== Development of aggressive legalism ==

Following [[World War II]] and the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], the [[United States]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] designed a new world economic order, partially emphasizing greater cooperative trade relationships. With the adoption of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1946 and via its replacement by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1995, these countries developed a comprehensive legal framework, that reflected their common legal traditions, to facilitate these relationships, including a system to settle disputes that favored litigation.&lt;ref name="Pekkanen2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pekkanen|first=Saadia M.|title=Aggressive Legalism: The Rules of the WTO and Japan's Emerging Trade Strategy|journal=World Economy|year=2001|pages=707–738}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Masaki|first=Hisane|title=China and the Legacy of the Plaza Accord|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/GI21Dj01.html|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=The Asian Times|date=21 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat under [[GATT]] in the 1950s but specifically with the adoption of the [[WTO]], these countries engaged increased trade with [[Asia]]n countries, as they became signatories.&lt;ref name="atimes" /&gt;   Initially, while the [[United States|U.S.]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] leveraged the agreement's respective legal frameworks and dispute-mechanisms including litigation to deal with disputes with their trading partners, many [[Asia]]n countries choose not to.&lt;ref name="atimes" /&gt; Instead, they avoided legal confrontation, in favor of bilateral negotiations to arrive at a settlement. Social-cultural disparities between each, concerning an inclination to litigate, are likely indicative of why.&lt;ref name="Pekkanen2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes" /&gt;

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, under both [[GATT]] and [[WTO]], many [[Asia]]n countries began to utilize their legal frameworks to settle disputes.&lt;ref name="atimes" /&gt;

In 2001, in ''Aggressive Legalism: The Rules of the WTO and Japan’s Emerging Trade Strategy'', Saadia M. Pekkanen described the increasing tendency of the [[Japan]]ese government’s use of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s (WTO) dispute settlement protocols to counter adverse acts by its trading partners as aggressive legalism. Aggressive legalism, she argued is “a conscious strategy where a substantive set of international legal rules can be made to serve as both ‘shield’ and ‘sword’ in trade disputes among sovereign states.”&lt;ref name="Pekkanen2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atimes" /&gt;

== Modern aggressive legalism ==

In a policy primer for the [[United States Government]], The Policymaker's Library wrote that the [[United States]]' influence with its [[Asia]]n trading partners has waned and that an "emphasis on aggressive legalism" affords opportunities to reshape economic relationships going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Policymaker's Library: Asia Policy|journal=The National Bureau of Asian Research|date=January 2009|issue=7|pages=159–89|url=http://nbr.org/publications/asia_policy/AP7/AP7_F_PolicyLibrary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The [[KORUS FTA|Korea–US Free Trade Agreement]] (KORUS), reflects a political strategy by both the [[United States]] and [[South Korea]] of aggressive legalism. That is, both countries agreed to envelope in the agreement binding legal rules to deal with lingering [[Bilateral trade|bilateral trade disputes]].&lt;ref name="Choi2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Dukgeun|title=Korea In The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System: Legal Battle For Economic Development|journal=Journal of International Economic Law|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===

Following the succession of [[GATT]] with the [[WTO]] in the 1980s and 1990s, many [[Asia]]n countries, including [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mercurcio|first=Bryan|author2=Mitali Tyagi|title=China's Evolving Role in WTO Dispute Settlement: Acceptance, Consolidation and Activation|journal=European Yearbook of International Economic Law|year=2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=89–123|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23309-8_3|isbn=978-3-642-23308-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Verghese|first=Aditi|title=The Evolution of China as a WTO Disputant|url=http://www.cuts-citee.org/pdf/Trade_law_Brief10-The_Evolution_of_China_as_a_WTO_Disputant.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=Trade Law Brief: University of Bhopal, India|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manjiao|first=Chi|title=China's participation in WTO dispute settlement over the past decade: experiences and impacts|journal=Journal of International Economic Law|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kobayashi|first=Jirokazu|title=The Future of Japan's Trade Policy Regarding Bilateral Trade Disputes - Thoughts on the Enactment of "The Damages Recovery Law Countering the U.S. Anti-dumping Act of 1916" |url=http://www.rieti.go.jp/en/columns/a01_0154.html|accessdate=2 November 2016|newspaper=Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Korea]],&lt;ref name="Choi2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gao2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; shifted to a policy of aggressive legalism, evidenced by each's willingness to use the legal frameworks provided under both to directly engage [[Bilateral trade|bilateral trading]] disputes with their partners.&lt;ref name="Choi2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gao2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Inoguchi|first=Takashi|title=Japan Desperately Needs a Grand Strategy|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2009/03/14/japan-desperately-needs-a-grand-strategy/|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=East Asia Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masaki|first=Hisane|title=Sunset for Japanese chip makers?|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HA27Dh02.html|work=Sunset for Japanese chip makers?|publisher=The Asian Times|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] that separates the two continents.

The term can be used in a more limited way to imply support for North Atlantic military alliances,&lt;ref name="osvaldo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Croci|first=Osvaldo|title=Not a Zero-Sum Game: Atlanticism and Europeanism in Italian Foreign Policy|journal=The International Spectator: Italian Journal of International Affairs|date=December 2008|volume=43|issue=4|pages=137–155|doi=10.1080/03932720802486498|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03932720802486498|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in a more expansive way implying broader cooperation, perceived deeply shared values, a merging of diplomatic cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Weisbrode, Kenneth.

In practice, the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American, particularly US, engagement in Europe and close cooperation between the two sides of the ocean.

Atlanticism manifested itself most strongly during the [[Second World War]] and in its aftermath through the establishment of various euro-Atlantic institutions, most importantly [[NATO]] and the [[Marshall Plan]].

Atlanticism varies in strength from region to region and country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors. Atlanticism is often considered to be particularly strong in eastern and central Europe, and the United Kingdom (linked to the [[Special Relationship]]). Politically, it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically, but certainly not exclusively, with [[classical liberal]]s, or the [[political right]] in Europe. Atlanticism often implies an affinity for American political or social culture as well as the historical bonds between the two continents.

There is some tension between Atlanticism and [[continentalism]] on both sides of the Atlantic, with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans-Atlantic cooperation.&lt;ref name="denmark"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mouritzen |first=Hans |title=Denmark's Super Atlanticism |date=16 May 2007 |url=https://busieco.samnet.sdu.dk/politics/nisa/papers/Mouritzen.doc |accessdate=24 June 2015 |publisher=Nordic International Studies Association }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship between Atlanticism and [[North American integration|North American]] or [[European integration]] is complex and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators.&lt;ref name="koran"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kořan|editor-first=Michal|title=Czech Foreign Policy in 2007-2009: Analysis|date=2010|isbn=978-8086506906|page=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0yQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationalism is the foreign policy belief combining both Atlanticism and continentalism.&lt;ref name="koran" /&gt; The relative decrease of European power in the world, the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the spread of Atlanticist [[peremptory norm|norms]] outside of the North Atlantic region, have decreased the strength of Atlanticist thought since the end of the [[Cold War]]. Other international relationships have been increasingly emphasised, although the trans-Atlantic relationship is still arguably the most important in the world.

== History ==
{{main article|Transatlantic relations}}[[File:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph|[[Ronald Reagan]] speaking in Berlin, 1987 ("[[Tear down this wall!]]") with [[Helmut Kohl]], [[Chancellor of Germany]]. Reagan was a committed Atlanticist]]Prior to the World Wars, western European countries were generally preoccupied with creating [[colonial empires]] in Africa and Asia and not relations with North America. Likewise, the United States was busy with interventions in Latin America, but had little interest in European affairs, and Canada had yet to exercise full foreign policy independence as a part of the British Empire.

The experience of having American and Canadian troops fighting with British, French, and other Europeans in Europe during the wars fundamentally changed this situation. Though the US (and to some extent Canada) adopted a more [[isolationist]] position between the wars, by the time of the [[Normandy landings]] the Allies were well integrated on all policies. The [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941 declared by US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill established the goals of the Allies for the post-war world, and was later adopted by all the Western allies. Following the Second World War, the Western European countries were anxious to convince the US to remain engaged in European affairs to deter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union. This led to the 1949 ''[[North Atlantic Treaty]]'' which established the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the main institutional consequence of Atlanticism, which binds all members to defend the others, and led to the long-term garrisoning of American and Canadian troops in Western Europe.

{{Multiple image |direction=vertical |image1=President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Camp David 1986.jpg|image2=Clinton Blair.jpg|caption1=U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (right) and British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986|caption2=U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] (left) greets British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1999}}
After the end of the [[cold war]], the relationship between the United States and Europe changed fundamentally, and made both sides less interested in the other. Without the threat of the Soviet Union dominating Europe, the continent became much less of a military priority for the US, and likewise, Europe no longer felt as much need for military protection from the US. As a result, the relationship became much less important strategically speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daalder |first=Ivo |title=The End of Atlanticism |journal=Survival |year=2003 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=147–166 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2003/6/summer%20europe%20daalder/20030601.pdf |accessdate=9 July 2013 |doi=10.1080/00396330312331343536 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023071908/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2003/6/summer%20europe%20daalder/20030601.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlanticism has undergone significant changes in the 21st century in light of [[terrorism]] and the [[Iraq War]], the net effect being a renewed questioning of the idea itself and a new insight that the security of the respective countries may require alliance action outside the North Atlantic territory. After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], NATO for the first time invoked [[North Atlantic Treaty|Article 5]],&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Council. [http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2001/p01-124e.htm "Statement by the North Atlantic Council,"] 2001-10-12.

Retrieved on 2007-10-13&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Iraq War caused fissures within NATO and the sharp difference of opinion between the US-led backers of the invasion and opponents strained the alliance. Some commentators, such as [[Robert Kagan]] questioned whether Europe and the United States had diverged to such a degree that their alliance was no longer relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kagan|first=Robert|title=[[Of Paradise and Power]]: America and Europe in the New World Order|year=2003|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Atlanticism is a belief in the necessity of cooperation between North America and Europe. The term can imply a belief that the bilateral relationship between Europe and the United States is important above all others, including intra-European cooperation, especially when it comes to security issues.&lt;ref name=dunne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Tim|title='When the shooting starts': Atlanticism in British security strategy|journal=International Affairs|year=2004|volume=80|issue=5|page=895|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2004.00424.x/abstract|accessdate=10 July 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2346.2004.00424.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can also be used "as a shorthand for the transatlantic security architecture."&lt;ref name=dunne /&gt;

[[Supranational]] integration of the North Atlantic area had emerged as a focus of thinking among intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic already in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straus|first=Ira|title=Atlanticism as the core 20th century U.S. strategy for internationalism|journal=Streit Council|date=June 2005|series=Annual Meeting of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations|url=http://streitcouncil.org/uploads/PDF/Straus-%20Atlanticism%20as%20the%20core%2020th%20century%20US%20Strategy%20for%20internationalism.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not known as Atlanticism at the time (the term was coined in 1950), they developed an approach coupling [[Soft power|soft]] and [[hard power]] which would to some extent integrate the two sides of the Atlantic. The idea of an attractive "nucleus" union was the greatest soft power element; the empirical fact of the hegemonic global strength such a union would hold was the hard power element. This approach was eventually implemented to a certain degree in the form of NATO, the [[G7]] grouping and other Atlanticist institutions. In the long debate between Atlanticism and its critics in the 20th century, the main argument was whether deep and formal Atlantic integration would serve to attract those still outside to seek to join, as Atlanticists argued, or alienate the rest of the world and drive them into opposite alliances.&lt;ref name="Straus" /&gt; [[Realism (international relations)|Realists]], [[neutralist]]s, and [[pacifists]], [[nationalists]] and [[globalist]]s tended to believe it would do the latter, citing the [[Warsaw Pact]] as the proof of their views and treating it as the inevitable [[realpolitik]] counterpart of NATO.&lt;ref name="Straus" /&gt;

Atlanticism is, broadly speaking, particularly strong in Britain&lt;ref name=dunne /&gt; (linked to the [[Special Relationship]]), and eastern and central Europe (i.e. the area between Germany and Russia).&lt;ref name=Asmus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asmus|first=Ronald|author2=Alexandr Vondra|title=The Origins of Atlanticism in Central and Eastern Europe|journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs |date=July 2005 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=203–216 |doi=10.1080/09557570500164439 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09557570500164439 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous reasons for its strength in Eastern Europe, primarily the role of the United States bringing political freedom there after the First World War, the role of the US in defeating Nazism, its leading role during the Cold War, its relative enthusiasm for bringing the countries of the region into Atlanticist institutions such as NATO, and a suspicion of the intentions of the major Western European powers.&lt;ref name=Asmus /&gt; Countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and the [[United Kingdom]] are among those who generally hold strong Atlanticist views, while [[Germany]] tends to promote continentalist views and a strong [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="denmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name=koran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8492549 "The new kids on the block,"] ''The Economist'', 2007-01-04. Retrieved 2007-10-14. Quote: "Romania, under its president, [[Traian Basescu]], is a bastion of Atlanticism in the [[Black Sea]] region."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century Atlanticism has tended to be slightly stronger on the political right in Europe (although many variations do exist from country to country), but the political center-left in the United States. The partisan division should not be overstated, but it exists and has grown since the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asmus|first=Ronald|author2=Phillip Everts|author3=Pierangelo Isernia|title=Across the Atlantic and Political Aisle: The Double Divide in U.S. - European Relations|journal=German Marshall Fund|year=2004|url=http://trends.gmfus.org/doc/transpaper.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703174057/http://trends.gmfus.org/doc/transpaper.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While trans-Atlantic trade and political ties have remained mostly strong throughout the Cold War and beyond, the larger trend has been [[continentalism|continentalist]] [[economic integration]] with the European Union (and its regional partners) and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] notably dividing the Atlantic region into two rival [[trade blocs]]. However, many political actors and commentators do not see the two processes as being necessarily opposed to one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Atlanticist delusion|newspaper=The Economist|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=9 July 2013|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21578060-unhelpfully-barack-obama-restrains-his-scorn-britains-threat-leave-european-union}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact some commentators believe regional integration can reinforce Atlanticism.&lt;ref name=osvaldo/&gt; Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, added by Canada, also attempted to bind the nations together on economic and political fronts.

'''Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar''' (14 April 1891&amp;nbsp;– 6 December 1956), popularly known as '''Babasaheb Ambedkar''', was an Indian [[jurist]], [[economist]], [[politician]] and [[Social Reformer|social reformer]] who inspired the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] and campaigned against social [[discrimination]] towards the [[Untouchability|untouchables]] (''[[Dalit]]s''), while also supporting the rights of women and [[Labour movement|labour]].&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|title=Rescuing Ambedkar from pure Dalitism: He would've been India's best Prime Minister|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106214027/http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|archivedate=6 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"&gt;Bryant, Edwin.

Ambedkar was a prolific student earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]] and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics, and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar's time as a scholar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/hindi/india/zee-jankari-important-facts-of-dr-bhimrao-ambedkar/288606|title=Zee जानकारी : किसने रची थी डॉ. अंबेडकर के बारे में भ्रम फैलाने की साजिश|date=2016-04-15|work=Zee News Hindi|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he converted to [[Buddhism]] initiating mass conversions of Dalits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

In 1990, the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.

==Early life==
[[File:Pictures of Dr Ambedkar's parents - Ramji Ambedkar and Bhimabai.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Ambedkar parents [[Ramji Maloji Sakpal]] (father) and Bhimabai Sakpal (mother)]]

Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of [[Mhow]] (now [[Dr. Ambedkar Nagar]]) in the [[Central Provinces]] (now in [[Madhya Pradesh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |title = Ambedkar and Untouchability: Fighting the Indian Caste System|year= 2005 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-231-13602-0 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 14th and last child of [[Ramji Maloji Sakpal]], an army officer who held the rank of [[Subedar]], and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| title = In the 1890s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907040421/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| archivedate= 7 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Ambedkar family|family]] was of [[Marathi people|Marathi]] background from the town of [[Ambadawe]] ([[Mandangad|Mandangad taluka]]) in [[Ratnagiri (district)|Ratnagiri district]] of modern-day [[Maharashtra]]. Ambedkar was born into a poor low [[Mahar]] ([[dalit]]) caste, who were treated as [[Untouchability|untouchables]] and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357931/Mahar |title=Mahar |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130060042/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357931/Mahar |archivedate=30 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the [[British East India Company]], and his father served in the [[British Indian Army]] at the Mhow cantonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahuja|first=M.

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".&lt;ref name = "Waiting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|others= Frances Pritchett, translator |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa|first= B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&amp;nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&amp;nbsp;– and two daughters&amp;nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&amp;nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school.

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, his marriage to a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]].&lt;ref name="Columbia2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| title = In the 1900s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106043617/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| archivedate = 6 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming the first untouchable to do so. In his book, ''The Buddha and his Dhamma'', that when he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.&lt;ref name="Columbia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/00_pref_unpub.html unpublished preface of "The Buddha and his Dhamma"], cite 5th para&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.&lt;ref name="Columbia3"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| title = In the 1910s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123170145/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| archivedate = 23 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, Ambedkar moved to the United States at the age of 22. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in Economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar teacher|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India&amp;nbsp;– A Historic and Analytical Study'', for another M.A., and finally he received his PhD in Economics in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|title=Bhimrao Ambedkar|work=columbia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his third thesis, after he left for London. On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.&lt;ref name="Columbia3" /&gt; He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"/&gt; In 1922, he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn and In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics. His third and fourth Doctorates (LL.D, Columbia, 1952 and D.Litt., Osmania, 1953) were conferred ''honoris causa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wx218EFVU8MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=ambedkar%20D'Litt#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20D'Litt|title=Dalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956|first=Rāmacandra|last=Kshīrasāgara|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

==Opposition to untouchability==
[[File:Ambedkar Barrister.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a barrister in 1922]]
As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, ''[[Waiting for a Visa]]''.&lt;ref name="Rewriting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Dr. B.R.|title=Waiting for a Visa|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|website=columbia.edu|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=15 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624202609/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|archivedate=24 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keer |first1=Dhananjay |title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission |year=1971 |origyear=1954 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Mumbai |isbn=978-8171542376 |oclc=123913369 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he became Professor of Political Economy in the [[Sydenham College|Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics]] in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Ian |editor-last= Harris |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rwiLKm3LGUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ambedkar+discriminated+at+Sydenham+College+of+Comme#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20discriminated%20at%20Sydenham%20College%20of%20Comme |title=Buddhism and politics in twentieth-century Asia |publisher=Continuum International Group |isbn= 9780826451781 |date= 2001-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate [[electoral district|electorates]] and [[reservation in India|reservations]] for untouchables and other religious communities.&lt;ref name=Tejani&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejani|first=Shabnum|title=Indian secularism : a social and intellectual history, 1890-1950|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0253220448|pages=205–210|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xtrPKa59j4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22ambedkar%22+%22+Southborough+Committee%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ambedkar%22%20%22%20Southborough%20Committee%22|accessdate=17 July 2013|chapter=From Untouchable to Hindu Gandhi, Ambedkar and Depressed class question 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly ''Mooknayak'' (''Leader of the Silent'') in Mumbai with the help of [[Shahu of Kolhapur]] i.e. Shahu IV (1874–1922).&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the Doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission|last=Keer|first=Dhananjay|date=1995|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788171542376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5u9hDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=7 Reformers who Change the World|last=Mookherji|first=Kalyani|date=101-01-01|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution [[Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha]], intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "[[Dalit|outcastes]]", at the time referred to as depressed classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |title=Dr. Ambedkar |accessdate=12 January 2012 |publisher=National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008195805/http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |archivedate=8 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the defence of Dalit rights, he started five periodicals - ''Mooknayak'' (the leader of the dumb, 1920), ''Bahishkrit Bharat'' (Ostracized India, 1924), ''Samta'' (Equality, 1928), ''Janata'' (The People, 1930), and ''Prabuddha Bharat'' (Enlightened India, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/07/ambedkars-journalism-and-its-significance-today/|title=Ambedkar’s journalism and its significance today|date=2017-07-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|title=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|website=velivada.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand17/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-42-45/9964-2012-06-14-09-33-10?showall=&amp;start=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prahaar.in/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC/|title=पत्रकार डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर {{!}}|website=prahaar.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahamtb.com/Encyc/2017/12/6/Article-on-journalist-babasaheb-Ambedkar-by-ravindra-gole.html|title=पत्रकार आंबेडकर|website=mahamtb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Kamble, Rajeev|date=2002-12-31|title=Dr Ambedkar as a journalist a study|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/104917|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beedlive.com/newsdetail?cat=Madhyam&amp;id=2046&amp;news=%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89.%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE.html|title=डॉ.बाबासाहेब आंबेडकरांची आदर्श पत्रकारिता|website=beedlive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahanews.gov.in/Home/FrontMantralayDetails.aspx?str=utYf/MWKOh8=|title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर एक बहुआयामी व्यक्तीमत्त्व - डॉ. गंगाधर पानतावणे|website=mahanews.gov.in|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led a ''[[Mahad Satyagraha|satyagraha]]'' in [[Mahad]] to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar |accessdate=26 December 2010 |publisher=Maharashtra Navanirman Sena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041016/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the [[Manusmriti]] (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at [[Kalaram Temple]] satygraha making one of the greatest processions of [[Nashik]]. The procession was headed by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men walked in discipline, order and determination to see the god for the first time.

[[Gandhi]] fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poona Pact – 1932|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|website=Britannica.com|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073354/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambekar vs Gandhi: A Part That Parted|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Outlook|date=20 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427033738/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum to showcase Poona Pact|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=25 September 2007|quote=Read 8th Paragraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017053453/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]] of [[Poona]]. Following the fast, Congress politicians and activists such as [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and [[Palwankar Baloo]] organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omvedt |first1=Gail |year=2012 |title=A Part That Parted |journal=Outlook India |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812003046/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929 |archivedate=12 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 1932, the agreement known as [[Poona Pact]] was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]] earlier proposed by British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The text uses the term "Depressed Classes" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.&lt;ref name="sharma2007"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Introduction to the Constitution of India|work=google.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222319/https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|isbn=9788120332461|last1=Sharma|last2=Sharma|first2=B.

In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the [[Government Law College, Bombay]], a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of [[Ramjas College]], University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecampusconnect.com/7-interesting-historical-facts-about-ramjas-college-university-of-delhi/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.&lt;ref name="Columbia5"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| title = In the 1930s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906055230/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| archivedate= 6 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Columbia5"/&gt; He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the [[Independent Labour Party (India)|Independent Labour Party]], which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

After the [[Lahore resolution]] (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that ''Thoughts on Pakistan'' "rocked Indian politics for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the [[Partition of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |number=2 |year=2014 |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |p=73–76 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402094202/http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dhulipala |first=Venkat |title=Creating a New Medina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z6TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2 |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-05212-3 |ref={{sfnref|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015}} |pp=124,&amp;nbsp;134,&amp;nbsp;142–144,&amp;nbsp;149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.&lt;ref name="Firstpost 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Attention BJP: When the Muslim League rescued Ambedkar from the 'dustbin of history' | website=Firstpost | date=15 April 2015 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | accessdate=5 September 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920032027/http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | archivedate=20 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao Ramji|title=Pakistan or the Partition of India|year=1946|publisher=Thackers Publishers|location=Bombay|chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation|chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|pages=215–219|accessdate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912185829/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition to Aryan invasion theory==
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"/&gt;

Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"/&gt;}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 851.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 854-5, 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting India's Constitution==

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first Law Minister, which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |work=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title = The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |first= Granville |last= Austin |year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Constituent Assembly Debates Clause wise Discussion on the Draft Constitution 15th November 1948 to 8th January 1949|url=http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|accessdate= 12 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143208/http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|archivedate= 24 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.&lt;ref name=Sheth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

===Opposition to Article 370===
Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India, which granted a special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.&lt;ref name=Jamanadas&gt;{{cite web |last=amanadas |first=Dr. K. |title=Kashmir Problem From Ambedkarite Perspective |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |publisher=ambedkar.org |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225153/http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had [[neuropathic pain]] in his legs, and was taking [[insulin]] and homoeopathic medicines. He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Dr. Sharada Kabir, a Chitpawan Brahmin, whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi. She was 39 year old and he was 57.

Ambedkar considered converting to [[Sikhism]], which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">[[File:Birch-bark letter 292 real.jpg|thumb|300px|Birch-bark letter No. 292]]
The '''[[Birch bark document|birch bark letter]]''' given the document number '''292''' is the oldest known document in any [[Finnic language]]. The document is dated to the beginning of the 13th century. It was found in 1957 by a Soviet expedition led by [[Artemiy Artsikhovsky]] in the Nerevsky excavation on the left coast side of [[Novgorod]].&lt;ref&gt;А.В. Арциховский, В.И. Борковский. Новгородские грамоты на бересте (из раскопок 1956–1957 гг.). М.: Из-во Акад. Наук СССР, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in Novgorod City Museum. 

The language used in the document is thought to be an archaic form of [[Livvi-Karelian language|Livvi-Karelian]], the language spoken in [[Olonets Karelia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://victorian.fortunecity.com/christy/32/tuohi.html Itämerensuomalaista kirjoitusta 1200-luvulta] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525202814/victorian.fortunecity.com/christy/32/tuohi.html |date=2012-05-25 }} {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the exact form is difficult to determine, as Finnic dialects were only developing during that period.

==Transcription==
[[File:Birch-bark letter 292.gif]]

The text is written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] in the [[Karelian language|Karelian]] dialect of the archaic [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] language. A transcription of the text is as follows:

:юмолануолиїнимижи
:ноулисѣханолиомобоу
:юмоласоудьнииохови

==Interpretations==
===By Yuri Yeliseyev===
The text, as [[Transliteration|transliterated]] to the [[Latin alphabet]] by [[Yuri Sergeevich Yeliseyev|Yuri Yeliseyev]] in 1959&lt;ref&gt;Елисеев Ю. С. Древнейший письменный памятник одного из прибалтийско-финских языков.— Изв. АН СССР. Отд-ние лит. и языка, 1959, т. 18, Вып. 1, с. 65—72.&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted in modern [[Finnish language|Finnish]]:
{{quote|
jumolanuoli ï nimizi &lt;br/&gt;
nouli se han oli omo bou&lt;br/&gt;
jumola soud'ni iohovi
}}
{{quote|
Jumalannuoli, kymmenen [on] nimesi &lt;br/&gt;
Tämä nuoli on Jumalan oma &lt;br/&gt;
Tuomion-Jumala johtaa.
}}

In English, this means roughly the following:
{{quote|
God's arrow, ten [is] your name &lt;br/&gt;
This arrow is God's own &lt;br/&gt;
The [[Ukko|Doom-God]] leads.
}}

Yeliseyev believes, that this is an [[invocation]] against [[lightning]], as evidenced by "ten your names" construction. According to [[superstitious]] notions, knowledge of the name gives a human the magic power over an object or phenomenon.&lt;ref name="KSJ"&gt;[http://www.kirjazh.spb.ru/biblio/pizv_bg/pizv_g0.htm Written information on Karelians] by S. I. Kochkurkina, A. M. Spiridonov, T. N. Jackson, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===By Martti Haavio===
As the [[orthography]] used does not utilize [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] between words, the source text can be transcribed into words in different ways. [[Martti Haavio]] gives a different [[interpreting|interpretation]] of the text in his 1964 article, suggesting, that this is a sort of an [[oath]]:

{{quote|
jumolan nuoli inimizi &lt;br/&gt;
nouli sekä n[u]oli omo bou &lt;br/&gt;
jumola soud'nii okovy
}}
{{quote|
Jumalan nuoli, ihmisen &lt;br/&gt;
nuoli sekä nuoli oma. [ &lt;br/&gt;
Tuomion jumalan kahlittavaksi.] 
}}

In English, this means roughly the following:
{{quote|
God's arrow, man's &lt;br/&gt;
arrow, and (his) own arrow. [ &lt;br/&gt;
To be chained by the Doom-God.]
}}

===By Yevgeny Khelimsky===
Professor [[Eugene Helimski|Yevgeny Khelimsky]] in his 1986 work&lt;ref&gt;Хелимский Е. А. О прибалтийско-финском языковом материале в новгородских берестяных грамотах. In the book Янин В. Л., Зализняк А. А. Новгородские грамоты на бересте (из раскопок 1977—1983 гг.): Комментарии и словоуказатель к берестяным грамотам (из раскопок 1951—1983 гг.) / АН СССР. Отд-ние истории. — М.: Наука, 1986. — С. 254—255.)&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes Haavio's interpretation and gives the third known scientific interpretation, believing the letter to be an invocation, like Yeliseyev:&lt;ref name="KSJ"/&gt;

{{quote|
Jumalan nuoli 10 nimezi &lt;br/&gt;
Nuoli säihä nuoli ambu &lt;br/&gt;
Jumala suduni ohjavi (johavi?)
}}

A translation into Finnish of this interpretation would look something like this:

{{quote|
Jumalan nuoli 10 nimesi &lt;br/&gt;
Nuoli säihkyvä nuoli ampuu &lt;br/&gt;
Suuto-Jumala (Syyttö-Jumala)† ohjaa (johtaa?)
}}

In English, it means roughly the following:
{{quote|
God's arrow, ten your name(s) &lt;br/&gt;
Arrow sparkling, arrow shoots &lt;br/&gt;
The Doom-God guides/directs (leads/rules?).
}}

†''Syyttö-Jumala'' could also mean "Blaming God" or "God that blames"; modern Finnish ''syyttää'' = to blame or prosecute.

'''Charles Earl Boles''' (b. 1829; d. after February 28, 1888), also known as '''Black Bart''', was an [[English people|English]]-born [[outlaw]] noted for the [[poet]]ic messages he left behind after two of his robberies. Often called Charley by his friends, he was also known as '''Charles Bolton''', '''C.E. Bolton''' and '''Black Bart the Poet'''.&lt;ref name="Hoeper1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoeper|first=George|title=Black Bart: Boulevardier Bandit: The Saga of California's Most Mysterious Stagecoach Robber and the Men Who Sought to Capture Him|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3WgTe2HBtsC|accessdate=July 25, 2011|date=June 1, 1995|publisher=Quill Driver Books|isbn=978-1-884995-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a [[gentleman bandit]] with a reputation for style and sophistication,&lt;ref name="Hoeper1995" /&gt; he was one of the most notorious [[stagecoach]] [[robbery|robbers]] to operate in and around [[Northern California]] and southern [[Oregon]] during the 1870s and 1880s.

==Early life==
Charles Boles was born in [[Norfolk, England]] to John and Maria Boles (sometimes spelled Bolles). He was the third of ten children, having six brothers and three sisters.{{sfn|Nolan|2003|p=133}} When he was two years old, his parents immigrated to [[Jefferson County, New York]], where his father purchased a farm four miles north of Plessis Village in the direction of [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]].

===California Gold Rush===
In late 1849, Boles and his brothers David and James joined in the [[California Gold Rush]], prospecting in the [[North Fork American River|North Fork of the American River]] near [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. They traveled home in 1852, but Boles later returned with his brothers David and Robert. Both brothers fell ill shortly after their arrival and died. Charles Boles remained in California for another two more years before giving up again.

In 1854, Boles (who now used this spelling) married Mary Elizabeth Johnson. By 1860, they were living with their four children in [[Decatur, Illinois]].

===Civil War===
On August 13, 1862, Boles enlisted as a private in Company B, [[116th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|116th Illinois Regiment]] (his name is spelled "Boles" in the company records). He was a good soldier and became a [[First sergeant]] within a year. Boles was seriously wounded at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], and took part in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. He received [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] commissions as both second lieutenant and first lieutenant, and on June 7, 1865, was discharged with his regiment in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He returned home at last to his family in Illinois.

===Prospecting again===
In 1867, Boles went prospecting for gold in [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]. In a surviving letter to his wife from August 1871, he told her of an unpleasant encounter with some [[Wells Fargo|Wells, Fargo &amp; Company]] agents and vowed to exact revenge. His wife never heard from him again, and in time she presumed he had died.

==Criminal career==
Boles adopted the nickname "Black Bart" and proceeded to rob Wells Fargo stagecoaches at least 28 times across northern California between 1875 and 1883,{{sfn|Nolan|2003|p=130}} including a number of times along the historic [[Siskiyou Trail]] between California and Oregon. He only left two poems&amp;nbsp;– at the fourth and fifth robbery sites&amp;nbsp;– but this came to be considered his signature and ensured his fame. Black Bart was quite successful, often taking in thousands of [[United States dollar|dollars]] a year.

Ironically, Boles was afraid of horses and made all of his robberies on foot. Together with his poems, this earned him notoriety. He supposedly never once fired a weapon during his years as an outlaw.{{sfn|Nolan|2003|p=131}}

Boles was invariably polite and used no foul language, despite its appearance in his poems. He dressed in a long linen [[duster coat]] and a [[bowler hat]], using a flour sack with holes cut for his eyes as a mask. He brandished a shotgun, but never used it. These features became his trademarks.

===First robbery===
On July 26, 1875, Boles robbed his first stagecoach in [[Calaveras County, California]], on the road between [[Copperopolis, California|Copperopolis]] and [[Milton, California|Milton]]. He spoke with a deep and resonant tone as he politely ordered stage driver John Shine to "throw down the box". As Shine handed over the strongbox, Boles shouted, "If he dares to shoot, give him a solid volley, boys". Seeing rifle barrels pointed at him from the nearby bushes, Shine quickly handed over the strongbox. Shine waited until Boles vanished and then went to recover the empty strongbox, but upon examining the area, he discovered that the "men with rifles" were actually carefully rigged sticks. Black Bart's first robbery netted him $160.{{sfn|Nolan|2003|p=130}}

===Last stagecoach robbery===
His last holdup took place on November 3, 1883, at the site of his first robbery on Funk Hill, southeast of the present town of [[Copperopolis, California|Copperopolis]]. Driven by Reason McConnell, the stage had crossed the Reynolds Ferry on the old road from [[Sonora, California|Sonora]] to Milton. The driver stopped at the ferry to pick up Jimmy Rolleri, the 19-year-old son of the ferry owner. Rolleri had his rifle with him and got off at the bottom of the hill to hunt along the creek and meet the stage on the other side. When he arrived at the western end, he found that the stage was not there and began walking up the stage road. Near the summit, he saw the stage driver and his team of horses.

McConnell told him that as the stage had approached the summit, Boles had stepped out from behind a rock with a shotgun in his hands. He forced McConnell to unhitch the team and take them over the crest of the hill. Boles then tried to remove the strongbox from the stage, but it had been bolted to the floor and took Boles some time to remove. Rolleri and McConnell went over the crest and saw Boles backing out of the stage with the strong box. McConnell grabbed Rolleri's rifle and fired at Boles twice but missed. Rolleri took the rifle and fired as Boles entered a thicket. He stumbled as if he had been hit. Running to the thicket, they found a small, blood-stained bundle of mail he had dropped.

Boles had been wounded in the hand. After running a quarter of a mile, he stopped and wrapped a handkerchief around his hand to control the bleeding. He found a rotten log and stuffed the sack with the gold amalgam into it, keeping $500 in gold coins. He hid the shotgun in a hollow tree, threw everything else away, and fled. In a manuscript written by stage driver McConnell about 20 years after the robbery, he claimed he fired all four shots at Boles. The first missed, but he thought the second or third shot hit Boles, and was sure the fourth did. Boles only had the one wound to his hand.

====Investigation and arrest====
When Boles was wounded and forced to flee, he left behind several personal items. These included his eyeglasses, some food, and a [[handkerchief]] with a laundry mark F.X.O.7. Wells Fargo Detective [[James B. Hume]] found these at the scene. Hume and detective [[Harry N. Morse]] contacted every laundry in San Francisco about the laundry mark. After visiting nearly 90 laundries, they finally traced it to Ferguson &amp; Bigg's California Laundry on Bush Street and were able to learn that the handkerchief belonged to a man who lived in a modest [[boarding house]].

The detectives learned that Boles called himself a mining engineer and made frequent "business trips" that coincided with the Wells Fargo robberies. After initially denying he was Black Bart, Boles eventually admitted he had robbed several Wells Fargo stages, though he confessed only to crimes committed before 1879. Boles apparently believed the [[statute of limitations]] had expired on those robberies. When booked, he gave his name as T.&amp;nbsp;Z. Spalding, but police found a [[Bible]], a gift from his wife, inscribed with his real name.

The police report said that Boles was "a person of great endurance. Exhibited genuine wit under most trying circumstances, and was extremely proper and polite in behavior. Eschews profanity."

====Conviction and imprisonment====
Wells Fargo only pressed charges on the final robbery. Boles was convicted and sentenced to six years in [[San Quentin]] Prison, but he was released after four years for good behavior, in January 1888. His health had clearly deteriorated due to his time in prison; he had visibly aged, his eyesight was failing, and he had gone deaf in one ear. Reporters swarmed around him when he was released and asked if he was going to rob any more stagecoaches. "No, gentlemen," he replied, smiling, "I'm through with crime."

==Final days==
Boles never returned to his wife after his release from prison, though he did write to her. In one of the letters he said he was tired of being shadowed by Wells Fargo, felt demoralized, and wanted to get away from everybody. In February 1888, Boles left the Nevada House and vanished. Hume said Wells Fargo tracked him to the Visalia House hotel in [[Visalia, California|Visalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.visalialifestyle.com/visalia-house-a-bygone-relic-of-a-frontier-town/ |title=Visalia House - A Bygone Relic of A Frontier Town |last=Ommen |first=Terry |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=25 June 2018 |work=Lifestyle Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel owner said a man answering the description of Boles had checked in and then disappeared. Black Bart was last seen on February 28, 1888.

===Copycat robber===
On November 14, 1888, another Wells Fargo stage was robbed by a masked highwayman. The lone bandit left a verse that read:{{citation needed | date=October 2012}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
So here I've stood while wind and rain
Have set the trees a-sobbin,
And risked my life for that box,
That wasn't worth the robbin.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Detective Hume was called to examine the note. After comparing it with the handwriting of genuine Black Bart poetry, he declared the new holdup was the work of a [[copycat crime|copycat]] criminal.

===Rumors and theories===
There are rumors that Wells Fargo had paid off the aging bandit and sent him away to keep him from robbing their stages, though Wells Fargo denied this.

Some believe that Boles moved to [[New York City]] and lived quietly for the rest of his life, dying there in 1917, though this was never confirmed. Others believe the unlikely tale that the former poet bandit with failing eyesight had gone to the wilds of [[Montana]] or perhaps [[Nevada]] for another try at making a fortune.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Johnny Thacker, a Wells Fargo detective who had participated in Boles's arrest, said in 1897 that he knew Boles to have gone to live in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Hungerford |author-link=Edward Hungerford (author) |title=Wells Fargo: Advancing the American Frontier |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1949 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3984hT-yb9oC |oclc=504848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verses==
Boles, like many of his contemporaries, read [[dime novel]]–style serial adventure stories which appeared in local newspapers. In the early 1870s, the ''[[Sacramento Union]]'' ran a story called ''The Case of Summerfield'' by Caxton (a pseudonym of [[William Henry Rhodes]]). In the story, the villain dressed in black and had long unruly black hair, a large black beard, and wild grey eyes. The villain, named Black Bart, robbed [[Wells Fargo]] stagecoaches and brought great fear to those who were unlucky enough to cross him. Boles may have read the ''Sacramento Union'' story. He told a Wells Fargo detective that the name popped into his head when he was writing the first poem, and he used it.

Boles left only two authenticated verses. The first was at the scene of the August 3, 1877, holdup of a stage traveling from [[Point Arena, California|Point Arena]] to [[Duncans Mills, California]]:

{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;
I've labored long and hard for bread,
For honor, and for riches,
But on my corns too long you've tread,
You fine-haired sons of bitches.&lt;/poem&gt;
|sign=Black Bart, 1877{{sfn|Nolan|2003|p=130}}}}

The second verse was left at the site of his July 25, 1878, holdup of a stage traveling from [[Quincy, California|Quincy]] to [[Oroville, California]]:

{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;
Here I lay me down to sleep
To wait the coming morrow,
Perhaps success, perhaps defeat,
And everlasting sorrow.
Let come what will, I'll try it on,
My condition can't be worse;
And if there's money in that box
'Tis munny in my purse.&lt;/poem&gt;
|sign=Black Bart{{sfn|Nolan|2003|p=131}}}}

==List of crimes==

===1870s===
* July 26, 1875: The stage from [[Sonora, California|Sonora]], [[Tuolumne County]] to [[Milton, California|Milton]], [[Calaveras County]] was robbed by a man wearing a flour sack over his head with two holes cut out for the eyes.
* December 28, 1875: The stage from [[North San Juan, California|North San Juan]], [[Nevada County, California|Nevada County]] to [[Marysville, California|Marysville]], [[Yuba County, California|Yuba County]]. A newspaper related that it was held up by four men. This too had a description of the lone robber and his "trademarks". The "three other men" were in the hills around the stage; the driver saw their "rifles". When the investigators arrived at the scene they found the "rifles" used in the heist were nothing more than sticks wedged in the brush.
* August 3, 1877: The stage from Point Arena, [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino County]] to Duncans Mills, [[Sonoma County]].
* July 25, 1878: A stage traveling from Quincy, [[Plumas County, California|Plumas County]] to Oroville, [[Butte County, California|Butte County]].
* October 2, 1878: In Mendocino County, near [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]], Bart was seen picnicking along the roadside before the robbery.
* October 3, 1878: In Mendocino County, the stage from [[Covelo, California|Covelo]] to Ukiah was robbed. Bart walked to the McCreary farm and paid for dinner. Fourteen-year-old Donna McCreary provided the first detailed description of Bart: "Graying brown hair, missing two of his front teeth, deep-set piercing blue eyes under heavy eyebrows. Slender hands and intellectual in conversation, well-flavored with polite jokes."
* June 21, 1879: The stage from [[La Porte, California|La Porte]], Plumas County to Oroville, Butte County. Bart said to the driver, "Sure hope you have a lot of gold in that strongbox, I'm nearly out of money." In fact, the stage held no Wells Fargo gold or cash.
* October 25, 1879: An interstate route was robbed when Bart held up the stage from [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Douglas County, Oregon|Douglas County]], Oregon, to [[Redding, California|Redding]], [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]], California, stealing U.S. mail pouches on a Saturday night.
* October 27, 1879: Another California robbery, the stage from [[Alturas, California|Alturas]], [[Modoc County]], to Redding, Shasta County. Jim Hume was sure that Bart was the one-eyed ex-Ohioan, Frank Fox.

===1880s===
*  July 22, 1880: In [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], the stage from [[Point Arena, California|Point Arena]] to [[Duncan's Mills, California|Duncans Mills]] (same location as on August 3, 1877; Wells Fargo added it to the list when he was captured).
*  September 1, 1880: In Shasta County, the stage from [[Weaverville, California|Weaverville]] to Redding. Near French Gulch, Bart said, "Hurry up the hounds; it gets lonesome in the mountains."
*  September 16, 1880: In [[Jackson County, Oregon]], the stage from Roseburg to [[Yreka, California]]. This is the farthest north Bart is known to have robbed.
*  September 23, 1880: In Jackson County, Oregon, the stage from Yreka to Roseburg (President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and General [[William T. Sherman]] traveled on this stage three days later). On October 1, a person (Frank Fox?) who closely matched the description of Bart was arrested at Elk Creek Station and later released.
*  November 20, 1880: In [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou County]], the stage from Redding to Roseburg. This robbery failed because of the noise of an approaching stage or because of a hatchet in the driver's hand.
*  August 31, 1881: In Siskiyou County, the stage from Roseburg to Yreka. Mail sacks were cut in a "T" shape, another Bart trademark.
*  October 8, 1881: In Shasta County, the stage from Yreka to Redding. Stage driver Horace Williams asked Bart, "How much did you make?" Bart answered, "Not very much for the chances I take."
*  October 11, 1881: In Shasta County, the stage from [[Lakeview, California|Lakeview]] to Redding. Hume kept losing Bart's trail.
*  December 15, 1881: In Yuba County, near Marysville. Bart took mail bags and evaded capture due to his swiftness afoot.
*  December 27, 1881: In Nevada County, the stage from North San Juan to [[Smartsville, California|Smartsville]]. Nothing much was taken, but Bart was wrongly blamed for another stage robbery in Smartsville.
*  January 26, 1882: In Mendocino County, the stage from Ukiah to [[Cloverdale, California|Cloverdale]]. Again the posse was on his tracks within the hour and again they lost him after [[Kelseyville, California|Kelseyville]].
*  June 14, 1882:  In Mendocino County, the stage from [[Little Lake, Willits, California|Little Lake]] to Ukiah. Hiram Willits, Postmaster of Willitsville (present-day [[Willits, California]]), was on the stage.
*  July 13, 1882: In [[Plumas County, California|Plumas County]], the stage from La Porte to Oroville. This stage was loaded with gold and George Hackett was armed. Bart lost his derby as he fled the scene when it was determined that the Wells Fargo agent in LaPorte had supplied hardware to bolt down the strongbox. His derby was traced to him eventually through the laundry mark. The same stage was again held-up in Forbestown and Hackett blasted the would-be robber into the bushes. This was mistakenly blamed on Bart.
*  September 17, 1882: In Shasta County, the stage from Yreka to Redding; a repeat of October 8, 1881 (same stage, place and driver), but Bart got only a few dollars.
*  November 24, 1882: In Sonoma County, the stage from [[Lakeport, California|Lakeport]] to Cloverdale; "The longest 30 miles in the World."
*  April 12, 1883: In Sonoma County, the stage from Lakeport to Cloverdale; another repeat of the last robbery.
*  June 23, 1883: In [[Amador County, California|Amador County]], the stage from [[Jackson, California|Jackson]] to [[Ione, California|Ione]].
*  November 3, 1883: In Calaveras County, the stage from Sonora to Milton.

==Legacy==
===In geography===
In some areas where Black Bart operated, notably [[Redwood Valley, California]], there is a traditional annual Black Bart Parade featuring a man dressed as Black Bart playing him as a stereotypical Old West villain. Also in [[Redwood Valley, California]], the road leading from [[California State Route 20]] to Hell's Delight Canyon is called Black Bart Trail. There is a large rock at the side of [[U.S. Route 101|Highway 101]] on the Ridgewood Summit between Redwood Valley and [[Willits, California|Willits]] known by locals as "Black Bart Rock", though it is not the actual rock behind which Black Bart was reputed to have hidden while robbing stagecoaches (that rock having been lost in a series of highway improvements over the years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mendocinoartcenter.org/MendoArts/Spring08/S08MA_45-62.pdf |title=Black Bart in Mendocino County |last=Levene |first=Bruce |pages=46–47 |work=[[Mendocino Art Center]] |access-date=25 June 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Duncans Mills, California]], there is a plaque commemorating Black Bart and featuring his first poem. In Oroville, there is a road named Black Bart Road, as well as a stone mortar monument with a description of a robbery that took place at the scene.

===In literature===
Black Bart is a villain in ''The Stagecoach'', an album in the ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' Belgian comic book series by [[René Goscinny]] and [[Morris (comics)|Morris]]. While the hero manages to shoot and disable Bart's shotgun, he is unable to catch him. The depiction of the outlaw is extremely accurate and includes a transcription of his poems. It also mentions that Black Bart was identified and caught on the basis of a laundry mark.

Black Bart's life and exploits and his pursuit and capture by Hume and Morse are the subject of the 2017 novel ''The Ballad of Black Bart'' by [[Loren D. Estleman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Loren D. |last=Estleman |author-link=Loren D. Estleman |title=The Ballad of Black Bart: A Novel |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=d-U2DwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Tom Doherty Associates]] |pages=240 |isbn=9780765383532}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was named Best Fiction in its "True West Best of the West 2018 Western Books" by [[True West Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://truewestmagazine.com/true-west-best-of-the-west-2018-western-books/ |title=True West Best of the West 2018 Western Books |last=Rosebrook |first=Stuart |date=11 December 2017 |access-date=23 July 2018 |magazine=[[True West Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In film and television===
[[Dan Duryea]] starred as Black Bart in a 1948 film produced by [[Universal Studios]], ''[[Black Bart (film)|Black Bart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Dale L. |author-link=Dale L. Walker |title=Legends and Lies: Great Mysteries of the American West |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3smKgNaGiNsC&amp;pg=PT216 |publisher=[[Tom Doherty Associates]] |date=15 November 1998 |page=216 |isbn=9781466812925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Arthur Space]] played Black Bart in the eponymous episode of [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]'s syndicated western television series, ''[[Stories of the Century]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lentz |first=Harris M. |title=Television Westerns Episode Guide: All United States Series, 1949-1996 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=O85kAAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |date=1 January 1997 |page=385 |isbn=9780786403776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Beddoe]] played Black Bart in the 1954 episode "Black Bart The PO8" of the western [[anthology series]] ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. In the story line, Black Bart is a debonair poetry-writing former school teacher who turns to [[stagecoach]] robbery after his first holdup, a prank, pays handsomely. [[Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.]] detectives track him down through a laundry mark. He was also pursued with a romantic interest by his landlady, Winona Webb (Helen Brown). He spent six years in the penitentiary, never to be heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556563/|title=Black Bart The PO8 on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
He inspired on Blue Lotus album ''Across The Canyon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/grateful-web-interview-blue-lotus |title=Grateful Web Interview with Blue Lotus |first=Vinh |last=Nguyen |date=14 September 2015 |access-date=23 July 2018 |work=Grateful Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Black Bart" by Danish rock band Volbeat is based on his robberies and features lines taken directly from his poems.

'''''Fractured Flickers''''' is a  live-action [[television syndication|syndicated]] half-hour [[television]] [[comedy]] show that was produced by [[Jay Ward]], who is otherwise known for [[animated cartoons]]. The pilot film was produced in 1961 (hence the 1961 copyright notice on the animated main title), but the series was not completed until 1963. Twenty-six episodes were produced; they were syndicated by [[Desilu Productions]] and played for several years on local stations.

==Content==
Host [[Hans Conried]] introduced short "flickers" pieced together from [[silent film]] footage and from other older movies, [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] with newly written comic dialogue, music, and sound effects. The voices for these were provided by fellow Ward mainstays [[Paul Frees]], [[June Foray]], and [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]. The earliest episodes have careful [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], with the actors and writers taking pains to synchronize the new dialogue with the actors' lip movements. Once the series had deadlines to face, however, the time-consuming dubbing was abandoned, and the later episodes do not bother with exact synchronization.

True to the Jay Ward brand of humor, the dialogue was loaded with [[pun]]s and [[one-line joke]]s. (One silent vignette was retitled "[[Barbara Stanwyck|The Barber of Stanwyck]]", utilizing scenes from [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' 1920 silent classic, ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]''.) Movies, television, advertising, and even the ''Fractured Flickers'' series itself were fair game for merciless kidding. (Conried quipped, "This is what we'll be doing for the next several weeks--or until someone finds out!") The show was at its funniest when desecrating early [[melodramas]] with "hip" reinterpretations, such as presenting [[Rudolph Valentino]] as an insurance salesman or [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' as "Dinky Dunstan, Boy Cheerleader." ([[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] was not amused by the latter and attempted unsuccessfully to sue Jay Ward over it.)  Many segments were vicious satires of television commercials; a typical "word from our sponsor" would have the announcer extolling the virtues of the item being advertised, accompanied by darkly humorous clips. A fly-by-night real estate development, for example, was illustrated with clips of buildings being destroyed by a cyclone (from ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' with [[Buster Keaton]]). And "This moment of softness (explosions, wild parties, etc.) has been brought to you by Bee. Bee, the only tissue [[weaving|woven]] in mid-air by [[bees]]!" Regular features were the "Minute Mysteries", featuring [[Stan Laurel]] as master detective Sherman Oaks (his scenes "fractured" from his 1925 short comedy, ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]''), and the weekly "tributes" to some American city.

Each episode also featured a celebrity guest whom Conried would interview. Most were popular personalities of the 1960s such as [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]], [[Bob Denver]], [[Deborah Walley]], [[Rod Serling]], and [[Rose Marie]]. Many of them caught the spirit of the show, and answered Conried's questions with [[tongue in cheek]].

Many prominent figures of the 1960s were lampooned. A segment based on the [[Kennedy family]] (and produced long before air time) was excised from all copies of the series when [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated so that it was never shown. This segment remains lost to this day.

The entire series is available on a DVD set from VCI Entertainment.[http://www.vcientertainment.com/Film-Categories/TV-Series?product_id=350]

The competition, as created, had two rules: mention Harry's Bar &amp; Grill (the Venetian Harry's was long one of Hemingway's favorite watering holes) and be funny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2camels.com/international-imitation-hemingway-competition.php International Imitation Hemingway Competition] Nelson Taylor, ''American Bizarro'', St. Martin's Griffin, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-312-26286-0}}.

In addition to the humor of the contest, there is irony in its existence, as Hemingway famously said: "The step ''up'' from writing parodies is writing on the wall above the urinal." Nevertheless, the contest had thousands of dedicated enthusiasts among writers and Hemingway fans, drawing more than 24,000 entries in its first ten years of operation.&lt;ref name="Tellem"/&gt; Many notable literary figures judged the contest over the years, including Digby Diehl, [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Barnaby Conrad]], [[George Plimpton]], Bernice Kert,&lt;ref name="SmithLA"/&gt; [[Jack Hemingway]], A.

In the late 1970s, seeking to promote Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill in [[Century City]], California, bar owners Jerry Magnin and Larry Mindel consulted advertising executive Paul Keye, who suggested the contest to capitalize on Hemingway's literary references to "Harry's".&lt;ref&gt;"The Contessa is not at home, my Colonel," he said.  "They believe you might find her at Harry's." "You find everything on earth at Harry's." - Ernest Hemingway, ''Across the River and Into the Trees'' (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The contest announcement in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine stated, "One very good page of very bad Hemingway will send you and a friend to Italy for dinner."&lt;ref name="LAT2002"&gt;Avins, Mimi (September 5, 2002).

Hemingway's spare writing style had often been imitated prior to the contest. Since then, two anthologies of Imitation Hemingway have been published (The Best of Bad Hemingway, Volumes I &amp; II) and include contest winners as well as satires of Hemingway written by [[E. B. White]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[George Plimpton]].&lt;ref&gt;The Best of Bad Hemingway Volume 1: Choice Entries. Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill.

'''Kathleen A. Deagan''' is an American archaeologist who primarily focuses on excavations in Florida and the Caribbean. Known for her [[History|historic]] [[archaeology]] which uncovered the colonial past of ''[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]'', and work in St. Augustine, she has received multiple awards and honors, including the Award of Merit in 1992 and the [[J. C. Harrington Award]] in 2004, both bestowed by the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]].

==Early life==
Kathleen Anne Deagan was born in the [[baby boomers|middle of the 20th century]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], while her father, a [[meteorologist]] with the [[U. S. Navy]] was stationed at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]].{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=463}}{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=5}} The oldest child in a Catholic family of four children, she attended more than twenty schools before graduating from high school, as her father, a specialist in tropical storms, was assigned to hurricane prone places like England, Guam, the Philippines, and Taiwan, as well as in the United States, Florida, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Most of the schools were Catholic institutions like the [[Academy of Our Lady of Guam]], one of four high schools Deagan attended.{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=463}}

Deagan enrolled at the [[University of Florida]] in 1965 to study education,{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|p=2}} then journalism, social work and counseling,{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=464}} appropriate career choices for women at the time, but was drawn to anthropology courses.{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|p=2}} Studying under [[Charles H. Fairbanks]], she switched her major and graduated in 1970.{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=464}} 
Enrolling in graduate school at the [[University of California, Davis]] to study [[museology]], Deagan quickly left and spent some time in San Francisco.{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|pp=2-3}} In 1971, she returned to the University of Florida and completed a PhD in archaeology under Fairbanks in 1974.{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=464}}{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|p=3}}

==Career==
That same year Deagan was hired as an assistant professor at [[Florida State University]]{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=464}} and expanded work begun during her dissertation in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] on the 18th-century history of the city. In 1979, her research shifted to the 16th-century population, making comparisons between the two eras and analyzing the town's development. Her study confirmed the rapid decline of the indigenous native population, the [[Timucua]], after contact and the replacement of them with other indigenous peoples.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}} It also highlighted a difference in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] from [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] in that Deagan discovered Spanish households incorporated indigenous foods and goods, whereas British households followed British custom. Her later work in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] confirmed the pattern to be consistent in Spanish colonies.{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|pp=11-12}}

In 1981, when Fairbanks retired from the University of Florida, Deagan was recruited to fill his post{{sfn|Ewen|2017|pp=464-465}} at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History|Florida State Museum]] and take over the direction of the ongoing project at the Puerto Real settlement near present-day [[Cap-Haïtien]], Haiti. The colony, established on [[Hispaniola]] by [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]], thrived from 1503 to 1578. Running the annual field schools at the site, in 1983, Deagan expanded their search to include the nearby site where the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', one of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s ships ran aground in 1492.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}} Based on a review of evidence at the site, known as both ''La Navidad'' and ''En Bas Saline'', Deagan concluded that the shipwreck was not due to a weather related cause, but negligence on behalf of the crew.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}}{{sfn|''El País''|1985}} While working on the site in Haiti, she met Lawrence Dean Harris (1942-2010), a wildlife conservationist who was in Haiti to consult on a project to create a national park in the country.{{sfn|McCrea|2004}}{{sfn|Hatcher Cremations|2010}} Soon after, Harris, a father of four, and Deagan married.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}}

Simultaneously working sites in Florida and the Caribbean, in 1986, Deagan began fieldwork at [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Ft. Mosé]], a legally sanctioned, buffer zone community of free blacks established as a strategic defensive barrier to northern British colonies.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}}{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|p=19}} Working in conjunction with [[Jane Landers]], who specializes in African American history, worked for six months to evaluate documents from Spanish archives on the site prior to excavations.{{sfn|Orser Jr.|2016|p=150}} While many histories up to that point had included interaction with Spaniards and Native American peoples, few had included interaction with Africans and their findings sparked additional scholarship, as well as a movement to preserve the site as a [[National Historic Landmark]].{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|pp=18-19}}{{sfn|McIver|1993|p=3}} Deagan's next Caribbean project, in the [[Dominican Republic]] began in 1989 with an investigation of La Isabela, Columbus's first permanent settlement in the Americas. Because the community existed from 1493 to 1498, it was a "wholly 15th-century" location, yielding information on period flora and fauna, as well as social construction and technology.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}} In 1992, Deagan was honored with the Award of Merit from the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]].{{sfn|Orser Jr.|2002|p=577}}

In 1993, Deagan discovered the original settlement site of the fort at St. Augustine. For sixty years, archaeologists had searched for the original location of the fort, built by [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] in 1565. The later [[Castillo de San Marcos]] was built in the 17th century and lies to the south of the original fort, which was located near the monument to ''Nuestra Senora de la Leche'' adjacent to the [[Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park]]. Though artifacts and house footings had indicated 16th-century use of the site, the find of the moat confirmed the location and established conclusively that the Spaniards had colonized Florida long before the British had established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|colony of Jamestown]] or the [[Plymouth Colony]].{{sfn|Wilford|1993}} In 1995, Deagan initiated an excavation at Concepción de la Vega in the interior of the Dominican Republic. The settlement was founded in 1496 and occupied until 1562.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=6}}

That same year, 1995, Deagan was honored as a Distinguished Research Curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History. In 1997, she was honored with an award as an Outstanding Alumna of the University of Florida and in 1999 was designated by the research foundation of the university as a Distinguished Research Professor. She was the 2004 recipient of the [[J. C. Harrington Award]] of the Society for Historical Archaeology.{{sfn|McEwan|2004|p=7}} In 2007 Deagan was awarded the ''Order of La Florida'' by the City of St. Augustine for her work in developing the history of the city.{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=465}} Retiring from teaching in 2010,{{sfn|Ortiz|2012|p=41}} she was appointed as the Lockwood Professor of Florida and Caribbean Archaeology and received an honorary doctor of laws from [[Flagler College]] in 2011.{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=465}}

Continuing her work as curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History and leading excavations in the area around St. Augustine,  Deagan began to search for the field notes and artifacts which had been unearthed by archaeologist [[John Mann Goggin]] in the early 1950s. In 2013, she received a telephone call from a woman in Martinez, California who had gathered all the materials to complete his graduate work in Connecticut. Though he never finished his degree, the student kept the materials and moved them with his family to Chicago, later to New Mexico and finally to California. When he died, his daughter discovered the items in the family garage and Deagan arranged shipment of them to Florida.{{sfn|Tonnessen|2014|p=53}} The 12,000 artifacts and field notes helped determine the size of the original settlement and led to clues of a possible new defensive construction, which might indicate an additional fort.{{sfn|Tonnessen|2014|p=124}} The following year, the owners of the Fountain of Youth Park donated 97,000 artifacts which had been excavated from the property over a 65-year period to the museum{{sfn|Tonnessen|2014|p=51}} and Deagan returned to the Park to evaluate the site anew from her discoveries in the field notes from 1950.{{sfn|Tonnessen|2014|p=124}} In 2017 the research curator emerita, retired as the Lockwood Professor, but continued to pursue excavations in St. Augustine.{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=465}}

==Selected works==
Over her career, Deagan authored and edited over a dozen books and monographs, over two-dozen chapters of books and over four-dozen articles. She presented over one hundred papers and was recognized with book awards from the Florida Historical Society for her work on Fort Mose and the Society for American Archaeology for her work on La Isabela. Among her most noted contributions are:{{sfn|Ewen|2017|p=465}}

'''Kazimieras Jaunius''' (1848&amp;ndash;1908) was a [[Lithuania]]n [[priest]] and [[linguistics|linguist]]. He started his studies in [[linguistics]] in the end of the [[19th century]] in [[Kaunas]]. While Jaunius did not publish much, his major achievements include research on the similarity of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] to other languages and the systematization of research of  Lithuanian [[dialect]]s. He collaborated with [[Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay]] and [[Jonas Basanavičius]]. 

His famous disciple is [[Kazimieras Būga]], who from 1903 worked as Jaunius' personal secretary. Būga collected most of Jaunius' work, who was known not to be keen to write his thoughts down. Būga prepared four volumes of Jaunius' writings for print.

Public legal education, sometimes called civics education, comprises a range of activities intended to build public awareness and skills related to [[law]] and the justice system. This term also refers to the fields of practice and [[wikt:study|study]] concerned with those activities, and to a social and professional [[social movement|movement]] that advocates greater societal commitment to [[education|educating]] people about the law. Anna-Marie Marshall explains that  "in order to realize their rights, people need to take the initiative to articulate them.

Distinct from the education of students in [[law school]] seeking a degree in law (which is often simply called "[[legal education]]") and the [[continuing education#Continuing education for professionals|continuing professional education]] of [[lawyer]]s and [[judge]]s (which is sometimes called "[[continuing legal education]]"), public legal education is principally aimed at people who are not lawyers, judges, or degree-seeking law students.

The term "public legal education" (PLE) is related to, and may encompass, several similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "law-related education" (LRE) usually refers to public legal education in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools (and sometimes in [[higher education]]), as opposed to PLE for adults and outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Wanda (2000).

==Definition==
According to the [[American Bar Association]], Commission on Public Understanding, legal awareness is, "the ability to make critical judgments about the substance of the law, the legal process, and available legal resources and to effectively utilize the legal system and articulate strategies to improve it is legal literacy".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

The [[Canadian Bar Association]] (1992, 23) defines legal literacy as, "the ability to understand words used in a legal context, to draw conclusions from them, and then to use those conclusions to take action."&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Citizens: Literacy Training in Anxious Time. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. Project MUSE. Web. Feb. 2015. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

With little change to the Multiple Action Research Group's(MARG, an NGO working for the promotion of legal awareness) definition, legal awareness can be defined as, "critical knowledge of legal provisions and processes, coupled with the skills to use this knowledge to respect and realize rights and entitlements".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref name="MARG"&gt;[http://www.ngo-marg.org/legal-awareness Multiple Action Research Group - Justice through research empowerment] (Accessed on 2 Apr 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought, philosophy, and different approaches to legal literacy==

The "continuum approach" considers legal literacy as, "a capacity spread along a continuum, with lawyers and judges at one end and relatively incapable laypersons at the other". This approach was adopted by the legal scholar White who considered legal literacy to mean, "that degree of competence in legal discourse required for meaningful and active life in our increasingly [[legal culture|legalistic and litigious culture]]".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

Author Bilder (1999) defines legal literacy as a, "spectrum of functional skills", related to the conduct of [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Bilder1999, 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The continuum approach explains, "a certain degree of legal literacy is required for effective participation in modern society, but it is not necessary for the average citizen to reach the professional standard of 'thinking (and writing) like a lawyer.'"&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

One of the recent approaches considers legal literacy as a metaphor. According to this view, the term is "intended to suggest some parallels between the institution of the law, and a system of language to be mastered, knowledge gained and understanding achieved".&lt;ref&gt;(Manley-Casimir, Michael E., Wanda M. Cassidy, and Suzanne de Castell 1986, 47)&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that the term legal literacy can also function as a model for educators who seek to promote such literacy. Proponents of legal literacy may thus look to the teaching of language for guidance.&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

==Need and importance==
Anoop Kumar, a researcher of Legal Literacy Mission, says in his study, "the legislature of the state and the parliament, while enacting the legislation, consider the objectives of it. Some laws lay down the substantive rights of the masses and some touch upon the procedural aspect of certain laws. But it is due to lack of awareness of beneficiaries that most of the legislations are ineffective at the stage of their execution."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Anoop, Social science research network National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beljaars, Ben. "Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum", International Journal of Legal Information. Journal. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal awareness can empower people to demand justice, accountability and effective remedies at all levels.&lt;ref name=MARG/&gt; Legal needs always stand to become crisis oriented because their ignorance prevents them from anticipating legal troubles and approaching a lawyer for consultation and advice in time. This magnifies the impact of their legal troubles and difficulties when they come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hslsa.nic.in/Resume.htm Justice P.N. Bhagwati, In 1986, in case of Sukhdas V. Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh, reported in AIR 1986 S.C. at page 991, Justice P.N. Bhagwat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Without (legal) literacy people can get intimidated and alienated from law. This may evolve into a situation which results in people coming into conflict with the law, or being unable to obtain help from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Canadian Bar Association 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have acknowledged the barrier raised by a lack of literacy to asserting guaranteed rights effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (The John Howard Society of Canada1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; Low literacy may block people’s access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Council of Canadian Administrative Tribunals 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; At times, literacy requirements have been used to block access to rights and benefits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (South Carolina v.

Goals of the legal literacy programs can be broadly divided in three types. Namely educational, competency and critical.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Reading the Legal World'', author Laird Hunter expects legal literacy to achieve:&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Kumar, Anoop, National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis (March 26, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"People using the legal system must be able to guide themselves through a process that they understand [...] and, at appropriate places along the way"
*recognize they have a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] or [[Law of obligations|responsibility]], in order to exercise or assume it;
*recognize when a problem or conflict is a legal conflict and when a legal solution is available;
*know how to take the necessary action to avoid problems and where this is not possible, how to help themselves appropriately;
*know how and where to find information on the law, and be able to find information that is accessible to them,
* know when and how to obtain suitable legal assistance;
* have confidence that the legal system will provide a remedy, and
* understand the process clearly enough to perceive that justice has been done

Depending on the goals there can be a number of objectives for legal literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawforlife.org.uk/introduction/cambodian-community-empowerment-and-legal-awareness-programme,10181,FP.html retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods adopted to promote legal awareness===
There have been many cases where governments have promoted long-term legal literacy missions or awareness campaigns. An example of this is when institutions arrange legal literacy events.

Legal awareness is also achieved through camps, lectures, and interactive workshops or crash programs on the essential and elementary legal laws. Among the general public, many wish to spend time listening to scholars on contemporary issues that have significant bearing on the rights and livelihood of ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt; Other methods are road shows, radio talks, street and theatre plays, as well as the publication of relevant books, periodicals, posters, and charts that deal with particular laws, the distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and stickers, the display of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Aid and Literacy Cell|url=http://www.symlaw.ac.in/legal-aid-and-literacy-cell.php|website=symlaw.ac.in|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrations in comics,&lt;ref name="morungexpress"&gt;{{cite news|title = Legal awareness through grassroots comics|url = http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|accessdate = 8 December 2014|publisher = morungexpress.com|date = November 11, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211044243/http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|archive-date = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other ways to ensure publicity for various [[legal mobilisation]] activities.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

Strategically located display boards in public places (railway stations, bus stations, market places, in front of major government offices and police stations) are also used to help government officials, police, and the public to understand the spirit of law.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

==Obstacles==
According to Lorenzo Cotula, laws are usually published in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to [[legal information]].&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy,&lt;ref name="Cotula" /&gt; economic barriers,&lt;ref name="UNSG"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A-67-278.pdf  " Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights" page 6 from Note by the Secretary-General on Extreme poverty and human rights for UN GA 67th session A67/278 Distri:General 9 Aug 2012]  www.ohchr.org webpage retrieved 30 March 2013 16.00 IST&lt;/ref&gt; language barriers, social taboos&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=irvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;dq=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xBXUffCA4fXrQeHhIGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgo Arise: A Women's Developmental Magazine Published by Acfode, Issues 2-16 ] snippet view as seen/referred to on 30 March 2013 on Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of zeal among the legal fraternity may lead to obstacles in gaining requisite levels of legal literacy. According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, at times lack of zeal among lawyers make them prone to saying no and killing a deal rather than working through the issues and finding solutions that are both practical and legally sound.&lt;ref name="HannaHK"&gt;{{cite book| first = Hanna | last = Hasl-Kelchner| title = The business guide to legal literacy: what every manager should know about the law| isbn = 9780787982553 | year = 2006| pages = 1–12 &amp; inside flap page|accessdate=9 Nov 2013| url = http://www.legalliteracybooktour.com/LegalLiteracy-FreeChapters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a note to the UN General Assembly 67th session, the UN Secretary General states, "the deprivations that persons living in poverty encounter throughout their lives — lack of access to quality education, reduced access to information, limited political voice and social capital — translate into lower levels of legal literacy and awareness of their rights, creating social obstacles to seeking redress".&lt;ref name=UNSG/&gt;

The absence of a [[legal culture]] and the resulting illiteracy are the main reasons for the large number of cases in the courts. If the accused citizen knows that an act is a crime punishable by law, they may not do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413235533/http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |archivedate=2013-04-13 |df= }} website retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domain of law a vast category of users need to exchange [[legal information]] worldwide and carry out activities in a context where a common understanding of law beyond language is highly desirable. However, this requirement is hard to meet, due to the variety of languages and modes in which the legal discourse is expressed as well as to the diversity of legal orders and the legal concepts on which these systems are founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webfolder.eurac.edu/EURAC/LexALP_shared/media/Peruginelli.pdf Multilingual Legal Information Access: an Overview- Ginevra Peruginelli] Retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

About lesser significance to legal literacy in US legal education, Leonard J. Long professor of law, [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]] says, "law students, law firms, consumers of legal services, and society as a whole would benefit from having a legal profession comprised and dominated by people who are literate in American law, its history, and its jurisprudence. But legal literacy is not promoted mainly because it is not viewed as necessary for the practice of law. This is part of the anti-intellectual tradition in American law generally, and in American legal education specifically".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.siu.edu/journal/34fall/1%20-%20Long.pdf RESISTING ANTI -INTELLECTUALISM AND PROMOTING LEGAL LITERACY by Leonard J.

==Institutional and corporate legal literacy==
Corporate, institutions and NGOs are subject to and are supposed to follow various sets of laws.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Corporate legal literacy===
Legal awareness is an important part of professional work life.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=1T5BHBHNNN0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2--T8XgEY3JrQeY-qW1DQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTi0AQ&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Akula, when law-sensitive issues arise, corporate executives often find themselves in what is, for them, unmapped territory, often without requisite law training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iedp.com/Blog/Importance_Legal_Literacy_Executives_MITSloan The Importance of Legal Literacy for Executives-John Akula, Senior lecturer in Law at MIT Sloan School of Management] Retrieved 31 March 2013 13.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt; When corporate executives work with attorneys they need to develop a common language to bridge probable communication gaps to achieve legal astituteness.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=I2ezeH8IpSgC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=need+of+legal+literacy+to+corporate+executives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qO9XUcrEJ4OsrAeM5YGgCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20of%20legal%20literacy%20to%20corporate%20executives&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, legal literacy can help to bridge the gap between law and business by simplifying legal terms into language that makes business sense and offers a new way to think about the law as a useful business tool.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;
She says, "corporate legal literacy involves balanced understanding of cross disciplinary influences bringing in legal risk exposure, avoiding lawsuits and transforming potential business legal issues that threaten growth and profitability, into opportunities for building stronger business relationships, delivering sustainable stakeholder value, improving competitive advantage and foremost embedding compliance into the corporate culture to achieve organizational excellence".&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

According to Hasl-Kelchner, corporate legal literacy tackles companies' legal risk profiles on both the employee and organizational levels. There is a need to identify the infrastructure needed to support legal literacy and promote effective communications throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Institutional legal literacy===
George Pulikuthiyil, executive director of NGO Jananeethi in his essay ''Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment'' says that, 'Well educated and highly placed professionals too are often not aware of provisions in laws and implications of their violations. Many would not know the nitty-gritty of several statutory laws and their applications.&amp;nbsp;... However, the fact remains that vast majority of the officers and professionals like clinical psychologists, therapeutic counsellors, welfare officers, social workers, institutional heads and academia are ignorant of their role and responsibilities as contemplated in the Act. NGOs do take pains to organize workshops to sensitize them with respect to such new generation legislations wherein the pro-active role of various stake holders are great significance.' &lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulikuthiyil|first1=George|title=Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment|url=http://www.jananeethi.org/jananeethi/reports/esseylegalliteracy.htm|publisher=jananeethi.org/|accessdate=2 December 2014|quote=Bare-foot lawyers/para-legal activists"There may be para-legal workers specially trained in specific thrust areas like minorities, indigenous people, child rights, gender issues, right to information, consumer rights, torture and custodial violence etc. "}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Pulikuthiyil further believes non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, faith groups, various service providers, trade unions, youth clubs, police personnel, elected representatives to local bodies, PG students of social work and service organizations also have larger scope of improving the quality of life provided they are made conversant with respective legislations.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

===Designated legal officers===
Apart from external legal advisors, [[General counsel|internal legal officers]]&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10,[http://www.acc.com/chapters/socal/upload/2011-In-House-Counsel-Compensation-Survey_4-13-11.pdf] Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 [http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=16297] Who Does Your Counsel Report To?

==Related concepts==
There are certain related concepts including [[legal consciousness]], [[legal mobilization]] and [[legal socialization]], [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]], that helps to put legal literacy in perspective.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"/&gt;

===Civics and socio-legal literacy===
Despite semantic proximity education of [[civics]], civics literacy and legal literacy are not exactly the same. In the "legal literacy" semantic components are the dominant notion of the "right," "law," "responsibility to the law," and "civic literacy" added to them the concept of "civil society", "individual rights and freedoms" and "man's responsibility to civil society".&lt;ref&gt;http://academia.lndb.lv/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1173/natalia-gendina-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the formal civic education system, human rights can be taken up as a part of civic education, values education and social studies, though they may have the limitation of presenting only certain aspects of human rights rather than their integrated whole, and duties of citizens may be overly emphasized to the detriment of certain rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurights.or.jp/english/education/overview-human-rights-education-in-the-asia-pacific.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elementary school level, usually minimal level legal literacy introduction is taught through [[civics]], but which is not necessarily adequate for the rest of life.&lt;ref name="Civic Education, Crittenden &amp; Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crittenden|first1=Jack|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Education|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civic-education/|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=22 June 2017|page=Para 2 and also para 1|date=27 December 2007&lt;!--substantive revision Thu May 30, 2013--&gt;|quote=Paragraph no. 2  Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase “civic education” investigates deliberate programs of instruction within schools or colleges,...........Nevertheless, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education takes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than schools.  also Para 1  ...It is certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and youth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23982">This is a '''list of utopian literature'''. A [[utopia]] is a [[community]] or [[society]] possessing highly desirable or perfect qualities. It is a common literary theme, especially in [[speculative fiction]] and [[science fiction]].

== Pre-16th century ==
The word "utopia" was coined in [[Greek language]] by [[Sir Thomas More]] for his 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', but the genre has roots dating back to [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].

The '''Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus''' or '''"Great" Ludovisi sarcophagus''' is an [[ancient Roman sarcophagus]] dating to around AD 250–260 from a tomb near the [[Porta Tiburtina]]. It is also known as the '''Via Tiburtina Sarcophagus''', though other sarcophagi have been found there. It is known for its densely populated, anti-[[classicism|classical]] composition of "writhing and highly emotive"&lt;ref name="Kleiner 272"&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'' (Wadsworth, 2007, 2010, enhanced ed.), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ancient Romans|Romans]] and [[Goths]], and is an example of the battle scenes favored in [[Roman art]] during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].&lt;ref name="Kleiner 272" /&gt; Discovered in 1621 and named for its first modern owner, [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], the sarcophagus is now displayed at the [[Palazzo Altemps]] in [[Rome]], part of the [[National Museum of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarcophagus is a late outlier in a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, the others all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Strong et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 205, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300052936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus 03.JPG|thumb|Detail of the central figure, his forehead marked with an X]]
The sarcophagus measures 1.53m in height and is made from [[Proconnesian marble]], a [[List of artistic media|medium]] characterized by dark gray stripes and a medium to coarse grain.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Van Keuren, Donatio Attanasio, John J. Hermann Jr., Norman Herz, and L. Peter Gromet, "Multimethod Analyses of Roman Sarcophagi at the Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome," in ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; It is decorated in a very [[high relief]] with many elements of the composition cut completely free of the background. Overlapping figures entirely fill the image space, allowing no room to depict a background. In many battle sarcophagi the side panels show more tranquil scenes, but here the battle continues round both sides.

The lid of the sarcophagus depicts barbarian children handed over to a Roman general by men presumably their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannine Diddle Uzzi, "The Power of Parenthood in Official Roman Art," in ''Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Children were sometimes taken into Roman custody as pledges of peace, and might be reeducated as Romans. The lid, which was broken in 1945 while on display in [[Mainz]], also shows a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of a female figure.

The central figure of the tortuous composition on the front is a young Roman military commander on horseback, presumed to represent the deceased. His face is serene, and his arm is extended confidently in a "gesture which is difficult to interpret but seems to be one of farewell".&lt;ref name="Strong 257" /&gt; An X-mark on his forehead has been interpreted as the cross received by initiates into the [[Mithraic mysteries]] as a sign of the god Mithras' favor. The Mithraic religion was popular among Roman soldiers. The valor ''([[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]])'' shown by the horseman may represent real-life bravery on the battlefield, but the religious connotation of the X may suggest victory over death, a theme of mounted warriors in funerary art. The horseman probably represents the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Welch, "Roman Sculpture," in ''The Oxford History of Western Art'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 51; Linda Maria Gigante, "Funerary art," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure is sometimes identified as the younger son of the emperor [[Decius]], [[Hostilian]], who reigned briefly in the year 251. Decius and his older son, [[Herennius Etruscus|Herennius]], whom he had made his co-ruler, were killed [[Battle of Abritus|in battle]] against a federation of [[Scythians#Migration period|Scythians]] under the command of the [[Goths|Gothic]] king [[Cniva]]. They were the first [[Roman emperor]]s to die in battle at the hands of a foreign enemy. Despite the battle imagery, Hostilian himself died of plague.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Allan, ''Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome'' (Duncan Baird, 2005), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus 21.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Roman wearing mail, and above him a ''[[cornicen]]'', a junior officer who communicated signals with the [[cornu (horn)|military horn]]]]
The sarcophagus contains many precise depictions of military details such as the ''[[Draco (military standard)|draco]]'' military standard and a detailed [[Mail (armour)|mail shirt]] of the longer length characteristic of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern and Karen R. Dixon, ''The Late Roman Army'' (Yale University Press, 1996), pp. 98, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and style==
The undercutting of the deep relief exhibits virtuosic and very time-consuming drill work that conveys chaos and a sense of weary, open-ended victory. It differs from earlier battle scenes on sarcophagi in which more shallowly carved figures are less convoluted and intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, "Roman Sculpture", in ''The Oxford History of Western Art'', p. 41; Mackay, ''Ancient Rome'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  Describing it as "the finest of the third-century sarcophagi", art historian Donald Strong says:&lt;ref name="Strong 257"&gt;Donald Strong et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 257, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300052936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The faces are strikingly unclassical, and the technique of deep drilling is particularly obvious in the manes of the horses and the shaggy hair of the barbarians.  But the main difference [to the [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], a similar 2nd-century work] is in the symbolism.  The barbarians all seem frozen in the moment before disaster and death overwhelm them; their attitudes are highly theatrical but none the less immensely expressive... The main theme is no longer the glorification of military prowess but that of transcending the struggle, presumably conveying the notion of triumph over death ... The ugliness of pain and suffering is stressed by the dishevelled hair, the tormented eyes, the twisted mouth.}}

The carving is so deep that the forms are almost completely offset from the background resulting in three, or even four, layers of various figures and forms. What is more, overlapping figures fill the image space entirely, allowing no room to depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos and a sense of weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue all the way around the sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574 n7.jpg|thumb|Detail of a barbarian pierced by a lance,]]
From the time of the [[Antonine dynasty|reign of the Antonine emperors]], Roman art increasingly depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military might, at a time when in fact the [[Roman Empire]] was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to [[fall of the Roman Empire|the fall of the empire in the West]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Coleman, "Barbarians: Artistic Representations", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 371; Allan, ''Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, "Barbarians: Artistic Representations", p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Various aspects of the execution of the work accentuate the contrast between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are unarmoured and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a nobler appearance with idealised physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced cheekbones, and wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark accentuates the contrast between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved.

Differences in scale between the figures, though present, are far less marked than in the earlier Portonaccio sarcophagus, such that the general is only slightly larger than his troops or enemies. Nor is the general seen wearing a helmet or in actual combat, as in the earlier sarcophagi.&lt;ref name="Strong 257" /&gt;

[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|250px|thumb|right|World map from 2016 ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'']]

A '''map''' is a [[symbol]]ic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as [[Physical body|objects]], [[region]]s, or themes.

Many maps are static, fixed to [[paper]] or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any [[space]], real or fictional, without regard to [[context (language use)|context]] or [[scale (map)|scale]], such as in [[brain mapping]], [[DNA]] mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.

Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin ''Mappa mundi'', wherein ''mappa'' meant napkin or cloth and ''mundi'' the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.

==Geographic maps==
[[File:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the  cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]]

[[Cartography]] or ''map-making'' is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see [[History of cartography]]), and one who makes maps is called a [[cartography|cartographer]].

[[Road atlas|Road maps]] are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and [[nautical chart]]s, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by [[municipality|municipalities]], utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies.  Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance Survey]]: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.

In addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray [[contour line]]s indicating constant values of [[elevation]], [[temperature]], [[rain]]fall, etc.

==Orientation of maps==
[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|thumb|''The [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]]'' from about 1300, [[Hereford Cathedral]], England, is a classic "T-O" map with Jerusalem at centre, east toward the top, Europe the bottom left and Africa on the right.]]
The orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding [[compass direction]]s in reality. The word "[[orient]]" is derived from [[Latin]] ''oriens'', meaning east. In the [[Middle Ages]] many maps, including the [[T and O map]]s, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction "up" on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention is that north is at the top of a map.

Maps not oriented with north at the top:
* Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of [[Edo]] show the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Japanese imperial palace]] as the "top", but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European [[T and O map]]s such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] were centred on [[Jerusalem]] with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. [[Portolan chart]]s, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.
* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.
* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.
* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Polar maps]] of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.
* [[Reversed map]]s, also known as ''Upside-Down maps'' or ''South-Up maps'', reverse the ''North is up'' convention and have south at the top.
* [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion map]]s are based on a projection of the Earth's [[sphere]] onto an [[icosahedron]]. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.
* Modern digital [[GIS]] maps such as [[ArcMap]] typically project north at the top of the map, but use math degrees (0 is east, degrees increase counter-clockwise), rather than compass degrees (0 is north, degrees increase clockwise) for orientation of transects. Compass decimal degrees can be converted to math degrees by subtracting them from 450; if the answer is greater than 360, subtract 360.

==Scale and accuracy==

[[File:Blank globe.svg|thumb|A 'global view map' of Europe, Western Asia and Africa.]]

Many maps are drawn to a [[Scale (map)|scale]] expressed as a [[ratio]], such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of [[measurement]] on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the [[curvature]] of the Earth to be neglected, such as a [[city map]]. Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires [[map projection|projections]] to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the [[sphere]] to the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as [[scale (map)|point scale]] per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.

Large scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000), cover relatively small regions in great detail and small scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000,000), cover large regions such as nations, continents and the whole [[globe]]. The large/small terminology arose from the practice of writing scales as numerical fractions: 1/10,000 is larger than 1/10,000,000. There is no exact dividing line between large and small but 1/100,000 might well be considered as a medium scale. Examples of large scale maps are the 1:25,000 maps produced for hikers; on the other hand maps intended for motorists at 1:250,000 or 1:1,000,000 are small scale.

It is important to recognize that even the most accurate maps sacrifice a certain amount of accuracy in scale to deliver a greater visual usefulness to its user. For example, the width of roads and small streams are exaggerated when they are too narrow to be shown on the map at true scale; that is, on a printed map they would be narrower than could be perceived by the naked eye. The same applies to computer maps where the smallest unit is the [[pixel]]. A narrow stream say must be shown to have the width of a pixel even if at the map scale it would be a small fraction of the pixel width.
[[File:EU Pop2008 1024.PNG|thumb|Cartogram: The [[European Union|EU]] distorted to show population distributions.]]

Some maps, called [[cartogram]]s, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the right) of [[Europe]] has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.

Another example of distorted scale is the famous [[Tube map|London Underground map]]. The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines (and the [[River Thames]]) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.

Further inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.

==Map types and projections==

{{Category see also|Map types}}
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|thumb|Map of large underwater features. (1995, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])]]
Maps of the world or large areas are often either 'political' or 'physical'. The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial [[border]]s; the purpose of the physical is to show features of [[geography]] such as mountains, soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads, railroads and buildings. [[Topographic map]]s show [[elevation]]s and [[Terrain|relief]] with [[contour line]]s or shading. [[Geological map]]s show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[fault (geology)|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures.
Maps that depict the surface of the Earth also use a [[map projection|projection]], a way of translating the three-dimensional real surface of the [[geoid]] to a two-dimensional picture. Perhaps the best-known world-map projection is the [[Mercator projection]], originally designed as a form of [[nautical chart]].
Aeroplane pilots use [[aeronautical chart]]s based on a [[Lambert conformal conic projection]], in which a cone is laid over the section of the earth to be mapped. The cone intersects the sphere (the earth) at one or two parallels which are chosen as standard lines. This allows the pilots to plot a great-circle route approximation on a flat, two-dimensional chart.
* [[Map projection#Azimuthal (projections onto a plane)|Azimuthal]] or [[Gnomonic projection|Gnomonic]] [[map projection]]s are often used in planning air routes due to their ability to represent [[great circle]]s as straight lines.
*  Richard Edes Harrison produced a striking series of maps during and after [[World War II]] for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]. These used "bird's eye" projections to emphasise globally strategic "fronts" in the air age, pointing out proximities and barriers not apparent on a conventional  rectangular projection of the world.

===Electronic maps===&lt;!-- Electronic map redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Topographic map example.png|thumb|A [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[digital raster graphic]].]]

From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the [[cartographer]] has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering [[surveying|survey]] level, has been subsumed by [[geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such [[superimposition]] of data led [[John Snow (physician)|Dr. John Snow]] to identify the location of an outbreak of [[cholera]]. Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.

[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map Sierra Nevada]]

Even when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.

Interactive, computerised maps are commercially available, allowing users to ''zoom in'' or ''zoom out'' (respectively meaning to increase or decrease the scale), sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point.  In-car [[global navigation satellite system]]s are computerised maps with route-planning and advice facilities which monitor the user's position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientist's point of view, zooming in entails one or a combination of:

# replacing the map by a more detailed one
# enlarging the same map without enlarging the [[pixel]]s, hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version
# enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged (replaced by rectangles of pixels); no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the quality of one's vision, possibly more detail can be seen; if a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separate, but overlapping instead (this does not apply for an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]], but may apply for a [[cathode ray tube]]), then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail.  A variation of this method is [[interpolation]].

[[File:World.pdf|thumb|A world map in PDF format.]]

For example:
* Typically (2) applies to a [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) file or other format based on [[vector graphics]]. The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles or [[spline (mathematics)|splines]].
* (2) may apply to text and (3) to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.
* (1) may apply to the text as needed (displaying labels for more features), while (2) applies to the rest of the image.  Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.
* The map may also have layers which are partly [[raster graphics]] and partly [[vector graphics]].  For a single raster graphics image (2) applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter (3) applies.

== Climatic maps ==

The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth's surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps afford a very convenient overview of the climatic features in a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. Through interpolation the maps can be used to determine the values of climatic features in any particular spot.

Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.

Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.

Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth's surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.

Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.

==Conventional signs==
The various features shown on a map are represented by conventional [[sign]]s or symbols.  For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads.  Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185303/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=3 April 2016 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601185821/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ |date=1 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room "outside" the map for information about the map as a whole.
These cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise "blank" region "inside" the map{{mdash}}[[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]], [[legend (map)|map legend]], title, [[compass rose]], [[bar scale]], etc.
In particular, some maps contain smaller "sub-maps"&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; in otherwise blank regions—often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing "regions of interest" at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldn't otherwise fit.
Occasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map—a few maps of the [[contiguous United States]] include a sub-map&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.

{{See also|Japanese map symbols}}

===Labeling===
To communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]]. Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed [[automatic label placement]] to ease this process.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, E., “Die Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,” Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-Füssli Verlag, Zürich, 93–129, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, H., Map data processing and the annotation problem, Proc. 3rd Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, Chartwell-Bratt Ltd. Copenhagen, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-geographical spatial maps==
Maps exist of the [[Solar System]], and other cosmological features such as [[star map]]s. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not ''[[geospatial|geo]]''graphical maps.

==Topological maps==
[[File:Inventory Locations Represented as a Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a [[topological map]], like this one showing inventory locations, the distances between locations is not important. Only the layout and connectivity between them matters.]]
Diagrams such as [[schematic diagram]]s and [[Gantt chart]]s and [[treemap]]s display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships. [[Topological]] in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The [[London Underground map]] and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.

==General-purpose maps==
General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area.  The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.

==Legal regulation==

Some countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding [[border dispute]]s.  For example:
* Within Russia, Google Maps shows [[Crimea]] as part of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/12/302337754/google-maps-displays-crimean-border-differently-in-russia-u-s |title=Google Maps Displays Crimean Border Differently In Russia, U.S. |date=12 April 2014 |work=[[NPR.org]] |first=Bill |last=Chappell |author-link=Bill Chappell |access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China require that all maps show areas subject to the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]] in their own favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/23/us-google-asia-idUSBRE82M0I020120323 |title=Google charts a careful course through Asia's maps |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |first=Jeremy |last=Wagstaff |author-link=Jeremy Wagstaff |access-date=6 September 2018 |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the People's Republic of China began requiring that all online maps served from within China be hosted there, making them subject to Chinese laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guanqun |first=Wang |title=China issues new rules on Internet map publishing |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |access-date=27 July 2016 |date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527193512/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |archive-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mario Roques''' (1 July 1875 – 8 March 1961) was a French scholar, professor of history of [[medieval literature]] and renowned Romance philologist. He translated and edited ''[[Reynard|Le Roman de Renart]]''.

== Biography ==
Mario Roques was born in Peru where his father was a consular agent&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Chantraine, ''[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/crai_0065-0536_1961_num_105_1_11274 Éloge funèbre de Mario Roques, membre de l'Académie]', ''Comptes-rendus des séances de l'Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres'', 1961, 105-1, (p.&amp;nbsp;83–88)&lt;/ref&gt; He started studying at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) from 1894 while following courses at the [[École nationale des chartes]] as an auditor. In 1895, he joined the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (EPHE) where he trained in Romance philology under the guidance of [[Gaston Paris]] and Antoine Thomas. His teaching career began early and led him to teach at the ENS, the EPHE (where he would succeed [[Gaston Paris]]), the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales]] (where he taught the Romanian and Albanian languages and of which he was appointed director, that is to say director, 1936), the [[Sorbonne]] and the [[Collège de France]].

In 1910, he created the series "Les classiques français du Moyen âge" at {{Interlanguage link multi|éditions Honoré Champion|fr}}. The following year, he succeeded [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]] at the head of the journal ''[[Romania (journal)|Romania]]'', which he would manage until his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6320">'''Miriam Chaszczewacki''' or '''Miriam Chaszczewacka''' (1924–1942) was a 15-year-old Jewish girl and Holocaust victim who in 1939 began writing a personal diary about her life in the [[Radomsko]] [[ghetto]] which ended a few days before her assassination in 1942.

== Discovery and publication of the diary ==
Miriam's teacher Stefania Heilbrunn returned to [[Radomsko]], [[Poland]] after [[World War II]] had ended. While she was visiting the city cemetery, she met a Polish woman who gave her a sealed envelope saying "My son has asked me to give this to you. I don't know anything about it" and left. In the envelope Heilbrunn found a notebook with handwriting she recognized as belonging to her former student, Miriam Chaszczewacki. Heilbrunn brought the notebook to [[Israel]] and published its content.&lt;ref name=p344&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the diary was written in [[Polish language|Polish]]. Parts of the diary were published in Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish,  English and German. The original notebook was donated to [[Yad Vashem]].

== Life ==
Miriam's mother Sarah Lavit Zelber, born to a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidic]] family was a kindergarten teacher and a public figure. Miriam's father David&lt;ref&gt;תמונתו ופרק לזכרו בספר יזכור ליהדות רדומסקו page 460&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Ukraine]]. He opened a Jewish school in Radomsko where he taught Hebrew. This school was later active in the ghetto. Miriam's  brother Nahum was born in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Children of Dust and Heaven, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam was a 15-year-old [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] student and a member of a Zionist youth movement when the war began. She is described as a gentle, sensitive, intelligent and talented girl who studied Hebrew in her father's school.&lt;ref&gt;נערה בגיטו, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In another testimony, she is described as a shy, romantic and dreamy teenager.&lt;ref name=p86&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam's father and brother were murdered in the ghetto by the Germans. The father, David, was killed for refusing to board a deportation train.&lt;ref name=p142&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brother Nahum was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name=p184&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapters of the diary ==
The diary begins with the introductory chapter that describes the events between the summer of 1939 and the occupation of Radomsko by the Germans in September 1939. The second part of the diary consists of 27 dated entries starting at 21 April 1941 describing the events of the war and ghetto life along with the typical account of a teenage girl's emotions.

== Death ==
The last entry in the diary in Miriam's handwriting was on 7 October 1942, when Miriam was 18. Between 9 and 12 October 1942 about 14,000 residents of the ghetto were sent to [[Treblinka]].

In the last page of the notebook appears an entry in a different, adult, handwriting, possibly by the Polish policeman who was the son of the woman who passed the notebook to Stefania Heilbrunn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the evening of the 24 October 1942 she surrendered, together with her mother, to a Polish policeman on duty on Limanewskeigo Str. They asked to be taken to the Judenrat, as they have been hiding for a week in a lavatory and had enough of it all. During the last 3 days they ate raw groats. They were taken to the Police station and the next day left with a transport by lorry to [[Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name=p344/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In one of the diary's last entries, about a month before her death, Miriam wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may seem silly, but only a step away from death I still worry about my diary. I would not want for it to meet a miserable end in an oven or on a rubbish heap. I wish somebody could find it – even if it be only a German – and would read it. I wish that these scribblings, though they record barely a fraction of the cruelties, would one day serve as a true and faithful document of our times.&lt;ref name=p133&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Dust and Heaven : A Diary from Nazi Occupation through the Holocaust|last=Heilbrunn|first=Stefania|date=March 18, 2013|isbn=1481865617|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Muisca raft''' (''Balsa Muisca'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), sometimes referred to as the '''El Dorado Raft''', is an artistic figure of pre-Columbian gold votive, drafted by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] who established one of the four grand civilisations in the Americas on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]]. The piece is exhibited at the [[Gold Museum, Bogota|Gold Museum]] in [[Bogota]]. It is estimated that the figure was drawn between 600 and 1600 AD by [[lost-wax casting]] in [[gold]] with a small amount of [[copper]].

The figure refers to the ceremony of the legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''. It represents the ceremony of investiture of the Muisca chief, which used to take place at [[Lake Guatavita]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/s_muisca05.htm Banco de la Republica: Muisca Eldorado Raft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119000405/http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/s_muisca05.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this ritual, the heir to the chieftainship (''[[zipa]]'') covered his body with gold dust and jumped into the lake along with gold offerings and [[emerald]]s to the gods. The piece has a base in the shape of a log boat with dimensions of 19.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 10.1&amp;nbsp;cm and various figures on the raft, the largest figure that stands in the middle apparently represents the chief, which is adorned with headdresses, nose rings and earrings, measuring 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm and is surrounded by his soldiers who carry banners.

The raft was found by three farmers in early 1969 in a cave in the village of Lázaro Fonte in the municipality of [[Pasca]] ([[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]]), Colombia in a ceramic pot, adorned with a human figure whose face has sharp teeth. The priest of the municipality protected the piece until it was acquired by [[Bogota]]'s [[Gold Museum, Bogota|Gold Museum]] and where it has become one of its major exhibition pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banrep.org/museo/esp/expo_bogota4.htm Banco de la Republica: Exposición del Museo del Oro del Banco de la República en Bogotá] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXgRApLxfM Explanation of the metallurgy of the Muisca raft by Eduardo Londoño] - [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] https://www.youtube.com/user/faccienciashumanas http://www.humanas.unal.edu.co/&lt;/ref&gt; It has never left Colombia.

== Composition ==
The Muisca raft weighs 287.5 grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/leipzig/254/colombiahist.htm COLOMBIA, ¿el Dorado?] Spanish Academic Page Online. University of Delaware.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an alloy of gold with copper and silver.&lt;ref name=secrets2013&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Secrets: Golden Raft of El Dorado|year=2013|publisher=Smithsonian Channel|time=27 minutes, 11 seconds}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis using [[X-ray fluorescence]] has revealed breakdown of the composition as detailed in the table below:

{|class="wikitable sortable"
! Element (symbol) !! % by composition&lt;ref name=secrets2013/&gt; !! % by weight&lt;ref&gt;Based on standard atomic weights of {{val|196.966569}}, 63.546, and 107.8682 for gold, copper, and silver, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Gold (Au) 
| align=right | {{val|63.0|0.31}}
| align=right | 79.8
|-
| Copper (Cu)
| align=right | {{val|19.4|0.13}}
| align=right | 8.0
|-
| Silver (Ag)
| align=right | {{val|17.6|0.13}}
| align=right | 12.2
|}

Thus, the raft contains approximately {{convert|{{#expr: .798 * 287.5}}|g|ozt|adj=ri0|sigfig=3|abbr=off|order=flip}} of gold.

The '''names of China''' include the many contemporary and historical appellations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as ''Zhongguo'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:中國|中國]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:中国|中国]]}}) in its official language. [[China]], the name in English for the country, was derived from Portuguese in the 16th century, and became popular in the mid 19th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|p=191}} It is believed to be a borrowing from [[Middle Persian]], and some have traced it further back to [[Sanskrit]]. It is also generally thought that the ultimate source of the name China is the Chinese word "Qin" ({{zh|c=秦}}), the name of the [[Qin dynasty|dynasty]] that unified China but also existed as a [[Qin (state)|state]] for many centuries prior. There are however other alternative suggestions for the origin of the word.

Chinese names for China, aside from ''Zhongguo'',  include ''[[Zhonghua minzu|Zhonghua]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:中華|中華]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:中华|中华]]}}), ''[[Huaxia]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|華夏}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|华夏}}), ''Shenzhou'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|神州}}) and ''Jiuzhou'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|九州}}). ''[[Han Chinese|Han]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:漢|漢]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:汉|汉]]}}) and ''[[Tang dynasty|Tang]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:唐|唐]]}}) are common names given for the Chinese ethnicity. The [[China|People's Republic of China]] (Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó) and [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (Zhōnghuá Mínguó) are the official names for the two contemporary [[sovereign states]] currently claiming sovereignty over the traditional area of [[China]]. "[[Mainland China]]" is used to refer to areas under the jurisdiction by the PRC usually excluding [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]].

There are also names for China that are derived from the languages of other ethnic groups other than the [[Han Chinese|Han]]; examples include "[[Cathay]]" from the [[Khitan language]] and "Tabgach" from [[Tuoba]].

====Pre-Qing====
''Zhōngguó'' is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times. The first appearance of {{lang|zh-Hant|中國}} on an artifact was in the [[Western Zhou]] on a ritual vessel known as [[He zun]].&lt;ref name="qiji"&gt;7qiji.com. "[http://big5.7qiji.com/Attractions_view.asp?id=392 China's 7 wonders {{lang|zh-Hans|(中國七大奇蹟)}}]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}." ''{{lang|zh-Hans|何尊}}'' Retrieved on 2010-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed by combining the characters ''zhōng'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|中}}) meaning "central" or "middle", and ''guó'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|國}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|国}}), representing "state" or "states"; in contemporary usage, "nation". Prior to the Qin unification of China "Zhongguo" referred to the "Central States"; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area, centered on the Yellow River valley, as distinguished from the tribal periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Esherick, "How the Qing Became China," in ''Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods, however, "Zhongguo" was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|p=191}} Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as "Han dynasty" (''Hanchao'' {{lang|zh|漢朝}}), "Tang dynasty" (''Tangchao'' {{lang|zh|唐朝}}), "The Great Ming" (''Daming'' {{lang|zh|大明}}), "The Great Qing" (''Daqing'' {{lang|zh|大清}}), as the case might be. but the most traditional name that China has used to refer to itself is “Zhonggou". Missionary Matteo Ricci and John Livingston Nevius，They preached in China in different dynasties. In their Record, Chinese people often call themselves "Chung kwoh" the word meaning "middle kingdom". That is a very common word in both writing and speaking,&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Ricci , Louis J. Gallagher, S.J. China in the 16th Century: The Journals of Matthew Ricci,1583-1610, trans.(New York, Random House, 1942,1953)p.3-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Livingston Nevius, China and the Chinese (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1869), p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; and may be used with the name of the dynasty. Many case studies have proved that there were times China call itself “ Zhongguo ”in Chinese history and historical sites. Until the 19th century when the international system came to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.&lt;ref name="Zarrow "&gt;{{cite book |last = Zarrow |first = Peter Gue |year = 2012 |title = After Empire:The Conceptual Transformation of the Chinese State, 1885-1924 |publisher = [[Stanford University Press]]| location = Stanford, California |ISBN = 9780804778688 |ref = harv}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJfbNnquT8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=zarrow+aafter+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNgZXTncDRAhVGRyYKHRKmA88Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=zhongguo&amp;f=false p. 93-94].&lt;/ref&gt;

There were  different usages of the term "Zhongguo" in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in [[Western Zhou]]. It could refer to the states of the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] to distinguish them from states in outer regions. During the [[Han dynasty]], three usages of "Zhongguo" were common. The ''[[Shi Jing]]'' explicitly defines "Zhongguo" as the capital; the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' uses the concept ''zhong'' to indicate the center of civilization: "Eight famous mountains are there in [[Tianxia]]. Three are in [[Nanman|Man]] and [[Dongyi|Yi]]. Five are in ''Zhōnghuá''." The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' uses the concept of the central states in "Zhōnghuá", or the states in "Zhōnghuá" which is the center, depending on the interpretation. It records the following exhortation: "If we can lead the host of [[Wu (region)|Wu]] and [[Baiyue|Yue]] to oppose "Zhongguo," then let us break off relations with them soon." In this sense, the term "Zhongguo" is synonymous with ''Zhōnghuá'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|中華}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|中华}}) and ''Huáxià'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|華夏}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|华夏}}), names for "China" that comes from the [[Xia dynasty]].

From the Qin to Ming dynasty literati discussed "Zhongguo" as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w68uObIhx9MC&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jiang 2011], p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of "Zhongguo" and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Peter K Bol, "Geography and Culture: Middle-Period Discourse on the Zhong Guo: The Central Country," (2009), 1, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing====
''Zhongguo'' appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire]], and [[Wei Yuan]], a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from ''Zhongguo'', which he defined as the 17 provinces of "[[China proper]]" plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as ''Zhongguo'' (see the discussion below).&lt;ref&gt;Esherick, "How the Qing Became China," pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing equated the lands of the Qing realm (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas as "China" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas; both Han and non-Han peoples were part of "China". Officials used "China" (though not exclusively) in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the "Chinese language" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term "Chinese people" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國人}} Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.{{sfnb|Zhao|2006|p = [https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf 4, 7–10, 12–14]}} Ming loyalist Han literati held to defining the old Ming borders as China and using "foreigner" to describe minorities under Qing rule such as the Mongols, as part of their anti-Qing ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/6928995/The_Literati_Rewriting_of_China_in_the_Qianlong-Jiaqing_Transition Mosca 2011], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Elliott noted that it was under the Qing that "China" transformed into a definition of referring to lands where the "state claimed sovereignty" rather than only the [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains]] area and its people by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2658945?seq=36 Elliot 2000], p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elena Barabantseva also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as "Chinese" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國之人}}), and used the term ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國}}) as a synonym for the entire Qing empire while using "Han ren" ({{lang|zh-Hant|漢人}}) to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3XFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Barabantseva 2010], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph W. Esherick]] noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the [[Lifan Yuan|Lifanyuan]] and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國}}) and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati [[Wei Yuan]] used Zhongguo only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Esherick 2006], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were even if they didn't understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or understand what the connotations of being Chinese were.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Esherick 2006], p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Nanking]] (1842) English version refers to "His Majesty the Emperor of China" while the Chinese refers both to "The Great Qing Emperor" (''Da Qing Huangdi'') and to Zhongguo as well. The [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (1858) has similar language.&lt;ref name="Zarrow " /&gt;

In the late 19th century the reformer [[Liang Qichao]] argued in a famous passage that "our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties." He argued that the other countries of the world "all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States." &lt;ref&gt;Liang quoted in Joseph Esherick, "How the Qing Became China," in ''Empire to Nation: Historical Perspectives on the Making of the Modern World'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), p. 235, from Liang Qichao, "Zhongguo shi xulun" ''Yinbinshi heji'' 6:3 and in Lydia He Liu, ''The Clash of Empires: The Invention of China in Modern World Making'' (Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]], 2004), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese term "''[[Shina (word)|Shina]]''" was proposed as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for "China". Liang and Chinese revolutionaries, such as [[Sun Yat-sen]], who both lived extensive periods in Japan, used ''Shina'' extensively, and it was used in literature as well as by ordinary Chinese. But with the overthrow of the Qing in 1911, most Chinese dropped ''Shina'' as foreign and demanded that even Japanese replace it with ''Zhonghua minguo'' or simply ''Zhongguo''.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas R.

''China'' (London: Arnold; New York: [[Oxford University Press]]; Inventing the Nation Series, 2001. {{ISBN|0-340-74133-3}}), pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding of the Chinese Republic in 1912, ''Zhongguo'' was also adopted as the abbreviation of ''&lt;u&gt;Zhong&lt;/u&gt;hua min&lt;u&gt;guo&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Endymion Wilkinson, ''Chinese History: A Manual'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, Rev. and enl., 2000 {{ISBN|0-674-00247-4}} ), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qing official Zhang Deyi objected to the western European name "China" and said that China referred to itself as Zhonghua in response to a European who asked why Chinese used the term guizi to refer to all Europeans.&lt;ref name="LIULiu2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Lydia He.

In the 20th century after the [[May Fourth Movement]], educated students began to spread the concept of ''Zhōnghuá'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|中華}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|中华}}), which represented the people, including 56 minority ethnic groups and the [[Han Chinese]], with a single culture identifying themselves as "Chinese". The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China both used the title "Zhōnghuá" in their official names. Thus, "Zhōngguó" became the common name for both governments. [[Overseas Chinese]] are referred to as ''huáqiáo'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|華僑}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|华侨}}), literally "Chinese overseas", or ''huáyì'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|華裔}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|华裔}}), literally "Chinese descendant" (i.e., Chinese children born overseas).

==== Middle Kingdom ====
The English translation of "Zhongguo" as the "Middle Kingdom" entered [[European languages]] through the Portuguese in the 16th century and became popular in the mid 19th century. By the mid 20th century the term was thoroughly entrenched in the English language to reflect the Western view of China as the inwards looking Middle Kingdom, or more accurately the ''Central Kingdom''. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for their name.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Zhongguo was also not commonly used as a name for China until quite recently, nor did it mean the "Middle Kingdom" to the Chinese, or even have the same meaning throughout the course of history.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=191}}

=== Huaxia ===
{{Main article|Huaxia}}

The name ''Huaxia'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|華夏}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|华夏}}; {{zh|p=huáxià}}), generally used as a [[sobriquet]] in Chinese text, is the combination of two words:
* ''Hua'' which means "flowery beauty" (''i.e.'' having beauty of dress and personal adornment {{lang|zh-Hant|有服章之美，謂之華}}).
* ''Xia'' which means greatness or grandeur (''i.e.'' having greatness of social customs/courtesy/polite manners and rites/ceremony {{lang|zh-Hant|有禮儀之大，故稱夏}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-Hant|孔穎達《春秋左傳正義》：「中國有禮儀之大，故稱夏；有服章之美，謂之華。」}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms originally referred to the elegance of the traditional attire of the Han Chinese ({{lang|zh-Hant|漢服}} ''Hànfú'', or simply {{lang|zh-Hant|衣冠}} ''yīguān'', literally ''clothes and headgear'') and the Confucian concept of rituals ({{lang|zh-Hant|禮}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|礼}} ''lǐ'').{{CN|date=November 2018}} In the original sense, Huaxia refers to a confederation of tribes—living along the Yellow River—who were the ancestors of what later became the Han ethnic group in China.{{CN|date=November 2018}} During the Warring States (475–221 BCE), the self-awareness of the Huaxia identity developed and took hold in ancient China.

=== Tianxia and Tianchao ===
{{Main article|Tianxia}}

''Tianxia'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|天下}}}}; {{zh|p=Tiānxià}}) literally means "[[All under heaven|under heaven]]"; and ''Tianchao'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|天朝}}}}) means "Heavenly Dynasty". These terms were usually used in the context of [[civil war]]s or periods of division, in which whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled ''Tianxia'', or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically the term was connected to the later [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1046–256 BCE), especially the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the [[Warring States period]] (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by the [[Qin state]]).

* [[Russian language|Russian]]: Поднебесная (''Podnebésnaya''; lit. "under the heaven")

=== Jiangshan ===
''Jiangshan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|江山}}; {{zh|p=Jiāngshān}}) literally means "Rivers and mountains". This term is quite similar in usage to Tianxia, and simply refers to the entire world, and here the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. Use of this term is also common as part of the phrase "designing rivers and mountains" meaning maintaining and improving government and policy in the world.

=== Jiuzhou ===
{{Main article|Jiuzhou}}

The name ''Jiuzhou'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|九州}}; {{zh|p=jiǔ zhōu}}) means "nine provinces". Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of [[Warring States period]] of China (c. 400–221 BCE).  During that time, the [[Yellow River]] river region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king, [[Yu the Great]], who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign. (Consult [[Zhou (political division)|Zhou]] for more information.)

=== Shenzhou ===
This name means ''Divine Land'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|神州}}; {{zh|p=Shénzhōu}}) and comes from the same period as Jiuzhou. It was thought that the world was divided into nine major states, one of which is Shenzhou, which is in turn divided into nine smaller states, one of which is Jiuzhou mentioned above.

=== Sihai ===
{{Main article|Four Seas}}

This name, ''[[Four Seas]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|四海}}; {{zh|p=sìhǎi|links=no}}), is sometimes used to refer to the world, or simply China, which is perceived as the civilized world. It came from the ancient notion that the world is flat and surrounded by sea.

The name ''Han'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|漢}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|汉}}; {{zh|p=Hàn}}) derives from the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD), who presided over China's first "golden age". The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] periods. During these periods, various non-Chinese ethnic groups invaded from the north and conquered areas of North China, which they held for several centuries. It was during this period that people began to use the term "Han" to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the invaders) were the descendants of the subjects of the [[Han dynasty]].

During the [[Yuan dynasty]] Mongolian rulers divided people into four classes: Mongols, [[Semu]] or "Colour-eyeds", Hans, and "Southerns". Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class "Han" includes all ethnic groups in northern China including [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] who have in most part sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name "Han" became popularly accepted.

During the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the local Chinese from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today the term "Han Persons", often rendered in English as [[Han Chinese]], is used by the People's Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 [[List of Chinese nationalities|officially recognized ethnic groups]] of China. The "Han Chinese" are simply referred to as "Chinese" by some.

The name ''Tang'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:唐|唐]]}}; {{zh|p=Táng}}) comes from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) that presided over China's second golden age. It was during the Tang Dynasty that South China was finally and fully [[Sinicized]]; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as "''Tang ren''" ({{lang|zh|[[wikt:唐人|唐人]]}}, {{zh|p=Tángrén|l=People of Tang}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbDdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=China: A Cultural and Historical Dictionary |first= Michael|last= Dillon |page=132 |isbn=9781136791413 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sinicization and rapid development of [[Guangdong]] during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as ''Tong-yan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:唐人|唐人]]}}) in Cantonese, while China is called ''Tong-saan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:唐山|唐山]]}}; {{zh|p=Tángshān|l=Tang Mountain|links=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZjruI0_XmcC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|author= H. Mark Lai |pages=7&amp;ndash;8 |isbn=9780759104587 |publisher=AltaMira Press |date=4 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chinatown]]s worldwide, often dominated by Southern Chinese, also became referred to ''Tong-yan-gaai'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:唐人街|唐人街]]}}; {{zh|p=Tángrénjiē|l=Tang people street|links=no}}).  The Cantonese term is recorded as ''Tongsan'' in [[Malay language|Old Malay]] as one of the local terms for China, along with the Sanskrit-derived ''Cina''. It is still used in [[Malaysia]] today, usually in a derogatory sense.

Among Taiwanese, ''Tn̂g-soaⁿ'' has been used, for example, in the saying, "has Tangshan father, no Tangshan mother" (有唐山公，無唐山媽; {{zh|poj=Ū Tn̂g-soaⁿ kong, bô Tn̂g-soaⁿ má}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title = The Concise History of Taiwan |edition = Chinese-English bilingual |year = 2007 |publisher = Taiwan Historica |location = Nantou City |ISBN = 9789860109504 |page = 52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span lang="zh-Hant"&gt;{{holodict|60161|e=有唐山公，無唐山媽。}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This refers how the Han people crossing the [[Taiwan Strait]] in the 17th and 18th centuries were mostly men, and that many of their offspring would be through intermarriage with [[Taiwanese aborigine]] women.

In [[Okinawan language|Ryukyuan]], [[Karate]] was originally called ''tii'' (手, hand) or ''karatii'' (唐手, Tang hand) because 唐ぬ國 ''too-nu-kuku'' or ''kara-nu-kuku'' (唐ぬ國) was a common [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] name for China; it was changed to ''karate'' (空手, open hand) to appeal to Japanese people after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

=== Dalu and Neidi ===
''Dàlù'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|大陸}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|大陆}}; {{zh|p=dàlù}}), literally "big continent" or "mainland" in this context, is used as a short form of ''Zhōnggúo Dàlù'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國大陸}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|中国大陆}}, Mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong and [[Macau]], and/or [[Taiwan]]. This term is used in official context in both the mainland and Taiwan, when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term ''Neidi'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|内地}}; {{zh|p=nèidì}}, literally "the inner land"). While ''Neidi'' generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Increasingly, it is also being used in an official context within mainland China, for example in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.

The term ''Neidi'' is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.

The name '''New China''' has been frequently applied to China by the [[Communist Party of China]] as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new socialist state, which eventually became '''Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó''' (see below), known in English as the "People's Republic of China". This term is also sometimes used by writers outside mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the [[Cold War]] as "'''Communist China'''" or "Red China" to distinguish it from the [[Republic of China]] which is commonly called "Taiwan", "Nationalist China" or "Free China". In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, "China" is often used to refer to [[mainland China]] to the exclusion of Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].

The official name of the People's Republic of China in various official languages and scripts:
* [[Simplified Chinese]]: {{lang|zh-Hans|中华人民共和国}} ({{zh |p = Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó }}) – Official language and script, used in mainland China, [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]

In 1912, China adopted its official name, '''Zhōnghuá Mínguó''' (see below), known in English as the "Republic of China", which also has sometimes been referred to as "[[History of the Republic of China|Republican China]]" or "Republican Era" ({{lang|zh-Hant|民國時代}}), in contrast to the [[Qing Dynasty|empire it replaced]], or as "'''[[Nationalist Government|Nationalist China]]'''", after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]). {{lang|zh-Hant|中華}} (''Zhonghua'') is a term that pertains to "China" while {{lang|zh-Hant|民國}} (''mínguó''), literally "people's country", stands for "republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-Hant|《中華民國教育部重編國語辭典修訂本》:「以其位居四方之中，文化美盛，故稱其地為『中華』。」}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson. ''Chinese History: A Manual.'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; With the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of [[Taiwan]] and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply "'''[[Taiwan]]'''", although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. (See [[Taiwan Independence]].) Amid the hostile rhetoric of the [[Cold War]], the government and its supporters sometimes referred to itself as "Free China" or "Liberal China", in contrast to People's Republic of China (which was historically called the "Bandit-occupied Area" ({{lang|zh-Hant|匪區}}) by the ROC). In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, was forced to use the name "'''[[Chinese Taipei]]'''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中華台北}}) whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the [[Olympic Games]].

The official name of the Republic of China in various official languages and scripts:
* English: Republic of China – Official in Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei – official designation in several international organizations ([[International Olympic Committee]], [[FIFA]], [[Miss Universe]], [[World Health Organization]]), Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu –  [[World Trade Organization]], Taiwan – Most commonly used

== Names in non-Chinese records ==
Names used in the rest of Asia, especially [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia, are usually derived directly from words in a [[language of China]]. Those languages belonging to a former dependency (tributary) or Chinese-influenced country have an especially similar pronunciation to that of Chinese. Those used in [[Indo-European languages]], however, have indirect names that came via other routes and bear little resemblance to what is used in China.

English, most [[Indo-European languages]], and many others use various forms of the name "China" and the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] "Sino-" or "Sin-" from the Latin ''Sina''.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed (AHD4).

The traditional etymology, proposed in the 17th century by [[Martin Martini]] and supported by later scholars such as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Berthold Laufer]], is that the word "China" and its related terms are ultimately derived from the polity known as [[Qin (state)|Qin]] that unified China to form the [[Qin Dynasty]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|秦}}}}, [[Old Chinese]]: ''*dzin'') in the 3rd century BC, but existed as a state on the furthest west of China since the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name=yule&gt;{{cite book |author=Yule, Henry |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SAqgAb41ifIC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Cathay and the Way Thither |pages = 2–3 |ISBN = 8120619668 }} "There are reasons however for believing the word {{font|text=China|font=Century Gothic}} was bestowed at a much earlier date, for it occurs in the Laws of Manu, which assert the ''Chinas'' to be degenerate Kshatriyas, and the Mahabharat, compositions many centuries older that imperial dynasty of {{font|text=Ts'in|font=Century Gothic}} ...

The existence of the word ''Cīna''  in ancient Hindu texts was noted by the Sanskrit scholar [[Hermann Jacobi]] who pointed out its use in the Book 2 of ''[[Arthashastra]]'' with reference to silk and woven cloth produced by the country of ''Cīna'', although textual analysis suggests that Book 2 may not have been written long before 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bodde, Derk |editors=Denis Twitchett and Michael Loewe |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A2HKxK5N2sAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = The Cambridge History of China: Volume 1, The Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 BC - AD 220 |pages = 20&amp;ndash;21 |ISBN = 9780521243278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also found in other Sanskrit texts such as the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' and the ''[[Manusmṛti|Laws of Manu]]''.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;Wade, Geoff.

The term "China" can also be used to refer to:
* the modern states known as the People's Republic of China (PRC) and (before the 1970s) the Republic of China (ROC)
* "Mainland China" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國大陸}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|中国大陆}}, ''Zhōngguó Dàlù'' in Mandarin), which is the territory of the PRC minus the two [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]]s of Hong Kong and [[Macau]];
* "[[China proper]]", a term used to refer to the historical heartlands of China without peripheral areas like [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], and [[Xinjiang]]

In economic contexts, "[[Greater China]]" ({{lang|zh-Hant|大中華地區}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|大中华地区}}, ''dà Zhōnghuá dìqū'') is intended to be a neutral and non-political way to refer to [[Mainland China]], Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]].

[[Sinologist]]s usually use "Chinese" in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of ''Zhongguo'', to the [[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the [[overseas Chinese]].

[[File:CEM-11-Chinae-nova-descriptio-2521.jpg|thumb|[[Luiz Jorge de Barbuda|Barbuda]]'s 1584 map, also published by Ortelius, already applies the name ''China'' to the entire country. However, for another century many European maps continued to show ''Cathay'' as well, usually somewhere north of the [[Great Wall]]]]

===Seres, Ser, Serica===
{{Main article|Serica}}

''Sēres'' (Σῆρες) was the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin|Roman]] name for the northwestern part of China and its inhabitants. It meant "of silk," or "land where silk comes from." The name is thought to derive from the Chinese word for silk, "''sī''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|絲}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|丝}}). It is itself at the origin of the [[Latin]] for silk, "''sērica''".  See the main article [[Serica]] for more details.

* [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Σῆρες ''[[Seres]]'', Σηρικός ''Serikos''
* [[Latin]]: ''Serica''

This may be a [[back formation]] from ''sērikos'' (''σηρικός''), "made of silk", from ''sēr'' (''σήρ''), "silkworm", in which case ''Sēres'' is "the land where silk comes from."

{{anchor|Sinae|Sin|Sinæ}}

=== Sinae, Sin {{anchor|Sino-}}===
[[File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|250px|A mid-15th century map based on Ptolemy's manuscript [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]].  Serica and Sina are marked as separate countries (top right and right respectively).]]

''Sīnae'' was an ancient Greek and Roman name for some people who dwelt south of the [[Seres]] (Serica) in the eastern extremity of the inhabitable world. References to the Sinae include mention of a city that the Romans called ''Sēra Mētropolis'', which may be modern [[Chang'an]]. The Latin prefixes ''Sino-'' and ''Sin-'', which are traditionally used to refer to China and the Chinese, came from ''Sīnae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sino- |title=Sino- |work= Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally thought that ''Chīna'', ''Sīna'' and ''Thīna'' are variants that ultimately derived from Qin, which was the westernmost state in China that eventually formed the Qin Dynasty.&lt;ref name="middle kingdom" /&gt; There are however other opinions on its etymology (See section on China above). [[Henry Yule]] thought that this term may have come to Europe through the Arabs, who made the China of the farther east into ''Sin'', and perhaps sometimes into ''Thin''.&lt;ref name="yule2"&gt;{{cite book |author = Yule, Henry |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SgcVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Cathay and the Way Thither, Volume 1 |page = xxxvii |ISBN = 8120619668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ''Thin'' of the author of the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], who appears to be the first extant writer to employ the name in this form; hence also the Sinæ and Thinae of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name="yule" /&gt;&lt;ref name="middle kingdom" /&gt;

Some denied that Ptolemy's Sinae really represented the Chinese as [[Ptolemy]] called the country ''Sērice'' and the capital ''Sēra'', but regarded them as distinct from ''Sīnae''.&lt;ref name="middle kingdom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Yule, Henry |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SgcVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Cathay and the Way Thither, Volume 1 |page= xl |ISBN = 8120619668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marcian of Heraclea]] (a condenser of Ptolemy) tells us that the "nations of the Sinae lie at the extremity of the habitable world, and adjoin the eastern [[Terra incognita]]". The 6th century [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] refers to a "country of silk" called ''Tzinista'', which is understood as referring to China, beyond which "there is neither navigation nor any land to inhabit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962 |title=The World According to Cosmas Indicopleustes – Concepts and Illustrations of an Alexandrian Merchant and Monk |author=Stefan Faller |journal = Transcultural Studies |volume=1 |pages= 193–232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems probable that the same region is meant by both. According to [[Henry Yule]], Ptolemy's misrendering of the [[Indian Sea]] as a closed basin meant that Ptolemy must also have misplaced the Chinese coast, leading to the misconception of Serica and Sina as separate countries.&lt;ref name="yule2"/&gt;

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], there is a mention of a faraway country [[Sinim]] in the [[Book of Isaiah]]  49:12 which some had assumed to be a reference to China.&lt;ref name="middle kingdom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionarybible03smit#page/1328/mode/2up |title= Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Bible|editors= Sir William Smith, John Mee Fuller |page=1328 |year= 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Genesis 10:17, a tribes called the [[Sinite]]s were said to be the descendants of [[Canaan]], the son of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], but they are usually considered to be a different people, probably from the northern part of [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://archive.org/stream/cyclopediaofbibl02kitt#page/772/mode/2up |title=A cyclopædia of biblical literature|editor = John Kitto |page=773 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://archive.org/stream/dictionarybible03smit#page/1322/mode/2up |title= Encyclopaedic dictionary of the Bible |editors= Sir William Smith, John Mee Fuller |page=1323 |year= 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cathay ===
{{Main article|Cathay}}

This group of names derives from [[Khitan people|Khitan]], an ethnic group that originated in [[Manchuria]] and conquered parts of Northern China early tenth century forming the [[Liao dynasty]], and later in the twelfth century dominated Central Asia as the [[Kara Khitan]] Khanate. Due to long period of domination of Northern China and then Central Asia by these nomadic conquerors, the name Khitan become associated with China to the people in and around the northwestern region.  Muslim historians referred to the Kara Khitan state as ''Khitay'' or ''Khitai''; they may have adopted this form of "Khitan" via the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of [[Kingdom of Qocho|Kocho]] in whose language the final -n or -ń became -y.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Sinor |first = D. |chapter = Chapter 11 – The Kitan and the Kara Kitay |year = 1998 |title = History of Civilisations of Central Asia |editor1-last = Asimov |editor1-first = M.S. |editor2-last = Bosworth |editor2-first = C.E. |volume = 4 part I |publisher = UNESCO Publishing |ISBN = 92-3-103467-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was then introduced to medieval and early modern Europe through Islamic and Russian sources.&lt;ref name="millward" /&gt; In English and in several other European languages, the name "Cathay" was used in the translations of the adventures of [[Marco Polo]], which used this word for northern China.  Words related to Khitay are still used in many [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Slavic languages]] to refer to China. However, its use by Turkic speakers within China, such as the [[Uyghurs]], is considered pejorative by the Chinese authority who tried to ban it.&lt;ref name="millward"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XuvqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |editor=S.F.Starr |authors = James A.

There is no evidence that either in the 13th or 14th century, Cathayans, ''i.e.'' Chinese, travelled officially to Europe, but it is possible that some did, in unofficial capacities, at least in the 13th century. During the campaigns of [[Hulagu]] (the grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]) in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] (1256–65), and the reigns of his successors, Chinese [[engineer]]s were employed on the banks of the [[Tigris]], and Chinese [[astrologer]]s and physicians could be consulted. Many [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] communications passed between the Hulaguid [[Ilkhan]]s and Christian princes. The former, as the great khan's liegemen, still received from him their [[seal (device)|seals]] of state; and two of their letters which survive in the archives of France exhibit the vermilion impressions of those seals in [[Chinese character]]s—perhaps affording the earliest specimen of those characters to reach western Europe.

=== Tabgach ===
"[[Tabgach]]" came from the metatheses of "[[Tuoba]]" (''*t'akbat''), a dominant tribe of the [[Xianbei]], and the surname of the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in the 5th century before sinicisation. It referred to Northern China, which was dominated by half-Xianbei, half-Chinese people.

* [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]]: ''Taugats''
* [[Old Turkic language|Orhon Kok-Turk]]: ''Tabgach'' (variations ''Tamgach'')

=== Nikan ===
''Nikan'' ([[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠨᡳᡴᠠᠨ}}, means"Han ethnicity")  was a Manchu ethnonym of unknown origin that referred specifically to the ethnic group known in English as the [[Han Chinese]]; the stem of this word was also conjugated as a verb, ''nikara(-mbi)'', and used to mean "to speak the [[Chinese language]]." Since ''Nikan'' was essentially an [[ethnonym]] and referred to a group of people (i.e., a [[nation]]) rather than to a political body (i.e., a [[Sovereign state|state]]), the correct translation of "China" into the Manchu language is ''Nikan gurun'', literally the "Nikan state" or "country of the Nikans" (i.e., country of the Hans).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} &lt;!-- cf Pamela Crossley, [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~crossley/comments_1.html Note on Nikan] --&gt;

This exonym for the Han Chinese is also used in the [[Daur language]], in which it appears as ''Niaken'' ({{IPA|[njakən]}} or {{IPA|[ɲakən]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Martin, ''Dagur Mongolian Grammar, Texts, and Lexicon'', Indiana University Publications Uralic and Altaic Series, Vol. 4, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word ''Niaken'' is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., "China" in a cultural sense) is ''Niaken gurun'', while ''niakendaaci-'' is a verb meaning "to talk in Chinese."

===Kara===
Japanese: ''Kara'' ({{lang|ja|から}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|唐}} or {{lang|ja|漢}}). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as [[Korea]], and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word "Kara" referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a [[metonymy|metonymic]] extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]].

The Japanese word ''[[karate]]'' ({{lang|ja|空手}}, lit. "empty hand") is derived from the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]] word ''karatii'' ({{lang|ja|唐手}}, lit. "Tang/Chinese hand") and refers to Okinawan [[martial arts]]; the character for ''kara'' was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.

=== Morokoshi ===
Japanese: ''Morokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|もろこし}}; variously written in [[kanji]] as {{lang|ja|唐}} or {{lang|ja|唐土}}). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading of the Chinese compound {{lang|zh-Hant|諸越}} ''Zhūyuè'' or {{lang|zh-Hant|百越}}
[[Baiyue|Bǎiyuè]] as "all the Yue" or "the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue," which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.

The Japanese common noun ''tōmorokoshi'' ({{lang|ja|トウモロコシ, 玉蜀黍}}), which refers to [[maize]], appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although ''tōmorokoshi'' is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean "jade [[Shu (state)|Shu]] [[proso millet|millet]]," the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to "[[names of China#Tang|Tang]] morokoshi," in which "morokoshi" was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for [[sorghum]], which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.

===Mangi===
From Chinese ''Manzi'' (southern barbarians). The division of [[North China and South China]] under the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han Chinese to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called [[#Cathay|Cathay]], Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese "Nangkiyas" or "Nangkiyad", and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word "Manzi" also reached the Western world as "Mangi" (as used by Marco Polo), also in Persian as ''Machin'' {{lang|fa|ماچين}} and Arabic as ''Māṣīn'' {{lang|ar|ماصين}}.  The name is also commonly found on medieval maps. However, the Chinese themselves considered "Manzi" to be  derogatory and never used it as a self appellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Cathay and the Way Thither: Preliminary essay on the intercourse between China and the western nations previous to the discovery of the Cape route |page =177 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4XAQAAMAAJ |author= Henry Yule, Henri Cordier |year= 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dynastic China: An Elementary History|author= Tan Koon San |page=247 |publisher=The Other Press|isbn=9789839541885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Monument to the Forefathers''', formerly known as the '''''Pilgrim Monument''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Massachusetts of To-day
|first= Daniel P. |last=Toomey |year=1892 |publisher=Columbia publishing company |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; commemorates the ''[[Mayflower]]'' [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].  Dedicated on August 1, 1889, it honors their ideals as later generally embraced by the [[United States]]. It is thought to be the world's largest solid granite monument.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Planning and Engineering, Resource Management Planning Program, September 2006. "[http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/stewardship/rmp/rmpforefathers.pdf Resource Management Plan: National Monument to the Forefathers, Plymouth, Massachusetts]", p 1. Accessed 8 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Located at 72 Allerton Street in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], the {{convert|81|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} monument was commissioned by the Pilgrim Society.  The original concept dates to around 1820, with actual planning beginning in 1850. The cornerstone was laid August 2, 1859 by the Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts, under the direction of Grand Master John T. Heard. The monument was completed in October 1888, and was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on August 1, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.plymouthguide.com/monument.html| title=Forefathers Monument| author=Plymouth Guide| accessdate=May 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060511222601/http://www.plymouthguide.com/monument.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammatt Billings, Boston architect, illustrator and sculptor, originally conceived the monument as a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} structure comparable to the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]. Shortly before his death in 1874, Billings reduced the size of the monument, which was to be made entirely of [[granite]] quarried in [[Hallowell, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kjonline.com/news/Hallowell-to-celebrate-a-long-forgotten-past-Saturday-.html | title=Hallowell to Celebrate a Long Forgotten Past Saturday| author=Michael Shepherd| accessdate=July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was then passed to Billings' brother Joseph who, along with other sculptors including [[Alexander Doyle]], [[Carl Conrads]], and James Mahoney, reworked the design, although the basic components remained. The monument, which faces northeast to Plymouth Harbor (and, roughly, towards Plymouth, England), sits in the center of a circular drive, which is accessed from Allerton Street from the east.  The plan of the principal pedestal is [[octagon]]al, with four small, and four large faces; from the small faces project four [[buttress]]es. On the main pedestal stands the heroic figure of "Faith" with her right hand pointing toward heaven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=S508Q49160860.415&amp;profile=ariall&amp;uri=link=3100009~!1466888~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;term=National+Monument+to+the+Forefathers,&amp;index=ALTIT|title=National Monument to the Forefathers|first1=Hammatt|last1=Billings|first2=Joseph|last2=Billings|first3=William|last3=Rimmer|first4=John D.|last4=Perry|first5=Alexander|last5=Doyle|first6=Karl|last6=Conrad|first7=James H.|last7=Mahoney|date=24 October 2017|publisher=|via=siris-artinventories.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her left hand clutching the Bible. Upon the four buttresses also are seated figures emblematical of the principles upon which the Pilgrims founded their Commonwealth; counter-clockwise from the east are Morality, Law, Education, and Liberty. Each was carved from a solid block of granite, posed in the sitting position upon chairs with a [[Alto-relievo|high relief]] on either side of minor characteristics.  Under "Morality" stand "Prophet" and "Evangelist"; under "Law" stand "Justice" and "Mercy"; under "Education" are "Youth" and "Wisdom"; and under "Liberty" stand "Tyranny Overthrown" and "Peace".  On the face of the buttresses, beneath these figures are high reliefs in [[marble]], representing scenes from Pilgrim history.  Under "Morality" is "Embarcation"; under "Law" is "Treaty"; under "Education" is "Compact"; and under "Freedom" is "Landing".   Upon the four faces of the main pedestal are large panels for records. The front panel is inscribed as follows: ''"National Monument to the Forefathers. Erected by a grateful people in remembrance of their labors, sacrifices and sufferings for the cause of civil and religious liberty."''  The right and left panels contain the names of those who came over in the ''Mayflower''. The rear panel, which was not engraved until recently, contains a quote from [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|Governor William Bradford]]'s famous history, ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]'': 
:''"Thus out of small beginnings greater things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing and gives being to all things that are; and as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation; let the glorious name of Jehovah have all praise."''

The overall scheme was designed by architect [[Hammatt Billings]]. The 36-foot figure of ''Faith'' was based on a 9-foot plaster model by [[William Rimmer]] in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Craven et al, ‘’200 Years of American Sculpture’’, David R. Godine, Publisher in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1976 p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; that was enlarged and altered by [[Joseph Edward Billings]] and a sculptor named Perry (probably John D. Perry). The subsidiary statues were executed by area sculptors including [[Alexander Doyle]], [[Carl Conrads]], and James H. Mahoney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Gorman|first=James F.|date=September 1995|title=The Colossus of Plymouth: Hammatt Billings's National Monument to the Forefathers|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|publisher=University of California Press|volume=54|issue=3|pages=278–301|jstor=990993|doi=10.2307/990993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Register==
The monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on August 30, 1974.  Originally under the care of the Pilgrim Society, it was given to  the [[Massachusetts]] government in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/rmp/rmp-forefathers.htm|title=Resource Management Plan, National Monument to the Forefathers|author=[[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]]|accessdate=May 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133531/http://mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/rmp/rmp-forefathers.htm|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It and [[Plymouth Rock]] constitute the [[Pilgrim Memorial State Park]].  Although intended as national in scope, the Forefathers Monument is not a federal "[[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]" as understood today from the [[Antiquities Act|Antiquities Act of 1906]].

==''Monumental'' movie==
In 2012, [[Kirk Cameron]] released the movie ''[[Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure|Monumental]]'' which features the monument and Cameron's interpretation of its history and the values of those it commemorates.&lt;ref name="misoant20120328"&gt;{{Citation

The Normalization process model is a sociological model developed by Carl R May that explains technologies in health care. The model provides framework for process evaluation using three components, actors, objects, and contexts, that are compared across four constructs, Interactional workability, relational integration, skill-set workability, and contextual integration. This model help build the Nomalization Process Theory.

== Development ==

The '''normalization process model''' is a [[theory]] that explains how new technologies are embedded in health care work.&lt;ref&gt;May, C. 2006. "A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care." BMC Health Services Research 6: 1-11.[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/6/86].&lt;/ref&gt; The model was developed by [[Carl R May]] and co-workers,&lt;ref&gt;Finch, T. L., F. S. Mair, and C. R. May. 2007. "Teledermatology in the UK: lessons in service innovation." British Journal of Dermatology 156: 521-527; May, C., M. Mort, T. Williams, F.S. Mair, and L. Gask. 2003a. "Health Technology Assessment in its local contexts: studies of telehealthcare." Social Science and Medicine 57: 697-710; May, C.R., R. Harrison, T. Finch, A. MacFarlane, F.S. Mair, and P. Wallace. 2003b. "Understanding the normalization of telemedicine services through qualitative evaluation." Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 10: 596-604.&lt;/ref&gt; and is an empirically derived [[grounded theory]] in [[medical sociology]] and [[science and technology studies]] (STS), based on [[qualitative methods]]. Carl May developed the model after he appeared as a witness at a [[British House of Commons]] Health Committee Inquiry on New Medical Technologies in the NHS in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Health Committee. (2005) Inquiry on New Medical Technologies in the NHS. [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/398/39802.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked how new technologies became routinely embedded, and taken-for-granted, in everyday work, in view of the increasing corporate [[organization]] and [[regulation]] of [[healthcare]].&lt;ref&gt;May, C. 2007. "The clinical encounter and the problem of context." Sociology 41: 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The model explains embedding by looking at the work that people do to make it possible.

The model is a theory in sociology that fits well with macro approaches to [[innovation]] like the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory developed by [[Everett Rogers]]. Although the normalization process model is limited in scope to [[healthcare]] settings&lt;ref&gt;May C, T Finch, FS Mair, L Ballini, C Dowrick, et al. 2007a. "Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the Normalization Process Model." BMC Health Services Research [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/7/148]&lt;/ref&gt; recent work by May and colleagues has led to the development of [[normalization process theory]], which presents a general sociological theory of implementation and integration of technological and organizational innovations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. In Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Innovation and Implementation in Health Technology: Normalizing Telemedicine. In: J. Gabe, M. Calnan, Eds.), The New Sociology of the Health Service. Routledge, London, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Mundane Medicine, Therapeutic Relationships, and the Clinical Encounter.’ In  (eds.) In: B. Pescosolido, et al., Eds.), Handbook of the Sociology of Health, Illness, and Healing: A Blueprint for the 21st Century. Springer, New York, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization process theory has now superseded the more limited normalization process model.

The normalization process model provides a framework for process evaluation and also for comparative studies of complex interventions, especially of [[randomized controlled trials]]. Clinical trials and other evaluations of healthcare interventions often focus on the complex relationships  between actors, objects and contexts, making a simple explanatory model, that fits well with other frameworks a necessary tool for clinical and health service researchers. In the normalization process model, a complex intervention is defined as a deliberately initiated attempt to introduce new, or modify existing, patterns of collective action in health care.

=== Components ===

A complex intervention has three kinds of components:&lt;ref&gt;May, C, FS Mair, C Dowrick, and T. 2007b. "Process evaluation of complex interventions in primary care: understanding trials using the normalization process model." BMC Family Practice 8&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Actors''' are the individuals and groups that encounter each other in health care settings. They can include physicians, other health professionals, managers, patients, and family members.  The aims of interventions aimed at actors are often to change people's behaviour and its intended outcomes. 
# '''Objects''' are the institutionally sanctioned means by which knowledge and practice are enacted. They can include procedures, protocols, hardware, and software The aims of interventions aimed at objects often include changing people's expertise and actions. 
# '''Contexts''' are the physical, organisational, institutional, and legislative structures that enable and constrain, and resource and realize, people and procedures. The aims of interventions aimed at contexts are often to change the ways that people organize their work to achieve goals in health care (or other) services.

==== Constructs ====

The normalization process model explains the embedding  of complex interventions by reference to four constructs of collective action that are demonstrated to promote or inhibit the operationalization and embedding of complex interventions (interactional workability, relational integration, skill-set workability, and contextual integration)in a rigorous and sound theory.&lt;ref&gt;May C, T Finch, FS Mair, L Ballini, C Dowrick, et al. 2007a. "Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the Normalization Process Model." BMC Health Services Research [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/7/148]&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Interactional workability:'''  This describes how a complex intervention is operationalized by the people using it. A complex intervention will affect co-operative [[interactions]] over work (its congruence), and the normal pattern of outcomes of this work (its disposal). Therefore: a complex intervention is disposed to normalization if it confers an interactional advantage in flexibly accomplishing congruence and disposal of work.
# '''Relational integration:''' This describes how knowledge and work is mediated and understood within the [[social networks]] of people around it. A complex intervention will affect not only the knowledge required by its users (its accountability), but also the ways that they understand the actions of people around them (its confidence). Therefore: a complex intervention is disposed to normalization if it equals or improves accountability and confidence within networks. 
# '''Skill-set workability:''' This describes the distribution and conduct of work in a [[division of labor]]. A complex intervention will affect the ways that work is defined and distributed (its allocation), and the ways in which it is undertaken and evaluated (its performance). Therefore: a complex intervention is disposed to normalization if is calibrated to an agreed skill-set at a recognizable location in the division of labor.
# '''Contextual integration:''' This refers to the incorporation of work within an [[organization]]al setting. A complex intervention will affect the mechanisms that link work to existing structures and procedures (its execution), and for allocating and organizing resources for them (its realization). Therefore: a complex intervention is disposed to normalization if it confers an advantage on an organization in flexibly executing and realizing work.

Possession of [[Torah|Jewish scriptures]] was made a capital offense.

In the [[Middle Ages]] [[antisemitism in Europe]] was [[Religious antisemitism|religious]]. Although not part of [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]], many Christians, including members of the [[clergy]], held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing [[Jesus]]. As stated in the ''[[Boston College]] Guide to Passion Plays'', "Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of [[Jewish deicide|deicide]], or "god-killing". For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in [[Europe]] and [[Americas|America]]."&lt;ref name=Paley&gt;Paley, Susan, and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds.

During the [[High Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]] there was full-scale persecution in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]]. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries.  The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) flourishing communities on the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] and the [[Danube River|Danube]] were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the [[Rhineland massacres]]. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in [[France]] were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]]. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including in 1290, [[Edict of Expulsion|the banishing of all English Jews]]; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and, in 1421 thousands were expelled from [[Austria]]. Many of the expelled Jews fled to [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |title=Why the Jews? – Black Death |publisher=Holocaustcenterpgh.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429065613/http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the [[Black Death persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by [[papal bull]] on July 6, 1348 - with another following later in 1348 - several months afterwards, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burnt alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de Histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p.47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study finds that Jewish persecutions and expulsions increased with negative economic shocks and climactic variations in Europe over the period 1100-1600.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jewish Persecutions and Weather Shocks: 1100-1800|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12331/abstract|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1468-0297|pages = n/an/a|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12331|language = en|first = Robert Warren|last = Anderson|first2 = Noel D.|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Mark|last3 = Koyama}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600:
* (1) there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century;
* (2) improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks;
* (3) the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities;
* (4) there were fewer negative temperature shocks.
* (5) the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced antisemitic attitudes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.  Until the 1840s, they were required to regularly attend sermons urging their conversion to Christianity.  Only Jews were taxed to support state [[boarding school]]s for Jewish converts to Christianity.  It was illegal to convert from Christianity to Judaism.  Sometimes Jews were baptized involuntarily, and, even when such baptisms were illegal, forced to practice the Christian religion.  In many such cases, the state separated them from their families, of which the [[Edgardo Mortara]] account is one of the most widely publicized instances of acrimony between Catholics and Jews in the Papal States in the second half of the 19th century.

[[File:Banu Qurayza.png|thumb|200px|The [[Banu Qurayza|massacre of the Jewish Banu Qurayza]] in Arabia.]]
According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of [[Islam]], the first encounters between [[Muslim]]s and Jews resulted in friendship when the Jews of [[Medina]] gave [[Muhammad]] refuge. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided the Meccan Pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Mark R. ''Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1994, p. 163. {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Jews living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religion and administer their internal affairs but were subjects to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]] (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00807-8}} pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp.10,20&lt;/ref&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), p. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the [[Qur'an]] did not allow Muslims to force Jews to wear distinctive clothing. [[Obadiah the Proselyte]] reported in 1100 AD, that the [[Caliph]] had created this rule himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Scheiber|Scheiber, A.]] "The Origins of Obadiah, the Norman Proselyte" ''Journal of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford), Vol. 5, 1954, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment toward Jews perceived as having attained too lofty a position in Islamic society also fueled antisemitism and massacres. In [[Moorish Spain]], ibn Hazm and [[Abu Ishaq]] focused their anti-Jewish writings on this allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the [[1066 Granada massacre]], when "[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day",&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist–Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714-ff.

The [[Damascus affair]] occurred in 1840 when a French [[monk]] and his servant disappeared in [[Damascus]]. Immediately following, a charge of [[ritual murder]] was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured. The consuls of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] as well as [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan: ''The Damascus Affair: 'Ritual Murder', Politics, and the Jews in 1840'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0-521-48396-4}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the Damascus affair, [[Pogroms]] spread through the Middle East and North Africa. Pogroms occurred in: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jerusalem (1847), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–07), Port Said (1903, 1908), Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891), Istanbul (1870, 1874), Buyukdere (1864), Kuzguncuk (1866), Eyub (1868), Edirne (1872), Izmir (1872, 1874).&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Bodansky.

There was a massacre of Jews in [[Baghdad]] in 1828.&lt;ref name="Morris10"/&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern [[Persia]]n city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]], burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. This is known as the [[Allahdad incident]]. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted.&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patai |first=Raphael |title=Jadid al-Islam: The Jewish "New Muslims" of Meshhed |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1997 |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8143-2652-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]]. Tensions over the [[Western Wall]] in Jerusalem led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ovendale |first=Ritchie |title=The Origins of the Arab–Israeli Wars |year=2004 |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |isbn=0-58282320-X |pages=g.71 |chapter=The "Wailing Wall" Riots |quote=The Mufti tried to establish Muslim rights and the Jews were deliberately antagonized by building works and noise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[1929 Hebron massacre|main victims]] were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron which came to an end.

In 1941, following [[Rashid Ali]]'s pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] coup, riots known as the ''[[Farhud]]'' broke out in [[Baghdad]] in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001).

During the [[Holocaust]], the [[Middle East]] was in turmoil. Britain prohibited Jewish immigration to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In [[Cairo]] the Jewish [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (also known as the Stern Gang) assassinated [[Lord Moyne]] in 1944 fighting as part of its campaign against British closure of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to Jewish immigration, complicating British-Arab-Jewish relations. While the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] were fighting for the [[oil]]-rich region, the Mufti of Jerusalem [[Amin al-Husayni]] staged a pro-Nazi coup in [[Iraq]] and organized the [[Farhud]] pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|war with Israel in 1948]], were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951. The coup failed and the mufti fled to [[Berlin]], where he actively supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. In [[Egypt]], with a Jewish population of about 75,000, young [[Anwar Sadat]] was imprisoned for conspiring with the Nazis and promised them that "no British soldier would leave Egypt alive" (see [[Military history of Egypt during World War II]]) leaving the Jews of that region defenseless. In the French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territories of [[Algeria]] and [[Syria]] plans had been drawn up for the liquidation of their Jewish populations were the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] powers to triumph.

The tensions of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] were also a factor in the rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as [[Jewish refugees|refugees]], the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four [[Syrian Jewish]] girls were discovered by border police in a cave in the [[Zabdani Mountains]] northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee from Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girl’s bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S. (1989).

The persecution of Jews reached its most destructive form in the policies of [[Nazi Germany]], which made the destruction of the Jews a priority, culminating in the killing of approximately 6,000,000 Jews during [[the Holocaust]] from 1941 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Dawidowicz|Dawidowicz, Lucy]]. ''The War Against the Jews'', Bantam, 1986.p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the [[Einsatzgruppen]], to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews in territory that they conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the [[Final Solution]], the [[genocide]] of the Jews of [[Europe]], and to increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing [[extermination camps]] specifically to kill Jews as well as other undesirables such as people who openly opposed Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Manvell, Roger ''Goering'' New York:1972 Ballantine Books – War Leader Book #8 Ballantine's Illustrated History of the Violent Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6724481.stm |title=Ukrainian mass Jewish grave found |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded [[ghettos]] were transported (often by train) to [[extermination camps|death camps]], where some were herded into a specific location (often a [[gas chamber]]), then killed with either gassing or shooting. Other prisoners simply committed suicide, unable to go on after witnessing the horrors of camp life.  Afterward, their bodies were often searched for any valuable or useful materials, such as [[gold]] fillings or [[hair]], and their remains were then buried in mass graves or burned. Others were interned in the camps where they were given little food and disease was common.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum103&gt;Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know," United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Escapes from the camps were few, but not unknown. The few [[Auschwitz]] escapes that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground inside the camp and local people outside.&lt;ref name=Linn20&gt;[[Ruth Linn|Linn, Ruth]]. ''Escaping Auschwitz. A culture of forgetting'', Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the Auschwitz commandant reported that "the local population is fanatically Polish and … prepared to take any action against the hated [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] camp personnel. Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of a first Polish farmstead."&lt;ref name=Swiebocki505&gt;Swiebocki, Henryk.

===Czarist Russia===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Russian Empire}}
For much of the 19th century, [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], which included much of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Baltic states]], contained the world's largest Jewish population. From [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]'s reign until the end of [[Tsar]]ist rule in Russia, many Jews were often restricted to the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] and they were also banned from many jobs and locations.  Jews were subject to racist laws, such as the [[May Laws]], and they were also targeted in hundreds of violent anti-Jewish riots, called [[pogrom]]s, which received unofficial state support. It was during this period that a hoax document alleging a global Jewish [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was created.

The Czarist government implemented programs which ensured that the Jews would remain isolated. However, the government tolerated their religious and national institutions as well as their right to emigrate. The restrictions and discriminatory laws drove many Russian Jews to embrace [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] causes. However, following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] many politically active Jews forfeited their Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-jews-in-the-soviet-union-since-1917--by-nora-levin--the-jews-of-the-soviet-union--by-benjamin-pinkus-7646nska4.html |title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, by Nora Levin; The Jews of the Soviet Union, by Benjamin Pinkus |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Leon Trotsky]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jews] considered themselves neither Jews nor Russians but socialists. To them, Jews were not a nation but a class of exploiters whose fate it was to dissolve and assimilate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the aftermath of Czarist Russia, Jews found themselves in a tragic predicament. Conservative Russians saw them as a disloyal and subversive element and the radicals viewed the Jews as a doomed social class.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917, Nora Levin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{main|Antisemitism in the Soviet Union}}
Even though many of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot [[Judaism]] and [[Zionism]] and established the ''[[Yevsektsiya]]'' in order to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s, the [[Communist]] leadership of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, with the exception of a few [[tokenism|token]] [[synagogue]]s. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informants{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

The campaign of 1948–1953 against so-called "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]s," the alleged "[[Doctors' plot]]," the rise of "[[Zionology]]" and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the [[Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public]] were officially carried out under the banner of "[[anti-Zionism]],", and by the mid-1950s the state persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major [[human rights]] issue in the West as well as domestically.

==Apartheid South Africa==
{{Main|Antisemitism in South Africa}}
During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party leaders and wide sections of the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner people]] came strongly under the influence of the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the [[British Empire]] in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html|title=The Rise of the South African Reich - Chapter 4|date=15 July 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of D F Malan closely associated itself with the policies of the Nazis. Jewish immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] was controlled under the Aliens Act and it soon came to an end during this period. Although Jews were accorded status as Europeans, they were not accepted into white society. The Kelvin Grove sports club, for example, had an exclusive Europeans Only and No Jews policy until recent times. Some 11 such sports clubs had similar policies. Many Jews lived in mixed race areas such as District Six, from where they were forcibly removed in order to make way for a whites-only development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1936, [[Hendrick Verwoerd]] joined a deputation of six professors who were protesting against the admission to South Africa of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. Following the demands of the Nationalist Party, Eric Louw, later Foreign Minister, introduced another anti-Semitic bill that strongly resembled Nazi legislation - the Aliens Amendment and Immigration Bill of 1939. His bill was a means of suppressing all Jews. This bill suggested that Jews threatened to overpower [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the business world, that they were innately cunning and manipulative and that they were also a danger to society. To support his claim, Louw maintained that Jews were involved in the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] and therefore intended to spread [[Communism]] worldwide. This bill defined Jews as anyone with parents who were at least partly Jewish regardless of actual religious faith or practices." &lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Lee Jamison, The Nazi Influence in the Formation of Apartheid in South Africa, Concord Review
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization with which the Nationalists found much in common during the thirties was the 'South African Gentile National Socialist Movement', headed by [[Johannes von Strauss von Moltke]], whose objective was to combat and destroy the alleged 'perversive influence of the Jews in [[economics]], [[culture]], [[religion]], [[ethics]], and [[Power (international relations)|statecraft]] and to re-establish European [[Aryan race|Aryan]] control in South Africa for the welfare of the Christian peoples of South Africa'.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

During the 1960s, [[Oswald Mosley]], the British fascist leader, was a frequent visitor to South Africa, where he was received by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. At one time, Mosley had two functioning branches of his organization in South Africa, and one of his supporters, Derek Alexander, was stationed in [[Johannesburg]] as his main agent.

Upon Verwoerd's [[assassination]] in 1966, [[BJ Vorster]] was elected by the National Party to replace him. While Vorster had been a supporter of Hitler during WWII, his policy towards Jews in his own country, however, can best be described as ambivalent.
 
The 1980s saw the rise of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups such as the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] under [[Eugene Terreblanche]]. The AWB modeled itself after Hitler's National Socialist Party replete with fascist regalia and an emblem resembling the [[swastika]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

{{Politics of Canada}}

The '''political culture of Canada'''  is in some ways part of a greater North American and European political culture, which emphasizes [[constitutional law]], [[freedom of religion]], [[personal liberty]], and [[regional autonomy]]; these ideas stemming in various degrees from the British [[common law]] and French [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions, North American [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|aboriginal]] [[government]], and [[Fundamental Laws of England|English civic traditions]], among others.

Canada has a tradition of [[liberalism in Canada|liberalism]] in the [[centrist]] context, as [[Left–right political spectrum|far-right and far-left politics]] have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Ambrose, Cas Mudde (2015).

==Political cleavages==
Canadian political parties and leaders can be analyzed based on various positions.

=== Economy ===
In the 19th century, the Liberal Party stood for British [[classical liberalism]] and free trade, and the Conservatives, especially the Red Tories, for protectionism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the 20th century, however, the Liberal Party adopted more elements of European [[Social liberalism|reform liberalism]] and co-opted elements of the social-democratic [[Progressive Party of Canada]], and [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In the 1990s, the Liberals shifted back to a more [[neoliberal]] position on the economy and trade.  Within the [[Reform Party of Canada]] there was an element of anti-market [[populism]] but this faded as the Reform Party became more associated with US-style [[conservatism]]. The NDP have retained many of the socialist tendencies of the former CCF.

=== Federal provincial relations ===
In regard to federal-provincial relations it can be said that BQ are [[separatist]], the Conservatives [[decentralist]], the Liberals [[centralist]], and the NDP supporters of [[asymmetric federalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Québec's Voice and a Choice for a Different Canada (section 4 on "Asymmetric Federalism", pages 5-6)
| url = http://www.pierreducasse.ca/IMG/pdf/Declaration_Sherbrooke_ENG_V2.pdf
| date = 2005
| accessdate = 12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversity ===
With regards to issues of diversity ([[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingualism]] and [[multiculturalism]]), the Conservatives tend to be more majoritarian, favouring a reduced scope for official bilingualism and a more [[assimilationist]] approach to immigrants and Native peoples. The Liberals and NDP are more [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] including generous government support for minority cultures, while the BQ favour viewing Canada as two separate societies (English Canada and Quebec), and advocate strong protections for French language and culture in Quebec while remaining unconcerned about issues with other minorities or in other parts of the country.

=== United States ===
In the 19th century, the Conservatives were a party of [[National Policy|protectionism]] and the Liberals favoured [[reciprocity (Canadian politics)|free trade with the US]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Religion ===
In the 19th 
and early 
20th centuries, English Canada remained strongly committed to the British Empire and Protestantism. French Canada was more anti-imperialist and strongly Catholic. Attempting to form stable parties that could win seats in both areas was a daunting task and led to political deadlock in the Province of Canada before Confederation.

During the era of Confederation, British-style [[British Whig Party|Whig]] liberals from [[Canada West]], the [[Clear Grits]] and [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reformers]], attempted to work with the [[anti-clerical]] minority in [[Canada East]], the [[Parti rouge]], and liberals in the Maritimes to form the Liberal Party. The avowedly anti-democratic Tories of the English colonies attempted to create a coalition with conservative Catholics in Canada East, the [[Parti bleu]].

Keeping these diverse coalitions united remained difficult when interests cut across party lines, and instead inflamed sectional feeling. The first such issues were the two Riel Rebellions of [[Red River Rebellion|1869]] and [[Red River Rebellion|1885]] which hardened Catholic–Protestant animosity.  The Tory government of [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], himself an [[Orange Order in Canada|Orangeman]], eventually oversaw the execution of [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]] leader [[Louis Riel]] (a devout [[Catholic]]) for treason. The Tory party was decimated in Quebec, and the Liberal party everywhere else.

Eventually, [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] was able to lead the Liberals back to a competitive position in English Canada, but by the time of the [[First World War]], and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], Laurier again found himself in charge of a Liberal Party limited to Quebec and a few other pockets. In part because of the memories of these eras, the Tory party gained a reputation as being anti-Catholic and anti-French and remained substantially weaker than the Liberals in Quebec from the 1890s to the 1980s, with the lone exception of [[Canadian federal election, 1958|1958]].  Meanwhile, Laurier's Liberals were accused of not supporting Britain forcefully enough during the [[Boer War]] and with the creation of the [[Canadian Navy]], widely disparaged as a [[Tin Pot Navy]], which hurt his party in [[English people|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Ontario]].

Since that time, [[sectarianism]] has faded substantially as an issue in Canada, and relations with Britain are no longer of nearly the same importance.

'''Portobelo''' (historically '''Porto Bello''' in English) is a port city and [[Corregimientos of Panama|corregimiento]] in [[Portobelo District]], [[Colón Province]], [[Panama]] with a population of 4,559 {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}}.&lt;ref name=inec/&gt; Established during the Spanish colonial period, it functions as the seat of Portobelo District.&lt;ref name=inec/&gt; Located on the northern part of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], it has a deep [[natural harbor]] and served as a center for silver exporting before the mid-eighteenth century and its destruction in 1739 during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].

It slowly rebuilt and the city's economy revived briefly in the late-nineteenth century during construction of the Panama Canal. In 1980 [[UNESCO]] designated the ruins of the Spanish colonial fortifications, along with nearby [[Fort San Lorenzo]], as a [[World Heritage Site]], named [[Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama: Portobelo-San Lorenzo]].

==History==
Portobelo was colonized in 1597 by Spanish explorer Francisco Velarde y Mercado&lt;ref name="Fish2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirley Fish|title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons: The Treasure Ships of the Pacific with an Annotated List of the Transpacific Galleons 1565-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kk_iU0f-iT8C&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=17 May 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-7542-1|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly replaced [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] as a Caribbean port for Peruvian silver.  Legend has it that [[Christopher Columbus]] originally named the port "Puerto Bello", meaning "Beautiful Port", in 1502.&lt;ref name="Katzman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Katzman|title=Panama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i94Ea2E97jAC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=10 February 2006|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-58843-529-3|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Francis Drake]] died of [[dysentery]] in 1596 at sea, he was said to be buried in a lead coffin near Portobelo Bay.  From the 16th to the 18th centuries, it was an important silver-exporting port in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] on the [[Spanish Main]] and one of the ports on the route of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]]s. The Spanish built defensive fortifications.

The [[privateer]] [[William Parker (privateer)|William Parker]] [[Capture of Portobello (1601)|attacked and captured the city]] in 1601 and [[Henry Morgan|Captain Henry Morgan]] repeated the feat in 1668. He led a fleet of privateers and 450 men against Portobelo, which, in spite of its good fortifications, he captured.  His forces plundered it for 14 days, stripping nearly all its wealth while raping, torturing and killing the inhabitants. It was captured again in 1680 by [[John Coxon (pirate)|John Coxon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoziński|first1=Jan|title=The Wordsworth dictionary of pirates|date=1997|publisher=Wordsworth Reference|location=Ware|isbn=1-85326-384-2|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British had a disaster in the [[Blockade of Porto Bello]] under [[Francis Hosier|Admiral Hosier]] in 1726. As part of the campaigns of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]], the port was attacked on November 21, 1739, and captured by a British fleet of six ships, commanded by Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]. The British victory created an outburst of popular acclaim throughout the British Empire. More medals were struck for Vernon than for any other 18th-century British figure.  Across the [[British Isles]], Portobello was used in place and street names in honor of the victory, such as [[Portobello Road]] in London, the [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello area]] in Edinburgh, and the [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="Simms2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan Simms|title=Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714-1783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izhwqC3W23UC|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=8 December 2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01332-6|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish quickly recovered the Panamanian town and defeated Admiral Vernon in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] in 1741. Vernon was forced to return to England with a decimated fleet, having suffered more than 18,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Francis. ''History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery'', London, 1879, Vol.1, p.123, Quote:"...so reduced was this force in two years by disaster and disease, that not a tenth part returned to England...'thus ended in shame, disappointment, and loss, the most important, most expensive, and best concerted expedition that Great Britain was ever engaged in'...".&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Portobello campaign, British efforts to gain a foothold in the [[Spanish Main]] and disrupt the galleon trade were fruitless. Following the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Spanish switched from large fleets calling at few ports to small fleets trading at a wide variety of ports, developing a flexibility that made them less subject to attack. The ships also began to travel around [[Cape Horn]] to trade directly at ports on the western coast.

Its population as of 1990 was 3,058; its population as of 2000 was 3,867.&lt;ref name=inec/&gt;  In July 2012, the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Committee]] placed Portobelo and nearby [[Fort San Lorenzo]] on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]], inscribed as [[Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama: Portobelo-San Lorenzo]], citing environmental factors, lack of maintenance, and uncontrollable urban developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/panamanian_fortifications Panamanian Fortifications Added to UNESCO List of World Heritage in Danger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408124318/http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/panamanian_fortifications |date=2015-04-08 }}, Global Heritage Fund blog article&lt;/ref&gt;

Portobelo is hosting dozen of anchored sail boats. There is an immigration office in the village and boat services taking passengers to Colombia. From $160/person with the taxi boat 'Naturalstour' to $550 on private sail boats.

Although not widely accepted in  [[linguistics]], the term '''preverb''' is used in [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]] (including all three families: [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] and [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]), [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan]], [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] linguistics to describe certain elements prefixed to verbs. In the context of [[Indo-European languages]], the term is usually used for [[separable verb|separable verb prefixes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-1513-7_1|hdl=1871/11412|chapter=Preverbs: An introduction|title=Yearbook of Morphology 2003|pages=1|series=Yearbook of Morphology|year=2003|last1=Booij|first1=Geert|last2=Van Kemenade|first2=Ans|isbn=978-1-4020-1272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, any prefix could be called a preverbal element. However, in practice, the term ''preverb'' applies more narrowly in those families and refers to a prefixed element that is normally outside the premise of verbal morphology like locations of noun elements or, less often, noun elements themselves.

==Northwest Caucasian languages==
In Northwest Caucasian languages, they can have [[noun]]s, directional and locative preverbs (like [[preposition]]s), like in this example from [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]:

{|
| colspan="5"|'''{{IPA|sæbɣʲawqʼanajtʼ}}'''

|{{IPA|sæ}}-
|{{IPA|bɣʲa}}-
|{{IPA|w}}-
|{{IPA|qʼa}}
| -{{IPA|najtʼ}}
|-
|1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;-
|&lt;small&gt;PVB&lt;/small&gt;-
|2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;-
|talk
| -&lt;small&gt;[[Imperfect|IMPF]]&lt;small&gt;
|-
| colspan="5"|''You were talking about me''&lt;br&gt;(literally, ''you were talking on me'')
|}

==Caddoan==
In [[Caddoan]] linguistics, preverbal elements are less well defined as a class, and often, "preverb" designates a part of the verbal root that can be separated from the rest of the root by certain prefixes, as in this [[Wichita language|Wichita]] example:

{|
| colspan="8"|'''{{IPA|taatíísaaskinnaʔas}}'''
|-
| ta-
| i-
| aa-
| tíísaas
| kir
| ri-
| {{IPA|ʔa}}

|-
|&lt;small&gt;[[Indicative mood|INDIC]]&lt;/small&gt;-
|3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;-
|&lt;small&gt;PVB&lt;/small&gt;-
|medicine
|liquid
|portative-
|come
| -&lt;small&gt;IMPF&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| colspan="8"|''He is bringing (liquid) medicine''
|}

==Mandarin Chinese==
For [[Mandarin Chinese]] and many other [[varieties of Chinese]], the term refers to some words that carry the meanings of [[prepositions]] in English. In Chinese, they are lexically verbs and appear before the noun in question. They are more commonly referred to as [[coverb]]s.

==Georgian==
In [[Georgian language|Georgian]], a Kartvelian language, the main function of a preverb is to distinguish the present tenses and the future tenses. To turn a present tense verb into a future tense, a preverb is added to the verb compound. In addition, preverbs also have directional meanings in Georgian.

Preverbs are directly attached to the beginning of the verb compound:

:''aketebs'' ("he does it") and '''''ga'''aketebs'' ("he will do it")
:''vtser'' ("I am writing") and '''''da'''vtser'' ("I will write")

Note in those two examples that the meaning of the future tense is achieved only by adding the preverb; no other grammatical change occurs. In these examples, preverbs have directional meanings:

:'''''mo'''dis'' ("he/she is coming")
:'''''mi'''dis'' ("he/she is going")
:'''''a'''dis'' ("he/she is going up (the stairs)", "he/she is getting on (a bus)")
:'''''chamo'''dis'' ("he/she is arriving")
:'''''shemo'''dis'' ("he/she is entering")

Again, note that only the preverbs are changed to convey the meaning of various directional meanings. It should also be noted that preverbs add directional meanings not only to the verbs of motion but also to any other kind of verbs. Compare the examples of the verb -''tser''- ("write"):

:'''''da'''vtsere'' ("I wrote it")
:'''''mo'''gtsere'' ("I wrote it ''to'' you")
:'''''mi'''vtsere'' ("I wrote it ''to'' him/them")
:'''''gada'''gitsere'' ("I wrote to you (''from a place'')")

As can be seen from the examples, the preverb changes according to the indirect object (the person for (to) whom the verb is being done).

Many verbs have a common root. For example, "end" and "stay" have the same verb root, -''rch''-. The meanings of the verbs are distinguished by their preverbs and other elements of the verb compound:

:''rcheba'' ("he is staying"), '''''da'''rcheba'' ("he will stay")
:''rcheba'' ("it is ending"), '''''mo'''rcheba'' ("it will end")

As is clear, the verbs are identical in the present tense but differ in the future tense by their preverbs.

==Modern Persian==
A preverb is a morpheme, which is applied together with the participles modifying their meaning and the meaning of their derivates.

Persian preverbs, referred to as "āndar" or "dar", are:

*bar
*bāz
*farā and hā
*farāz
*foru and hō
*ham
*negah and negāh
*pas
*piš
*ru
*sar
*var
*vā

Pre-verbs can modify the procedure attribute of the verbs and the infinitives, but they do not change their objective attribute:

.او کتابی داشت (static attribute)

U ketābi dāsht.
{|
|3rd&lt;small&gt;P PRONOUN&lt;/small&gt;-
|Book.&lt;small&gt;DEFINITE&lt;/small&gt;-
|Have.&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;
|}

.او کتابی را برداشت (dynamic attribute)

U ketabi bar dāsht. {{Clarify|reason=را is not mentioned here.|date=June 2017}}
{|
|3rd&lt;small&gt;P PRONOUN&lt;/small&gt;-
|Book.&lt;small&gt;DEFINITE&lt;/small&gt;-
|&lt;small&gt;PVB&lt;/small&gt;-
|Have.&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;
|} {{Clarify|reason=را / ra is not mentioned here.|date=June 2017}}

The Pre-verb is normally positioned ahead of the verb. If the verb is composed of two separable components, the pre-verb is positioned ahead of the second component. The Pre-verb can be positioned at the end of the sentence, owing to versification requirements:

از کارِ خير عزمِ تو هرگز نگشت باز

هرگز زِ راه بازنگشته‌ست هيچ تير

Manuchehri (11th - 12th Century AD)

==Algonquian==
In Algonquian languages, preverbs can be described as phonologically separate words that may precede a verb and share its inflection. In particular, pronominal prefixes or initial change are applied to the first preverb, if any, of the verb complex rather than to the verb stem. Their meaning can range from [[past tense]] or [[perfective aspect]] to meanings for which English might use an adverb or another verb, like these from [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ojibwe
! English
! Comment
|-
| nibaa
| he/she sleeps
| has no preverb
|-
| ninibaamin
| we sleep
| likewise, with pronominal prefix
|-
| gii-nibaa
| he/she slept
| has past tense preverb
|-
| ningii-nibaamin
| we slept
| likewise, with pronominal prefix
|-
| gii-maajii-nibaa
| he/she started to sleep
| has past preverb, and a lexical preverb
|-
| ningii-maajii-nibaamin
| we started to sleep
| likewise, with pronominal prefix
|}

In [[Munsee grammar|Munsee]], some words can come between a preverb and its verb.

See also [[prenoun]] in such languages.

== Pingelapese ==
[[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]] is a language spoken on the Island of Pingelap atoll, located in Micronesia. This language uses preverbs in existential sentences, one of their four sentence structures. The verb is used when a character of a story or statement is already known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hattori|first=Ryoko|year=2012|title=Preverbal Particles in Pingelapese: A Language of Micronesia|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9055">[[Image:Prohibition of death around the world.jpg|thumb|350px|Map showing places where it is illegal to die, where it used to be illegal to die, and where there are attempts to make it illegal to die.]]
'''Prohibition of death''' is a political [[social phenomenon]] and [[taboo]] in which a law is passed stating that it is illegal to die, usually specifically in a certain [[political division]] or in a specific [[building]].

The earliest case of prohibition of death occurred in the 5th century BC, on the Greek island of [[Delos]]; dying on Delos was prohibited on religious grounds.

Today, in most cases, the prohibition of death is a satirical response to the government's failure to approve the expansion of municipal cemeteries. In [[Spain]], one town has prohibited death;&lt;ref name="S1"/&gt; in [[France]], there have been several settlements which have had death prohibited;&lt;ref name="F1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="F3" /&gt; whilst in [[Biritiba Mirim]], in [[Brazil]], an attempt to prohibit death took place in 2005.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B3" /&gt;

There is a falsely rumored prohibition on recording deaths in [[royal palaces]] in the [[United Kingdom]], for rather different reasons.&lt;ref name="UK1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK2"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/81960.stm|title= You Can't Do That! |accessdate= 2008-03-04|author= |date= 2005-08-30|publisher= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient==

===Greece===
The island of [[Delos]] was considered a sacred and holy place by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], and various measures were taken to "purify" the island and render it fit for the proper worship of the gods. In the 6th century BC, the tyrant [[Peisistratos of Athens|Peisistratus]], of the city-state of [[Athens]], ordered that all graves within sight of the island's temple be dug up and the bodies removed to locations on or beyond the perimeter. In the 5th century BC, under instruction from the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]], the entire island was purged of all dead bodies, and it was forbidden for anybody else to die or give birth on the island.

==Modern==

===Brazil===
The mayor of [[Biritiba-Mirim]] filed a [[public bill]] in 2005, to make it illegal for the people living in the town to die. Although no specific punishments have been presented, the mayor intends to target relatives of people who die with fines and even jail if necessary to get more space for tombstones.

The main reason for the attempt to pass such a law with such severe punishments if broken is that the town's 28,000 inhabitants apparently do not look after their health properly, making them more vulnerable to death, which would mean having to bury more corpses in the already full cemetery. Since the cemetery was inaugurated in 1910, over 50,000 people have been buried in 3,500 crypts and tombs. In November 2005, the cemetery was declared to be full and 20 recently deceased residents were forced to share a crypt, and several others were buried under the walkways.

The mayor, to support his uncommon proposal for a law, stated that 89% of the town is occupied by rivers, of which most are underground and serve as vital water sources for nearly two million people living in [[São Paulo]], and that the remaining area is protected because it consists of tropical jungle. So, public land five times the size of the cemetery was set aside to provide space for a new one, which environmental experts claim will not affect water tables or surrounding tropical forest. The environment council decided to analyze such a solution carefully, while the state government had agreed to help build a new vertical cemetery; but, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, nothing has been done, and the law has not yet been passed, leaving the situation in suspense.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4527868.stm "Brazil city proposes ban on death"]. BBC News. 14 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B3"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10454687/ "No room at cemetery, so mayor in Biritiba Mirim  proposes a ban on death"]. MSNBC. 13 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Three settlements in southern France have prohibited death. The mayor of [[Le Lavandou]] outlawed death in 2000, after planning permission for a new cemetery was turned down due to environmental concerns. He described the new bylaw as "an absurd law to counter an absurd situation".&lt;ref name="Henley"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |title=Citizens live under law's dead hand |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/23/jonhenley |work=The Guardian |date=2000-09-23 |accessdate=2008-10-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Cugnaux]] also prohibited death, for similar reasons,&lt;ref name="F1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528204947/http://weirdglobenews.com/forbidden_to_die_because_of_lack_of_room.html "Forbidden to die because of lack of room"].

===Japan===
The island of [[Itsukushima]] is considered a sacred location in [[Shinto]] belief, and is the site of the [[Itsukushima Shrine]], an [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Purity is of utmost concern in Shinto worship, and because of this, the shrine's priests have attempted to keep the island free of the pollution of death. Immediately after the [[Battle of Miyajima]] in 1555, the only battle to have taken place on the island, the victorious commander had the bodies of the fallen troops removed to the mainland, and ordered that the entire battlefield be cleansed of the blood that was spilled, to the point that buildings were scrubbed and blood-soaked soil was removed from the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Turnbull |first= Stephen R. |title= The Samurai: A Military History |publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co. |place=New York |year =1977|page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaining the purity of the Itsukushima Shrine is so important that since 1878, no deaths or births have been permitted near the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Itsukushima |work= Japanese Lifestyle |url= http://www.gojapango.com/travel/miyajima_itsukushima.htm |year=2010 |accessdate= 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, pregnant women are supposed to retreat to the mainland as the day of delivery approaches, as are terminally ill or the very elderly whose passing has become imminent. Burials on the island are still forbidden.

===Spain===
Death has been prohibited in the Andalucian town of [[Lanjarón]].&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080709215313/http://www.stiffs.com/backoct99.html "Spanish Mayor Outlaws Death"]. Stiffs. 2 October 1999. Archived from the original on 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The village, with 4,000 inhabitants, is to remain under this law until the government buys land for a new cemetery. The mayor who issued the edict explains that the awkward new law is his response to politicians urging him to find a quick fix for a long-lasting problem.&lt;ref name="S1" /&gt; The edict has become wildly popular amongst residents, even amongst political opponents of the mayor who issued the law, and was received with a sense of humor from most.&lt;ref name="S1" /&gt;

==Myths==
===United Kingdom===
A story sometimes reported in the United Kingdom states it is forbidden for commoners to die in a royal palace, such as the [[Palace of Westminster]], on the grounds that anyone who dies in a royal palace is technically entitled to a [[state funeral]].&lt;ref name="UK1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1568474/Dont-die-in-parliament-its-the-law.html|title= Don't die in parliament, it's the law |accessdate= 26 August 2012|author= |date= 2007-11-06|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]| location=London | first=Gary | last=Cleland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Rachel''''' is a sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] of the [[Old Testament]] figure [[Rachel]]. Like the ''[[Leah (sculpture)|Leah]]'', it was part of the final, 1542-1545 design for the [[tomb of Pope Julius II]] in [[San Pietro in Vincoli]], on which it still remains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="106744">Although [[Old Chinese]] is known from written records beginning around 1200 BC, the [[logographic]] script provides much more indirect and partial information about the pronunciation of the language than alphabetic systems used elsewhere.
Several authors have produced reconstructions of [[Old Chinese phonology]], beginning with the Swedish sinologist [[Bernard Karlgren]] in the 1940s and continuing to the present day.
The method introduced by Karlgren is unique, comparing categories implied by ancient rhyming practice and the structure of [[Chinese characters]] with descriptions in medieval [[rime dictionary|rhyme dictionaries]], though more recent approaches have also incorporated other kinds of evidence.

Although the various notations appear to be very different, they correspond with each other on most points.
By the 1970s, it was generally agreed that [[Old Chinese]] had fewer [[points of articulation]] than [[Middle Chinese]], a set of voiceless [[sonorant]]s, and [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] and labio-laryngeal initials.
Since the 1990s, most authors have agreed on a six-vowel system and a re-organized system of [[liquid consonant|liquid]]s.
Earlier systems proposed voiced final stops to account for contacts between stop-final syllables and other tones, but many investigators now believe that Old Chinese lacked [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] distinctions, with Middle Chinese tones derived from consonant clusters at the end of the syllable.

== Sources of evidence ==
The major sources for the sounds of Old Chinese, covering most of the lexicon, are the sound system of [[Middle Chinese]] (7th century AD), the structure of [[Chinese character]]s, and the rhyming patterns of the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (''Shijing''), dating from the early part of the 1st millennium BC.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=2–3}}
Several other kinds of evidence are less comprehensive, but provide valuable clues.
These include [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects, early Chinese transcriptions of foreign names, early loans between Chinese and neighbouring languages, and families of Chinese words that appear to be related.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=12–13, 25}}

=== Middle Chinese ===
[[File:Guangyun Dong Rhyme 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.75|The start of the first rhyme class (東 ''dōng'' "east") of the ''[[Guangyun]]'' rhyme dictionary|alt=two pages of a Chinese dictionary, comprising the end of the index and the start of the entries]]
Middle Chinese, or more precisely Early Middle Chinese, is the phonological system of the ''[[Qieyun]]'', a [[rhyme dictionary]] published in 601, with many revisions and expansions over the following centuries.
These dictionaries set out to codify the pronunciations of characters to be used when reading the [[Chinese classics|classics]].
They indicated pronunciation using the ''[[fanqie]]'' method, dividing a [[syllable]] into an initial consonant and the rest, called the final.
In his ''Qièyùn kǎo'' (1842), the Cantonese scholar [[Chen Li (scholar)|Chen Li]] performed a systematic analysis of a later redaction of the ''Qieyun'', identifying its initial and final categories, though not the sounds they represented.
Scholars have attempted to determine the phonetic content of the various distinctions by comparing them with [[rhyme table]]s from the [[Song dynasty]], pronunciations in modern varieties and loans in Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese (the [[Sinoxenic]] materials), but many details regarding the finals are still disputed.
According to its preface, the ''Qieyun'' did not reflect a single contemporary dialect, but incorporated distinctions made in different parts of China at the time (a [[diasystem]]).{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=32–44}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–42}}

The fact that the ''Qieyun'' system  contains more distinctions than any single contemporary form of speech means that it retains additional information about the history of the language.
The large number of initials and finals are unevenly distributed, suggesting hypotheses about earlier forms of Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=37–38}}
For example, it includes 37 initials, but in the early 20th century [[Huang Kan]] observed that only 19 of them occurred with a wide range of finals, implying that the others were in some sense secondary developments.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=12–13}}

=== Phonetic series ===
[[File:Shuowen-Shuo.png|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=page of a Chinese dictionary, with headings in seal script and entries in conventional script|Page from a copy of a [[Song dynasty]] edition of the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', showing characters with the 言 element]]
The logographic Chinese writing system does not use symbols for individual sounds as is done an alphabetic system.{{sfnp|Dong|2014|pp=23–24}}
However, the vast majority of characters are [[phono-semantic compound]]s, in which a word is written by combining a character for a similarly sounding word with a semantic indicator.
Often characters sharing a phonetic element (forming a phonetic series) are still pronounced alike, as in the character 中 (''zhōng'', "middle"), which was adapted to write the words ''chōng'' ("pour", 沖) and ''zhōng'' ("loyal", 忠).&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1007a,p,k.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other cases the words in a phonetic series have very different sounds both in Middle Chinese and in modern varieties.
Since the sounds are assumed to have been similar at the time the characters were chosen, such relationships give clues to the lost sounds.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=43–44}}

The first systematic study of the structure of Chinese characters was [[Xu Shen]]'s ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (100 AD).{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=13}}
The ''Shuowen'' was mostly based on the [[small seal script]] standardized in the [[Qin dynasty]].{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=346–347}}
Earlier characters from [[oracle bone]]s and [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Zhou bronze inscriptions]] often reveal relationships that were obscured in later forms.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=5}}

=== Poetic rhyming ===
Rhyme has been a consistent feature of Chinese poetry.
While much old poetry still rhymes in modern varieties of Chinese, Chinese scholars have long noted exceptions.
This was attributed to lax rhyming practice of early poets until the late-[[Ming dynasty]] scholar [[Chen Di]] argued that a former consistency had been obscured by [[sound change]].
This implied that the rhyming practice of ancient poets recorded information about their pronunciation.
Scholars have studied various bodies of poetry to identify classes of rhyming words at different periods.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=42}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=12}}

The oldest such collection is the ''[[Shijing]]'', containing songs ranging from the 10th to 7th centuries BC.
The systematic study of Old Chinese rhymes began in the 17th century, when [[Gu Yanwu]] divided the rhyming words of the ''Shijing'' into ten groups (韻部 ''yùnbù'').
Gu's analysis was refined by [[Qing dynasty]] philologists, steadily increasing the number of rhyme groups.
One of these scholars, [[Duan Yucai]], stated the important principle that characters in the same phonetic series would be in the same rhyme group,{{efn|同聲必同部 ''Tóng shēng bì tóng bù''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=831}}}} making it possible to assign almost all words to rhyme groups.
A final revision by [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]] in the 1930s produced the standard set of 31 rhyme groups.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=150–170}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=42–44}}

=== Min dialects ===

The [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects are believed to have split off before the Middle Chinese stage, because they contain distinctions that cannot be derived from the ''Qieyun'' system.
For example, the following dental initials have been identified in reconstructed [[proto-Min language|proto-Min]]:{{sfnp|Norman|1973|pp=227, 230, 233, 235}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=228–229}}

Other points of articulation show similar distinctions within stops and nasals.
Proto-Min voicing is inferred from the development of Min tones, but the phonetic values of the initials are otherwise uncertain.
The sounds indicated as *''-t'', *''-d'', etc. are known as "softened stops" due to their reflexes in [[Jianyang, Fujian|Jianyang]] and nearby Min varieties in [[Fujian]], where they appear as fricatives or approximants, or are missing entirely, while the non-softened variants appear as stops.  Evidence from early loans into [[Mienic languages]] suggests that the softened stops were [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]].{{sfnp|Norman|1986|p=381}}

=== Other evidence ===

Several early texts contain transcriptions of foreign names and terms using Chinese characters for their phonetic values.
Of particular importance are the many Buddhist transcriptions of the [[Eastern Han]] period, because the native pronunciation of the source languages, such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], is known in detail.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1992|p=375–379}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=12}}{{sfnp|Coblin|1983|p=7}}

Eastern Han commentaries on the classics contain many remarks on the pronunciations of particular words, which has yielded a great deal of information on the pronunciations and even dialectal variation of the period.{{sfnp|Coblin|1983|pp=4–7}}
By studying such glosses, the Qing philologist [[Qian Daxin]] discovered that the labio-dental and retroflex stop initials identified in the rhyme table tradition were not present in the Han period.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=44}}{{sfnp|Dong|2014|pp=33–35}}

Many students of Chinese have noted "word families", groups of words with related meanings and variant pronunciations, sometimes written using the same character.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1973}}
One common case is "derivation by tone change", in which words in the departing tone appear to be derived from words in other tones.{{sfnp|Downer|1959}}
Another alternation involves transitive verbs with an unvoiced initial and passive or stative verbs with a voiced initial, though scholars are divided on which form is basic.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=49}}{{sfnp|Handel|2012|pp=63–71}}

In the earliest period, Chinese was spoken in the valley of the [[Yellow River]], surrounded by neighbouring languages, some of whose relatives, particularly [[Austroasiatic language|Austroasiatic]] and the [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]] and [[Miao–Yao languages]], are still spoken today.  The earliest borrowings in both directions provide further evidence of Old Chinese sounds, though complicated by uncertainty about the reconstruction of early forms of those languages.{{sfnp|Sagart|1999|pp=8–9}}

== Systems ==
Many authors have produced their own reconstructions of Old Chinese.
A few of the most influential are listed here.

=== Karlgren (1940–1957) ===
The first complete reconstruction of Old Chinese was produced by the Swedish linguist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] in a dictionary of Middle and Old Chinese, the ''Grammata Serica'' (1940), revised in 1957 as the ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' (GSR).  Although Karlgren's Old Chinese reconstructions have been superseded, his comprehensive dictionary remains a valuable reference for students of Old Chinese, and characters are routinely identified by their GSR position.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=547}}
Karlgren's remained the most commonly used until it was superseded by the system of Li Fang-Kuei in the 1970s.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=548}}

In his ''Études sur la phonologie chinoise'' (1915–1926), Karlgren produced the first complete reconstruction of [[Middle Chinese]] (which he called "Ancient Chinese").
He presented his system as a [[narrow transcription]] of the sounds of the standard language of the [[Tang dynasty]].
Beginning with his ''Analytical Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'' (1923), he compared these sounds across groups of words written with [[phono-semantic compound|Chinese characters with the same phonetic component]].
Noting that such words were not always pronounced identically in Middle Chinese, he postulated that their initials had a common [[point of articulation]] in an earlier phase he called "Archaic Chinese", but which is now usually called [[Old Chinese]].
For example, he postulated [[velar consonant]]s as initials in the series
* 甘 ''kâm'', 柑 ''kâm'', 酣 ''ɣâm'', 鉗 ''gjäm''{{sfnp|Karlgren|1923|p=18}}{{efn|Middle Chinese forms given in [[Karlgren–Li reconstruction of Middle Chinese|Li's revision of Karlgren's notation]].}}
In rarer cases where different types of initials occurred in the same series, as in
* 各 ''kâk'', 胳 ''kâk'', 格 ''kak'', 絡 ''lâk'', 駱 ''lâk'', 略 ''ljak''
he postulated initial clusters *kl- and *gl-.{{sfnp|Karlgren|1923|p=31}}

Karlgren believed that the voiced initials of Middle Chinese were aspirated, and projected these back onto Old Chinese.
He also proposed a series of unaspirated voiced initials to account for other correspondences, but later workers have discarded these in favour of alternative explanations.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=230–231}}
Karlgren accepted the argument of the Qing philologist [[Qian Daxin]] that the Middle Chinese dental and retroflex stop series were not distinguished in Old Chinese, but otherwise proposed the same points of articulation in Old Chinese as in Middle Chinese.
This led him to the following series of initial consonants:{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|p=230}}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;"

| || || *s || *ṣ || *ś || *x
|-
! &lt;small&gt;voiced&lt;/small&gt;
| || *l || *z || || ||
|}

To account for the broad variety of vowels in his reconstruction of Middle Chinese, Karlgren also proposed a complex inventory of Old Chinese vowels:{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|p=244}}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 12em; text-align: center;"
|-
| || || *ŭ || *u ||
|-
| *e || *ĕ || *ə || *ô || *ộ
|-
| || || *ɛ || *o || *ǒ
|-
| *a || *ă || *â || *å ||
|}
He also had a secondary vowel *i, which occurred only in combination with other vowels.
As with Middle Chinese, Karlgren viewed his reconstruction as a narrow transcription of the sounds of Old Chinese.
Thus *e rhymed with *ĕ in the ''Shijing'', *a rhymed with *ă and *â, *ɛ rhymed with *ĕ and *ŭ, *ŭ rhymed with *u, *ô rhymed with *ộ, and *o rhymed with *ǒ and *å.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|p=244}}

Karlgren projected the final consonants of Middle Chinese, semivowels /j/ and /w/, nasals /m/, /n/ and /ŋ/, and stops /p/, /t/ and /k/ back onto Old Chinese.
He also noted many cases where words in the departing tone rhymed or shared a phonetic element with words ending in a stop, e.g.
* 賴 ''lâi-'' "depend on" and 剌 ''lât'' "wicked"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 272e,a.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 欬 ''khəi-'' "cough" and 刻 ''khək'' "cut, engrave"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 937s,v.&lt;/ref&gt;
He suggested that the departing tone words in such pairs had ended with a final voiced stop ({{IPA|*-d}} or {{IPA|*-ɡ}}) in Old Chinese.{{sfnp|Karlgren|1923|pp=27–30}}
To account for occasional contacts between Middle Chinese finals ''-j'' and ''-n'', Karlgren proposed that ''-j'' in such pairs derived from Old Chinese {{IPA|*-r}}.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=843}}
He believed there was insufficient evidence to support definitive statements about Old Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Karlgren|1957|p=2}}

=== Yakhontov (1959–1965) ===
In a pair of papers published in 1960, the Russian linguist [[Sergei Yakhontov]] proposed two revisions to the structure of Old Chinese that are now widely accepted.
He proposed that both the retroflex initials and the division-II vowels of Middle Chinese derived from the Old Chinese medial *-l- that Karlgren had proposed to account for phonetic series contacts with ''l-''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=23, 178, 262}}
Yakhontov also observed that the Middle Chinese semi-vowel ''-w-'' had a limited distribution, occurring either after velar or laryngeal initials or before finals ''-aj'', ''-an'' or ''at''.
He suggested that ''-w-'' had two sources, deriving from either a new series of labio-velar and labio-laryngeal initials, or from a vowel ''-o-'', which subsequently broke to ''-wa-'' before dental codas.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=180, 250}}{{sfnp|Yakhontov|1970}}

Yakhontov proposed a simpler seven-vowel system:{{sfnp|Yakhontov|1965|p=27}}{{sfnp|Yakhontov|1978–79|p=37}}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;"

|-

|}
However these vowels had an uneven distribution, with *ä and *â almost in complementary distribution and *ü occurring only in open syllables and before *-k.{{sfnp|Yakhontov|1978–79|p=38}}
His final consonants were the nasals *-m, *-n and *-ng, corresponding stops *-p, *-t and *-k, as well as *-r, which became ''-j'' or disappeared in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Yakhontov|1965|p=26}}{{sfnp|Yakhontov|1978–79|p=37}}

=== Pulleyblank (1962) ===
The Canadian sinologist [[Edwin Pulleyblank]] published a reconstruction of the consonants of Old Chinese in two parts in 1962.
In addition to new analyses of the traditional evidence, he also made substantial use of transcription evidence.
Though not a full reconstruction, Pulleyblank's work has been very influential, and many of his proposals are now widely accepted.

Pulleyblank adapted Dong Tonghe's proposal of a voiceless counterpart to the initial *m, proposing a full set of aspirated nasals,{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=92–93, 121, 135–137}}
as well as Yakhontov's labio-velar and labio-laryngeal initials.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=95–96}}

Pulleyblank also accepted Yakhontov's expanded role for the medial *-l-, which he noted was cognate with Tibeto-Burman *-r-.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=110–114}}
To account for phonetic contacts between Middle Chinese l- and dental initials, he also proposed an aspirated lateral *lh-.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=121–122}}
Pulleyblank also distinguished two sets of dental series, one derived from Old Chinese dental stops and the other derived from dental fricatives *δ and *θ, cognate with Tibeto-Burman *l-.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=114–119}}
He considered recasting his Old Chinese *l and *δ as *r and *l to match the Tibeto-Burman cognates, but rejected the idea to avoid complicating his account of the evolution of Chinese.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|p=117}}
Later he re-visited this decision, recasting *δ, *θ, *l and *lh as *l, *hl, *r and *hr respectively.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1973|p=117}}

Pulleyblank also proposed an Old Chinese labial fricative *v for the few words where Karlgren had *b, as well as a voiceless counterpart *f.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=137–141}}
Unlike the above ideas, these have not been adopted by later workers.

| || *lh || || || || ||

| || *l || || || || ||
|}

Pulleyblank also proposed a number of initial consonant clusters, allowing any initial to be preceded by *s- and followed by *-l- (*-r- in later revisions), and grave initials and *n to be followed by *-δ- (*-l- in later revisions).{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|p=141}}

On the basis of transcription evidence, Pulleyblank argued that the ''-j-'' medial of Middle Chinese was an innovation not present in Old Chinese.
He classified Middle Chinese finals without ''-j-'' as type A and those with the medial as type B, and suggested that they arose from Old Chinese short and long vowels respectively.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962a|pp=141–142}}

[[André-Georges Haudricourt]] had demonstrated in 1954 that the tones of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] were derived from final consonants *-ʔ and *-s in an atonal ancestral language.{{sfnp|Haudricourt|1954a}}
He also suggested that the Chinese departing tone derived from earlier *-s, which acted as a derivational suffix in Old Chinese.
Then the departing tone syllables that Karlgren had reconstructed with *-d and *-g could instead be reconstructed as *-ts and *-ks, with the stops subsequently being lost before the final *-s, which eventually became a tonal distinction.{{sfnp|Haudricourt|1954b|pp=363–364}}
The absence of a corresponding labial final could be attributed to early [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of {{IPA|*-ps}} to {{IPA|*-ts}}.
Pulleyblank strengthened the theory with several examples of syllables in the departing tone being used to transcribe foreign words ending in ''-s'' into Chinese.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962b|pp=216–225}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=54–57}}
He further proposed that the Middle Chinese rising tone derived from *-ʔ, implying that Old Chinese lacked tones.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1962b|pp=225–227}}
Mei Tsu-lin later supported this theory with evidence from early transcriptions of Sanskrit words, and pointed out that rising tone words end in a glottal stop in some modern Chinese dialects, including [[Wenzhounese]] and some [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects.{{sfnp|Mei|1970}}

=== Li (1971) ===

The Chinese linguist [[Li Fang-Kuei]] published an important new reconstruction in 1971, synthesizing proposals of Yakhontov and Pulleyblank with ideas of his own.
His system remained the most commonly used until it was replaced by that of Baxter in the 1990s.
Although Li did not produce a complete dictionary of Old Chinese, he presented his methods in sufficient detail that others could apply them to the data.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=45}}
{{harvp|Schuessler|1987}} includes reconstructions of the Western Zhou lexicon using Li's system.{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=548}}

Li included the labio-velars, labio-laryngeals and voiceless nasals proposed by Pulleyblank.
As Middle Chinese ''g-'' occurs only in palatal environments, Li attempted to derive both ''g-'' and ''ɣ-'' from Old Chinese {{IPA|*g-}} (and similarly {{IPA|*gw-}}), but had to assume irregular developments in some cases.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|p=235}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=209–210}}
Thus he arrived at the following inventory of initial consonants:{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|p=237}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=46}}

Li also included the *-l- medial proposed by Pulleyblank, in most cases re-interpreting it as *-r-.
In addition to the medial *-j- projected back from Middle Chinese, he also postulated the combination *-rj-.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=237–240}}

Assuming that rhyming syllables had the same main vowel, Li proposed a system of four vowels {{IPA|*i}}, {{IPA|*u}}, {{IPA|*ə}} and {{IPA|*a}}.
He also included three diphthongs {{IPA|*iə}}, {{IPA|*ia}} and {{IPA|*ua}} to account for syllables that were placed in rhyme groups reconstructed with {{IPA|*ə}} or {{IPA|*a}} but were distinguished in Middle Chinese:{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=243–247}}

Li followed Karlgren in proposing final consonants *-d and *-g, but was unable to clearly separate them from open syllables, and extended them to all rhyme groups but one, for which he proposed a final *-r.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=331–333}}
He also proposed that labio-velar consonants could occur as final consonants.
Thus in Li's system every syllable ended in one of the following consonants:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=48}}

|}
Li marked the rising and departing tones with a suffix *-x or *-h, without specifying how they were realized.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=248–250}}

=== Baxter (1992) ===
[[William H. Baxter]]'s monograph ''A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology'' displaced Li's reconstruction in the 1990s.
Baxter did not produce a dictionary of reconstructions, but the book contains a large number of examples, including all the words occurring in rhymes in the ''Shijing'', and his methods are described in great detail.
{{harvp|Schuessler|2007}} contains reconstructions of the entire Old Chinese lexicon using a simplified version of Baxter's system.

Baxter's treatment of the initials is largely similar to the proposals of Pulleyblank and Li.
He reconstructed the liquids *l, *hl, *r and *hr in the same contexts as Pulleyblank.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=196–202}}
Unlike Li, he distinguished Old Chinese *ɦ and *w from *g and *gʷ.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=209–210}}
Other additions were *z, with a limited distribution,{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=206}} and voiceless and voiced palatals *hj and *j, which he described as "especially tentative, being based largely on scanty graphic evidence".{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=202–203}}

As in Pulleyblank and Li's systems, the possible medials were *-r-, *-j- and the combination *-rj-.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=178–180}}
However while Li had proposed *-rj- as conditioning palatalization of velars, Baxter followed Pulleyblank in proposing it as the source of division III ''chóngniǔ'' finals.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=178–179, 214}}

Baxter's major contribution concerned the vowel system and rhyme groups.
[[Nicholas Bodman]] had proposed a six-vowel system for a proto-Chinese phase, based on comparison with other [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].{{sfnp|Bodman|1980|p=47}}
Baxter argued for a six-vowel system in Old Chinese by re-analysing of the traditional rhyme groups.
For example, the traditional 元 rhyme group of the ''Shijing'' corresponds to three different finals in Middle Chinese.
While Li had sought to reconcile these distinct outcomes from rhyming words by reconstructing the finals as *-ian, *-an and *-uan, Baxter argued that in fact they did not rhyme in the ''Shijing'', and could thus be reconstructed with three distinct vowels, *e, *a and *o.
Baxter proposed that the traditional 31 rhyme groups should be refined to over 50, and performed a statistical analysis of the actual rhymes of the ''Shijing'', which supported the new groups with varying degrees of confidence.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=367–564}}

Baxter's final consonants were those of Middle Chinese, plus *-wk (an allophone of *-kʷ), optionally followed by a post-coda *-ʔ or *-s.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=181–183}}

Baxter also speculated on the possibility of a glottal stop occurring after oral stop finals.
The evidence is limited, and consists mainly of contacts between rising tone syllables and ''-k'' finals, which could alternatively be explained as phonetic similarity.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=323–324}}

=== Zhengzhang (1981–1995) ===
[[Zhengzhang Shangfang]] published his ideas in a series of articles in Chinese provincial journals, which were not widely disseminated.  Some of his notes were translated into English by [[Laurent Sagart]] in 2000.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|p=vii}}  He published a monograph in 2003.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2003}}

Zhengzhang's reconstruction incorporates a suggestion by [[Pan Wuyun]] that the three Middle Chinese laryngeal initials are reflexes of uvular stops in Old Chinese, and thus parallel to the other sets of stops.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|p=14}}
He argues that Old Chinese lacked affricate initials, and that the Middle Chinese affricates reflect Old Chinese clusters of *s- and other consonants, yielding the following inventory of initial consonants:{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|p=18}}

Zhengzhang's *w medial could occur only after velar and uvular initials, matching the labio-velar and labio-laryngeal initials of other reconstructions.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|p=25}}
Instead of marking type B syllables with a *-j- medial, he treated type A syllables as having long vowels.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=48–53}}

Zhengzhang also refined the traditional rhyme classes to obtain a six-vowel system similar to those of Baxter and Starostin, but with *ɯ corresponding to Baxter's *ɨ and Starostin's *ə:{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=33–43}}

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 9em; text-align: center;"
| *i || *ɯ || *u
|-
| *e || *a || *o
|}

Zhengzhang argued that the final stops of Old Chinese were voiced, like those of [[Old Tibetan]].{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=60–61}}
He accepted the consonantal origin of Middle Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=63–68}}

=== Baxter–Sagart (2014) ===
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] concluded his review of {{harvp|Baxter|1992}} with the words:
{{quote|A reader of Baxter's book is left with the impression that he has pushed the traditional approach to its limits and that any further progress in the field will have to be based on a quite different methodological approach.{{sfnp|Norman|1993|p=705}}}}
Baxter has attempted a new approach in collaboration with [[Laurent Sagart]], who had used a variant of Baxter's system in a study of the [[derivational morphology]] of Old Chinese.{{sfnp|Sagart|1999}}
They used additional evidence, including word relationships deduced from these morphology theories, Norman's reconstruction of [[Proto-Min]], divergent Chinese varieties such as [[Waxiang]], early loans to other languages, and character forms in [[bamboo and wooden slips|recently unearthed documents]].{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=3–4, 30–37}}
They also sought to apply the [[hypothetico-deductive method]] to linguistic reconstruction: instead of insisting on deducing patterns from data, they proposed hypotheses to be tested against data.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=4–6}}

The initial consonants of the revised system largely correspond to those of Baxter (1992) apart from the dropping of the rare initials *z, *j and *hj.
Instead of marking type B syllables with a *-j- medial, they treated type A syllables as having [[pharyngealize]]d initials, adapting a proposal of Jerry Norman, and thus doubled the number of initials.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=43, 68–76}}{{efn|Norman originally proposed pharyngealization only in type A syllables without retroflexion (the *-r- medial).{{sfnp|Norman|1994}}}}
They also adopted the proposal of [[Pan Wuyun]] to recast the laryngeal initials as [[uvular stop]]s, though they retained a separate glottal stop.{{sfnp|Sagart|2007}}

They propose the uvular initial {{IPA|*ɢ}} as a second source of the Middle Chinese palatal initial in addition to {{IPA|*l}}, so that series linking Middle Chinese ''y-'' with velars or laryngeals instead of dentals are reconstructed as uvulars rather than laterals, for example{{sfnp|Sagart|2007}}

Baxter and Sagart retained the six-vowel system, though re-casting *ɨ as *ə.
The finals consonants were unchanged except for the addition of a final *r in syllables showing connections between final consonants ''-j'' and ''-n'' in Middle Chinese, as suggested by [[Sergei Starostin]].{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=252–268}}

The major departure from Baxter's system lay in the structure of roots proposed by Sagart, in which roots could comprise either a monosyllable or a syllable preceded by a preinitial consonant, in one of two patterns:{{sfnp|Sagart|1999|pp=14–15}}
* a "tightly attached" preinitial forming a consonant cluster, as in 肉 {{IPA|*k.nuk}} "flesh", 用 {{IPA|*m.loŋ-s}} "use" and 四 {{IPA|*s.lij-s}} "four", and
* a "loosely attached" preinitial, forming a minor syllable, as in 脰 {{IPA|*kə.dˤok-s}} "neck", 舌 {{IPA|*mə.lat}} "tongue" and 脣 {{IPA|*sə.dur}} "lip".
Similar root structures are found in the modern [[rGyalrong]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Atayal language|Atayal]] languages.{{sfnp|Sagart|1999|p=13}}
Sagart argued that such [[iamb (poetry)|iambic]] combinations, like single syllables, were written with single characters and also counted as a single foot in verse.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=53}}
The various initials are reconstructed based on comparisons with [[proto-Min language|proto-Min]] cognates and early loans to [[Hmong–Mien languages]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]:{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=83–99}}

== Comparison ==
The different reconstructions provide different interpretations of the relationships between the categories of Middle Chinese and the main bodies of ancient evidence: the phonetic series (used to reconstruct initials), and the ''Shijing'' rhyme groups (used to reconstruct finals).

=== Initials ===
Karlgren first stated the principle that words written with the same phonetic component had initials with a common point of articulation in Old Chinese.  Moreover, nasal initials seldom interchanged with other consonants.{{sfnp|Karlgren|1923|pp=17–18}}
Thus phonetic series can be placed into classes, depending on the range of Middle Chinese initials found in them, and these classes are presumed to correspond to classes of Old Chinese initials.{{sfnp|Branner|2011|pp=132–137}}
Where markedly different Middle Chinese initials occur together in a series, investigators have proposed additional consonants, or clusters of consonants, in Old Chinese.

=== Medials ===

Middle Chinese is usually reconstructed with two medials:
* ''-w-'' in ''Qieyun'' syllables classified as "closed" (合 ''hé'') in the [[Song dynasty]] rhyme tables, in contrast to "open" (開 ''kāi'') syllables,{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=32}} and
* ''-j-'' in syllables with division-III (or Type B) finals.
Karlgren projected both of these medials back to Old Chinese.
However, since the work of Yakhontov most reconstructions have omitted a *w medial but included [[labialised velar|labiovelar]] and labiolaryngeal initials.{{sfnp|Haudricourt|1954b|p=359}}{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=233–234}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=180}}
Most reconstructions since Pulleyblank have included a medial *r, but the *j medial has become more controversial.

==== Middle Chinese "divisions" ====

Karlgren noted that the [[Middle Chinese finals|finals of Middle Chinese]] can be divided into a number of classes, which combine with different groups of initials.
These distributional classes are partially aligned with the placement of finals in different rows of the Song dynasty [[rhyme table]]s.
As three classes of final occurred in the first, second and fourth rows respectively, he named them finals of divisions I, II and IV.
The remaining finals he called "division-III finals" because they occurred in the third row of the tables.
Some of these (the "pure" or "independent" division-III finals) occurred only in that row, while others (the "mixed" finals) could also occur in the second or fourth rows with some initials.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=24}}
Karlgren disregarded the ''[[chongniu]]'' distinction, but later workers have emphasized its importance.
[[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]], in a systematic comparison of the rhyme tables with a recently discovered early edition of the ''Qieyun'', identified seven classes of finals.
The table below lists the combinations of initial and final classes that occur in the ''Qieyun'', with the row of the rime tables in which each combination was placed:{{sfnp|Branner|2006|p=25}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=63–81}}

On the basis of these combinations, the initials of Old and Middle Chinese can be divided into two broad types: [[grave and acute|''grave'' initials]] (labials, velars and laryngeals), which combine with all types of finals, and ''acute'' initials (dentals and sibilants), with more restricted distribution.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=59–60}}

Karlgren derived the four divisions of Middle Chinese finals from the palatal medial and a range of Old Chinese vowels.
More recent reconstructions derive division II from an Old Chinese medial *r (given as *l in the early work of Yakhontov and Pulleyblank).
This segment also accounts for phonetic series contacts between stops and ''l-'', retroflex initials and (in some later work) the ''[[chongniu]]'' distinction.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=258–267, 280–282}}
Division III finals are generally held to represent a palatal element, at least in Middle Chinese.
Division I and IV finals have identical distributions in the rhyme dictionaries.{{sfnp|Branner|2006|pp=32–33}}
These two classes are believed to be primary, while the others were modified by medials.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=236–258}}

==== Type A and B syllables ====

A fundamental distinction within Middle Chinese is between division-III finals and the rest.
Most scholars believe that division-III finals were characterized by a palatal medial ''-j-'' in Middle Chinese.
Karlgren projected this medial back to a medial {{IPA|*-j-}} in Old Chinese (*-i̯- in Karlgren's notation), a position followed by most reconstructions up to the 1990s, including those of Li and Baxter.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=287–290}}

Other authors have suggested that the Middle Chinese medial was a secondary development not present in Old Chinese.
Evidence includes the use of syllables with division-III finals to transcribe foreign words lacking any such medial, the lack of the medial in Tibeto-Burman cognates and modern Min reflexes, and the fact that it is ignored in phonetic series.{{sfnp|Norman|1994|pp=400–402}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1977–1978|pp=183–185}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=95}}
However, it is generally agreed that syllables with division-III finals and other syllables, labelled types B and A respectively by Pulleyblank, were distinguished in Old Chinese, though scholars differ on how this distinction was realized.

Many realizations of the distinction have been proposed.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=288}}{{sfnp|Norman|1994|p=400}}
Starostin and Zhengzhang proposed that type A syllables were distinguished by longer vowels,{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|1991|pp=160–161}}{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=48–57}} the reverse of an earlier proposal by Pulleyblank.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1992|p=379}}{{sfnp|Handel|2003|p=550}}
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Norman]] suggested that type B syllables (his class C), which comprised over half of the syllables of the ''Qieyun'', were in fact [[markedness|unmarked]] in Old Chinese.  Instead, he proposed that the remaining syllables were marked by retroflexion (the {{IPA|*-r-}} medial) or [[pharyngealization]], either of which prevented palatalization in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|1994}}  Baxter and [[Laurent Sagart|Sagart]] adopted a variant of this proposal, reconstructing pharyngealized initials in all type A syllables.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=43, 68–76}}
The different realizations of the type A/B distinction are illustrated by the following reconstructions of Middle Chinese finals from one of the traditional Old Chinese rhyme groups:

=== Rhymes ===

Most workers assume that words that rhymed in the ''Shijing'' had the same main vowel and the same final consonant, though they differ on the particular vowels reconstructed.
The 31 traditional Old Chinese rhyme groups could thus be accounted for with four vowels, which Li Fang-Kuei reconstructed as {{IPA|*i}}, {{IPA|*u}}, {{IPA|*ə}} and {{IPA|*a}}.
However some of the rhyme groups reconstructed with {{IPA|*ə}} or {{IPA|*a}} gave rise to more than one Middle Chinese rhyme group.
To represent these distinctions, he also included three diphthongs {{IPA|*iə}}, {{IPA|*ia}} and {{IPA|*ua}}.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=243–247}}

In the early 1970s, [[Nicholas Bodman]] proposed a six-vowel system for an earlier stage of Chinese.{{sfnp|Bodman|1980|p=47}}
Applying Bodman's suggestion to Old Chinese, Zhengzhang Shangfang, [[Sergei Starostin]] and William Baxter argued that the 31 traditional rhyme groups should be split into more than 50 groups.{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|pp=42–43}}{{sfnp|Starostin|1989|pp=343–429}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=180, 253–254, 813}}
Baxter supported this thesis with a statistical analysis of the rhymes of the ''Shijing'', though there were too few rhymes with codas {{IPA|*-p}}, {{IPA|*-m}} and {{IPA|*-kʷ}} to produce statistically significant results.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=560–562}}

For the Old Chinese rhyme groups with nasal codas in Middle Chinese (the ''yáng'' 陽 groups), which are assumed to reflect nasal codas in Old Chinese, six-vowel systems produce a more balanced distribution, with five or six rhymes for each coda, and at most four different finals for in each rhyme:{{sfnp|Zhengzhang|2000|p=40}}
* a final of division I or IV, arising from a type A syllable without an *-r- medial,
* a final of division II, arising from a type A syllable with an *-r- medial,
* a mixed division III or ''chongniu''-3 final, arising from a type B syllable with an *-r- medial, and
* a pure division III or ''chongniu''-4 final, arising from a type B syllable without an *-r- medial.
In syllables with acute initials, the two types of type B final are not distinguished, and the presence or absence of the former *-r- medial is reflected by the initial.

Finals with stop codas (traditionally classified as the [[entering tone]]) generally parallel those with nasal codas, with the addition of three groups with Middle Chinese reflexes in ''-k''.

Some words in the ''Shijing'' 質 ''zhì'' and 物 ''wù'' rhyme groups have Middle Chinese reflexes in the departing tone, but otherwise parallel to those with dental finals.
Li followed Karlgren in reconstructing such words with an Old Chinese coda *-d.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=325–336}}
The suffix *-h in Li's notation is intended to represent the Old Chinese precursor to the Middle Chinese departing tone, without specifying how it was realized.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=248–250}}
The ''Shijing'' 祭 ''jì'' group has Middle Chinese reflexes in the departing tone only, including some finals that occur only in the departing tone (marked below with the suffix -H).
As the reflexes of this group parallel the ''Shijing'' 月 ''yuè'' group, Li reconstructed these also as *-dh.
Following a suggestion of [[André-Georges Haudricourt]], most recent reconstructions derive the Middle Chinese departing tone from an Old Chinese suffix *-s.
The coda *-ts is believed to have reduced to -j in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=308–319}}

Because the Middle Chinese reflexes of the ''gē'' 歌 rhyme group do not have a ''-j'' coda, Li reconstructed it with an Old Chinese coda *-r.{{sfnp|Li|1974–1975|pp=250–251, 265–266}}
However, many words in this group do have a ''-j'' coda in the colloquial layers of Min and Hakka varieties, in early loans into neighbouring languages, and in cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=294, 297}}

The '''''Revue de métaphysique et de morale''''' is a French [[philosophy journal]] co-founded in 1893 by [[Léon Brunschvicg]], [[Xavier Léon]] and [[Élie Halévy]]. The journal initially appeared six times a year, but since 1920 has been published quarterly.&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; It was the leading [[French-language]] journal for philosophical debates at the 20th century, hosting articles by [[Victor Delbos]], [[Bergson]], etc., and still exists today. 

Xavier Léon served as the first editor of the journal until his death in 1935, when he was succeeded by [[Dominique Parodi]].&lt;ref name=EncycPhil&gt;Paul Edwards, ed., ''The encyclopedia of philosophy'', vol. 6, 1967, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; On Parodi's death in 1955, the journal was headed by [[Jean Wahl]].&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;[http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Glossary.html Glossary of Terms and Concepts relevant to Durkheim]&lt;/ref&gt;

It published in 1906 [[Bertrand Russell]]'s article on the [[Berry paradox]], as well as articles by [[Louis Bachelier]], the [[logicist]] [[Jean Nicod]], the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Félix Ravaisson]], [[Célestin Bouglé]], [[Henri Delacroix]] (concerning [[William James]]), [[Louis Couturat]], [[Sully Prudhomme]], [[Henri Maldiney]], [[Francine Bloch]], [[Frédéric Rauh]], [[Jean Cavaillès]], [[Julien Benda]], [[Georges Poyer]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Georg Simmel]], etc. More recently: [[Barbara Cassin]], etc.

[[File:Fictional Map With Romer.jpg|right|250px]]

A '''Reference Card''' or '''"Romer"'''&lt;ref&gt;War Office, ''Manual of map reading, photo reading and field sketching 1929'', [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; is a device for increasing the accuracy when reading a [[grid reference]] from a [[map]]. Made from transparent plastic, paper or other materials, they are also found on most baseplate compasses. Essentially, it is a specially marked-out [[ruler]] which matches the scale of the map in use. The scales are laid out in reverse, such that by lining up the numbers given in the grid reference with the gridlines for the square in question, the corner of the Romer lies on the location whose [[grid reference]] you wish to read. Some transparent versions have a small hole at the origin when this is not at the corner of the Reference Card. This allows access to the map such that the location could be marked with a pencil if using the Reference Card in reverse having been given a [[grid reference]] to start with. They are used in many types of land navigation and map reading, to give a more accurate [[grid reference]] than one just estimated by eye from the grid lines on the map.

While Romers of various designs are available commercially, they can easily be made yourself; by hand, by using a computer or by finding a website&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080224023511/http://www.merlins-pyramid.com/bush/romer.html  archived copy of Merlin's Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt; with instructions.

Invented in 1915 by Temporary Lieutenant (later Captain) Carrol Romer, MC, RE (1883-1951), then “Maps”, First Army: i.e. OC Maps and Printing Section, such Reference Cards were widely used by the British Army in WW1 and after, being described in a Maps GHQ booklet ''Maps and Artillery Boards'' in December 1916: the name '''"Romer"''' seems only to have been used officially from 1929.&lt;ref&gt;R T Porter, ''Romer and his Romer'', Sheetlines (Journal of [https://charlesclosesociety.org/ The Charles Close Society]) 63, page 39, and ''Romer and his Romer: an Addendum'', Sheetlines 64, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;
  
A version was later developed for car navigational rallies by car rally partners Eric Gardner and John Cridford during the early 1950s, the 'Garford Romer' was available for both Imperial and Metric OS maps and is still sold today. Although a registered design when it was first made and sold it was and still is much copied.

The illustration below shows how the Romer is used. Here, we are plotting the reference 696018. The marks corresponding to (6, 8) on the Romer are lined up along the gridlines (69, 01). The hole near the corner yields the exact point, the church at Little Plumpton.

'''Schizoglossia''' is a linguistic term used to refer [[linguistic insecurity]] or language complex about one's [[mother language]]. The term was coined by [[Einar Haugen]] in 1962. &lt;ref&gt;Einar Haugen (1962) ''Schizoglossia and the Linguistic Norm'' [https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/555455/GURT_1962.pdf;sequence=1 Monograph Series on Languages and Linguistics] 
Georgetown University. Number 15-1962&lt;/ref&gt; 

Linguistic insecurity is common in societies where there are two language varieties and one is seen as incorrect and the other as proper. For example: Standard [[French language|French]] versus [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian French]] (often seen as a "[[Creole language|creole]]") or Standard [[American English]] versus [[African American Vernacular English|Afro-American English]]. In these cases, one variety is seen as "bad" and its speaker might want to correct some usages for some more prestigious alternatives. Those negative attitudes usually make the speakers ashamed of language usage that doesn't convey prestige, either openly or indirectly by using linguistic characteristics, such as pronunciation, of the other language.

'''Social Emergency Medicine''' is an emerging branch of [[Emergency Medicine]] that explores the interplay of social forces and the emergency care system, and how these act together to affect the health of individuals and their communities. Organized in 2009, the field has gained wider acceptance within the larger specialty of emergency medicine. Initiatives in social emergency medicine include research, direct service and advocacy in hunger, unstable housing, community violence&lt;ref&gt;Fahimi, Jahan, Emily Larimer, Walid Hamud-Ahmed, Erik Anderson, C.

'''''The Last Heathen: Encounters with Ghosts and Ancestors in Melanesia''''' is a book by [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], published in Canada by [[Douglas and McIntyre]] in 2004. In 2006 it was published in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] as ''The Shark God''.

''The Last Heathen'' is the autobiographical account of the author in his journey to [[Melanesia]], following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, [[Henry Montgomery (bishop)|Henry Montgomery]], [[Bishop of Tasmania]], and to study the effect of his great-grandfather's religion on the people. Montgomery traveled to Melanesia expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony. The book details his journey as well as his discoveries, from an atheistic point of view.

The book won the [[Charles Taylor Prize]] for Literary Non-fiction in 2005. The book has also won the [[Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize]].

'''''The Scarlet Plague''''' is a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]] novel written by [[Jack London]] and originally published in ''[[The London Magazine|London Magazine]]'' in 1912.

==Plot summary==
The story takes place in 2073, sixty years after an uncontrollable epidemic, the Red Death,&lt;ref&gt;[[Evening Standard]]; ''Back to the future again;'' November 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; has depopulated the planet. James Smith is one of the survivors of the era before the scarlet plague hit and is still left alive in the [[San Francisco]] area, and he travels with his grandsons Edwin, Hoo-Hoo, and Hare-Lip. His grandsons are young and live as primeval  [[hunter-gatherer]]s in a heavily depopulated world. Their intellect is limited, as are their language abilities. Edwin asks Smith, whom they call "Granser", to tell them of the disease alternately referred to as scarlet plague, scarlet death, or red death.

Smith recounts the story of his life before the plague, when he was an English professor. In 2013, the year after "Morgan the Fifth was appointed President of the United States by the Board of Magnates", the disease came about and spread rapidly. Sufferers would turn scarlet, particularly on the face, and become numb in their lower extremities. Victims usually died within 30 minutes of first seeing symptoms. Despite the public's trust in doctors and scientists, no cure is found, and those who attempted to do so were also killed by the disease. The grandsons question Smith's belief in "germs" causing the illness because they cannot be seen. 

Smith witnesses his first victim of the scarlet plague while teaching when a young woman's face turns scarlet. She dies quickly, and a panic soon overtakes the campus. He returns home but his family refuses to join him because they fear he is infected. Soon, an epidemic overtakes the area and residents begin rioting and killing one another. Smith meets with colleagues at his college's chemistry building, where they hope to wait out the problem. They soon realize they must move elsewhere for safety and begin trekking northward.

Eventually, Smith's entire party dies out and he is left as the sole survivor. He lives for three years on his own with the company of a pony and two dogs. Eventually, his need for social interaction compels him back to the San Francisco area in search of other people. He eventually discovers a sort of new society has been created with a few survivors, who have broken into tribes.

Smith worries that he is the last to remember the times before the plague. He reminisces about the quality of food, social classes, his job, and technology. As he realizes his time grows short, he tries to impart the value of knowledge and wisdom to his grandsons. His efforts are in vain, however, as the children ridicule his recollections of the past, which sound totally unbelievable to them.

==Publication history==
[[Image:Famous fantastic mysteries 194902.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''The Scarlet Plague'' was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]'']]
''The Scarlet Plague'' was written in 1910 but not serialized until the May–June 1912 issue of ''London Magazine''. It was published as a book in 1915 by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].

London published ''The Scarlet Plague'' in book form at a point in his career that biographers and critics have called a "professional decline", from September 1912 to May 1916. In this period, he stopped writing short works and shifted to longer works including ''[[The Abysmal Brute]]'' (1913), ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]]'' (1913), ''[[The Mutiny of the Elsinore (novel)|The Mutiny of the Elsinore]]'' (1914), ''[[The Star Rover]]'' (1915), among others.&lt;ref&gt;Reesman, Jeanne Campbell. ''Jack London's Racial Lives: A Critical Biography''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2009: 267. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2789-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Scarlet Plague'' was later reprinted in the February 1949 issue of ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]''.

Jack London was inspired in part by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1842 short story "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, J. R. ''An Edgar Allan Poe Companion: A Guide to the Short Stories, Romances and Essays''. London: The Macmillan Press Ltd, 1981: 78. {{ISBN|978-1-349-05027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Poe's story and London's fall into a genre of apocalyptic fiction featuring a universal plague that nearly wipes out humanity. Other examples include [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), [[George R. Stewart]]'s ''[[Earth Abides]]'' (1949), [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' (1969) and [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Elizabeth K.

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;
Keith David Wyma, ''Crucible of reason'', pp. 197, 221, 223, 225, 227 (Rowman and Littlefield 2004).  {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3538-1}}.

===In psychology===
{{Main|Volition (psychology)}}
Psychologist Avi Sion writes, "''Many psychological concepts may only be defined and explained with reference to velleity''." (''Emphasis in original''.)&lt;ref name=Sion&gt;Avi Sion, "Volition and allied causal concepts," p. 190 (2004). {{ISBN|978-2-9700091-6-0}}.

Also found at [http://www.thelogician.net/4b_volition/4b_chapter_09.htm The Logician website].  All accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example he cites is that "an ordinarily desirable object can only properly be called 'interesting' or 'tempting' to that [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] at that time, if he manifests some velleity...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;
He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

Kathy Kolbe also lists velleity as a "key concept of [[conation]]."&lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;See [http://www.kolbe.com/knol/keyConceptsOfConation.htm Kathy Kolbe's website page on Conation].  Accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Wall Street Reform''' or '''Financial Reform''' refers to reform of the financial industry and the [[Bank regulation in the United States|regulation]] of the financial industry in the [[United States]]. [[Wall Street]] is the home of the country's two largest [[stock exchange]]s, and "Wall Street" is a [[metonym]] for the American financial sector. Major Wall Street reform bills include the [[Federal Reserve Act]] of 1913, the [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933, the [[Truth in Lending Act]] of 1968, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999, and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]]. The most recent Wall Street reform bill, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], was signed by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] on July 22, 2010, following a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]].

== The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 ==
The [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933 placed a "wall of separation" between banks and brokerages, which was largely repealed by the [[Financial Services Modernization Act]] of 1999.  The bill was enacted during the [[Great Depression]], which began with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 repealed the "wall of separation," allowing companies to simultaneously act as [[commercial bank]]s, [[investment bank]]s, and [[insurance company|insurance companies]].  Though some commentators regard the restoration of the 1933 bill as crucial, even calling it "the most vital element of Wall Street reform",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/martens03262010.html|title=The Most Vital Ingredient in Wall Street Reform Goes Missing|author=Pam Martens|date=2010-03-26|publisher=CounterPunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Democratic leaders refused to allow an amendment by Rep. [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY) to restore Glass-Steagall as part of the 2009 Frank bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100111/scheer2|title=McCain Gets It, Obama Doesn't|author=Robert Scheer|publisher=The Nation|date=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinchey introduced his proposal as a separate bill, the Glass-Steagall Restoration Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4375:|title=[Text of H.R. 4375]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the "Volcker rule" proposed by the Obama administration has been described as a "new Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century", as it establishes stringent rules against banks using their own money to make risky investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/21/obama-banks-wall-street-reform|title=Obama announces dramatic crackdown on Wall Street banks: Obama's 'new Glass-Steagall Act' will prevent banks with customer deposits taking risky investment bets|author=Jill Treanor|publisher=The Guardian|date=2010-01-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ==
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], by Sen. [[Paul S. Sarbanes]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Maryland|MD]]) and Rep. [[Michael G. Oxley]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Ohio|OH]]), was signed into law by [[George W. Bush]] in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july02/b_ethics.html |title=Wall Street reform |date=August 2002 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617084215/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july02/b_ethics.html |archivedate=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.R.3763:|title=[Text of H.R. 3763 (6 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major [[accounting scandals|corporate and accounting scandals]] including those affecting [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]].

== Dodd-Frank (2010)==
{{Main|Obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009}}

As of May 2010, both the House and Senate bills had been passed, but the differences between the bills were to be worked out in [[United States congressional conference committee]]. Differences which must be resolved include:&lt;ref&gt;Indiviglio D. (2010). [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/05/the-conference-challenges-congress-faces-for-financial-reform/57241/ The Conference Challenges Congress Faces for Financial Reform]. ''The Atlantic''.&lt;/ref&gt;  whether the new consumer protection agency would be independent (Senate) or part of the [[Federal Reserve]];  whether to require banks to issue [[credit derivative]]s in separately capitalized [[subsidiary|affiliate]]s (Senate); how exactly the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) will wind down or bail out large institutions which fail; the circumstances under which large institutions could be broken up; a 15 to 1 leverage limit in the House bill; the terms of a Fed audit (continuous as in the House bill or one-time as in the Senate bill); both bills include the Volcker rule which prohibits [[proprietary trading]] by bank holding companies, but both have a caveat which allow for regulators to overrule the rule; both bills propose to regulate [[credit rating agencies]], but the Senate's bill is much stronger.

=== House bill ===
H.R. 4173, the [[Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2009 by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), passed by the House of Representatives in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4173:|title=[Text of H.R. 4173 (3 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awaiting action by the Senate as of April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show|title=H.R.4173 - Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009|publisher=OpenCongress.org|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/18/barney-frank-vs-the-credi_n_397404.html|title=Barney Frank Vs. The Credit Raters (VIDEO)|author=Ben Protess|publisher=Huffington Post Investigative Fund|date=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senate bill ===
{{Further|Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010}}
[[S.3217]] was introduced by [[Senate Banking Committee]] chairman [[Chris Dodd]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]) on April 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.3217:|title=[Text of S.3217]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dodd's bill included a $50 billion liquidation fund which drew criticism as a continuing bailout, which he was pressured to remove by Republicans and the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/17/white-house-signals-shift-on-wall-street-reform/|title=White House signals shift on Wall Street reform|date=2010-04-17|author=CNN Senior White House Correspondent [[Ed Henry]]|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senate bill passed on May 20, 2010.

=== Volcker Rule ===
{{Further|Volcker Rule}}
The "Volcker Rule" was proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] based on advice by [[Paul Volcker]], and a draft of the proposed legislation was prepared by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]].  It limited any one bank from holding more than 10% of FDIC-insured deposits, and prohibited any bank with a division holding such deposits from using its own capital to make speculative investments.  The Volcker rule faced heavy resistance in the Senate and was introduced as part of the subsequent Dodd bill only in a limited form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703503804575083823511212204|title='Volcker Rule' Stalls in Senate|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Damian Palmetta|date=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6224B920100303|title=Obama reasserts Volcker rule|author1=Kevin Drawbaugh  |author2=Karey Wutkowski |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2010-03-03|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62E5IZ20100315|title=Factbox: Key elements of Dodd's financial reform bill|publisher=Reuters|date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial Stability Oversight Council ===

Chaired by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], a new multi-authority oversight body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council of regulators will be established. The council will consist of nine members including regulators from the [[Federal Reserve System]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], and many other agencies.  The main purpose of the council is to identify risk in the [[Financial system]]. Also, the council will look at the interconnectivity of the highly leveraged financial firms and can ask companies to divest holdings if their structure poses a great threat to the Financial system. The council will have a solid control on the operations of the leveraged firms and also help in increasing the transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-15/congressional-overhaul-maps-the-future-of-financial-regulation.html|title='Congressional Overhaul Maps the Future of Financial Regulation'|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author1=David Scheer |author2=Gregory Mott |author3=Lawrence Roberts |date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wall Street Reform Plan (2016) for a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act ==

In 2016, 170 Economists, Financial Experts, and Academics Back Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Reform Plan. In the letter supporting Bernie Sander's Financial Reform Plan &lt;ref&gt;[https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wall-St-Letter-1.pdf], Economists and Financial Experts in Favor of Sen. Sanders' Wall St. Reforms&lt;/ref&gt;

''"In our view, Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another "too-big-to-fail" financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted.
Wall Street's largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks' potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient "living wills" for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis.
Secretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders' plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass Steagall."''

His body and belongings are displayed in the [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]] in [[Bolzano]], [[South Tyrol]], Italy.

==Discovery==
Ötzi was found on 19 September 1991 by two German tourists, at an elevation of {{convert|3210|m|ft}} on the east ridge of the [[Fineilspitze]] in the [[Ötztal Alps]] on the Austrian–Italian border. The tourists, Helmut and Erika Simon, were walking off the path between the mountain passes Hauslabjoch and Tisenjoch. They believed that the body was of a recently deceased mountaineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iceman.it/en/node/233 Description of the Discovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213024011/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/233 |date=13 December 2011 }} at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology web site&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a mountain [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] and the keeper of the nearby Similaunhütte first attempted to remove the body, which was frozen in ice below the torso, using a pneumatic drill and ice-axes, but had to give up due to bad weather. The next day, eight groups visited the site, among whom happened to be the famous mountaineers [[Hans Kammerlander]] and [[Reinhold Messner]]. The body was semi-officially extracted on 22 September and officially salvaged the following day. It was transported to the office of the medical examiner in [[Innsbruck]], together with other objects found. On 24 September the find was examined there by [[archaeologist]] Konrad Spindler of the [[University of Innsbruck]]. He dated the find to be "about four thousand years old", based on the typology of an axe among the retrieved objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Iceman: Uncovering the Life and Times of a Prehistoric Man Found in an Alpine Glacier |author=Brenda Fowler |page=37&amp;nbsp;''ff'' |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-25823-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Incredible Age of the Find |url=http://www.iceman.it/en/oetzi-age |publisher=[[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]] |date=2013 |accessdate=3 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624085502/http://www.iceman.it/en/oetzi-age |archivedate=24 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1919]], the border between [[North Tyrol|North]] and [[South Tyrol]] was defined as the [[drainage divide|watershed]] of the rivers [[Inn (river)|Inn]] and [[Etsch]]. However, near Tisenjoch the (now withdrawn) glacier complicated establishing the watershed at the time and the border was established too far north. Therefore, although Ötzi's find site drains to the Austrian side, surveys in October 1991 showed that the body had been located {{convert|92.56|m|yd|2}} inside Italian territory as delineated in 1919{{coord|46|46|45.8|N|10|50|25.1|E|display=title}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iceman.it/en/node/241 The Border Question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008075754/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/241 |date=8 October 2011 }}, at the museum site&lt;/ref&gt; The province of South Tyrol therefore claimed property rights, but agreed to let Innsbruck University finish its scientific examinations. Since 1998, it has been on display at the [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]] in [[Bolzano]], the capital of South Tyrol.

==Scientific analyses==
The corpse has been extensively examined, measured, [[X-ray]]ed, and dated. Tissues and intestinal contents have been examined microscopically, as have the items found with the body. In August 2004, frozen bodies of three [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] soldiers killed during the [[Battle of San Matteo]] (1918) were found on the mountain [[Punta San Matteo]] in [[Trentino]]. One body was sent to a museum in the hope that research on how the environment affected its preservation would help unravel Ötzi's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=WWI bodies are found on glacier|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3592268.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=23 August 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630025333/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3592268.stm|archivedate=30 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a [[X-ray computed tomography|CAT]] scan revealed that the stomach had shifted upward to where his lower lung area would normally be.

In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and [[barley]], and seeds of [[flax]] and [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] were discovered, as well as kernels of [[Prunus spinosa|sloes]] (small plumlike fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=A.G.

Pollen in the first meal showed that it had been consumed in a mid-altitude [[conifer]] forest, and other pollens indicated the presence of wheat and [[legume]]s, which may have been domesticated crops. Pollen grains of [[Ostrya|hop-hornbeam]] were also discovered. The pollen was very well preserved, with the cells inside remaining intact, indicating that it had been fresh (estimated about two hours old) at the time of Ötzi's death, which places the event in the spring, or early summer. Einkorn wheat is harvested in the late summer, and [[sloe]]s in the autumn; these must have been stored from the previous year.

High levels of both copper particles and [[arsenic]] were found in Ötzi's hair. This, along with Ötzi's copper axe blade, which is 99.7% pure copper, has led scientists to speculate that Ötzi was involved in copper [[smelting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iceman's final meal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2262615.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=16 September 2002|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330095330/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2262615.stm|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By examining the proportions of Ötzi's [[tibia]], [[femur]] and [[human pelvis|pelvis]], Christopher Ruff has determined that Ötzi's lifestyle included long walks over hilly terrain. This degree of mobility is not characteristic of other [[Copper Age]] Europeans. Ruff proposes that this may indicate that Ötzi was a high-altitude shepherd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Christopher Ruff|title=Body size, body proportions, and mobility in the Tyrolean "Iceman"|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=July 2006|volume=51|issue=1 |pages=91–101|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.02.001|pmid=16549104|last2=Holt|first2=BM|last3=Sládek|first3=V|last4=Berner|first4=M|last5=Murphy Jr|first5=WA|last6=Zur Nedden|first6=D|last7=Seidler|first7=H|last8=Recheis|first8=W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using modern 3-D technology, a facial reconstruction has been created for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. It shows Ötzi looking old for his 45 years, with deep-set brown eyes, a beard, a furrowed face, and sunken cheeks. He is depicted looking tired and ungroomed.&lt;ref name="disco"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rossella |last=Lorenzi |url=http://news.discovery.com/history/otzi-face-reconstruction-110225.html |title=The Iceman Mummy: Finally Face to Face |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |publisher=[[Discovery News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619001445/http://news.discovery.com/history/otzi-face-reconstruction-110225.html |archivedate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Ötzi apparently had [[whipworm]] (''Trichuris trichiura''), an intestinal [[parasite]]. During [[computed tomography|CT]] scans, it was observed that three or four of his right ribs had been cracked when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body. One of his fingernails (of the two found) shows three [[Beau's lines]] indicating he was sick three times in the six months before he died.

===Skeletal details and tattooing===
Ötzi had a total of 61 [[tattoo]]s (or [[Soot tattoo]]s), consisting of 19 groups of black lines ranging from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness and 7 to 40&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Samadelli |first=M |author2=M Melis |author3=M Miccoli |author4=E Egarter-Vigl |author5=AR Zink |title=Complete Mapping of the Tattoos of the 5300-year-old Tyrolean Iceman |journal=Journal of Cultural Heritage |date=2015 |volume=16 |number=5 |pages=753–758 |doi=10.1016/j.culher.2014.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include groups of parallel lines running along the longitudinal axis of his body and to both sides of the [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar spine]], as well as a [[cruciform]] mark behind the right knee and on the right ankle, and parallel lines around the left wrist.

[[Radiology|Radiological]] examination of Ötzi's bones showed "age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration" corresponding to many tattooed areas, including [[osteochondrosis]] and slight [[spondylosis]] in the lumbar spine and wear-and-tear degeneration in the knee and especially in the ankle joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spindler|first=Konrad|title=The man in the ice|year=1995|publisher=Phoenix|isbn=0-7538-1260-6|pages=178–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that these tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to [[acupressure]] or [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name="redorbit.com"/&gt; If so, this is at least 2,000 years before their previously known earliest use in China (c. 1000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dorfer|first=L |author2=M Moser |author3=F Bahr |author4=K Spindler |author5=E Egarter-Vigl |author6=S Giullén |author7=G Dohr |author8=T Kenner |title=A medical report from the stone age? |journal=The Lancet|date=September 1999 |volume=354 |pages=1023–1025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12242-0 |pmid=10501382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research into archaeological evidence for ancient tattooing has confirmed that Ötzi is the oldest tattooed human mummy yet discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113410697/its-official-otzi-the-iceman-has-the-oldest-tattoos-in-the-world-111115/ |title=It’s official: Ötzi the Iceman has the oldest tattoos in the world |last1=Deter-Wolf |first1=Aaron |date=11 November 2015 |access-date=16 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115131532/http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113410697/its-official-otzi-the-iceman-has-the-oldest-tattoos-in-the-world-111115/ |archivedate=15 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tattoo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deter-Wolf |first=Aaron |last2=Robitaille |first2=Benoît |last3=Krutak |first3=Lars |last4=Galliot |first4=Sébastien |title=The World's Oldest Tattoos |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science:Reports |volume=5 |pages=19–24 |date=February 2016 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15301772 |doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothes and shoes===

Ötzi wore a cloak made of woven grass&lt;ref&gt;In the book ''Cookwise'' by Shirley Corriher, the point is made (in relation to cooking) that plant leaves have a waterproof, waxy [[cuticle]] which makes raindrops roll off, with the comment "it was interesting that the 5,000-year-old Alpine traveler&amp;nbsp;... had a grass raincoat": {{citation|author=Shirley O. Corriher|authorlink=Shirley Corriher|title=Cookwise: The Hows and Whys of Successful Cooking|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]]|year=1997|page=312|isbn=978-0-688-10229-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a coat, a belt, a pair of leggings, a loincloth and shoes, all made of leather of different skins. He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for walking across the snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, leggings and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with [[sinew]]. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, drill, flint flake, bone awl and a dried fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iceman.it/en/node/275|title=The Belt and Pouch|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology|access-date=23 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311083938/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/275|archivedate=11 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoes have since been reproduced by a Czech academic, who said that "because the shoes are actually quite complex, I'm convinced that even 5,300 years ago, people had the equivalent of a [[Shoemaker|cobbler]] who made shoes for other people". The reproductions were found to constitute such excellent footwear that it was reported that a Czech company offered to purchase the rights to sell them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Katka Krosnar|title=Now you can walk in footsteps of 5,000-year-old Iceman – wearing his boots|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1494238/Now-you-can-walk-in-footsteps-of-5000-year-old-Iceman-wearing-his-boots.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 July 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175118/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1494238/Now-you-can-walk-in-footsteps-of-5000-year-old-Iceman-wearing-his-boots.html|archivedate=29 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent hypothesis by British archaeologist [[Jacqui Wood]] says that Ötzi's "shoes" were actually the upper part of [[snowshoes]]. According to this theory, the item currently interpreted as part of a "backpack" is actually the wood frame and netting of one snowshoe and animal hide to cover the face.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The leather loincloth and hide coat were made from sheepskin. Genetic analysis showed that the sheep species was nearer to modern domestic European sheep than to wild sheep; the items were made from the skins of at least four animals. Part of the coat was made from domesticated goat belonging to a mitochondrial [[haplogroup]] (a common female ancestor) that inhabits central Europe today. The coat was made from several animals from two different species and was stitched together with hides available at the time. The leggings were made from domesticated goat leather. A similar set of 6,500-year-old leggings discovered in Switzerland were made from goat leather which may indicate the goat leather was specifically chosen.

Shoelaces were made from the European genetic population of cattle. The quiver was made from wild [[roe deer]],  the fur hat was made from a genetic lineage of [[brown bear]] which lives in the region today. Writing in the journal ''[[Scientific Reports]]'', researchers from Ireland and Italy reported their analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]], that was extracted from nine fragments from six of his garments, including his loin cloth and fur cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/18/it-becometh-the-iceman-otzi-clothing-study-reveals-stylish-secrets-of-leather-loving-ancient|title=It becometh the iceman: clothing study reveals stylish secrets of leather-loving ancient|first=Nicola|last=Davis|archive-date=18 August 2016|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=30 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830164637/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/18/it-becometh-the-iceman-otzi-clothing-study-reveals-stylish-secrets-of-leather-loving-ancient|date=30 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/otzi-iceman-european-alps-mummy-clothing-dna-leather-fur-archaeology|title=Here's What the Iceman Was Wearing When He Died 5,300 Years Ago|first=Kristin|last=Romey|date=18 August 2016|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|access-date=18 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819105927/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/otzi-iceman-european-alps-mummy-clothing-dna-leather-fur-archaeology/|archivedate=19 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Sullivan|first=Niall J.|last2=Teasdale|first2=Matthew D.|last3=Mattiangeli|first3=Valeria|last4=Maixner|first4=Frank|last5=Pinhasi|first5=Ron|last6=Bradley|first6=Daniel G.|last7=Zink|first7=Albert|date=18 August 2016|title=A whole mitochondria analysis of the Tyrolean Iceman’s leather provides insights into the animal sources of Copper Age clothing|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31279|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep31279|issn=2045-2322|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818215749/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31279|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools and equipment===
[[File:ReconstructedOetziAxe.jpg|upright|thumb|A replica of Ötzi's copper axe]]
Other items found with the Iceman were a copper axe with a [[Taxus baccata|yew]] handle, a [[chert]]-bladed [[knife]] with an [[ash tree|ash]] handle and a [[quiver]] of 14 arrows with [[viburnum]] and [[dogwood]] shafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/science/otzi-iceman-tools.html?rref=collection/column/trilobites|title=The Final Hours of the Iceman’s Tools|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetragliaWierer2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petraglia|first1=Michael D.|last2=Wierer|first2=Ursula|last3=Arrighi|first3=Simona|last4=Bertola|first4=Stefano|last5=Kaufmann|first5=Günther|last6=Baumgarten|first6=Benno|last7=Pedrotti|first7=Annaluisa|last8=Pernter|first8=Patrizia|last9=Pelegrin|first9=Jacques |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198292 |title=The Iceman’s lithic toolkit: Raw material, technology, typology and use|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=13|issue=6|year=2018|pages=e0198292|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0198292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the arrows, which were broken, were tipped with flint and had [[fletching]] (stabilizing fins), while the other 12 were unfinished and untipped.

In addition, among Ötzi's possessions were [[berry|berries]], two [[birch bark]] baskets, and two species of [[polypore]] [[mushroom]]s with leather strings through them. One of these, the [[birch bracket|birch fungus]], is known to have [[anthelmintic]] properties, and was probably used for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref name="pmid9851424"&gt;{{Citation |author=Capasso L |title=5300 years ago, the Ice Man used natural laxatives and antibiotics |journal=Lancet |volume=352 |issue=9143 |pages=1864 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9851424 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79939-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(05)79939-6 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;!-- note: title of this letter is not relevant to its content --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The other was a type of [[tinder fungus]], included with part of what appeared to be a complex [[firelighting]] kit. The kit featured pieces of over a dozen different plants, in addition to flint and [[pyrite]] for creating sparks.

Ötzi's copper [[axe]] was of particular interest. His axe's [[Axe#Parts of the axe|haft]] is {{convert|60|cm|in}} long and made from carefully worked [[Taxus#Uses and traditions|yew]] with a right-angled crook at the shoulder, leading to the blade. The {{convert|9.5|cm|in}} long axe head is made of almost pure copper, produced by a combination of [[casting]], cold [[forging]], polishing, and sharpening. Despite the fact that copper ore sources in the Alpines are known to have been exploited at the time, a study indicated that the copper in the axe came from southern [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/07/copper-axe-owned-neolithic-hunter-otzi-iceman-came-way-tuscany/|title=Copper axe owned by Neolithic hunter Ötzi the Iceman came all the way from Tuscany|first=Nick|last=Squires|date=7 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107080026/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/07/copper-axe-owned-neolithic-hunter-otzi-iceman-came-way-tuscany/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was let into the forked end of the crook and fixed there using [[birch-tar]] and tight leather [[Lashing (ropework)|lashing]].

===Genetic analysis===
Ötzi's full genome has been sequenced; the report on this was published on 28 February 2012.&lt;ref name="keller2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keller |first1=Andreas |last2=Graefen |first2=Angela |last3=Ball |first3=Markus |last4=Matzas |first4=Mark |last5=Boisguerin |first5=Valesca |last6=Maixner |first6=Frank |last7=Leidinger |first7=Petra |last8=Backes |first8=Christina |last9=Khairat |first9=Rabab |last10=Forster |first10=Michael |last11=Stade |first11=Björn |last12=Franke |first12=Andre |last13=Mayer |first13=Jens |last14=Spangler |first14=Jessica |last15=McLaughlin |first15=Stephen |last16=Shah |first16=Minita |last17=Lee |first17=Clarence |last18=Harkins |first18=Timothy T. |last19=Sartori |first19=Alexander |last20=Moreno-Estrada |first20=Andres |last21=Henn |first21=Brenna |last22=Sikora |first22=Martin |last23=Semino |first23=Ornella |last24=Chiaroni |first24=Jacques |last25=Rootsi |first25=Siiri |last26=Myres |first26=Natalie M. |last27=Cabrera |first27=Vicente M. |last28=Underhill |first28=Peter A. |last29=Bustamante |first29=Carlos D. |last30=Vigl |first30=Eduard Egarter |display-authors=2 |date=28 February 2012 |title=New insights into the Tyrolean Iceman's origin and phenotype as inferred by whole-genome sequencing |journal=Nature Communications |volume=3 |page=698 |doi=10.1038/ncomms1701 |pmid=22426219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Y-DNA]] of Ötzi belongs to a [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|subclade of G]] defined by the SNPs M201, P287, P15, L223 and L91 (G-L91, ISOGG G2a2b, former "G2a4"). He was not typed for any of the subclades downstreaming from G-L91. G-L91 is now mostly found in South [[Corsica]].

Analysis of his [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that Ötzi belongs to the K1 subclade, but cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade (K1a, K1b or K1c).

A 2012 paper by [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[John D.

In October 2013, it was reported that 19 modern [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] men were descendants of Ötzi, or of a close relative of Ötzi. Scientists from the Institute of Legal Medicine at [[Innsbruck Medical University]] had analysed the DNA of over 3,700 Tyrolean male blood donors and found 19 who shared a particular genetic mutation with the 5,300-year-old man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=10 October 2013|title=Link to Oetzi the Iceman found in living Austrians|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24477038|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043826/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24477038|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood===
In May 2012, scientists announced the discovery that Ötzi still had intact blood cells. These are the oldest complete human blood cells ever identified. In most bodies this old, the blood cells are either shrunken or mere remnants, but Ötzi's have the same dimensions as living red blood cells and resembled a modern-day sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120502-oldest-blood-otzi-iceman-mummy-oetzi-zink-science/|title=World's Oldest Blood Found in Famed "Iceman" Mummy|first=James|date=2 May 2012|work=National Geographic|author=Owen|accessdate=4 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062603/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120502-oldest-blood-otzi-iceman-mummy-oetzi-zink-science/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janko|first=Marek|last2=Stark|first2=Robert W.|last3=Zink|first3=Albert|date=7 October 2012|title=Preservation of 5300 year old red blood cells in the Iceman|journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface / the Royal Society|volume=9|issue=75|pages=2581–2590|doi=10.1098/rsif.2012.0174|issn=1742-5662|pmc=3427508|pmid=22552923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''H. pylori'' analysis===
In 2016, researchers reported on a study from the extraction of twelve samples from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] of Ötzi to analyze the origins of the ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' in his gut.&lt;ref name="Maixner 2016"/&gt; The ''H. pylori'' strain found in his gastrointestinal tract was, surprisingly, the hpAsia2 strain, a strain today found primarily in South Asian and Central Asian populations, with extremely rare occurrences in modern European populations.&lt;ref name="Maixner 2016"/&gt;  The strain found in Ötzi's gut is most similar to three modern individuals from Northern India; the strain itself is, of course, older than the modern Northern Indian strain.&lt;ref name="Maixner 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maixner|first1=Frank|last2=Krause-Kyora|first2=Ben|title=The 5300-year-old Helicobacter pylori genome of the Iceman|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=8 Jan 2016|volume=351|issue=6269|doi=10.1126/science.aad2545|pages=162–165|pmid=26744403|pmc=4775254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi [[Exsanguination|bled to death]] after the arrow shattered the [[scapula]] and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt;

Recent DNA analyses claim they revealed traces of blood from at least four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-08-11-iceman-murder_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com – 'Iceman' was murdered, science sleuths say|author=|work=usatoday.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627042824/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-08-11-iceman-murder_x.htm|archivedate=27 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fagan|first1=Brian M.|last2=Durrani|first2=Nadia|title=In the Beginning: An Introduction to Archaeology|date=25 September 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317346432|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNOPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205093054/https://books.google.com/books?id=rNOPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303|archivedate=5 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, and was able to retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back.&lt;ref name="Mummy Tombs: Scientific Studies"/&gt; Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and [[rigor mortis]] set in, the Iceman was turned onto his stomach in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Rossella Lorenzi|title=Blow to head, not arrow, killed Otzi the iceman|url=http://abc.net.au/science/news/stories/2007/2020609.htm?health|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=31 August 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011190231/http://abc.net.au/science/news/stories/2007/2020609.htm?health|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}; {{citation|author=Nicole Winfield|title=Ancient murder mystery takes new turn|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20495781/?GT1=10252|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=30 August 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901210135/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20495781/?GT1=10252|archivedate=1 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was proposed that Ötzi died at a much lower altitude and was buried higher in the mountains, as posited by archaeologist Alessandro Vanzetti of the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vanzetti, M. Vidale, M. Gallinaro, D.W. Frayer, and L. Bondioli.

==Legal dispute==
Italian law entitled the Simons to a finders' fee from the South Tyrolean provincial government of 25% of the value of Ötzi. In 1994 the authorities offered a "symbolic" reward of 10 million [[Italian lira|lire]] (€5,200), which the Simons turned down.&lt;ref name="BBC 20080929"&gt;{{citation|title='Iceman' row ends after 17 years|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7643286.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=29 September 2008|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930070344/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7643286.stm|archivedate=30 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Simons filed a [[lawsuit]] which asked a court in [[Bolzano]] to recognize their role in Ötzi's discovery and declare them his "official discoverers". The court decided in the Simons' favor in November 2003, and at the end of December that year the Simons announced that they were seeking US$300,000 as their fee. The provincial government decided to appeal.&lt;ref name="Mummy Tombs"&gt;{{citation|author=James M. Deem|title=Ötzi: Iceman of the Alps: Finder's fee lawsuits|url=http://mummytombs.com/otzi/lawsuit.htm|publisher=Mummy Tombs|date=September 2008|accessdate=1 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102055614/http://www.mummytombs.com/otzi/lawsuit.htm|archivedate=2 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, two people came forward to claim that they were part of the same mountaineering party that came across Ötzi and discovered the body first:

*Magdalena Mohar Jarc, a retired [[Slovenia]]n climber, who alleged that she discovered the corpse first after falling into a crevice, and shortly after returning to a mountain hut, asked Helmut Simon to take photographs of Ötzi. She cited Reinhold Messner, who was also present in the mountain hut, as the witness to this.&lt;ref name=Jarc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gore-ljudje.net/novosti/39391/ |title=Magdaleni ne bodo plačali za Ötzija |trans-title=Magdalena Won't Get Paid for Ötzi |newspaper=Slovenske novice |date=9 October 2008 |language=Slovenian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518064420/http://www.gore-ljudje.net/novosti/39391/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sandra Nemeth, from Switzerland, who contended that she found the corpse before Helmut and Erika Simon, and that she spat on Ötzi to make sure that her [[DNA]] would be found on the body later. She asked for a DNA test on the remains, but experts believed that there was little chance of finding any trace.&lt;ref name="Telegraph: Cold Case"&gt;{{citation|author=Nick Pisa|title=Cold case comes to court – After 5,300 years|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1501326/Cold-case-comes-to-court---after-5300-years.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 October 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206113514/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1501326/Cold-case-comes-to-court---after-5300-years.html|archivedate=6 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the rival claims were heard by a Bolzano court. The legal case angered Mrs. Simon, who alleged that neither woman was present on the mountain that day.&lt;ref name="Telegraph: Cold Case"/&gt; In 2005, Mrs. Simon's lawyer said: "Mrs. Simon is very upset by all this and by the fact that these two new claimants have decided to appear 14 years after Ötzi was found."&lt;ref name="Telegraph: Cold Case"/&gt; In 2008, however, Jarc stated for a Slovene newspaper that she wrote twice to the Bolzano court in regard to her claim but received no reply whatsoever.&lt;ref name=Jarc /&gt;

In 2004, Helmut Simon died. Two years later, in June 2006, an appeals court affirmed that the Simons had indeed discovered the Iceman and were therefore entitled to a finder's fee. It also ruled that the provincial government had to pay the Simons' legal costs. After this ruling, Mrs. Erika Simon reduced her claim to €150,000. The provincial government's response was that the expenses it had incurred to establish a museum and the costs of preserving the Iceman should be considered in determining the finder's fee. It insisted it would pay no more than €50,000. In September 2006, the authorities appealed the case to Italy's highest court, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref name="Mummy Tombs"/&gt;

On 29 September 2008 it was announced that the provincial government and Mrs. Simon had reached a settlement of the dispute, under which she would receive €150,000 in recognition of Ötzi's discovery by her and her late husband and the tourist income that it attracts.&lt;ref name="BBC 20080929"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nick Squires|title=Oetzi The Iceman's discoverers finally compensated: A bitter dispute over the payment of a finder's fee for two hikers who discovered the world famous Oetzi The Iceman mummy has finally been settled|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/3105153/Oetzi-the-icemans-discoverers-finally-compensated.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 September 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002035714/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/3105153/Oetzi-the-icemans-discoverers-finally-compensated.html|archivedate=2 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Ötzi's curse"==
Influenced by the "[[Curse of the pharaohs]]" and the media theme of cursed mummies, claims have been made that Ötzi is [[curse]]d. The allegation revolves around the deaths of several people connected to the discovery, recovery and subsequent examination of Ötzi. It is alleged that they have died under mysterious circumstances. These persons include co-discoverer Helmut Simon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iceman's finder missing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/austria/article/0,,1330689,00.html|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 October 2004|author1=Reuters in Vienna}}; {{citation|author=Stephen Goodwin|title=Helmut Simon: Finder of a Bronze Age man in the alpine snow &amp;#91;obituary&amp;#93;|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article30165.ece|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=25 October 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001130155/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article30165.ece|archivedate=1 October 2007|df=dmy-all|access-date=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Konrad Spindler, the first examiner of the mummy in Austria in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Barbara McMahon|title=Scientist seen as latest 'victim' of Iceman|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/sciences/story/0,,1463998,00.html|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209193306/http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/sciences/story/0,,1463998,00.html|archivedate=9 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the deaths of seven people, of which four were accidental, have been attributed to the alleged curse. In reality hundreds of people were involved in the recovery of Ötzi and are still involved in studying the body and the artifacts found with it. The fact that a small percentage of them have died over the years has not been shown to be statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.iceman.it/en/oetzi-curse | title = Is there an Ötzi curse? | work = Ötsi – the Iceman | publisher = [[South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology]] | accessdate = 15 August 2012 | quote = hundreds of people have worked on the Iceman project, and many years have passed since the corpse was first discovered.
