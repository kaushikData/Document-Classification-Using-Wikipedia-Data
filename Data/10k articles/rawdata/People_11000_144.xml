'''Alberto Bayo y Giroud''' (1892 in [[Camagüey]] &amp;ndash; 1967 in [[Havana]]) was a [[Cuba]]n [[military]] leader of the defeated [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Second Spanish Republic|Loyalists]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He was also a poet and essayist.

He was born in [[Cuba]] and studied in the [[United States]] and [[Spain]]. Bayo's most significant action during the Spanish Civil War was his [[Battle of Majorca|invasion and retreat]] from the islands of [[Ibiza]] and [[Majorca]].

After that war was lost, Bayo had a furniture factory in [[Mexico]], and is said to have been an instructor at the Military Academy of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]]. Bayo had contact in Mexico with prominent [[Latin America]]n revolutionaries, and was associate/mentor of some, including [[Ernesto Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]]. While it is not known if he continued direct contact with [[Soviet Union]] agents such as "Comandante Carlos Contreras" [[Vittorio Vidali]] after the war was lost in Spain, both were present in Mexico for throughout the same period.

Alberto Bayo died a General of the [[Military of Cuba|Cuban Armed Forces]].

'''Ahmadou''' (var. ''Amadou''), was one of the last ''[[Almami]]s'' (r. 1873&amp;ndash;1896) of the [[Fula people|Fula]] [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]], in the [[Futa Jallon]] region of today's [[Guinea]].

Ahmadou signed agreements with French representatives [[Aimé Olivier de Sanderval]] (10 July 1881, to build a rail line), Beckmann (14 December 1891), and Alby (23 May 1893 to create a protectorate like status).  Though resisting explicit protectorate status or the appointment of a permanent French representative in the Fouta Djallon capital of [[Timbo]], these agreements were the first steps to French direct control of the state.  

In 1898 French colonial troops defeated the last Almamy [[Boubacar Biro Barry]], dismantled the state and integrated it into their new colony of [[Rivières du Sud]], which became Guinea.

'''Biker Boy''' is a [[fiction]]al superhero character created and portrayed by [[Zach Cone]].  Biker Boy promotes [[bicycle|bicycling]] as an alternative to walking and driving, and primarily aims to increase the use of [[Bicycle helmet|helmets]], among both children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Cain, [http://dailyfreepress.com/2010/04/21/menino-hosts-bicycle-safety-summit-at-bu/ "Menino hosts Bicycle Safety Summit at BU"], ''The Daily Free Press'' (Boston University newspaper), April 21, 2010.  (accessed June 4, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Biker Boy is based in [[Greater Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where he frequents local biking areas to spread awareness for bicycle safety.

==Character==
Biker Boy is a fictional superhero who protects and serves the bicycling community.  He was invented by Zach Cone, who did not initially intend to play the character as well.  "I began telling stories to the kids about superheroes", Cone states in an interview with ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. " That's when I made up this character, Biker Boy, whose bike has magical powers that tells him if someone's in trouble. The kids loved it. They thought it was real and that I was Biker Boy, even though I told them I wasn't."  Biker Boy has also recorded voice announcement's for Boston's [[MBTA]] train and bus services, promoting bicycling as an alternative method of transportation.  The recording was a part of a larger initiative by mayor [[Thomas Menino]] to make Boston a more bike-friendly city.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Moskowitz, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/04/25/bike_safety_efforts_pick_up_pace_in_city/?page=2 "Bike safety efforts pick up pace in city"], ''The Boston Globe'', April 25, 2010.  (accessed June 4, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Biker Boy has been consistently noted for his red cape.

==Zach Cone==
Zach Cone (born July 26, 1983), is a certified [[pre-kindergarten]] teacher.  He attended [[Brookline High School]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], where he realized he could sleep longer by biking to school.  Cone began teaching pre-school while he was in college, often telling the students superhero stories.  He invented Biker Boy originally as an external character, but the students thought he was talking about himself, hence Cone eventually assuming the role of Biker Boy himself. Cone states on the development of his character, "Six months ago I drove cross-country with some friends. We brought our bikes so we could ride as much as possible. That's when I realized Boston has a lot of work to do to be a bike friendly city and I decided to be part of the solution."

When asked, "How are you the solution to Boston's bicycle problem?" Cone, as Biker Boy, immediately responded "I talk to people politely. There's too much anger in the first place. And I encourage them to wear helmets."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Simmons, [http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/arlington/2010/06/on_biking_have_no_fear_biker_b.html "On Biking: Have no fear, Biker Boy is here"], ''The Boston Globe'', June 2, 2010.  (accessed 2 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Franke''' (born 6 April 1953, [[Berlin]]) is a German musician and composer. From 1971 to 1987 he was a member of the electronic group [[Tangerine Dream]]. Initially a drummer with The Agitation, later renamed [[Agitation Free]], his primary focus eventually shifted to keyboards and synthesizers as the group moved away from its [[psychedelic rock]] origins. While he was not the first musician to use an [[analog sequencer]], he was probably the first to turn it into a live performance instrument, thus laying the rhythmic foundation for classic [[Tangerine Dream]] pieces and indeed for the whole [[Berlin School of electronic music|Berlin school]] sound.

After his departure from the group, he founded the [[Sonic Images]] record label, a [[new-age music]] label called [[Earthtone]] and the [[Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra]], and produced a number of solo music works. After leaving Tangerine Dream, his only live concert was on 9 October 1991 at the Astoria Theatre in London. He performed on stage with [http://DingDingMusic.com Edgar Rothermich] (a.k.a. Richard E. Roth) who is also his producer and engineer on all his solo projects and film music after 1990.

Franke moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to pursue film work. In 1995 he scored the [[AFI Conservatory|AFI]] short ''[[Requiem (1995 film)|Requiem]]''. He may be best known for composing the music for the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', as well as the score of the [[anime]] movie ''[[Tenchi Muyo! in Love]]'' and in 2005 the music for German musical ''[[Ludwig²]]'' (with [[Konstantin Wecker]]).

==Political career==
Crabiel was elected to the Milltown Borough Council in 1960, and was re-elected in 1963 and 1966.  He was elected Mayor in 1967 and was re-elected in 1970, 1973, and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David B. Crabiel|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/app/obituary.aspx?pid=120854979|website=Asbury Park Press|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Crabiel challenged ten-term Congressman [[Frank B. Thompson, Jr.]] in the 4th district Democratic primary.  He lost 11,317 (65%) to 6,063 (35%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=719276|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Middlesex County Board of Freeholders in 1978.

In 1986, Crabiel was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 12th district.  The race was designated as "targeted" by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]].&lt;ref name="Salmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salmore|first1=Stephen A.|title=Candidates, Parties, and Campaigns: Electoral Politics in America|date=1989|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=0871874849|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lost to four-term Republican incumbent [[Jim Courter]], 72,966 (63.5%) to 41,967 (36.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30743|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crabiel was defeated for re-election to a sixth term as Freeholder in the Republican landslide of 1991.  He was again elected in 1994, and re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Diane|title=Middlesex Freeholder Director David Crabiel is dead at 78|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/middlesex_county_freeholder_di.html|accessdate=7 December 2014|publisher=The Star-Ledger|date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in office, after winning his biggest election victory in November, 2008. Crabiel's death was unexpected, and he was replaced as freeholder director by Stephen J. Dalina.&lt;ref name="Racz2008"/&gt;

'''David ben Shimon''', also known as '''Tzuf Devash''' and the '''Radvash''' (1826 – 5 December 1879) was a rabbi who headed the [[Maghrebi Jews|North African Jewish]] community of Jerusalem in the [[Old Yishuv]] and established the neighbourhood [[Mahane Israel]].

==Personal life==
David ben Shimon was the son of a wealthy merchant in Morocco. He married Rachel, the daughter of Rabbi Masoud Tsabbach, and one of their children was Rabbi Rafael Aharon. A talented leader and a distinguished scholar, Ben Shimon attracted a large following at an early age. In 1854, at the age of twenty eight, he moved to Jerusalem together with several of his disciples, and he quickly became a leading figure within the Moroccan Jewish community.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;Greer Fay Cashman: [http://www.jpost.com/In-Jerusalem/Features/Restored-beyond-former-glory Restored beyond former glory] ''Jerusalem Post'' 06/09/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leichter&gt;Rabbi Yosef Leichter: [http://www.zomet.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=160&amp;ArticleID=7026 A Moroccan Lover of Zion] Zomet, Volume 1408: Va'era 26th of Tevet 5772/21 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem, his learning, his wisdom and his charisma attracted increasing numbers of followers. He established the [[Tzuf Dvash Synagogue]] in 1860, and participated in the establishment of [[Mishkenot Shaananim]]. Relations with the [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardi]] community, which ruled Jerusalem, became strained, as he felt they tried to master him. He decided to establish a community of his own, "Edah HaMaaravit B'Yerushalayim". Together with his followers, he settled in 1867 on a lot he had purchased outside the walls of the [[Old City of Jerusalem|Old City]], [[Mahane Israel]]. Two synagogues, several [[Beth midrash|Batei Medrash]] (houses of study), and other institutions were built there. His Moroccan followers were soon followed by Jews from other North African countries, who wished to brake away from the Sephardi yoke. The community was the first to brake off from the direct supervision of the Sephardic umbrella organization "Ha'Edah HaSfaradit B'Yerushalayim".&lt;ref name=jp /&gt;&lt;ref name=leichter /&gt;&lt;ref name=sarig&gt;Barak Sarig [http://www.tog.co.il/en/Article.aspx?id=559 Rabbi David ben Shimon – The 'Tzuf Devash'] Tog News 11/12/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He sent [[meshulach]]s (fundraisers for charity in the Holy land) to Jewish communities in Islamic countries, and used the money to aid the needy, as well as to build the institutions of his community. He opened a meat store where he would distribute meat to the poor, and he took care of widows and orphans. He reported all donations and expenses in a newsletter called ''Havatzelet''.&lt;ref name=jp /&gt;&lt;ref name=sarig /&gt;

Ben Shimon served as [[Rosh Yeshiva]], rabbi and [[posek]], and gave [[halacha|halachic]] rulings in his [[Beth Din]]. His reputation drew crowds from outside his community to hear him and study with him. The first six years, he was the leader at large for his community; thereafter he appointed a committee of seven rabbis who would assist him in leading the community. Sir [[Moses Montefiore]] also greatly assisted the community.&lt;ref name=jp /&gt;&lt;ref name=sarig /&gt;

==Books==
Ben Shimon planned a series of books about the holy land by the name of ''Shaarei Tzedek''. In 1862 he published the first volume, ''Shaar Hachatzer'' a collection of commentaries of the [[Chazal|Sages]] regarding the Holy Land, supplemented with his own commentaries. The second volume was published posthumously: ''Shaar Hamatarah'' on the laws of the land. The third book, ''Shaar Hakadim,'' with introductions about matters pertaining to Eretz Yisrael, was never printed. ''Shaar Hamifkad'' on the special traditions of the land was edited by the author's son Rabbi Rafael Aharon and was published in Egypt in 1908. ''Shaar Takdim'' is about the commandments of the land and ''Shaarei Tehilah'' contains prayers and songs for special occasions. Rabbi David's [[responsa]] were included in a book by his son named "Umitzur Devash." The divorce cases in which Rabbi David was involved are summarized in the book ''Shem Chadash,'' by his youngest son Rabbi Masoud. This book also includes the poetry written by Rabbi David, under the name "Shir Chadash."&lt;ref name=sarig /&gt;

Norte was the first Log Cabin Republican to remain an appointee under Democratic Governor Jerry Brown's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/GC_Committee_Membership.htm |title=Workforce Partners - Committee Membership |work=Employment Development Department |publisher=State of California |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Norte was involved in the [[Bobby Shriver]] for Santa Monica City Council Campaign and was one of about 10 named prominent community leader endorsers in Shriver's campaign literature.

Norte's career covers over twenty years of public service with Federal, State, and local government, including the [[US Defense Department]] and the [[New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blogcabinca.org/2007/08/27/the-gay-republican-takeover-spreads  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011044052/http://blogcabinca.org/2007/08/27/the-gay-republican-takeover-spreads |date=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norte holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey, and master's degree from [[New York University]]'s [[Robert F.

Don was employed by the City of West Hollywood's Department of Transportation and Public Works as Parking Services and Projects Officer for 27 years, and currently serves as Parking Manager for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Norte currently resides in Hollywood with his partner since high school, and now husband, Kevin.

In 2009, Norte was named the Program Chair of CPPAs 25th Annual Conference and secured San Francisco Assemblyperson [[Fiona Ma]] as the Keynote Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parking-net.com/News/30974/Assembly-member-Fiona-Ma-Set-As-Keynote-Speaker-for-California-Public-Parking-Associations-25th-Annual-Conference |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131081542/http://www.parking-net.com/News/30974/Assembly-member-Fiona-Ma-Set-As-Keynote-Speaker-for-California-Public-Parking-Associations-25th-Annual-Conference |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 31, 2013 |title=Assembly member Fiona Ma Set As Keynote Speaker for California Public Parking Associations 25th Annual Conference |work=[[Parking Network]] |date=August 19, 2009 |first=Don |last=Note }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, both Norte and his spouse were co-hosts at a fundraiser for Democratic San Francisco Assembly person and Speaker Pro Tempore [[Fiona Ma]] for Fiona Ma's planned bid for the California Senate in 2014 (since then Ma was elected to the California State Board of Equalization representing the Second District.

==Log Cabin Republicans==
Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) joined with the Schwarzenegger administration to actively recruit LGBT representatives in Sacramento.

The inclusion of the LGBT community was significant in that the positions were launching points for both Republicans and Democrats. Log Cabin California Director James Vaughn made recruitment from LCR a top priority, and succeeded in recruiting the first openly gay Republican to serve on a visible political post in the Schwarzenegger administration.

"This is part of our campaign to develop a farm team of candidates for public office â€“ getting our members to be involved on state and local boards and commissions."Don and his spouse were the only [[Same-sex relationship|same sex couple]] to publicly endorse the Republican Schwarzenegger and were involved in the inauguration as a same sex couple in the program brochure &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070107022317/http://www.governors2007inaugural.com/site/c.gdJIKONpFiG/b.2292749/k.6C36/Inaugural_Sponsors_List.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nortes were sponsors of Log Cabin Republicans/Liberty Education Forum in Denver in 2007 and in San Diego in 2008 according to both program's booklets. The slightly right of center couple was also a table sponsor for [[Equality California]]'s Gala Dinner in Los Angeles in the summer of 2008.

According to a recent blog by [[Huffington Post]] blogger [[Ryan J. Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-j-davis/the-great-california-gay_b_96802.html |title='&amp;#39;Huffington Post'&amp;#39; report by Ryan J.

We did. We had some powerhouses there and the message was clear. We were not going away."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506143536/http://blogcabinca.org/2008/04/18/a-personal-point-of-view-on-the-governors-position-on-marriage/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in [[The Huffington Post]], the coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/california-gop-the-queer-enablers-of-gay-marriage/18959/.htm|publisher=LA WEEKLY|date=May 21, 2008|title=California GOP: The Queer Enablers of Gay Marriage}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; had a broad base, including [[Matt Foreman (gay rights activist)|Matt Foreman]] (former Executive Director, [[The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]]), Damon Romine (Former Entertainment Media Director, [[GLAAD]]), Geoff Kors (Former Executive Director, [[Equality California]]), Charles Robbins (Executive Director, [[The Trevor Project]]), [[John Duran]] (President, Equality California &amp; City Councilperson [[West Hollywood]]), Charles Moran, the Log Cabin Republicans' former LA Chapter President and LCR-CA VP, 2010, James Vaughn (former LCR CA Director), and the organizers, Don Norte (Governor's Committee on Labor for People With Disabilities) and Kevin Norte (LCR California Member, and former LCR-PAC Board of Directors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-j-davis/the-great-california-gay_b_96802.html |title=Ryan J.

On April 11, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger officially announced his opposition to the Initiative at LCR's National Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR09RxPpAaE/ |title=LCR's National Convention on YouTube |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2008-04-11 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Log Cabin's 2009 convention, Kevin Norte received the group's "Grassroots Leader Award".

==Context of same sex couples taking one name in California==
Norte tested California's "[[Domestic Partnership]]" law that promised equality except for the word "marriage"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://da205b2489b3915b8b2e3728e3a760b5.en.wikivx.biz/en/California+domestic+partner+lawhtml|publisher=[[WIKIVT]].biz|title=California Domestic Partner Law/}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005  by attempting to change his last name to test the applicability of AB 205.  That law was intended to match the rights of domestic partnerships to married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gaycalifornia.blogspot.com/2007/05/kevin-and-don-norte-bill.html 
|publisher= Land of Fruits and Nuts|date=May 8, 2007|title=Kevin and Don Norte Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language provided in California Family Code § 297.5 (a), reads as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, duties, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether derived from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Legislative Session 2006-07, California AB 102 was drafted by San Francisco Assemblymember [[Fiona Ma]] after the Norte's legal name status was called into question after the CA DMV{{clarify|date=May 2017}} adopted a policy to intentionally block other domestic partners after the Nortes from applying the California Family Code in a similar manner. The Nortes' involvement was mentioned in the description of a [[George Takei]] interview on [[Larry King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/Kevin_Norte |title=Kevin Norte |publisher=Wn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AB 102 expanded on the concept of allowing domestic partners to take the name of a spouse, to include married couples so the husband would  have the right to assume the last name of the wife. AB 102 was inclusive and consistent with Fam. Code § 297.5 by addressing marriages of different or the same genders. Name changes processed for domestic partners after AB 205 and prior to AB 102 originally permitted individuals to proceed with subsequent name change actions, including social security and passport documents. AB 102 passed the Assembly with three Republican votes: [[Sam Blakeslee]], [[Roger Niello]], and [[Anthony Adams (politician)|Anthony Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2007/05/why_did_26_of_3.htm|publisher=California Progress Report|date=May 9, 2007|title=Why Did 26 of 32 California Assembly Republicans Vote Against the Name Equality Act?/}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed the Senate on a straight party vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dist07.casen.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_PR&amp;SEC=%7BD46BB12E-1B37-41F4-B0FB-4EBF67799000%7D&amp;DE=%7B4623BFF5-1D80-4E06-8DA4-6BB4ABFAF79A%7D.html|publisher=Tom Torlakson, California State Senator|date=September 8, 2007|title=California Senate Passes Gun Microstamping--Governor to Get Prescription Labeling, Police Interrogation, College Textbook Bills--and Measure Gutting Local Campaign Finance Laws /}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction from opponents was swift after the Governor signed the bill. "AB 102 allows homosexual couples to hold themselves out as married by permitting them to choose the same surname upon registration of their 'domestic partnership,'" said Randy Thomasson, president of Campaign for Children and Families. The bill granted unmarried couples married last names. "Schwarzenegger and the Democrat politicians have created the public image of homosexual "marriages" in California," said Thomasson in response to the signing of AB 102. "It's hypocritical for Arnold Schwarzenegger to veto homosexual "'marriage'" licenses and at the very same time aggressively promote the public image of gay and lesbian "'marriages'" in every community for every child to see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wrightrepublican.blogspot.com/2007/10/terminator-roils-conservatives.html.html|publisher=Wright County Republican|date=October 19, 2007|title=Terminator Roils Conservatives}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nortes' position on their name was resolved in the 2006-07 legislative session when AB 102 was signed into law by the Governor because the law was made retroactive.

==End of activism==
During the last days of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]], when Log Cabin Republicans announced their last minute endorsement of [[Mitt Romney]], Norte and his husband resigned from Log Cabin Republicans and changed their political affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/31/log-cabin-republicans-mitt-romney_n_2039834.html |publisher=The Huffington Post|date=October 31, 2012|title=Log Cabin Republicans' Mitt Romney Endorsement Prompts Los Angeles Couple To End Membership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7993">'''Herbert Dyson Carter''' known as '''Dyson Carter''' (February 2, 1910 – 1996)&lt;ref name=prop&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reader.paperc.com/books/propaganda-and-persuasion/939419/intro|title=Reader|website=reader.paperc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Canadian scientist, lecturer, writer, and Communist propagandist and organiser who served as president of the [[Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society]] from 1949 to 1960.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/m/article/herbert-dyson-carter/|title=Herbert Dyson Carter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his fifty-year writing career, Carter produced hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles, dozens of short stories, and 17 books including five novels. Many of his non-fiction books and articles popularized scientific ideas and discoveries or reported on medical advances. In the 1930s and 1940s, many of his articles appeared in popular magazines in Canada and the United States and three of his books were published by large commercial publishers in the United States and widely reviewed.&lt;ref name="doyle"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doyle|first1=James|title=Science,  Literature and Revolution: The  Life and Writings of Dyson Carter|journal=Left History|date=1997|volume=5|issue=2|pages=7–30|url=https://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/viewFile/5335/4530&amp;|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He occasionally used the pseudonym '''Warren Desmond''' for popular fiction that he would otherwise would not have been able to sell in the [[United States]] due to [[McCarthyism]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

==Early life==
Carter was born in  [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] to Gertrude and William R. Carter, members of the [[Salvation Army]] who  had been sent from Britain first to [[Bermuda]] and then to [[Canada]] to work for the church. In 1912, the Carters became matron and superintendent, respectively, of the Provincial Detention Home for Juveniles in [[Winnipeg]], where Dyson Carter would grow up and go to school. Carter suffered from [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], which made his bones brittle throughout his life and often required him to be bedridden or walk with crutches, or later use a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;https://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/viewFile/5335/4530&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Carter received his Bachelor of Science in 1931 and his Master of Science degree in Chemistry from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1933 and subsequently worked as a university lecturer, a researcher and an engineering consultant in addition to his writing career.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

==Literary career==
Carter wrote in a number of genres including [[popular science]], health, [[socialist realist]] fiction, romance, and biography.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

His works included ''Sea of Destiny: the Story of Hudson Bay, Our Undefended Back Door'' (1940), a book that argued the Canadian north was susceptible to Nazi invasion and should be developed and militarized along the lines of the Soviet north in order to prevent such an eventuality, ''Night of Flame'' (1942), a novel set in a hospital that explored themes of [[class conflict]], and ''Stalin's Life'' (1943), a hagiographical biography of [[Stalin]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

In the 1930s and 1940s, Carter's articles were published in popular magazines such as ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'', ''[[Star Weekly]]'', and ''[[Maclean's]]'' and in various American publications such as the pulp magazine ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zAjhO_p6qeUC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=Dyson+Carter+stalin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S-YhBt2Fsu&amp;sig=NyimMaKAfq3IrG_hG1rd0wW7xZA&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTscPtsdTZAhUQ8GMKHVYvCX8Q6AEwCHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dyson+Carter+stalin&amp;f=false|title=Progressive Heritage: The Evolution of a Politically Radical Literary Tradition in Canada|first=James|last=Doyle|date=17 April 2002|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was made a member of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] in 1941, but was essentially [[blacklisted]] by the popular media after 1945 when he made public his membership in the [[Labor-Progressive Party]] (as the [[Communist Party of Canada]] was known at the time). He had joined the Communist Party in 1931 but had kept his membership secret for over a decade.&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;

Many of his books were translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and other languages and distributed throughout the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, and many of his articles were translated and carried in Soviet publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=pmPNNncH3hMC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=%22dyson+carter%22+russian+translation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=duDyZ41sai&amp;sig=lF6TVaCBwfDZSUAXlGGOkjtw_sw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4zYOxtNjZAhUFSa0KHSMFCZEQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dyson%20carter%22%20russian%20translation&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://reader.paperc.com/books/propaganda-and-persuasion/939419/ch01/__root__&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Canada in Eight Tongues.

==Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society and ''Northern Neighbors''==
As well as being president  of the CSFSS from 1949 to 1960, with [[Dorise Nielsen]] as executive secretary, and engaging in national lecture tours to promote friendship with the [[Soviet Union]], Carter  was editor and publisher of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society's newsletter, '' News-Facts About the USSR'' from 1950 to 1956 and of the glossy pro-Soviet magazine ''Northern Neighbours'' from 1956 to 1989.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

Carter's pro-Soviet writings never deviated from the [[party line (politics)|party line]], following its twists and turns. The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|invasion of Hungary]] in 1956 and the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 were presented from the Soviet point of view. According to historian Jennifer Anderson, who researched Carter's life and work:

"Dyson Carter eventually recognized the message did not correspond with reality, but not until [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policy of [[glasnost]] had made speaking openly about Soviet 'falsifications' possible. In 1990, Carter wrote that he had spent 40 years producing 'bullshit.'"&lt;ref&gt;https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/636d773d-b182-4454-9338-c07adffbfd23/etd_pdf/0fb7e7f30e99c6ea1040100565f4a6f1/anderson-propagandaandpersuasioninthecoldwarthecanadian.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter added: "I publicized so many Soviet ‘achievements’that were total falsifications, that I consider my ‘work’ an exercise in political pathology."&lt;ref name="and"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=The Pro-Soviet Message in Words and Images: Dyson Carter and Canadian "Friends" of the USSR|journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association|date=2007|volume=18|issue=1|pages=179–206|doi=10.7202/018259ar|url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/018259ar|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded several honours by the [[Soviet Union]] including the Centenary Medal (1970), the Order of Friendship of the Peoples (1980) and the Order of the Union of Friendship Societies (1985).&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

Howe was the author of one of the first books that was critical of the spiritual claims of [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. His 1834 book ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'' {{sic}} was based largely on [[affidavit]]s collected by Latter Day Saint dissenter [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut]] and on the letters of dissenter [[Ezra Booth]], which in 1831 had been published in the ''Ohio Star''.

==Life==
Howe was born to Samuel William Howe and Mabel Dudley in [[Clifton Park, New York|Clifton Park]], [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1804 the family moved to [[Ovid, New York]] and 1811 relocated to [[Upper Canada]], living a few miles west of [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]]. During the [[War of 1812]] Howe joined the [[U.S. Army]] in [[Batavia, New York]]. After the war, Howe became involved in the newspaper business, working at the ''Buffalo Gazette'' in [[Buffalo, New York]], the ''Erie Gazette'' in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and the ''Cleveland Herald'' in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In 1822, he moved to [[Painesville, Ohio]] and began publishing the ''Painesville Telegraph''. Under Howe's editorship, the ''Telegraph'' had a strongly [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] editorial perspective. Howe's home was used as a station on the [[Underground Railroad]], assisting fugitive slaves. In June 1823 he married Sophia Hull of Clarence, Ohio.&lt;ref name=JSP/&gt;

While living in Painesville, Howe's wife, sister, and niece converted to [[Mormonism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} On January 11, 1831, Howe wrote a letter to [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]], a newspaper publisher in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]], asking about the origins of the new religion. Phelps, who had read the [[Book of Mormon]] and met [[Joseph Smith]], responded to Howe by writing that "we have nothing by which we can positively detect it as an imposition", but that "if it is false, it will fall, and if of God, God will sustain it." Phelps was baptized into the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Latter Day Saint church]] a few months later. Howe continued to be interested in the [[Mormons]], and in November 1834 he published ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'', which he described as "a history of the Mormon imposition, from its rise to the present time, with many other peculiarities of the sect."

In January 1835, Howe sold the ''Painesville Telegraph'' to his younger brother for $600. After leaving the newspaper, Howe remained a publisher and a manufacturer of woollen goods.

Howe considered himself to be a [[Skepticism|skeptic]] on religious matters. However, after his wife died of [[stomach cancer]] in 1866, he became an avid believer in [[spiritualism]].

'''Edward Bullough''' (28 March 1880 – 17 September 1934) was an English [[aesthetics|aesthetician]] and scholar of [[modern language]]s, who worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He did experimental work on the perception of [[color|colours]], and in his theoretical work introduced the concept of [[psychical distance]]: that which "appears to lie between our own self and its affections" in aesthetic experience. In languages, Bullough was a dedicated teacher who published little. He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the [[Serena Professor of Italian|Chair of Italian]] at Cambridge in 1933.

==Life and work==

===Early life to "Psychical Distance," 1880&amp;ndash;1914===

Edward Bullough was born in [[Thun]], [[Switzerland]], on 28 March 1880, to John Bullough and Bertha Schmidlein.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Trayes, ed., ''Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College'', vol. 5, ''Admissions from 1911 to 1932'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1948), 132.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he lived mostly in Germany, and was educated at Vitzthum Gymnasium, [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;M. O. [Michael Oakeshott], "Edward Bullough," ''Caian'' 43, no. 1 (1934): 1. It was a convention at the time that articles in the ''Caian'' were signed with initials only. Oakeshott is identified in Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to ''Aesthetics'', by Edward Bullough (London: Bowes and Bowes, 1957), xii.&lt;/ref&gt; At seventeen Bullough moved to England,&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1899 matriculated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] in the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Rouse Ball and J. A. Venn, eds., ''Admissions to Trinity College, Cambridge'', vol. 5, ''1851 to 1900'' (London: Macmillan, 1913), 1134.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied Medieval and Modern Languages.&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated BA (Class I) in 1902, MA in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Ball and Venn, ''Admissions to Trinity'', 1134.&lt;/ref&gt; after which he taught French and German at Cambridge colleges and lectured in the university.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time Bullough became interested in [[aesthetics]], and "prepared himself to deal with [its] problems … by a study of [[physiology]] and general [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2. See also Edward Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1934), 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Bullough gave a course of lectures in aesthetics, the first such at Cambridge, privately printed as ''The Modern Conception of Aesthetics''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2. Bullough mistakenly says the year was 1906 in ''Italian Perspectives'', 8. The lectures are first announced, to begin on 14 October 1907, in the ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 37, no. 39 (1907): 1018.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated the course annually "until shortly before his death".&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough conducted experimental work on the perception of [[color|colours]] in the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, the basis for a series of three papers in the ''British Journal of Psychology'': "The Apparent Heaviness of Colours" (1907), "The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Single Colours" (1908), and "The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Simple Colour-Combinations" (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough also had an interest in [[parapsychology]], and was a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Bullough married Enrichetta Angelica Marchetti (daughter of the actor [[Eleonora Duse]]), with whom he would have a son and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough, Italian Studies at Cambridge," ''The Times'', 18 September 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to a Drosier Fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]] in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year published his noted theoretical paper, {{" '}}Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle". [[Psychical distance]] (Bullough capitalises the words) is that which, in certain situations, "appears to lie between our own self and its affections, using the latter term in its broadest sense as anything which affects our being".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bullough, {{" '}}Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle," ''British Journal of Psychology'' 5, no. 2 (1912): 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic production and appreciation are two such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Psychical Distance] has a ''negative'', inhibitory aspect—the cutting-out of the practical sides of things and of our practical attitude to them—and a ''positive'' side—the elaboration of the experience on the new basis created by the inhibitory action of Distance.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relation between [[self]] and [[object (philosophy)|object]] remains a personal one (it is not like the impersonal relation in [[science|scientific]] observation, for example) and Bullough thinks that a "concordance" between them is necessary for aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 91&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt; However this must not be such that psychical distance is lost: Bullough imagines a jealous husband watching a performance of ''[[Othello]]'', who "will probably do anything but appreciate the play".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[antinomy]] of Distance"&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 92.&lt;/ref&gt; leads Bullough to say that what is desirable in art, "both in appreciation and production", is "the utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, "Psychical Distance," 94. In the source, the second quotation is mostly italicised.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War service to death, 1915&amp;ndash;1934===

In the [[First World War]], Bullough was recruited as a civilian in the summer of 1915 to the [[Admiralty]]'s [[cryptanalysis|cryptoanalysis]] section, [[Room 40]]. He served for four years, finally as a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he returned to Caius, where he had been re-elected to a fellowship in January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He published in the ''British Journal of Psychology'' two more papers on aesthetic theory, "The Relation of Aesthetics to Psychology" (1919) and "Mind and Medium in Art" (1920), and a review of experimental work (1921).&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he was appointed College Lecturer in [[modern language]]s and University Lecturer in German,&lt;ref&gt;P. Giles, "Appointment of a University Lecturer in German," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 50, no. 31 (1920): 758.&lt;/ref&gt; and he edited the anthology ''Cambridge Readings in Italian Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Bullough resigned his university post,&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Pearce, "University Lectureship in German," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 53, no. 41 (1923): 1042.&lt;/ref&gt; wishing to concentrate instead on Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he joined the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] as a [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|Dominican Tertiary]], and afterwards was active in the Cambridge University Catholic Association.&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade he published translations of [[Étienne Gilson]], [[Karl Adam (theologian)|Karl Adam]], and [[Pope Pius XI|Achille Ratti]] (by then Pope Pius XI), and gave three papers on [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] at Catholic summer schools in Cambridge and [[Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A colleague believed that his work in Italian studies "all went into his lectures and teaching", rather than research for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted anonymously in Oakeshott, "Edward Bullough," 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed University Lecturer in Italian in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Trayes, ''Biographical History of Caius'', 132. No reference has been located in the ''Cambridge University Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullough was elected to the [[Serena Professor of Italian|Chair of Italian]] at Cambridge in March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Will Spens, "Professorship of Italian: Election," ''Cambridge University Reporter'' 63, no. 29 (1933): 830.&lt;/ref&gt; In his printed inaugural lecture, titled ''Italian Perspectives'', he claims that the Italian "perspective" is one of "continuity of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] with [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Modern history|modern]] times",&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt; so that tradition is treated "with the easy familiarity of a family possession".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that because the European classical tradition is also, for the Italian, the native tradition, "the 'national' inheritance of Italy lies at the same time embedded in the foundations of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In illustration, Bullough proposes [[Roman law]], the [[Renaissance]], and the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] as "three contributions made by Italy to the patrimony of the civilised world".&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the contemporary [[Italian Fascism|fascist movement]] as a tentative fourth:&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, ''Italian Perspectives'', 62&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt; a successor to the chair, Uberto Limentani, believed there was "no doubt" that Bullough sympathised with fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Uberto Limentani, "Leone and Arthur Serena and the Cambridge Chair of Italian, 1919&amp;ndash;1934," ''Modern Language Review'' 92, no. 4 (1997): 891.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short illness&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough," ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from an internal operation,&lt;ref&gt;H. O. Evennett, "Edward Bullough," ''Dublin Review'' 196, no. 392 (1935): 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullough died in a nursing home in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on 17 September 1934. He was buried at Woodchester Priory in [[Stroud]].&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Bullough," ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Michael Oakeshott]], a colleague at Caius, wrote Bullough's obituary for their college record.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Wilkinson, introduction to ''Aesthetics'', xii. Bullough's influence on Oakeshott's aesthetics is discussed in Efraim Podoksik, ''In Defence of Modernity: Vision and Philosophy in Michael Oakeshott'' (Exeter: Imprint Academic, 2003), 109&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family home on Buckingham Road, Cambridge was offered to the Dominican Order by his widow and is now [[Cambridge Blackfriars]].

[[File:Flashmancover.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Flashman'' (2005 printing)]]

Sir '''Harry Paget Flashman''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|VC|KCB|KCIE}} is a fictional character created by [[Thomas Hughes]] (1822–1896) in the semi-autobiographical ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' (1857) and later developed by [[George MacDonald Fraser]] (1925–2008). Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser's books, collectively known as ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'', with covers illustrated by [[Arthur Barbosa]]. Flashman was played by [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the [[Richard Lester]] 1975 film ''[[Royal Flash (film)|Royal Flash]]''.

In Hughes' 1857 book, Flashman (a relatively minor character) is portrayed as a notorious bully at [[Rugby School]] who persecutes [[Tom Brown (character)|Tom Brown]], and who is finally expelled for drunkenness. Fraser decided to write Flashman's memoirs, in which the school bully would be identified with an "illustrious [[Victorian era|Victorian]] soldier" experiencing many 19th-century wars and adventures and rising to high rank in the [[British Army]], acclaimed as a great soldier, while remaining "a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward—and, oh yes, a toady."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fraser, G.M. |date=1969|title= Flashman|location= London|publisher= Barrie &amp; Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser's Flashman is an [[antihero]] who often runs from danger in the novels. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George MacDonald Fraser [obituary] |date=2008|work= The Economist|url= http://www.economist.com/node/10492913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flashman's origins==
Fraser gave Flashman a lifespan from 1822 to 1915 and a birth-date of 5 May. Flashman's first and middle names were invented for the character as Hughes's novel does not give Flashman's first name. Fraser uses the names to make an ironic allusion to [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey]], one of the heroes of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], who [[cuckold]]ed the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s brother [[Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley|Henry Wellesley]] and later&amp;mdash;in one of the period's more celebrated scandals&amp;mdash;married Wellesley's ex-wife.

In ''[[Flashman (novel)|Flashman]]'', Flashman says that his great-grandfather, Jack Flashman, made the family fortune in America, trading in rum, [[slavery|slaves]] and "[[piracy]] too, I shouldn't wonder". Despite their wealth, the Flashmans "were never the thing": Flashman quotes the diarist [[Henry William Greville|Henry Greville's]] comment that "the coarse streak showed through, generation after generation, like dung beneath a rosebush". Harry Flashman's father, Henry Buckley Flashman, appears in ''[[Black Ajax]]'' (1997). Buckley, a bold young officer in the British cavalry, was wounded in action at [[Battle of Talavera|Talavera]] in 1809. He then tried to get into "society" by sponsoring [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle boxer]] [[Tom Molineaux]] (the first black man to contend for a championship) and subsequently married Flashman's mother Lady Alicia Paget, a fictional relation of the real [[Marquess of Anglesey]]. Buckley also served as a Member of [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] but was "sent to the knacker's yard at [[Reform Act 1832|Reform]]". Beside politics, his interests were drinking, [[fox hunting]] (riding to hounds) and women.

==Flashman the man==
Flashman is a large man, {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|spell=in}} tall and close to 13 [[stone (weight)|stone]] (about 180 pounds or 82&amp;nbsp;kg). In ''Flashman and the Tiger'', he mentions that one of his grandchildren has black hair and eyes, resembling him in his younger years. His dark colouring frequently enabled him to pass (in disguise) for a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]. He claims only three natural talents: horsemanship, facility with foreign languages, and fornication. He becomes an expert cricket-bowler, but only through hard effort (he needed sporting credit at Rugby School, and feared to play [[rugby football]]). He can also display a winning personality when he wants to, and is very skilled at flattering those more important than himself without appearing servile.

As he admits in the Papers, Flashman is a coward, who will flee from danger if there was any way to do so, and has on some occasions collapsed in funk. He has one great advantage in concealing this weakness: when he is frightened, his face turns red, rather than white, so that observers think he is excited, enraged, or exuberant&amp;mdash;as a hero ought to be.

After his expulsion from [[Rugby School]] for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks for an easy life. He has his wealthy father [[Sale of commissions|buy him an officer's commission]] in the fashionable [[11th Hussars|11th Regiment of Light Dragoons]]. The 11th, commanded by [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan|Lord Cardigan]], later involved in the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], has just returned from [[India]] and are not likely to be posted abroad soon. Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of [[Canterbury]] society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.&lt;ref&gt;"Flashman" pages 46 and 50&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[duel]] with another officer over a French courtesan leads to his being temporarily stationed in [[Paisley, Scotland]]. There he meets and deflowers Elspeth Morrison, daughter of a wealthy textile manufacturer, whom he has to marry in a "[[shotgun wedding]]" under threat of a horsewhipping by her uncle. But marriage to the daughter of a mere businessman forces his transferral from the snobbish 11th Hussars. He is sent to India to make a career in the army of the [[East India Company]]. Unfortunately, his language talent and his habit of flattery bring him to the attention of the [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]]. The Governor does him the (very much unwanted) favour of assigning him as aide to General [[William George Keith Elphinstone|Elphinstone]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Flashman survives the ensuing [[1842 retreat from Kabul|debacle]] by a mixture of sheer luck and unstinting cowardice. He becomes an unwitting hero: the defender of Piper's Fort, where he is the only surviving white man, and is found by the relieving troops clutching the flag and surrounded by enemy dead. Of course, Flashman had arrived at the Fort by accident, collapsed in terror rather than fighting, been forced to stand and show fight by his subordinate, and is 'rumbled' for a complete coward. He had been trying to surrender the colours, not defend them. Happily for him, all inconvenient witnesses had been killed.

This incident sets the tone for Flashman's life. Over the following 60 years or so, he is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century — always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters (the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], the [[Siege of Cawnpore]], [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], [[Battle of Isandlwana]]), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.

Despite his admitted cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting when he has to. Though he dodges danger as much as he can, and runs away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides all the way to the Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.

Flashman surrenders to fear in front of witnesses only a few times, and is never caught out again. During the siege of Piper's Fort, in the first novel, Flashman cowers weeping in his bed at the start of the final assault; the only witness to this dies before relief comes. He breaks down while accompanying Rajah Brooke during a battle with pirates, but the noise drowns out his blubbering, and he recovers enough to command a storming party of sailors (placing himself right in the middle of the party, to avoid stray bullets). After the Charge of the Light Brigade, he flees in panic from the fighting in the battery&amp;mdash;but mistakenly charges into an entire Russian regiment, adding to his heroic image.

In spite of his numerous character flaws, Flashman is represented as being a perceptive observer of his times ("I saw further than most in some ways"&lt;ref&gt;"Flashman" page 49&lt;/ref&gt;). In its obituary of George MacDonald Fraser, ''[[The Economist]]'' commented that realistic sharp-sightedness ("if not much else") was an attribute Flashman shared with his creator.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist 10 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volumes of ''The Flashman Papers''==
{{main|The Flashman Papers}}

==Flashman's women==
Flashman, an insatiable lecher, had sex with many different women over the course of his fictional adventures. His size, good looks, winning manner, and especially his splendid cavalry-style whiskers won over many women, from low to high, including many famous women, and frequent encounters with prostitutes. In ''Flashman and the Great Game'', about halfway through his life, he counted up his sexual conquests while languishing in a dungeon at [[Gwalior]], "not counting return engagements", reaching a total of 478 up to that date. Passages in ''Royal Flash'', ''Flashman and the Dragon'', ''Flashman and the Redskins'', and ''Flashman and the Angel of the Lord'' suggest that Flashman was well endowed. 

He was a vigorous and exciting (if sometimes selfish and rapacious) lover, and some of his partners became quite fond of him&amp;mdash;though by his own admission, others tried to kill him afterwards. The most memorable of these was Cleonie, a prostitute Flashman sold into slavery in ''Flashman and the Redskins''. He was not above forcing himself on a partner by blackmail (e.g., the Russian countess in ''Flashman and the Dragon''), and at least twice raped women ([[Narreeman]], an Afghan dancing girl in ''Flashman'', and an unnamed harem girl in ''Flashman's Lady''). 

Flashman's stories are dominated by his numerous amorous encounters. Several of them are with prominent historical personages. These women are sometimes window dressing, sometimes pivotal characters in the unpredictable twists and turns of the books. Historical women Flashman bedded included:

*[[Lola Montez]] (Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert James) (''Royal Flash'').
*[[Jind Kaur]], [[Dowager]] [[Maharani]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (''Flashman and the Mountain of Light'').
*[[Lillie Langtry]], actress and mistress of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] (''Flashman and the Tiger'')
*[[Daisy Brooke]], socialite and mistress of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] (''Flashman and the Tiger'')
*Mangla, maid and confidant to Jind Kaur.
*Masteeat, Queen of the Wollo [[Oromo people|Galla]]s (''Flashman on the March'').
*Queen [[Ranavalona I]] of Madagascar (''Flashman's Lady'').
*The Silk One (aka Ko Dali's daughter), consort of [[Yakub Beg]] (''Flashman at the Charge'').
*Yehonala, Imperial Chinese concubine, later the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (''Flashman and the Dragon'').

He also lusted after (but never bedded):

*[[Frances Isabella Duberly|Fanny Duberly]], a famous army wife.
*[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett-Coutts]], who became the richest woman in England in her twenties. She nearly dislocated his thumb repelling a "friendly grope" at a house-party. (''Flashman's Lady'')
*[[Rani Lakshmibai|Lakshmibai]], Dowager Rani of [[Jhansi]] (''Flashman in the Great Game'') (a dancing girl ''may'' have taken the rani's place for a tryst outside the palace)

His fictional amours included:

*Judy Parsons, his father's mistress (''Flashman''). After a single bedding to satisfy joint lust, she and Flashman achieve a state of mutual dislike. 
*Josette, mistress of Captain Bernier of the 11th Light Dragoons (''Flashman'').
*Elspeth Rennie Morrison, his wife.
*Fetnab, a dancing girl Flashy bought in Calcutta (''Flashman'') to teach him Hindustani, Hindi culture and purportedly ninety-seven ways of love making. Sold to a major in the artillery when Flashman is posted to Afghanistan. 
*Mrs Betty Parker, wife of an officer of Bengal Light Cavalry (''Flashman''; unconsummated). Cited by Flashman as an example of the "inadequacies of education given to young Englishwomen" in the Victorian era, 
*Baroness Pechmann, a [[Bavaria]]n noblewoman (''Royal Flash'').
*Irma, Grand Duchess of Strackenz (''Royal Flash''). For involved political reasons Flashman marries her, in the guise of a Danish prince. After an unpromising start the cold and highly-strung Duchess becomes physically infatuated with him. Decades later she pays an official visit to Queen Victoria. Flashman, by now an aging courtier, observes his erstwhile royal spouse from a safe distance.   
*An-yat-heh, an undercover agent of [[Harry Smith Parkes]] (''Flashman and the Dragon'').
*Aphrodite, one of Miss Susie's "gels" (''Flashman and the Redskins'').
*Cassy, an escaped slave who accompanied Flashman up the Mississippi (''Flash for Freedom!'').
*Caprice, a French intelligence agent (''Flashman and the Tiger'')
*Lady Geraldine.
*Gertrude, niece of [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff|Admiral Tegetthoff]] (''Flashman on the March'').
*Princess "Kralta", European princess and agent of [[Otto von Bismarck]] (''Flashman and the Tiger'')
*Cleonie Grouard (aka Mrs Arthur B. Candy), one of "Miss Susie's gels" (''Flashman and the Redskins''). With her he had a son, [[Frank Grouard]],
*Mrs Leo Lade, mistress of a violently jealous duke (''Flashman's Lady'').
*"Lady Caroline Lamb", a slave on board the [[slave ship|slaver]] ''Balliol College'' (''Flash for Freedom!''). 
*Mrs Leslie, an unattached woman in the [[Meerut]] garrison (''Flashman in the Great Game'').
*Mrs Madison (''Flashman and the Mountain of Light'').
*Malee, a servant of Uliba-Wark (''Flashman on the March'').
*Mrs Mandeville, a Mississippi planter's wife (''Flash for Freedom!'' and again in ''Flashman and the Angel of the Lord'').
*Penny/Jenny, a steamboat girl (''Flash for Freedom!'').
*Lady Plunkett, wife of a colonial judge (not quite consummated: ''Flashman and the Angel of the Lord'').
*Mrs Popplewell, agent of a Southern slaveholders' conspiracy (''Flashman and the Angel of the Lord'').
*Sara (Aunt Sara), sister-in-law of Count Pencherjevsky (''Flashman at the Charge''). Shares violent love-making with Flashman in a Russian steam-bath. Believed to be victim of a subsequent serf rising. 
*Sonsee-Array (Takes-Away-Clouds-Woman), an Apache savage 'princess', daughter of [[Mangas Coloradas]] (''Flashman and the Redskins'').
*Miranda Spring, daughter of John Charity Spring (''Flashman and the Angel of the Lord'').
*Szu-Zhan, a six-foot-eight Chinese bandit leader (''Flashman and the Dragon'').
*Uliba-Wark, an Abyssinian chieftainess and warrior (''Flashman on the March'').
*Valentina (Valla), married daughter of Russian nobleman and [[Cossack]] colonel Count Pencherjevsky (''Flashman at the Charge''). Has an affair with Flashman at her father's instigation. When charged with saving Valla from a rebellion of Pencherjevsky's serfs, Flashman attempts to escape pursuit by throwing her into the snow from a [[troika (driving)|troika]]   
*White Tigress and Honey-and-Milk, two concubines of the Chinese merchant Whampoa (''Flashman's Lady''). 
*Susie Willinck (aka "Miss Susie"), [[New Orleans]] madam (''Flash for Freedom!'' and ''Flashman and the Redskins'').

As well as bedding more or less any lass available, he married whenever it was politic to do so. During a posting to Scotland, he was forced to marry Elspeth to avoid "pistols for two with her fire-breathing uncle". He is still married to her decades later when writing the memoirs, though that does not stop him pursuing others. Nor does it prevent marrying them when his safety seems to require it; he marries Duchess Irma in ''Royal Flash'' and in ''Flashman and the Redskins'' he marries Susie Willnick as they escape New Orleans and Sonsee-Array a few months later.

He was also once reminded of a woman that Elspeth claimed he flirted with named Kitty Stevens, though Flashman was unable to remember her.

He had a special penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his favourite amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: "a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: I dare say I'm just a snob."  He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: "Elspeth, of course, is Scottish."  And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.

His lechery was so strong that it broke out even in the midst of rather hectic circumstances. While accompanying Thomas Kavanaugh on his daring escape from Lucknow, he paused for a quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of Patusan, he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib's concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.

Flashman's relations with the highest-ranking woman of his era, [[Queen Victoria]], are warm but platonic. He first meets her in 1842 when he receives a medal for his gallantry in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;page 247 "Flashman"&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects on what a honeymoon she and Prince Albert must have enjoyed. Subsequently he and his wife received invitations to [[Balmoral Castle]], to the delight of the snobbish Elspeth.&lt;ref&gt;pages 1, 9 &amp; 12 "Flashman in the Great Game"&lt;/ref&gt; For his services during the [[Indian Mutiny]], Victoria not only approved awarding Flashy the [[Victoria Cross]], but loaded the KCB on top of it.&lt;ref&gt;Flashman in the Great Game&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Malcolm McDowell]] played Harry Flashman in ''[[Royal Flash (film)|Royal Flash]]'', directed by [[Richard Lester]].

==References in other works==
* It is unclear if Hughes or Fraser was aware of it, but the first occurrence of the name "Flashman" in fiction comes from the 2nd century, as an emissary of the Sun in [[Lucian]]'s novel "A True Story". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl2/wl212.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Jackson Speed Memoirs, Robert Peecher borrows heavily from George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman in creating the Jackson Speed character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://robertpeecher.com/2013/05/24/harry-flashman-and-jackson-speed/ Robert Peecher]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Flashman, Speed is a womanizer and a coward who is undeservedly marked as a hero by those around him. Peecher also adopts the literary device used by Fraser of the "discovered" memoirs. Unlike the English Flashman, Speed is an American making appearances in the Mexican–American War, the U.S. Civil War and other American conflicts of the 19th Century.
* Writer [[Keith Laidler]] gave the Flashman story a new twist in ''The Carton Chronicles'' by revealing that Flashman is the natural son of [[Sydney Carton]], hero of the Charles Dickens classic ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''. Laidler has Sydney Carton changing his mind at the foot of the guillotine, escaping death and making wayward and amorous progress through the terrors of the French Revolution, during which time he spies for both the British and French, causes [[Georges Danton|Danton's]] death, shoots [[Robespierre]], and reminisces on a liaison among the hayricks at the "Leicestershire pile" of a married noblewoman, who subsequently gave birth to a boy&amp;mdash;Flashman&amp;mdash;on 5 May 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Aziloth Books ''The Carton Chronicles: The Curious Tale of Flashman's true father''  {{cite web |url=http://azilothbooks.com/title_details.php?ID=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707202422/http://azilothbooks.com/title_details.php?ID=4 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laidler, Keith,''The Carton Chronicles: The Curious Tale of Flashman's true father'' (Aziloth, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-907523-01-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alex Stewart (writer)|Sandy Mitchell's]] ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' character Commissar [[Ciaphas Cain]] is partially inspired by Flashman.&lt;ref name = "Hero of the Imperium"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mitchell|first=Sandy|authorlink=Sandy Mitchell (novelist)|title=Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium|date=30 April 2007|publisher= The Black Library|isbn=978-1-84416-466-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[comics]], writer [[John Ostrander]] took Flashman as his model for his portrayal of the cowardly villain [[Captain Boomerang]] in the [[Suicide Squad]] series. In the letters page to the last issue in the series (#66), Ostrander acknowledges this influence directly. Flashman's success with the ladies is noticeably lacking in the Captain Boomerang character.
*In [[Kim Newman]]'s [[alternate history|alternative history]] novel ''[[The Bloody Red Baron]]'' (part of the [[Anno Dracula series]]), Flashman is cited as an example of a dishonourable officer in a character's [[internal monologue]]. In the later novella ''Aquarius'' (set in 1968, one year before the first volume of the Flashman Papers was published), it is mentioned that the fictional St Bartolph's College at the [[University of London]] had previously been home to the Harry Paget Flashman Refectory, until its recent renaming to [[Che Guevara]] Hall in an attempt to pacify campus activists.
* Flashman's portrait (unnamed, but with unmistakable background and characteristics) hangs in the home of the protagonist of ''[[The Peshawar Lancers]]'', an alternative history novel by [[S. M. Stirling]]: the family claims to have had an ancestor who held Piper's Fort, as Flashman did; the protagonist claims his sole talents are for horsemanship and languages and has an Afghan in his service named "Ibrahim Khan" (cf. Ilderim Khan); late in the book, he plays with Elias the Jew on a "black jade chess set" matching the description of the one Flashman stole from the Summer Palace in ''[[Flashman and the Dragon]]''; the book's chief antagonist is named Ignatieff. Another allusion to Flashman by Stirling occurs in his short story "The Charge of Lee's Brigade", which appeared in the [[alternate history|alternative history]] anthology ''[[Alternate Generals]]'' (1998, ed. by [[Harry Turtledove]]). Here, Sir Robert E. Lee is a British general in the Crimean War who orders an officer, obviously Flashman (Cherrypicker trousers, rides like a Comanche in battle), to take part in a better-planned [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. Flashman dies in the attack, demonstrating some courage despite what Lee perceives only as nervousness. So, in this version Flashman again ends up a hero. But&amp;mdash;as he himself would have been quick to point out&amp;mdash;he is a ''dead'' hero.
* [[Terry Pratchett]] was a fan of the Flashman series&lt;ref name="inthewordsofthemaster"&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=5 October 2010 |url=http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cyberpunk/pratchett_words.shtml |title=In the Words of the Master}} Excerpts from interviews with Terry Pratchett&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Discworld]] character [[Rincewind]] is an inveterate coward with a talent for languages who is always running away from danger, but nevertheless through circumstance emerges with the appearance of an unlikely hero, for which reason he is then selected for further dangerous enterprises. In this he strongly resembles Flashman, although he is totally dissimilar in most other aspects. The Discworld novel ''[[Pyramids (novel)|Pyramids]]'' has a character named Fliemoe, the bully at the [[Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild]] school, who is a parody of the original version of Flashman from ''Tom Brown's Schooldays'' (including "toasting" new boys).&lt;ref name="apf"&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=5 October 2010 |url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/pyramids.html |title=Annotated Pratchett File - Pyramids}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Discworld Diary|Assassins' Guild Yearbook and Diary]]'', Fliemoe is described as having grown up to be "an unbelievable liar and an unsuccessful bully". His name is a play on that of Flashman's crony Speedicut—both "Speedicut" and "Flymo" are brand names of British lawn mowers.
* An editorial piece in the 14 May 2011 edition of ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper on the subject of British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] being labelled a "Flashman" was given a Harry Flashman by-line and was written in the style of Flashman's narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/14/unthinkable-flashman-prime-minister | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Unthinkable?

* Flashman's son, Harry II, is used as a character in some of the short stories created for the "[[Tales of the Shadowmen]]" series. He first appeared in the eighth volume. His son has several of the characteristics of his father, but appears to be less a coward.
* The writing for [[Lord Flashheart]], a minor character in Series 2 and 4 of [[Blackadder]], seems likely to have been at least in part inspired by Flashman.&lt;ref name=Hallam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2011/06/10/13453/the_unforgettable_flashheart|title=The unforgettable Flashheart|author=Chris Hallam|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure from the Dominican Revolutionary Party ===
Afterwards of intense contradictions with the then president of the Republic and copartisan [[Hipólito Mejía]], because of De Camps’s posture of no reelection, Hatuey in the 2003–2004 called the population to vote for the [[Devil]] before Hipólito. This caused more grudges between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hoy.com.do/expulsan-a-hatuey-y-felipa-del-prd-por-alta-traicion-2/|title=Expulsan a Hatuey y Felipa del PRD por alta traición|date=2004-05-19|first=Luis M.|last=Cárdenas|publisher=Hoy|quote=Explicó que De Camps y los demás expulsados incurrieron en un conjunto de actos de indisciplina al llamar a votar hasta por el Diablo en Contra de su partido, y nadie puede en una campaña electoral votar en contra de los candidatos del PRD sin hacerse pasible de sanciones de ese tipo.

'''Israel Eldad''' ({{Lang-he|ישראל אלדד}}) (11 November 1910 – 22 January 1996), was an [[Israel]]i [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionist]] philosopher and member of the pre-state underground group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].

==Early life and education==
Israel Scheib (later Eldad) was born in 1910 in [[Pidvolochysk]], [[Austrian Galicia|Galicia]] in a traditional Jewish home. The Scheibs wandered as refugees [[Battle of Galicia|during the First World War]]. In 1918, in Lvov, young Scheib witnessed a funeral procession for Jews murdered in a pogrom.
 
After high school, Scheib enrolled at the Rabbinical Seminary of Vienna for religious studies and the [[University of Vienna]] for secular studies. He completed his doctorate on "The Voluntarism of Eduard von Hartmann, Based on [[Schopenhauer]]," but never took his rabbinical exams at the seminary.&lt;ref&gt;Ada Amichal Yevin, ''Sambatyon'', pp. 26-30 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, he attended, with his father, a protest demonstration in front of the local British Consulate following the [[1929 Arab riots]] in Palestine. The next year he read a poem by [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]], "I'll Tell It to a Child," about a messiah who cannot redeem his people because they are not ready to accept redemption. Two or three years later, Scheib met Greenberg at a speech Greenberg was giving entitled “The Land of Israel Is in Flames.”

==Career and activism==
Scheib's first job after graduation was  high school teaching in Volkovisk. He also published articles in [[Revisionist Zionist]] journals and became the commander of a local [[Betar]] section.
 
Scheib joined the staff of the Teachers Seminary in [[Vilna]] in 1937 while this city was part of [[Poland]], where he stayed for two years. During that time he rose in the Betar ranks to the position of regional staff officer. In 1938, at the Third Betar Conference in Warsaw, when the Revisionist leader [[Zeev Jabotinsky]] attacked the militant stance of Poland's Betar leader [[Menachem Begin]], Scheib spoke in Begin's defense.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Eldad, ''Maaser Rishon'', pp. 21-25 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, when the Second World War broke out, Scheib and Begin escaped together from Warsaw. Begin was arrested by the Soviet police in the middle of a chess game with Scheib, and it was several years before they met again in British Mandatory Palestine, where Scheib was already a leader of the Lehi underground and Begin would soon command the [[Irgun]]. The Lehi was at that point waging a violent struggle for freedom from British rule and the Irgun would, under Begin, soon join the revolt in hopes of turning Palestine into a Jewish state.
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13135 Escape of quot;Eldadquot; in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|264x264px|Plaque commemorating the escape of Eldad, in Jerusalem.]]
Scheib adopted several aliases while living underground, including "Sambatyon" and "Eldad". He worked in 1942 directly with Lehi founder [[Avraham Stern]]. After Stern's killing by the British, Eldad became one of a triumvirate of Lehi commanders, serving with [[Natan Yellin-Mor]] and future prime minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]]. It was in this role that, in September 1948, Eldad participated in ordering the assassination of [[Folke Bernadotte]], a United Nations mediator, as he subsequently admitted.&lt;ref name=SvoraiEldad&gt;Moshe and Tova Svorai, ''Me'Etzel Le'Lechi'', 1989, pp. 419-422 (Hebrew) and Israel Eldad, ''Maaser Rishon'', pp. 133-145 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A haunting legacy: The assassination of Count Bernadotte |journal= Middle East Journal |volume=42 | number=2 |year=1988 |author=C. D. Stanger |pages=260–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellin-Mor was the diplomatic "foreign minister," Shamir the operations man, and Eldad the ideologue. For the next six years Eldad wrote articles for various underground newspapers, some of which he edited. Eldad also wrote some of the speeches delivered in court by Lehi defendants.&lt;ref name=SvoraiEldad/&gt;

Eldad was arrested by the British fleeing from a Tel Aviv apartment; he was injured in a fall from a water pipe, and imprisoned in the Jerusalem prison in a body cast. He continued his political and philosophical writing from Cell 18 of the hospital ward at the Jerusalem Central Prison. Eventually Eldad healed enough to escape while on a visit in a dentist's clinic, from which several Lehi fighters spirited him away.

[[File:Sheib.jpg|thumb|right|Israel Eldad. Circa 1948.]]

During [[1948 Palestine war|Israel's War of Independence]], Eldad was critical of Menachem Begin's Irgun for what he thought of  not fighting against the [[Israel Defence Forces]] during the [[Altalena Affair]] . He was also critical of the IDF for not fighting harder to conquer [[Old City of Jerusalem|Jerusalem's Old City]] and critical of Lehi fighters who did not rush to fight in Jerusalem. Towards the end of the war, Eldad disguised himself as a foreign journalist in order to sneak past Israeli military roadblocks and join the battle for Jerusalem.
 
The Lehi veterans organized politically as the [[Fighters' List]]. The party won  one seat in the election for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|First Knesset]] and dissolved afterwards. At one party meeting, Eldad lectured on ''Sulam'', [[Jacob's ladder]] (based on {{bibleref2|Genesis|28:10-19}}, where [[Jacob]] dreams of a ladder uniting heaven and earth), thus beginning the next chapter in his life. For 14 years he published a revolutionary journal, ''Sulam''. Eldad also spent half of 1949 writing his memoirs, entitled ''Maaser Rishon''.

Eldad eventually got a job teaching Bible and Hebrew literature in an Israeli high school, until Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] intervened and had him dismissed. Ben-Gurion was afraid Eldad would imbue the students with his Lehi ideology. Eldad went to court and won, but found few people willing to hire him after Ben-Gurion had labeled him a danger to the state. Eldad turned to literary work, wrote histories of underground battles, a biography of the mayor of Ramat Gan, a newspaper-style review of Jewish history called ''Chronicles'', a book of Bible commentary, ''Hegionot Mikra'', weekly newspaper columns, and many more books, encyclopedia entries and other works. In 1962, Eldad was made a lecturer at the [[Technion]] in [[Haifa]]. He taught there for twenty years. Since 1982 was a lecturer at the [[Ariel University Center of Samaria]]. In 1988, Eldad was awarded [[Tel Aviv]]'s [[Bialik Prize]] for his contributions to Israeli thought.

By the 1990s, Eldad was known as the doyen of Israeli nationalists. He died on the first day of the Hebrew month of Shevat, in January 1996. His funeral was attended by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], former prime minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and [[Knesset]] Speaker [[Dov Shilansky]]. Eldad was buried on the [[Mount of Olives]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Post'', January 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; at the foot of the grave of his mentor and friend, Uri Zvi Greenberg.

==Views and opinions==
Eldad did not believe that the creation of the state of Israel was the goal of Zionism. He considered the state a tool to be used in realizing the goal of Zionism, which he called ''Malkhut Yisrael'' (the Kingdom of Israel). Eldad sought what he referred to as national redemption, meaning a sovereign Jewish kingdom in the biblical borders of Israel, with all the world's Jews living there, and the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] rebuilt in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Eldad, ''Israel: The Road to Full Redemption'', p. 37 (Hebrew) and Israel Eldad, [http://www.saveisrael.com/eldad/saveisraeleldad.htm "Temple Mount in Ruins"]&lt;/ref&gt; Eldad steadfastly refused to give legitimacy to any Jewish presence in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]], which he felt was doomed to extinction. Nonetheless, in his view of history, past generations of Jews in exile from the [[Land of Israel]] were not denigrated as passive sufferers, but were considered creative players in history.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, ''God, Man and Nietzsche'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Eldad and his journal ''Sulam'' wrote frequently about Jewish political figures who throughout history tried to bring redemption to their people, but who were stymied by geopolitical or other obstacles.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
 
Eldad called on all Jews to join in the building of Israel, not for their personal fulfillment but because they are needed there.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Politically, Eldad favored an independent foreign policy, with Israel not a member of any foreign bloc. He advocated more forceful use of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and opposed the inclusion of the word "defense" in the name of the army. He opposed ceding any land to the Arabs.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Writings==
Much of Eldad's voluminous writings has been translated into English, mostly by [[Zev Golan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gefenpublishing.com/authorcategory.asp?id=715 |title=Zev Golan |publisher=Gefen Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works: ''Chronicles'' {{ISBN|965-7108-15-2}}. ''The Jewish Revolution'' appeared in 1971, and was reissued in 2007. ''Free Jerusalem'' includes a chapter by Eldad ("Meanwhile, A European Interlude") about Polish Jewry on the eve of war.

[[File:Johanna St John.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Johanna St John, by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]
'''Johanna St John''' (1631–1705)&lt;ref name="emroc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emroc.hypotheses.org/ongoing-projects/johanna-st-john|title=The St. John Project|website=emroc|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English cookery writer and the eldest daughter of a notable [[Member of parliament|Parliament]]arian, [[Oliver St John]].&lt;ref name="r1180"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recipes.hypotheses.org/1180|title=Just who is this Johanna St. John?!?|website=The Recipes Project|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would eventually marry [[Sir Walter St John, 3rd Baronet|Sir Walter St John]], a distant relative.&lt;ref name=r1180 /&gt; Throughout her life, St John constructed two [[Cookbook|recipe books]] containing culinary, cosmetic, and medicinal recipes.&lt;ref name=emroc /&gt; She was the grandmother to the first Viscount Bolingbroke, [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St John]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.wellcomelibrary.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(AltRefNo='ms.4338')&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
St John's father was [[Oliver St John]], a leading [[English Parliamentarians|Parliamentarian]] and supporter of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. She was raised during the time of the [[English Civil War]]. In the early months of her life, her mother, Johanna Altham, brought her to the home of Altham's stepfather, Sir William Masham, in [[High Laver]], [[Essex]].&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://goodgentlewoman.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/johanna-lady-st-john/|title=Johanna, Lady St John|date=2012-04-19|website=Good Gentlewoman|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; St John was baptized there on January 27, 1631.&lt;ref name=good /&gt;

In 1649, she married her distant cousin and later had thirteen children.

== Housewife of Lydiard House ==
[[Lydiard Park]] is a 260-acre country park at [[Lydiard Tregoze]], nearly four miles west of central Swindon, Wiltshire, England, later owned by the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount of Bolingbroke]], Johanna St John's grandson. A set of letters between Johanna St John and her steward, Thomas Hardyman, give insight into how she learned to construct her recipe books.&lt;ref name=r1180 /&gt; At Lydiard House, her [[summer estate]], a plethora of materials and ingredients including food, herbs, and livestock gave her the raw materials she needed to craft her recipe books.&lt;ref name=r1180 /&gt; St John's usage of these materials ranged from food to distilled medicines.&lt;ref name=r1180 /&gt; From the letters, there is an understanding that Johanna herself did not concoct the recipes at Lydiard House, but gave "exact details to a team of distillers and herbgatherers", often collaborating with other recipe-makers in London.&lt;ref name=r1180 /&gt; People she collaborated with included Sir Edward Spencer, Lady Manchester and Lady Peterborough who all had remedies for sore eyes, and Sr. [[Philip Warwick]] who had a remedy for [[cramp]]s.&lt;ref name=good /&gt;

However, the first three ingredients: [[unicorn horn]], [[bezoar stone]], and bones of stag heart indicate that the intended use was to treat poison.&lt;ref name="r511"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://recipes.hypotheses.org/511|title=The Wonders of Unicorn Horns: Preventions and Cures for Poisoning|website=The Recipes Project|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recipe is significant because it shows how the [[Early modern period|Early Modern Period]] still accepted the idea of magic in their remedies.&lt;ref name=r511 /&gt;

=== To Make Hands White ===
While many of St John's recipes were prepared to cure ailments, some of her recipes were meant to be cosmetic. In her recipe "To Make Hands White", she used a concoction of herbs and seeds to cleanse her hands and make them white.&lt;ref&gt;http://lydiardhouse.blogspot.com/search?q=johanna+&lt;/ref&gt; This was important to a woman of status who hosted parties.

'''John Ward''' (25 December 1781 – 12 March 1837), known as '''Zion Ward''', was an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] preacher, [[Mysticism|mystic]] and self-styled [[prophet]], active (in the latter capacity) in [[England]] from around 1828 to 1835. He was one of those claiming to be the successor of prophetess [[Joanna Southcott]] after her death. His imprisonment for [[blasphemy]] prompted the intervention of [[Member of Parliament]] [[Joseph Hume]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|wstitle=Ward, John (1781-1837)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Ward was born at the Cove of Cork (now [[Cobh]]), in [[County Cork]], Ireland, on 25 December 1781. In July 1790, his parents took him to [[Bristol]], England, where, at twelve years of age, he was apprenticed to a [[shipwright]]. His father took him to [[London]] in 1797, where he learned [[shoemaking]] from his brother, but soon went back to his former trade and served on board the [[man-of-war]] ''Blanche'' as a shipwright; in this capacity he saw action at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]] on 2 April 1801.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1803, Ward was paid off from the Navy at [[Sheerness]], [[Kent]]. He married and returned to the trade of shoemaker. Ward had been brought up a [[Calvinist]], but became a [[Methodist]] at his wife's insistence, after moving to [[Carmarthen]] in [[Wales]]. Unable to experience conversion, he returned to London, resolving to "never more have anything to do with religion". However, after hearing dissenter [[Jeremiah Learnoult Garrett]] preach at Lant Street Chapel in [[Southwark]], he joined the [[Baptists]]. On Garrett's death in 1806, he aligned himself with the independents, and in 1813, joined the [[Sandemanians]], becoming a village preacher.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Preacher==

Just after the death of prophetess Joanna Southcott in 1814, Ward came across her ''Fifth Book of Wonders''.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Southcott. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EXpzgo3L3wQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Life and works: A collection of pamphlets, Volume 7]'' (1813).&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[universalism]] captivated him, and he began to preach it. This led to him rejoining the Methodists, who made him a local preacher, but soon dismissed him for his [[heresy|heretical]] views. The Southcottians would not receive him either.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Convinced by the example of Joanna Southcott that prophecy was "a living gift", Ward looked for another prophet to guide him, falling in with Mary Boon of [[Staverton, Devon|Staverton]], [[Devon]]. Boon was a [[Seventh-day Sabbatarianism|Seventh-day Sabbatarian]] fanatic who claimed to be Joanna Southcott reborn. Ward became the "reader" of the letters she dictated (for she could neither read nor write), for the benefit of her London followers. Around 1825, Ward began to experience visions in which he was supposedly visited by Southcott in [[Ghost|spirit]] form.&lt;ref name="zemka"&gt;Zemka, 1997, pp. 1 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; His followers reckoned their years from this point, designating 1826 ''First year, new date''.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Prophet==

In 1827, Ward gave up shoemaking to proclaim his divine call; his wife and family were convinced that he was  mad, and he was reported to the [[Civil parishes in England|parish]] officers. He was brought before a Southwark magistrate (Chambers), declared insane, and committed to [[Newington Workhouse]] for six months. He continued to experience visions, claiming to have received instruction and a sense of "call and mission".&lt;ref name="zemka" /&gt; Upon being freed, on 20 November 1828, he claimed to be "a new man, having a new name", ''Zion''. He also called himself [[Shiloh (biblical figure)|''Shiloh'']], as he was convinced that he was the biblical messiah of that name, to whom Southcott had claimed she would give birth.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1829, with the help of a follower, Charles William Twort (d. 1878, aged 93), he began to print [[Tract (literature)|tracts]]. He visited and preached in various towns and cities in England, making converts in [[Nottingham]], [[Chesterfield]], [[Worksop]], [[Blyth, Nottinghamshire|Blyth]], [[Barnsley]], [[Birmingham]], and [[Sheffield]]. In 1831, he preached regularly at Borough Chapel in Southwark (London), and in September, attracted notice for two discourses at the [[Rotunda (Blackfriars)|Rotunda]] on Blackfriars Road, previously made notorious by the preaching of [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] (1784–1844).&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Imprisonment and final years==

In 1832, Ward and Twort came into conflict with the authorities at [[Derby]]. They had posted placards announcing an address on a religious [[fast day]], 15 July. These were torn down three times by a local clergyman, James Dean (d. 1882), whom Twort [[assault]]ed. Ward and Twort were subsequently [[indictment|indicted]] for blasphemy and assault. Tried on 4 August before [[James Alan Park|Sir James Alan Park]], Twort was convicted of the assault, and both were found guilty of blasphemy, and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in [[Derby Gaol]]. The case had already become something of a ''cause célèbre'', attracting the attention of the radical [[Richard Carlile]], amongst others.&lt;ref name="zemka" /&gt; On 15 August, [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]], another political radical and agitator, presented a petition to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from 200 citizens of London, expressing "disgust and indignation" at the sentence, and praying for the release of Ward and Twort. Hunt made a violent attack on the government for prosecuting opinions; [[Member of Parliament]] [[Joseph Hume]] spoke in favour of the petition, and the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] opposed. On Hunt's motion, the house was counted out while [[Alexander Perceval]] was speaking. No mitigation of the sentence was obtained, but the confinement, as Ward described it, was by no means harsh.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Freed on 3 February 1834, Ward travelled to Bristol and preached to a congregation there. At the end of 1835 he had a paralytic [[stroke]]. On October 1836, he settled in [[Leeds]]. He died at 91 Park Lane, Leeds, on 12 March 1837.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Personality and influences==

Though said to be of "gentle disposition" and "modest demeanour", Ward was a persuasive speaker, and in conversation and writing, was able to argue with some authority and even humour. His attempts at [[verse (poetry)|verse]] are uncouth, but often effective. His main influence was Joanna Southcott and her school, but he was also familiar with the ideas of [[George Fox]] (1624–1691) and [[Lodowicke Muggleton]] (1609–1698); however, most of his teaching came from his own considerations on the [[Bible]]. He regarded biblical scripture as [[Allegory|allegorical]], and elaborated a key for eliciting its hidden meanings. His theology is a spiritual [[pantheism]], which allows immortality only to the regenerate.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

==Printed works==

Ward's printed works include over thirty pieces, among which are:
* ''Vision of Judgment'' (1829, 2 parts)
* ''Living Oracle'' (1830)
* ''Book of Letters'' (1831)
* ''Discourses at the Rotunda'' (1831)
* ''Review of Trial and Sentence'' (1832)
* ''Creed'' (1832)
* ''Spiritual Alphabet'' (1833)
* ''Origin of Evil'' (1837)
* ''New Light on the Bible'' (1873)

In 1874, a "jubilee" edition of his works was planned, with the title ''Writings of Zion Ward, or Shiloh, the Spiritual Man'', but only three parts were actually published (Birmingham, 1874–5). However, some additional tracts were printed separately, e.g. ''Good and Evil made One'' (1877).

'''Roberta Joan Mitchell''', [[Order of Canada|CC]] (née '''Anderson'''; born November 7, 1943), professionally known as '''Joni Mitchell''', is a Canadian singer-songwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2042|title=JoniMitchell.com – Biography: 1943–1963 Childhood Days|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from [[Folk music|folk]], pop, rock, and [[jazz]], Mitchell's songs often reflect social and environmental ideals as well as her feelings about romance, confusion, disillusionment, and joy. She has received many accolades, including nine [[Grammy Award]]s. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called her "one of the greatest songwriters ever",&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wild |first=David |url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=935|title=Joni Mitchell |work=Rolling Stone |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=March 9, 2007 |format = reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AllMusic]] has stated, "When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4930/biography|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=allmusic | title=Joni Mitchell Biography | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424142644/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4930/biography | archive-date=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell began singing in small [[nightclub]]s in her hometown of [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], and throughout western Canada, before [[busking]] in the streets and nightclubs of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. In 1965, she moved to the United States and began touring. Some of her original songs ("Urge for Going", "[[Chelsea Morning]]", "[[Both Sides, Now]]", "The Circle Game") were covered by other [[folk singer]]s, allowing her to sign with [[Reprise Records]] and record her debut album, ''[[Song to a Seagull]]'', in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/joni-mitchell-the-legendary-singersongwriter-is-back-26438772.html |title=The Independent|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=August 10, 2007|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in [[Southern California]], Mitchell, with popular songs like "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]" and "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]", helped define an era and [[counterculture of the 1960s|a generation]]. Her 1971 album ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'' is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]", the highest entry by a female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time |title=The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (''Blue'' is listed at No. 30) |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, ''[[The New York Times]]'' chose ''Blue'' as one of the 25 albums that represented "turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/03/arts/critics-choices-albums-as-mileposts-in-a-musical-century.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Joni%20Mitchell%20Blue%20Beatles%20Revolver&amp;st=cse|title=Critics' Choices; Albums as Mileposts in a Musical Century|author=Jon Pareles|date=January 3, 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=December 17, 2009|author2=Neil Strauss|author3=Ben Ratliff|author4=Ann Powers|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] ranked ''Blue'' Number 1 on a list of Greatest Albums Made By Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/20/538307314/turning-the-tables-150-greatest-albums-made-by-women-page-15|title=The 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women|last=Tsioulcas|first=Anastasia|date=July 24, 2017|work=[[National Public Radio]]|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell's fifth album, ''[[For the Roses]]'', was released in 1972. She then switched labels and began exploring more [[jazz]]-influenced melodic ideas, by way of lush pop textures, on 1974's ''[[Court and Spark]]'', which featured the radio hits "[[Help Me (Joni Mitchell song)|Help Me]]" and "[[Free Man in Paris]]"&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r44890|pure_url=yes}} Ankeny, Jason. All Music Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and became her best-selling album.

Around 1975, Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from [[mezzo-soprano]] to more of a wide-ranging [[contralto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/09/369386571/the-music-midnight-makes-in-conversation-with-joni-mitchell/|title=The Music Midnight Makes: In Conversation With Joni Mitchell|publisher=NPR|date=December 9, 2014|first= Renee|last=Montagne|authorlink=Renee Montagne|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/print.cfm?id=2350 |title=Three Throats |work=Windsor Star |date=February 1978|first=Henry|last=Pleasants|authorlink=Henry Pleasants (music critic)|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|title=Joni Mitchell: The Studio Albums 1968–1979|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=November 9, 2012|first=Jessica|last=Hopper|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her distinctive piano and [[open tuning|open-tuned]] guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she explored jazz, melding it with influences of [[rock and roll]], [[R&amp;B]], classical music and [[world music|non-western beats]]. In the late 1970s, she began working closely with noted jazz musicians, among them [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Pat Metheny]], as well as [[Charles Mingus]], who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfjazz.blogspot.com/2015/01/joni-jazz_28.html |title=Joni &amp; Jazz |work=SFJAZZ Blog |accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later turned again toward pop, embraced [[electronic music]], and engaged in [[protest|political protest]]. In 2002, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[44th Annual Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/joni-mitchell |title=Joni Mitchell |date=May 14, 2017 |publisher=[[Grammy Awards]] |accessdate=October 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell is the sole producer credited on most of her albums, including all her work in the 1970s. A blunt critic of the [[music industry]], she quit touring and released her 17th, and reportedly last, album of original songs in 2007. With roots in visual art, Mitchell has designed most of her own album covers. She describes herself as a "painter derailed by circumstance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I sing my sorrow and I paint my joy|url = http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=519|work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 8, 2000|accessdate = July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{tone|date=June 2017}}
Mitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in [[Fort Macleod]], Alberta, Canada, the daughter of Myrtle Marguerite (McKee) and William Andrew Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/edmontonjournal/obituary.aspx?pid=155554751|title=William ANDERSON|work=Edmonton Journal|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's ancestors were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and Irish;&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/print.cfm?id=1894|title=Saint Joni|work=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Aidan|last=Dunne|page=14|date=July 19, 2008|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; her father was from a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] family that possibly had some [[Sami people|Sami]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="READ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1317|title=Heart of a Prairie Girl: Reader's Digest, July 2005|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/02/joni-mitchell-fashion-muse.html#K1PCmz:VC4|title=Joni Mitchell, the original folk-goddess muse, in the season seemingly inspired by her|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 8, 2015|first=Carl|last=Swanson|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was a teacher while her father was a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] [[flight lieutenant]] who instructed new pilots at [[RCAF Station Fort Macleod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=Michelle|title=Will You Take Me As I Am: Joni Mitchell's Blue Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvv-Ij2BLgoC&amp;pg=PT213|accessdate=August 14, 2015|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6655-7|pages=213–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later moved with her parents to various bases in western Canada. After the war she settled with her family in [[Saskatchewan]]. She later sang about her small-town upbringing in several of her songs, including "[[Hejira (album)#Song for Sharon|Song for Sharon]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

At school Mitchell struggled; her main interest was painting. During this time she briefly studied classical piano.&lt;ref name="BRAND"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Education of Joni Mitchell|first=Stewart|last=Brand|work=Co-Evolution Quarterly|date=June 1976|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=8|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age nine, Mitchell contracted [[polio]] in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. Following this incident she focused on her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time.&lt;ref name="crowe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowe |first=Cameron |url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs296-joni-mitchell/|title=Joni Mitchell |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 26, 1979 |accessdate=January 4, 2012|format = reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3668299/Joni-Mitchell-still-smoking.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Joni Mitchell: still smoking | first=Neil | last=McCormick | date=October 4, 2007 | accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11, she moved with her family to the city of [[Saskatoon]], which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook.&lt;ref name="crowe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=95|title=Joni Mitchell Makes Mingus Sing|work=[[Down Beat]]|first=Leonard|last=Feather|date=September 6, 1979|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/music/album.cfm?id=2 |title=Words and Music |publisher=JoniMitchell.com |date= |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Grade 12, she dropped out (she later picked up her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that she was getting too close to the criminal world.&lt;ref name="crowe" /&gt;

At this time, country music began to eclipse rock, and Mitchell wanted to play the guitar. As her mother disapproved of its hillbilly associations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1455|title=An interview with Joni Mitchell|work=Broadside|first=Dave|last=Wilson|date=February 14, 1968|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; she settled initially for the [[ukulele]]. Eventually she taught herself guitar from a [[Pete Seeger]] songbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/joni-mitchell/biography |title=Joni Mitchell Biography |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the polio had affected her fingers, and she had to devise dozens of alternative tunings of her own. This improvised approach later helped her break free of standard approaches to harmony and structure in her songwriting.&lt;ref name="100GreatestGuitarists"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell started singing with her friends at bonfires around [[Waskesiu Lake]], northwest of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]]. Her first paid performance was on October 31, 1962, at a Saskatoon club that featured folk and jazz performers.&lt;ref name="GIGS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2018/01/a-coffee-house-for-sponge-people-rise.html|title='A coffee house for the sponge people' The rise and fall of the Crypt|work=It's Psychedelic Baby Magazine|date=February 1, 2018|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18, she widened her repertoire to include her own favorite performers like [[Édith Piaf]] and [[Miles Davis]]. Though she never performed jazz herself in those days, she and her friends sought out gigs by jazz musicians. Mitchell said, "My jazz background began with one of the early [[Lambert, Hendricks and Ross]] albums." That album, ''[[Lambert, Hendricks, &amp; Ross!|The Hottest New Group in Jazz]]'', was hard to find in Canada, she says. "So I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price. I considered that album to be my Beatles. I learned every song off of it, and I don't think there is another album anywhere—including my own—on which I know every note and word of every song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/print.cfm?id=595|title=Joni Mitchell Has Her Mojo Working|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|first=Leonard|last=Feather|date=June 10, 1979|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But art was still her chief passion at this stage, and when she finished high school at [[Aden Bowman Collegiate]] in Saskatoon, she took art classes at the [[Saskatoon Technical Collegiate]] with abstract expressionist painter [[Henry Bonli]],&lt;ref name="Weller2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheila Weller|title=Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon--And the Journey of a Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n5LMaA2xMsC|accessdate=February 11, 2017|date=April 8, 2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7434-9147-1|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then left home to attend the [[Alberta College of Art]] in Calgary for the 1963–64 school year. Here she felt disillusioned about the high priority given to technical skill over free-class creativity,&lt;ref name="BRAND"/&gt; and also felt out of step with the trend towards pure abstraction, and the tendency to move into commercial art. After a year, at age 20, she dropped out of school, a decision that much displeased her parents, who could remember the [[Great Depression]] and valued education highly.

She continued to play gigs as a folk musician on weekends, at her college and at a local hotel. Around this time she took a $15-a-week job in a Calgary coffeehouse, "singing long tragic songs in a minor key". She sang at [[hootenannies]] and made appearances on some local TV and radio shows in Calgary.&lt;ref name="GIGS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/chronology/ |title=A Chronology of Appearances |publisher=JoniMitchell.com |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, at the age of 20, she told her mother that she intended to be a folk singer in Toronto, and she left western Canada for the first time in her life, heading east for Ontario. On the three-day train ride there, Mitchell wrote her first song, "Day After Day". She stopped at the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] to see [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], a Saskatchewan-born Cree folk singer who had inspired her. A year later, Mitchell too played Mariposa, her first gig for a major audience, and years later, Sainte-Marie herself covered Mitchell's work.

==Career==

===1964–1969: Folk breakthrough===

====Ontario====
Lacking the $200 needed for musicians' union fees, Mitchell managed a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto's [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] neighbourhood, but she mostly played non-union gigs "in church basements and YMCA meeting halls". Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to [[busking]],&lt;ref name="GIGS"/&gt; while she "worked in the women's wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/print.cfm?id=1139|title=A Witness to Troubled Times|agency=Associated Press|first= Jeff|last=Bradley|date=May 13, 1988|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, she lived in a rooming house, directly across the hall from poet [[Duke Redbird]].&lt;ref name=dirtpoor&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/437645518.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+7%2C+1997&amp;author=by+John+Goddard+SPECIAL+TO+THE+STAR&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.1&amp;desc=Joni%3A+%60Dirt+poor%2C%27+20+and+pregnant+Excerpts+from+a+new+book+reveal+details+of+Joni+Mitchell%27s+life+in+%2760s+Toronto |title=Joni: 'Dirt poor,' 20 and pregnant; Excerpts from a new book reveal details of Joni Mitchell's life in '60s Toronto |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=April 7, 1997 |accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a lot of name recognition, Mitchell also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property and would no longer pass muster. She said, "You'd come into a town and you'd be told, you can't sing that, you can't sing that." {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} She resolved to write her own songs.

===== Daughter =====
In late 1964, Mitchell discovered that she was pregnant by her Calgary ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath. She later wrote, "[he] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed fuel for last winter's occupants."&lt;ref name="LINER"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/music/album.cfm?id=24 |title=Words and Music |publisher=JoniMitchell.com |date= |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, "[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]]" was legally unavailable in Canada, as was abortion, yet there was a strong social stigma against women giving birth out of wedlock. In Toronto, she could at least do so quietly, without alarming her relatives back home. In February 1965 she gave birth to a baby girl. Unable to provide for the baby, she placed her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, for adoption. The experience remained private for most of her career, but she made allusions to it in several songs, for example "[[Little Green (song)|Little Green]]," which she performed in the 1960s and recorded eventually for the 1971 album ''Blue''.

In "Chinese Cafe", from the 1982 album ''Wild Things Run Fast'', Mitchell sang, "Your kids are coming up straight / My child's a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her." These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time. The existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art-school days in the 1960s sold the story of the adoption to a tabloid magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-04-08/news/ls-46389_1_joni-mitchell|title=Both sides at last|first=Bill|last=Higgins|date=April 8, 1997|accessdate=November 27, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pertman|first=Adam|title=Adoption Nation: How the Adoption Revolution is Transforming Our Families – and America|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RzCLgIfmegMC|page=289}}|accessdate=November 27, 2011|date=March 16, 2011|publisher=Harvard Common Press|isbn=978-1-55832-716-0|pages=289–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Brian D |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/joni-mitchells-secret/ |title=Joni Mitchell's Secret |publisher=Maclean's |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=March 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability to take care of her as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun. When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to, she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally.

A few weeks after the birth of her daughter in 1965, Joni Anderson was playing gigs again around Yorkville, beginning to sing original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk singer from [[Michigan]]. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Joni left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together.&lt;ref name="GIGS" /&gt; Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1282|title=JoniMitchell.com Library: Joni Mitchell: Word, March 2005|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michigan====
While living at the Verona apartments in Detroit's [[Cass Corridor]], Chuck and Joni were regular performers at area coffee houses, including the Chessmate on Livernois, near Six Mile Road; the Alcove bar, near [[Wayne State University]]; the Rathskeller, a restaurant on the campus of the [[University of Detroit]]; and the Raven Gallery in [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/March-2009/Sixties-Folklore/|title=Sixties Folklore|work=Hour Detroit|date=March 2009|first=George|last=Bulanda|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thevarsitynews.net/news/view.php/104192/From-The-VN-Archives-Stars-like-Joni-Mit |title=From The VN Archives: Stars like Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt polished their talents at Chessmate coffeehouse blocks from campus |last=Grant |first=Cody |date=March 2, 2011 |website=The Varsity News |access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician, Eric Andersen, in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Brand]] featured her several times on his CBC television program ''[[Let's Sing Out]]'' in 1965 and 1966. The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell dissolved in early 1967, and Joni moved to New York City to follow her musical path as a solo artist. She played venues up and down the East Coast, including [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], and [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]]. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and [[folk clubs]] and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style.

====New York====
Folk singer [[Tom Rush]] had met Mitchell in Toronto and was impressed with her songwriting ability. He took "Urge for Going" to the popular folk artist [[Judy Collins]], but she was not interested in the song at the time, so Rush recorded it himself. Country singer [[George Hamilton IV]] heard Rush performing it and recorded a hit country version. Other artists who recorded Mitchell's songs in the early years were [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]] ("The Circle Game"), [[Dave Van Ronk]] ("Both Sides Now"), and eventually [[Judy Collins]] ("Both Sides Now", a top ten hit for her, and "Michael from Mountains", both included on her 1967 album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]''). Collins also covered "Chelsea Morning", another recording that eclipsed Mitchell's own commercial success early on.

====California====
While Mitchell was playing one night in the Gaslight South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1357 |title= A Conversation with David Crosby |publisher=JoniMitchell.com/JMDL Library |date= March 15, 1997 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a club in [[Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida|Coconut Grove]], Florida, [[David Crosby]] walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Monk p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; He took her back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Soon she was being managed by [[Elliot Roberts]], who, after being urged by Buffy Sainte-Marie, had first seen her play in a Greenwich Village coffee house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2558 |title= A Conversation with Buffy Sainte-Marie |publisher=JoniMitchell.com/JMDL Library |date= March 6, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a close business association with [[David Geffen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 71, Broadway Books (New York 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. Crosby convinced a record company to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at that time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when [[Reprise Records]] released her debut album, known either as ''Joni Mitchell'' or ''[[Song to a Seagull]]''.

Mitchell toured steadily to promote the LP. The tour helped create eager anticipation for Mitchell's second LP, ''[[Clouds (Joni Mitchell album)|Clouds]]'', which was released in April 1969. This album contained Mitchell's own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists: "[[Chelsea Morning]]", "[[Both Sides, Now]]", and "Tin Angel". The covers of both LPs, including a self-portrait on ''[[Clouds (Joni Mitchell album)|Clouds]]'', were designed and painted by Mitchell, a blending of her painting and music that she continued throughout her career.

===1970–1974: Mainstream success===
[[File:Joni mitchell 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Mitchell performing in concert at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in August 1974|241x241px]]
In March 1970, ''[[Clouds (Joni Mitchell album)|Clouds]]'' produced her first [[Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording|Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance]]. The following month, Reprise released her third album, ''[[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|Ladies of the Canyon]]''. Mitchell's sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of Mitchell's style in her most popular era. Her own version of "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]", slower than the cover by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], was performed solo on a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]]. The album also included the already-familiar song "The Circle Game" and the environmental anthem "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]", with its now-famous line, "they paved paradise and put up a parking lot."

''Ladies of the Canyon'' was an instant smash on [[FM radio]] and sold briskly, eventually becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted "Top Female Performer" for 1970 by ''[[Melody Maker]]'', a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of [[James Taylor]]'s ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]'' album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals on the track "[[You've Got a Friend]]". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'', released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell's talent to his own, David Crosby said, "By the time she did ''Blue'', she was past me and rushing toward the horizon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122575310809894821|title=A 65th Birthday Tribute to Joni Mitchell|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=November 4, 2008|first=Jim|last=Fusilli|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blue'' was an almost instant critical and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced "[[Carey (song)|Carey]]" was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of ''Blue'' departed further from the sounds of ''Ladies of the Canyon''. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions ("All I Want", "[[A Case of You]]"), while others such as "[[Blue (Joni Mitchell song)|Blue]]", "[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]" and "[[The Last Time I Saw Richard]]" were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most [[confessional poetry|confessional]] album, Mitchell later said of ''Blue'', "I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,&amp;nbsp;... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, but at the time of ''Blue'', our pop stars never admitted these things."&lt;ref name="shumway"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shumway|first=David R.|title= Rock Star: The Making of Musical Icons from Elvis to Springsteen|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781421413938|year=2014|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-1-4214-1392-1|pages=159, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in "[[California (Joni Mitchell song)|California]]"). Mitchell later remarked, "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong."&lt;ref name="crowe" /&gt;

Mitchell decided to return to the live stage after the great success of ''Blue'', and she presented new songs on tour which appeared on her next album, her fifth, ''[[For the Roses]]''. The album was released in October 1972 and immediately zoomed up the charts. She followed with the single, "[[You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio]]", which peaked at No. 25 in the Billboard Charts in February 1973, becoming her first bona fide hit single.

''[[Court and Spark]]'', released in January 1974, saw Mitchell begin the flirtation with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]] that marked her experimental period ahead. ''Court and Spark'' went to No. 1 on the Cashbox Album Charts. The LP made Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker "Raised on Robbery", which was released right before Christmas 1973, and "[[Help Me (Joni Mitchell song)|Help Me]]", which was released in March of the following year, and became Mitchell's only Top 10 single when it peaked at No. 7 in the first week of June. "[[Free Man in Paris]]" was another hit single and staple in her catalog.

While recording ''Court and Spark'', Mitchell had tried to make a clean break with her earlier folk sound, producing the album herself and employing jazz/pop [[fusion (music)|fusion]] band the [[L.A. Express]] as what she called her first real backing group. In February 1974, her tour with the L.A. Express began, and they received rave notices as they traveled across the United States and Canada during the next two months. A series of shows at L.A.'s [[Universal Amphitheater]] on August 14–17 were recorded for a live album. In November, Mitchell released that album, ''[[Miles of Aisles]]'', a two-record set including all but two songs from the L.A. concerts (one selection each from the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]], on March 2, and the L.A. Music Center, on March 4, were also included in the set). The live album slowly moved up to No. 2, matching ''Court and Spark''{{'}}s chart peak on Billboard. "Big Yellow Taxi", the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (she released another version of the song in 2007).

In January 1975, ''Court and Spark'' received four nominations for Grammy Awards, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], for which Mitchell was the only woman nominated. She won only the [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals]].

===1975–1980: Jazz explorations===
[[File:Joni Mitchell (1975).png|thumb|right|Mitchell in 1975|231x231px]]
Mitchell went into the studio in early 1975 to record acoustic demos of some songs that she had written since the ''Court and Spark'' tour. A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band. Her musical interests were now diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments. The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]''. On "The Jungle Line", she made an early effort at [[sample (music)|sampling]] a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s. "In France They Kiss on Main Street" continued the lush pop sounds of ''Court and Spark'', and efforts such as the title song and "Edith and the Kingpin" chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California.

During 1975, Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the [[Rolling Thunder Revue tours]] featuring [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joan Baez]], and in 1976 she performed as part of ''[[The Last Waltz]]'' by [[the Band]]. In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for the album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns'', though the Grammy went to [[Linda Ronstadt]].

In early 1976, Mitchell traveled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine. Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976's ''[[Hejira (album)|Hejira]]''. She stated that "This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That's why there were no piano songs&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="crowe" /&gt; ''Hejira'' was arguably Mitchell's most experimental album so far, due to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist [[Jaco Pastorius]] on several songs, namely the first single, "[[Coyote (song)|Coyote]]", the atmospheric "Hejira", the disorienting, guitar-heavy "Black Crow", and the album's last song "Refuge of the Roads". The album climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album oriented FM rock stations. Yet "Coyote", backed with "Blue Motel Room", failed to chart on the Hot 100. ''Hejira'' "did not sell as briskly as Mitchell's earlier, more "radio-friendly" albums, [but] its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years".&lt;ref name="ottawa"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Doug |url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1459|title=The trouble she's seen: Doug Fischer talks to Joni Mitchell about her seminal album, Hejira |work=The Ottawa Citizen |date=October 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell herself believes the album to be unique. In 2006 she said, "I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on ''Hejira'' could only have come from me."&lt;ref name="ottawa" /&gt;

In mid-1977, Mitchell began work on new recordings that became her first double studio album. Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she'd done in the past. She invited Pastorius back, and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers [[Weather Report]], including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Layered, atmospheric compositions such as "Overture/Cotton Avenue" featured more improvisatory collaboration, while "Paprika Plains" was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell's memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music. "Dreamland" and "The Tenth World", featuring [[Chaka Khan]] on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of ''Hejira''. Mitchell also revived "Jericho", written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting. ''[[Don Juan's Reckless Daughter]]'' was released in December 1977. The album received mixed reviews but still sold relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. The cover of the album created its own controversy: Mitchell was featured in several photographs, including one where she was disguised as a black man, wearing a curly afro wig, a white suit and vest, and dark sunglasses. The character, whom she called Art Nouveau, was based on a pimp who, she says, once complimented her while walking down an LA street – and was a symbol of her turn toward jazz and streetwise lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The only black man at the Party: Joni Mitchell enters the rock canon|first=Miles Parks|last=Grier|journal=Genders|issue=56|date=September 2012|url = http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2532|accessdate = October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after the release of ''Don Juan's Reckless Daughter'', Mitchell was contacted by the esteemed jazz composer, bandleader and bassist [[Charles Mingus]], who had heard the orchestrated song "Paprika Plains", and wanted her to work with him. She began a collaboration with Mingus, who died before the project was completed in 1979. She finished the tracks, and the resulting album, ''[[Mingus (Joni Mitchell album)|Mingus]]'', was released in June 1979, though it was poorly received in the press. Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell's overall sound, and though the album topped out at No. 17 on the Billboard album charts—a higher placement than ''Don Juan's Reckless Daughter''—''Mingus'' still fell short of gold status, making it her first album since the 1960s to not sell at least a half-million copies.

Mitchell's tour to promote ''Mingus'' began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles' [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] and one at the [[Santa Barbara County Bowl]], where she recorded and filmed the concert. It was her first tour in several years, and with Pastorius, jazz guitarist [[Pat Metheny]], and other members of her band, Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz-inspired albums. When the tour ended she began a year of work, turning the tapes from the Santa Barbara County Bowl show into a two-album set and a concert film, both to be called ''[[Shadows and Light (Joni Mitchell album)|Shadows and Light]]''. Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double-album, it was released in September 1980, and made it up to No. 38 on the Billboard Charts. A single from the LP, "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?", Mitchell's duet with [[The Persuasions]] (her opening act for the tour), bubbled under on Billboard, just missing the Hot 100.

===1981–1993: Pop, electronics and protest===
For a year and a half, Mitchell worked on the tracks for her next album. During this period she recorded with bassist [[Larry Klein]], whom she married in 1982. While the album was being readied for release, her friend David Geffen, founder of [[Asylum Records]], decided to start a new label, [[Geffen Records]]. Still distributed by Warner Bros. (who controlled Asylum Records), Geffen negated the remaining contractual obligations Mitchell had with Asylum and signed her to his new label. ''[[Wild Things Run Fast]]'' (1982) marked a return to pop songwriting, including "Chinese Cafe/[[Unchained Melody]]", which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous [[The Righteous Brothers]] hit, and "[[(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care]]", a remake of the [[Elvis]] chestnut, which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 1970s sales peak when it climbed to No. 47 on the charts. The album peaked on the Billboard Charts in its fifth week at No. 25.
[[File:Joni Mitchell 1983.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mitchell performing in 1983]]
In early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and then going back to the United States. A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as ''Refuge of the Roads''. As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British [[synthpop]] performer and producer [[Thomas Dolby]] was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record [by Geffen], and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems&amp;nbsp;... He may be able to do it faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=661|title=Joni Mitchell|work=New Musical Express|date=November 30, 1985|first=Alan|last=Jackson|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album that resulted, ''[[Dog Eat Dog (Joni Mitchell album)|Dog Eat Dog]]'', released in October 1985, turned out to be only a moderate seller, peaking at No. 63 on Billboard's Top Albums Chart, Mitchell's lowest chart position since her first album peaked at No. 189 almost eighteen years before. One of the songs on the album, "Tax Free", created controversy by lambasting "[[televangelist]]s" and what she saw as a drift to the [[Christian right|religious right]] in American politics. "The churches came after me", she wrote, "they attacked me, though the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian Church]], which I've seen described as the only church in America which actually uses its head, wrote me a letter of congratulation."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;

Mitchell continued experimenting with synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album, 1988's ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm]]''. She also collaborated with artists including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Wendy &amp; Lisa]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Don Henley]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Benjamin Orr]] of the [[The Cars|Cars]]. The album's first official single, "My Secret Place", was in fact a duet with Gabriel, and just missed the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song "Lakota" was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes, in this case the [[Wounded Knee incident]], the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in the previous decade. Musically, several songs fit into the trend of [[world music]] popularized by Gabriel during the era. Reviews were mostly favorable towards the album, and the cameos by well-known musicians brought it considerable attention. ''Chalk Mark'' ultimately improved on the chart performance of ''Dog Eat Dog'', peaking at No. 45.

In 1990, Mitchell, who by then rarely performed live anymore, participated in [[Roger Waters]]' ''[[The Wall Concert in Berlin]]''. She performed the song "[[Goodbye Blue Sky]]" and was also one of the performers on the concert's final song "[[The Tide Is Turning]]" along with Waters, [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Paul Carrack]].

Throughout the first half of 1990, Mitchell recorded songs that appeared on her next album. She delivered the final mixes for the new album to Geffen just before Christmas, after trying nearly a hundred different sequences for the songs. The album ''[[Night Ride Home]]'' was released in March 1991. In the United States, it premiered on Billboard's Top Album charts at No. 68, moving up to No. 48 in its second week, and peaking at No. 41 in its sixth week. In the United Kingdom, the album premiered at No. 25 on the album charts. Critically, it was better received than her 1980s work and seemed to signal a move closer to her acoustic beginnings, along with some references to the style of ''Hejira''. This album was also Mitchell's first since Geffen Records was sold to [[MCA Inc.]], meaning that ''Night Ride Home'' was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA (now [[Warner Music Group]]).

===1994–2001: Resurgence and vocal development===
[[File:Joni Michtell pets Buddy in the oval office.jpg|thumb|Mitchell pets [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]'s dog [[Buddy (dog)|Buddy]] in the [[Oval Office]] in 1998|265x265px]] 
To wider audiences, the real "return to form" for Mitchell came with 1994's [[Grammy]]-winning ''[[Turbulent Indigo]]''. While the recording period also saw the divorce of Mitchell and bassist [[Larry Klein]], their marriage having lasted almost 12 years, ''Indigo'' was seen as Mitchell's most accessible set of songs in years. Songs such as "Sex Kills", "Sunny Sunday", "Borderline" and "The Magdalene Laundries" mixed social commentary and guitar-focused melodies for "a startling comeback".&lt;ref name="Toronto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gill |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1575 |title=Joni Mitchell in person |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2007 |format = reprint }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album won two Grammy awards, including Best Pop Album, and it coincided with a much-publicized resurgence in interest in Mitchell's work by a younger generation of singer-songwriters.

In 1996, Mitchell agreed to release a greatest ''[[Hits (Joni Mitchell album)|Hits]]'' collection when label Reprise also allowed her a second album, called  ''[[Misses (album)|Misses]]'', to include some of the lesser known songs from her career. ''Hits'' charted at No. 161 in the US, but made No. 6 in the UK. Mitchell also included on ''Hits'', for the first time on an album, her first recording, a version of "Urge for Going" which preceded ''Song to a Seagull'' but was previously released only as a B-side.

[[File:Joni Mitchell and Peter Bogner.jpg|thumb|left|Joni Mitchell and Peter Bogner listening to premix of [[Herbie Hancock]]'s ''[[Gershwin's World]]'' ([[Venice Beach, California]] in 1999)|251x251px]]
Two years later, Mitchell released her final set of "original" new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits, 1998's ''[[Taming the Tiger]]''. She promoted ''Tiger'' with a return to regular concert appearances, including a co-headlining tour with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Van Morrison]].

On the album, Mitchell had played a custom guitar equipped with a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] hexaphonic pickup which connected to a Roland VG-8 modeling processor. The device allowed Mitchell to play any of her many alternate tunings without having to re-tune the guitar. The guitar's output, through the VG-8, was transposed to any of her tunings in real-time. This improved live performance as Mitchell didn't need to switch guitars between songs.

It was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, particularly on her older songs; the singer later admitted to feeling the same way, explaining that "I'd go to hit a note and there was nothing there".&lt;ref name="renai"&gt;{{cite news |last=Eggar |first=Robin |url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1569|title=The Renaissance Woman |work=Sunday Times |location=UK |date=February 11, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2007 |format = reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she has been described as "one of the world's last great smokers"), Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were due to other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio.&lt;ref name="renai" /&gt; In an interview in 2004, she denied that "my terrible habits" had anything to do with her more limited range and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that in her opinion her voice became a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them like she did in her youth.&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

The singer's next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to "fulfill contractual obligations",&lt;ref name="Toronto" /&gt; but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material. ''[[Both Sides Now (Joni Mitchell album)|Both Sides Now]]'' (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards, performed with an orchestra, featuring orchestral arrangements by [[Vince Mendoza]]. The album also contained remakes of "A Case of You" and the title track "Both Sides, Now", two early hits transposed down to Mitchell's now dusky, soulful alto range. It received mostly strong reviews and spawned a short national tour, with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop. Its success led to 2002's ''[[Travelogue (Joni Mitchell album)|Travelogue]]'', a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments.

===2002–2005: Retirement and retrospectives===
Mitchell stated at the time that ''Travelogue'' would be her final album. In a 2002 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', she voiced discontent with the current state of the music industry, describing it as a "cesspool".&lt;ref name="wild" /&gt; Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry's dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet.

During the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work. In 2003, her Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered four-disc box set, ''The Complete Geffen Recordings'', including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks. A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: ''The Beginning of Survival'' (2004), ''[[Dreamland (Joni Mitchell album)|Dreamland]]'' (2004), and ''Songs of a Prairie Girl'' (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the [[Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Centennial]] concert in Saskatoon. The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. In the ''Prairie Girl'' liner notes, she writes that the collection is "my contribution to Saskatchewan's Centennial celebrations".

In the early 1990s, Mitchell signed a deal with [[Random House]] to publish an autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Chrissie.

Although Mitchell stated that she would no longer tour or give concerts, she has made occasional public appearances to speak on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/05/05-04mitchell-audio.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515110819/http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/05/05-04mitchell-audio.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 15, 2006 |title=Joni Mitchell Audio |publisher=Commonwealthclub.org |accessdate=February 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell divides her time between her longtime home in Los Angeles, and the {{convert|80|acre|adj=on}} property in [[Sechelt, British Columbia]], that she has owned since the early 1970s.

===2006–2015: Late recordings===
In an interview with the ''[[The Ottawa Citizen|Ottawa Citizen]]'' in October 2006, Mitchell "revealed that she was recording her first collection of new songs in nearly a decade", but gave few other details.&lt;ref name="ottawa" /&gt; Four months later, in an interview with the ''New York Times'', Mitchell said that the forthcoming album, titled ''[[Shine (Joni Mitchell album)|Shine]]'', was inspired by the war in Iraq and "something her grandson had said while listening to family fighting: 'Bad dreams are good—in the great plan.'"&lt;ref name="nytdance"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yaffe |first=David |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E7D6143FF937A35751C0A9619C8B63 |title=DANCE: Working Three Shifts, And Outrage Overtime |work=The New York Times |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early media reports characterized the album as having "a minimal feel&amp;nbsp;... that harks back to [Mitchell's] early work" and a focus on political and environmental issues.&lt;ref name="renai" /&gt;

In February 2007, Mitchell returned to [[Calgary]] and served as an advisor for the [[Alberta Ballet Company]] premiere of "The Fiddle and the Drum", a dance choreographed by Jean Grand-Maître to both new and old songs.&lt;ref&gt;From the DVD ''Fiddle and the Drum '' cover&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with the French-Canadian TV director Mario Rouleau, well known for work in art and dance for television, such as [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref&gt;From the cover of the DVD: ''Cirque du Soleil, the concert'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt; She also filmed portions of the rehearsals for a documentary that she is working on. Of the flurry of recent activity she quipped, "I've never worked so hard in my life."&lt;ref name="nytdance"/&gt;

In mid-2007, Mitchell's official fan-run site confirmed speculation that she had signed a two-record deal with [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] label. ''Shine'' was released by the label on September 25, 2007, debuting at number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart, her highest chart position in the United States since the release of ''[[Hejira (album)|Hejira]]'' in 1976, over thirty years previously, and at number 36 on the United Kingdom albums chart.

On the same day, [[Herbie Hancock]], a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell's, released ''[[River: The Joni Letters]]'', an album paying tribute to Mitchell's work. Among the album's contributors were [[Norah Jones]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and Mitchell herself, who contributed a vocal to the re-recording of "The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)" (originally on her album ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbiehancock.com/news/story.php?sid=59|title=Herbie Hancock's "River: The Joni Letters" Set For Release on September 25th|date=August 1, 2007|website=HerbieHancock.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430185737/http://www.herbiehancock.com/news/story.php?sid=59|archivedate=April 30, 2008|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2008, Hancock's recording won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It was the first time in 43 years that a jazz artist took the top prize at the annual award ceremony. In accepting the award, Hancock paid tribute to Mitchell as well as to [[Miles Davis]] and [[John Coltrane]]. At the same ceremony Mitchell won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Performance for the opening track, "One Week Last Summer", from her album ''Shine''.

In a 2010 interview with the ''Los Angeles Times'', Mitchell was quoted as saying that singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], with whom she had worked closely in the past, was a fake and a [[plagiarism|plagiarist]]. The controversial remark was widely reported by other media.&lt;ref name="Mitchell: Dylan's a fake"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36741933 | work=NBC Today Show | title=Mitchell: Dylan's a 'fake'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/23/bob-dylan-joni-mitchell | work=The Guardian | title=Bob Dylan is 'a plagiarist', claims Joni Mitchell | location=London | first=Sean | last=Michaels | date=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell did not explain the contention further, but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan's 2006 album ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Mitchell: Dylan's a fake"/&gt; In a 2013 interview with [[Jian Ghomeshi]], she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement while mentioning the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan's 2001 album ''[[Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)|Love and Theft]]'' in the general context of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2013/6/Exclusive-Joni-Mitchell-talks-to-Jian-Ghomeshi-about-death-hippies-art-and-getting-Banffed |title=Exclusive: Joni Mitchell talks to Jian Ghomeshi about death, hippies, art and getting 'Banffed' |publisher=[[CBC Music]] |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}{{cbignore}}{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rejection of Baby Boom counter-culture ==
Despite her prominence among the young musicians of the 1960s and 1970s, and her writing of "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]" (where she was prevented from performing because her manager thought it was more advantageous to appear on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''&lt;ref&gt;William Ruhlmann, "Joni Mitchell:  From Blue to Indigo", ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'' (1995) republished in Stacey Luftig, ed., ''The Joni Mitchell Companion:  Four Decades of Commentary'' New York:  Schirmer Books, pp. 37–38. Also [http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=115 available online] at the Joni Mitchell Library&lt;/ref&gt;), she did not align herself with the [[Post–World War II baby boom|Baby Boom]] era's protest movements or its cultural manifestation, the associated [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counter-culture]]. She has said that the parents of the boomers were unhappy, and "out of it came this liberated, spoiled, selfish generation into the costume ball of free love, free sex, free music, free, free, free, free we're so free. And [[Woodstock]] was the culmination of it." But "I was not a part of that," she explained in an interview. "I was not a part of the anti-war movement, either. I played in Fort Bragg. I went the [[Bob Hope]] route because I had uncles who died in the war, and I thought it was a shame to blame the boys who were drafted." Even [[Bob Dylan]], one of the most iconic musicians of the Baby Boom generation, has not escaped Mitchell's generational critique: "I like a lot of Bob's songs. Musically he's not very gifted."&lt;ref name="Ghomeshi2013"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jian Ghomeshi|title=The Joni Mitchell Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEJuiZN3jI8|website=youtube.com|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guitar style===
While some of Mitchell's most popular songs were written on piano, almost every song she composed on the guitar uses an [[open tuning|open]], or non-standard, tuning; she has written songs in some 50 tunings, playing what she has called "Joni's weird chords". The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide-ranging textures. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive "slaps".

In 1995, Mitchell's friend Fred Walecki, proprietor of Westwood Music in Los Angeles, developed a solution to alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings. Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] VG-8 [[Guitar synthesizer|virtual guitar]], a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded the pickup signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=38|title=JMDL LIBRARY: The guitar odyssey of Joni Mitchell: My Secret Place: Acoustic Guitar, August 1996|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell was also highly innovative [[harmony|harmonically]] in her early work (1966–72), incorporating [[Mode (music)|modality]], [[chromaticism]], and [[pedal point]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Whitesell, "Harmonic Palette in Early Joni Mitchell", p. 173. ''Popular Music'', Vol. 21, No. 2, (May 2002), pp. 173–93. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On her 1968 debut album ''[[Song to a Seagull]]'', Mitchell used both [[quartal and quintal harmony]] in "Dawntreader" and quintal harmony in ''Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitesell, p. 131, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 ''Rolling Stone'' named her the 72nd greatest guitarist of all time; she was the highest-ranked woman on the list.&lt;ref name="100GreatestGuitarists" /&gt;

===Influence===

Mitchell's approach to music struck a chord with many female listeners. In an era dominated by the stereotypical male rock star, she presented herself as "multidimensional and conflicted&amp;nbsp;... allow[ing] her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans". Mitchell asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music. She has disclaimed the notion that she is a "feminist"; in a 2013 interview she rejected the label, stating, "I'm not a feminist. I don't want to get a posse against men. I'd rather go toe-to-toe; work it out."&lt;ref name="Ghomeshi2013"/&gt; David Shumway notes that Mitchell "became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full sense of that term.... Whatever Mitchell's stated views of feminism, what she represents more than any other performer of her era is the new prominence of women's perspectives in cultural and political life."&lt;ref name="shumway"/&gt;

Mitchell's work has had an influence on many other artists, including [[Katy Perry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garland|first1=Emma|title=A Deep Dive into Katy Perry's 2007 Myspace Page|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/a-deep-dive-into-katy-perrys-2007-myspace-page|website=Noisey|publisher=Vice Media|date=January 10, 2017|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellie Goulding]], [[Corinne Bailey Rae]], [[Gabrielle Aplin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-joni-mitchell-generation-james-blake-corinne-bailey-rae-and-others-pay-tribute-8915548.html|title=The Joni Mitchell generation: James Blake, Corinne Bailey Rae and others pay tribute|author=Elisa Bray|work=[[The Independent]]|date=November 1, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] from [[Opeth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-opeths-mikael-akerfeldt-talks-about-bands-new-album-heritage|title=Interview: Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt Talks About the Band's New Album, 'Heritage'|work=[[Guitar World]]|date=September 29, 2011|first=Josh|last=Hart|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marillion]] members [[Steve Hogarth]] and [[Steve Rothery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/phil-simon/an-interview-with-marilli_b_1874019.html | title= An Interview with Marillion's Steve Hogarth | work=The Huffington Post | date=September 11, 2012 | accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allaccessmagazine.com/vol7/issue12/steve-rothery.html | title=Steve Rothery interview | work=All Access Magazine | first=Kim | last=Thore | accessdate=August 10, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325022145/http://allaccessmagazine.com/vol7/issue12/steve-rothery.html# | archive-date=March 25, 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; their former vocalist and lyricist [[Fish (singer)|Fish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://thequietus.com/articles/12274-fish-marillion-favourite-albums?page=4 | title= This Must Be The Plaice: Fish's Favourite Albums | work=The Quietus | date=May 20, 2013 | accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Carrack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats-on/music/squeeze-roxy-musics-paul-carrack-4720220 | title= Squeeze and Roxy Music's Paul Carrack talks G Live | work=Get Surrey | date=January 16, 2013 | accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haim (band)|Haim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2013/11/The-ABCs-of-HAIM-pops-coolest-sister-act |title=The ABCs of HAIM – pops coolest sister act |publisher=Mucic.CBC.ca |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=February 25, 2014 }}{{cbignore}}{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taylor Swift]]. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager; "I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to ''[[Court and Spark]]''; I worshipped her when I was in high school. ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'' is amazing. I would have to say of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hirshey |first=Gerri |title=The Women in Rock Interviews |work=Rolling Stone |date=November 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several artists have had success [[cover version|covering]] Mitchell's songs. [[Judy Collins]]'s 1967 recording of "Both Sides, Now" reached No. 8 on Billboard charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists (Mitchell's own recording did not see release until two years later, on her second album ''[[Clouds (Joni Mitchell album)|Clouds]]''). This is Mitchell's most-covered song by far, with over 1,200 versions recorded at latest count.&lt;ref name="covers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/music/covers-most.cfm|title=Joni Undercover|publisher=JoniMitchell.com|accessdate=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hole (band)|Hole]] also covered "Both Sides, Now" in 1991 on their debut album, ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'', retitling it "Clouds", with the lyrics altered by frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]. Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and [[Amy Grant]] in 1995 scored hits with covers of "Big Yellow Taxi", the third-most covered song in Mitchell's repertoire (with over 300 covers).&lt;ref name="covers"/&gt; Recent releases of this song have been by [[Counting Crows]] in 2002 and [[Nena]] in 2007. [[Janet Jackson]] used a sample of the chorus of "Big Yellow Taxi" as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single "[[Got 'Til It's Gone]]", which also features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] saying "Joni Mitchell never lies". "[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]", from Mitchell's album ''Blue'' became the second-most covered song of Mitchell's in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums.&lt;ref name="covers"/&gt; Rap artists [[Kanye West]] and [[Mac Dre]] have also sampled Mitchell's vocals in their music. In addition, [[Annie Lennox]] has covered "Ladies of the Canyon" for the B-side of her 1995 hit "[[No More I Love You's]]". [[Mandy Moore]] covered "Help Me" in 2003. In 2004 singer [[George Michael]] covered her song "Edith and the Kingpin" for a radio show. "River" has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by [[Dianne Reeves]] (1999), [[James Taylor]] (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), [[Allison Crowe]] (2004), [[Rachael Yamagata]] (2004), [[Aimee Mann]] (2005), and [[Sarah McLachlan]] (2006). McLachlan also did a version of "Blue" in 1996, and [[Cat Power]] recorded a cover of "Blue" in 2008. Other Mitchell covers include the famous "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]" by both [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] and [[Matthews Southern Comfort]], "This Flight Tonight" by [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and well-known versions of "Woodstock" by [[Eva Cassidy]] and "A Case of You" by [[Tori Amos]], [[Michelle Branch]], [[Jane Monheit]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Diana Krall]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]], and [[Ana Moura]]. A 40th anniversary version of "Woodstock" was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of [[Matthews Southern Comfort]]). Fellow Canadian singer [[k.d. lang]] recorded two of Mitchell's songs ("A Case of You" and "Jericho") for her 2004 album ''[[Hymns of the 49th Parallel]]'' which is composed entirely of songs written by Canadian artists.

Prince's version of "A Case of U" appeared on ''[[A Tribute to Joni Mitchell]]'', a 2007 compilation released by [[Nonesuch Records]], which also featured [[Björk]] ("The Boho Dance"), [[Caetano Veloso]] ("Dreamland"), [[Emmylou Harris]] ("The Magdalene Laundries"), [[Sufjan Stevens]] ("Free Man in Paris") and [[Cassandra Wilson]] ("For the Roses"), among others.

Several other songs reference Joni Mitchell. The song "[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young song)|Our House]]" by [[Graham Nash]] refers to Nash's two-year affair with Mitchell at the time that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the [[Déjà Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young album)|Déjà Vu]] album. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Going to California]]" was said to be written about [[Robert Plant]] and [[Jimmy Page]]'s [[Limerence|infatuation]] with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says "Joni" after the line "To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The [[Sonic Youth]] song "[[Hey Joni]]" is named for Mitchell. [[Alanis Morissette]] also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, "Your House". British folk singer [[Frank Turner]] mentions Mitchell in his song "Sunshine State". The [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker" contains the lyric – " 'Oh, my favorite song' she said – and it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling' ". "[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]" by [[Marillion]] was partly influenced by "going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell", according to vocalist and lyricist [[Fish (singer)|Fish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1985_01|title=Marillion: Misplaced Childhood|work=Dutch Progressive Rock Page|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song "Montreal" from ''[[Sounds That Can't Be Made]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marillion.com/music/lyric.htm?id=822|title=Montreal|publisher=[[Marillion]]|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mayer]] makes reference to Mitchell and her ''Blue'' album in his song "[[Queen of California]]", from his 2012 album ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]''. The song contains the lyric  "Joni wrote ''Blue'' in a house by the sea".

In 2003, playwright [[Bryden MacDonald]] launched ''When All the Slaves Are Free'', a musical revue based on Mitchell's music.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;Gabrielle H. Cody and Evert Sprinchorn, ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama: M-Z, Volume 2'' (p. 843). [[Columbia University Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-231-14424-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell's music and poems have deeply influenced the French painter [[Jacques Benoit]]'s work. Between 1979 and 1989 Benoit produced sixty paintings, corresponding to a selection of fifty of Mitchell's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacquesbenoit.com/Joni_page_peintures%20-%20UK.html|title=Joni Mitchell|work=Jacques Benoit's website|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maynard James Keenan]] of the American [[progressive rock]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] has cited Mitchell as an influence, claiming that her influence is what allows him to "soften [staccato, rhythmic, insane mathematical paths] and bring [them] back to the center, so you can listen to it without having an eye-ache."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/joni-mitchell-15-great-artists-influenced-by-the-blue-singer-20160622/maynard-james-keenan-20160622|title=Maynard James Keenan {{!}} Joni Mitchell: 15 Great Artists Influenced by the 'Blue' Singer|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A Perfect Circle]], another band featuring Keenan as lead vocalist, recorded a rendition of Mitchell's "[[The Fiddle and the Drum]]" on their 2004 album ''[[Emotive (album)|eMOTIVe]]'', a collection of anti-war cover songs.

Mitchell has received nine Grammy Awards during her career (eight competitive, one honorary), the first in 1969 and the most recent in 2016. She received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2002, with the citation describing her as "one of the most important female recording artists of the rock era" and "a powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyatv.com/en-it/index.php/articles/artist_writer/18 |title=Sony/ATV Music Publishing: Joni Mitchell |publisher=Sonyatv.com |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Mitchell received Billboard's Century Award. In 1996, she was awarded the [[Polar Music Prize]]. In 1997, Mitchell was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], but did not attend the ceremony.

In tribute to Mitchell, the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT network]] presented an all-star celebration at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] in New York City on April 6, 2000. Mitchell's songs were sung by many performers, including James Taylor, [[Elton John]], [[Wynonna Judd]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Diana Krall]], and [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]. Mitchell herself ended the evening with a rendition of "Both Sides, Now" with a 70-piece orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/chronology/detail.cfm?id=1736|title=Joni Mitchell – A Chronology of Appearances|publisher=|accessdate=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version was featured on the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Love Actually]]''.

In 2008, Mitchell was ranked 42nd on [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s]] "100 greatest singers" list and in 2015 she was ranked ninth on their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231|title=100 greatest singers|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=November 27, 2008|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-songwriters|title=The 100 greatest songwriters of all time|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=August 2015|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate Mitchell's 70th birthday, the 2013 [[Luminato]] Festival in Toronto held a set of tribute concerts entitled ''Joni: A Portrait in Song – A Birthday Happening Live'' at [[Massey Hall]] on June 18 and 19. Performers included [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Esperanza Spalding]], and rare performances by Mitchell herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/06/19/toronto-massey-hall-joni-mitchell.html|title=Joni Mitchell plays rare performance at Luminato tribute|work=[[CBC News]]|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/concerts/Joni-A-Portrait-in-Song-presented-by-Luminato-Festival-2013-06-19 |title=Joni: A Portrait in Song presented by Luminato Festival |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=September 13, 2013 }}{{cbignore}}{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Mitchell was honoured by the city of Saskatoon, when two plaques were erected to commemorate her musical beginnings in Saskatoon. One was installed by the [[Broadway Theatre (Saskatoon)|Broadway Theatre]] beside the former Louis Riel Coffee House, where Mitchell played her first paid gig. A second plaque was installed at [[River Landing]], near the [[Remai Modern]] art gallery and [[Persephone Theatre]] performing arts centre.

'''Kermit K. Beahan''' (August 9, 1918 – March 9, 1989) was a career officer in the [[United States Air Force]] and its predecessor [[United States Army Air Forces]] during World War II. He was the [[bombardier (aircrew)|bombardier]] on the crew flying the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' on August 9, 1945 (his 27th birthday), that dropped the second [[atomic bomb]] on [[Nagasaki, Japan]].

He also participated in the first atomic mission that bombed [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945. Flying as part of the crew of ''[[The Great Artiste]]'' which was a reference to him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/03/10/Atomic-bombardier-dies/7021605509200/ Beahan obituary (March 10, 1989)]&lt;br&gt;Quote:&lt;br&gt;'We named our airplane for him,' [pilot] Sweeney said Thursday. 'We used to call him the Great Artiste. He was so good at his work. He was the sparkplug of our crew. We all loved him. We called him Honeybee because he was so likeable.'&lt;/ref&gt; purportedly because he could "hit a pickle barrel with a bomb from 30,000 feet" or he was "good with the fairer sex," his aircraft acted as the blast instrumentation support aircraft for the mission.

Beahan attended [[Rice University]] on a football scholarship during the 1930s. In 1939 he joined the Army Air Forces as an aviation cadet but washed out of pilot training, becoming a bombardier instead.  He was assigned to the [[97th Bombardment Group]] and took part in the first B-17 raids in Europe by [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]es. He flew 13 missions over Europe, 17 missions over North Africa, and five credited combat missions in the Pacific with the 509th Composite Group (including the Nagasaki sortie). He was shot down and crash-landed four times (twice in Europe and North Africa). He returned to the United States as a bombing instructor in Midland, Texas. In the summer of 1944, he was recruited by Colonel [[Paul W. Tibbets]] to be part of the [[509th Composite Group]], which was formed to deliver the atomic bomb.

The [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|mission to bomb Nagasaki]] was conducted on Beahan's 27th birthday. Admiral [[Frederick L. Ashworth]], who participated on the mission as weaponeer, credited Beahan with saving the mission from failure by finding an opening in the clouds by which to complete the required visual bombing of the city. An estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed outright by the bombing of Nagasaki.

Following the [[surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]], he returned to the United States as a crewman in the record-breaking [[1945 Japan–Washington flight]] under Lieutenant General [[Barney M. Giles]]. He remained in the Air Force until 1964, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. After his retirement, he worked as a technical writer for the engineering and construction firm Brown &amp; Root through 1985.

In 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing, Beahan said he would never apologize for the bombing, and that he had been thanked for his role by a group of 25 Japanese. He said the bombing was the "best way out of a hell of a mess."&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Beahan hoped that he would forever remain the last man to have dropped an atomic bomb on people.

He died of [[heart attack]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/11/obituaries/kermit-beahan-70-bombardier-on-plane-that-dropped-a-bomb.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the [[Houston National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|30493177}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, the former Teresa Lavery of [[Belfast]]. Lavery had a previous marriage, from 1944–46, to Civil War historian [[Shelby Foote]] after having met when Foote's artillery unit was deployed to Northern Ireland. Foote had spent six years in the US military and was tasked with making preparations for the invasion of Japan but in spite of his desires, never saw combat.  "...Foote was devastated that World War II was over", and it was Beahan, the future husband of his ex-wife who ended it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ejDkN3Q_j1wC&amp;pg=PA93 Shelby Foote: A Writer's Life, by C. Stuart Chapman (2003, p. 93)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kinder-KZ Litzmannstadt''''' ({{lang-de|Polen-Jugendverwahrlager der Sicherheitspolizei in Litzmannstadt}}, {{lang-pl|Prewencyjny Obóz Policji Bezpieczeństwa dla Młodzieży Polskiej w Łodzi}}) was a [[Nazi German]] concentration camp for Polish Christian children in occupied [[Łodź]] during World War&amp;nbsp;II, established in December 1942 adjacent to the ''[[Litzmannstadt Ghetto]]'' where [[Polish Jews]] were imprisoned before [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Podolska, Dorota Dekiert, ''Traces of the Litzmannstadt Getto. A guide to the past'', Piatek Trzynastego, 2004, {{ISBN|83-7415-001-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Separated from one another only by a high fence made of planks, the children's camp was located within the Ghetto section of the city bordering roughly today's streets of Bracka, Emilii Plater, Gornicza, and Zagajnikowa. The main gate of the camp was located  on Przemyslowa Street (''Gewerbestrasse'').&lt;ref name="Lodz-Ghetto.com"&gt;[http://www.lodz-ghetto.com/the_camp_for_polish_children.html,37 The camp for Polish children Przemystowa Street (Gewerbestrasse)] Lodz-Ghetto.com homepage.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinder KZ was run from 1941 to 1945. The prisoners were [[Kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany|Polish children of deported Poles from all Polish provinces]]. The Nazis kept an eye out for Polish children with [[Northern Europe|Nordic]] racial characteristics, those among them found to be classified as "racially valuable" were sent from here to the German Reich for adoption and [[Germanisation]] to be raised as Germans. About 3,000 (between 12,000 and 13,000 according to [[International Tracing Service]]) children were forced into passing through the camp .&lt;ref name="ITS"/&gt; The 1,600 child labourers performed work closely connected with the industrial output of the ghetto, with Jewish instructors.&lt;ref name="Lodz-Ghetto.com"/&gt; The youngest ones on record were merely two years old, while most of them were aged between 8 and 14.&lt;ref name="ITS"&gt;ITS, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111002213902/http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/historical_research/education/persecution/anniversaries/index.html?expand=3676&amp;cHash=4b28b91e5c Erecting the Lodz Ghetto February 1940] International Tracing Service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4762">'''Maria Rygier''' (born 1885 in [[Kraków]], died 1953 in [[Rome]]) was an Italian journalist and politician.

==Biography==
Rygier was a follower of [[Arturo Labriola]] and of the socialist avant-garde in Italy. In 1907 she became editor of the newspaper ''Lotta di classe'', a socialist revolutionary publication. With [[Filippo Corridoni]], she also founded the anti-militarist broadsheet ''Rompete le file''. She voiced the opinion that women should oppose [[militarism]], as they gave birth to the soldiers killed in war on behalf of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Stephen B.|title=The anarchist-individualist origins of Italian fascism|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2002|isbn= 9780820457178|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1909, she began to support [[anarchism]] in Italy. She became active in contributing to ''La Demolizione'' of the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Ottavio Dinale]] from 1907 to 1911.
 
A [[World War I]] interventionist in 1914, she became an editor at the newspaper founded by [[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]''. The socialist daily founded by Mussolini was devoted to supporting the campaign for intervention by Italy in the War. As a [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] and union supporter, she was jailed for a period in 1914. Her status as a political prisoner fighting for syndicalism became known to Italian-American syndicalists during the period. Anarchist [[Leda Rafanelli]] urged Italian workers to follow the example of Rygier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Topp|first=Michael Miller|title=Those Without a Country: The Political Culture of Italian American Syndicalists|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2001|isbn=9780816636495|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief nationalist period, she fled to France in 1926, by then in open opposition to [[Fascism]]. While in France, Rygier published a pamphlet highly critical of Mussolini. The 16-page pamphlet was originally written in French. The pamphlet was translated and published worldwide in 1928, revealing  how Rygier became disillusioned with Mussolini, accusing him of being an informer, engaging in blackmail, and of using tactics harmful to Italy's national interests yet beneficial to its future allies. She further accused Mussolini of political opportunism to further his personal interests, such as taking a lucrative newspaper job that required switching political orientation: {{blockquote|...I have already explained, in the French press, that being a fervent interventionist myself, I had been, to some extent, responsible for the "conversion" of Mussolini due to the advice I gave the French Ambassador at the Quirinal, M. Barrère, to start a daily socialist paper devoted to the interests of the Allies at Milan, an important industrial center and therefore proletariat. My suggestion was well received by France and carried out to the letter with the exception, however, of the selection of the future manager of the paper.
Not having then the least idea that Mussolini was for sale I had not suggested his name to M. Barrère. I had suggested the name of a well-known syndicalist already favorable to the cause of intervention. [...] when I learned that France had succeeded in hiring [...] the flag-bearer of neutrality, I conceived a real admiration for that French diplomacy which had realized that powerful trick of discovering Mussolini, or rather of discovering an impetuous interventionist under the mask of an "absolute neutral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Co Mason Official Bulletin of the American Federation of Human Rights 1928|publisher=American Federation of Human Rights, Larkspur, Colorado, 1928; reprinted by Kessinger Publishing|year=2003|isbn=9780766166820|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Little is known of Rygier's activities after the publication of her anti-Fascist pamphlet in France and the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Stephen B.|title=The anarchist-individualist origins of Italian fascism|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2002|isbn= 9780820457178|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Italy after the end of [[World War II]]. In 1946, she wrote a polemic book on the exiled anti-Fascists (''Rivelazioni sul fuoruscitismo italiano in Francia'', Rome, 1946). She eventually became a supporter of the monarchy of Italy. She died in Rome in 1953.

[[Canonization|Saint]] '''Michel Garicoïts''' (15 April 1797 &amp;ndash; 14 May 1863) was a [[French people|French]] [[Basques|Basque]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and the founder of the [[Society of Priests of the Sacred Heart of Betharram|Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Bétharram]].&lt;ref name=KN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.betharram.net/en/betharram-en/nos-sources-en/saint-michel-garicoits-134-en|title=St. Michael Garicoïts|publisher=Societas Sacratissimi Cordis Jesu|date=23 September 2008|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/saint-michael-garicoits/|title=Blessed Michael Garicoïts|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=7 June 2015|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He combated [[Jansenism]] in his parish due to the threat that it posed to the faith. He served as a teacher and preacher and was known for his ardent devotion to both the [[Eucharist]] and the [[Sacred Heart]].&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/53200|title=Saint Michael Garicoits|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sainthood cause commenced under [[Pope Leo XIII]] in mid-1899 while [[Pope Benedict XV]] later named him as [[Venerable]] on 10 December 1916 upon the confirmation of his [[heroic virtue]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] beatified him in 1923 while [[Pope Pius XII]] later canonized him as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church over a decade later in 1947.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clairval.com/lettres/en/2002/12/28/2010103.htm|title=Spiritual Newsletter|date=28 December 2002|publisher=Abbey of Saint-Joseph de Clairval|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Michel Garicoïts was born on 15 April 1797 in [[Saint-Just-Ibarre]] as the first of six children of the peasants Arnaud Garicoïts and Gratianne Etchéverry. His parents remained faithful and true to the spirit of the faith during the [[Persecution of Christianity during the French Revolution|persecutions of the French Revolution]] while also doing their best to shelter priests.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; His father helped priests flee persecution and helped them cross the border into Spain. One brother was born after him in 1799.

In 1801 he trespassed into his neighbour's home and hurled a stone at a woman who he believed had wronged his mother before fleeing the scene. In 1802 he stole a pack of needles from a travelling salesman – his mother reprimanded him for this – and in 1804 stole an apple from his brother to his mother's disdain. In 1806 he was sent to the village school but was taken out in 1809 to work as a servant on a farm for additional income.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

In his childhood he was noted for silent contemplation and for singing Psalms while guarding the cattle. In 1810 he was sent as a servant to another farm at Oneix and there made his [[First Communion]] on 9 June 1811 – it was this event that served as the trigger for his religious vocation.&lt;ref name=KN/&gt; He decided that he wanted to become a [[priest]] and so returned to his hometown and told his father: "I want to be a priest". His father said it would be impossible due to their poor financial condition (he said: "No! We are too poor") but his maternal grandmother Catherine Etchéverry knew a parish priest and convinced him to enroll him at school for studies before he became a [[seminarian]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; He attended school at [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]] where he studied Latin and French in the candlelight late into the night while paid his expenses through working for priests and in the local bishop's kitchen – the cook there had a disliking for him for unknown reasons. The parish priest Jean Baptiste Borda gave him private lessons.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Garicoïts commenced his studies for the priesthood in [[Aire-sur-Adour]] and later in [[Dax, Landes|Dax]]. He was asked to teach seminarians at [[Larressore]] despite still being a student himself. He received his [[ordination]] to the priesthood on 20 December 1823 at the [[Bayonne Cathedral]] from Archbishop – future cardinal – [[Paul-Thérèse-David d'Astros]].

He was appointed as the curate to the town of [[Cambo]] not too far from where he was ordained and he was there from the beginning of 1824 until late 1825 when he was sent to [[Bétharram]] to teach philosophical studies.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; In 1833 the diocesan bishop ceased education for seminarians in that place for unknown reasons and he was left to care for that Marian shrine and its pilgrims. It dawned on him to begin [[Society of Priests of the Sacred Heart of Betharram|his own religious congregation]] for all priests and professed brothers and dedicated it to the [[Sacred Heart]] as a means of evangelizing to people through missions. Before he founded it he attended a month retreat with the [[Jesuits]] in 1832 for guidance and his [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] Father Le Blanc helped to guide him along the right path.&lt;ref name=KN/&gt; Garicoïts helped [[Joan Elizabeth Bichier des Ages|Saint Jean Elizabeth Bichier des Ages]] found her religious order while later establishing his own in 1838.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

He died in the morning about 3:00am in mid-1863 due to an [[apoplexy]].&lt;ref name=KN/&gt; He had suffered from poor health since 1853 and in 1859 was quite ill but rallied from this until [[Lent]] in 1863 when his condition deteriorated to the point where he knew his death was near. His final words in a low murmur were: "Have pity on me, Lord, in Your great mercy".

===Name===
His [[Basque surname]] is the origin of the male name "Garikoitz".

==Sainthood==
The sainthood process commenced under [[Pope Leo XIII]] on 15 May 1899 and Garicoïts was titled as a [[Servant of God]]. [[Pope Benedict XV]] confirmed that the late priest had lived a model life of [[heroic virtue]] and named him as [[Venerable]] on 10 December 1916 as a result. Two miracles approved allowed for [[Pope Pius XI]] to preside over his beatification on 10 May 1923 while a decree resumed the cause on 23 July 1924.

Two additional miracles were investigated and received the validation of the [[Congregation for Rites]] on 17 July 1929. A preparatory committee approved them both on 13 April 1943 as did a general committee on 15 February 1944 and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 27 February 1944 who confirmed his sainthood. Pius XII proclaimed Garicoïts to be a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 6 July 1947.

'''Minas''' is a [[Philadelphia]]-based [[bossa nova]] jazz band - singer and guitarist '''Orlando Haddad''' and singer and pianist '''Patricia King'''.

Haddad is noted for bringing Brazilian music and culture to the city of Philadelphia, PA when he and his wife Patricia, after living in Brazil, moved back from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to the U.S. in 1984. Minas has performed in all of the area’s main venues and Orlando taught Brazilian Percussion at the University of the Arts, a post he held for 10 years. Minas also created an educational program, “Brazilian Adventure”, which brought assembly programs and residencies to public and independent schools in the tri-state area. This program has been seen by over 500,000 students.

Minas also created PhilaSamba, a [[samba school]] in Philadelphia, in 1987, with the help of the city's Latin American Musicians Association and musician Eugene Rausa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://jumpphilly.com/2011/06/05/the-brazilian-revolution-in-philly/|title = The Brazilian Revolution (in Philly).|last = |first = |date = June 5, 2011|work = Jump|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orlando Haddad''' (born Orlando Haddad Filho on April 19, 1953, in [[Lavras]], [[Minas Gerais]]) was the son of a physician and a piano teacher of Lebanese descent. He began playing piano at age six and as a child growing up in Brazil he studied classical piano and guitar. In his hometown of Lavras, Haddad was the leader of the pop-rock band Os Miseráveis (later renamed Electron 6). The group disbanded and with three other high school friends, he formed the group Zin performing mostly British/American as well as popular Brazilian music. Haddad later moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he studied at the [[Villa-Lôbos Institute]] and pursued private classical guitar studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.philly.com/1996-12-26/news/25639856_1_brazilian-music-music-teacher-latin-music|title = Husband-and-wife Team Draw Audiences To The Soft Sounds Of Samba|last = McGroarty|first = Cynthia J.|date = 26 December 1996|work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate = 22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the military dictatorship, music schools were not well funded in Brazil,{{Citation needed|date = November 2014}} so Haddad transferred to the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he received his bachelor's degree in composition in 1979. He later received a Masters of Science in Arts Administration from Drexel University in 1986, and in 2002 a Masters in Composition from Temple University, in Philadelphia.

'''Patricia King Haddad''' (born Patricia Gale King on April 27, 1956, in Denver, Colorado) grew up in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where she began her music education studying voice and piano, performed in musicals and theatrical productions at age six. In 1974 she enrolled at University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA) where she studied opera and continued piano studies and composition. She holds a master's degree in Jazz Piano Performance from Philadelphia's University of the Arts and a degree in classical voice from UNCSA. In addition to performing, composing and recording works with Minas, King wrote the story, music, and lyrics for her operetta ''La Giara'' (The Water Jug) a story about her families emigration from Sicily to Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lagiaramusic.com/about.html|title = La Giare |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1975, Haddad and King met while attending the [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts]] in [[Winston-Salem, NC]] and first began performing as the duo "Orlando &amp; Patricia" on campus as well as local bars and small concert halls.

In 1978, trip to Brazil, Haddad and King met Coquinho, Carlos Roberto Teixeira Alves, the drummer of Os Miseráveis, and Electron 6,  bands Orlando played in during his high school years. Alves moved to the US and joined King &amp; Haddad to form a trio which they named Minas, after Haddad and Alves’ home state of [[Minas Gerais]]. Soon the trio became a quartet with the addition of bassist Rick Heyman, who was from Paramus, NJ. Minas went on for a couple of years performing until Alves left the group and was replaced by Brazilian Manoel Monteiro, originally from São Paulo. The group worked extensively in the southern states of North and South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and up north in Pennsylvania, until both Rick and Manoel left the group for unknown reasons. Haddad and King continued performing under the name Minas as a duo from then til present time.

Haddad and King were married in October 1979 in Lexington, VA. The ceremony was officiated by a long time friend, Rev. Langston Randolf Harrison, a teacher and missionary at Lavras' Instituto Gammon. Now as husband and wife the couple continued performing in North Carolina until 1981. After the birth of their daughter Nicole, they decided to move to Brazil, where they lived near Haddad's family and continued to perform in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Pernambuco at clubs, festivals and universities. Joining a recent movement of independent recording artist and labels started by pianist, bandleader and composer Antonio Adolfo, they released their first vinyl “Num Dia Azul” in 1983, which was part of the first catalog of independent record producers in Rio de Janeiro.

After living in Brazil for some time, Haddad and King returned to the United States and settled in the city of Philadelphia where they now live with their two children, daughter Nicole Michele Haddad and son Jordan Alexander King Haddad.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Through their musical writings and arrangements as MINAS and its various projects, many jazz musicians in the U.S. and Brazil have collaborated with Haddad and King (MINAS) on recordings and/ or live performances to include: [[Paul Winter]], [[Herbie Mann]], [[Gerald Veasley]], [[Cyro Baptista]], Hendrik Meurkens, [[Rob Hyman]], [[Djalma Correa]], John Swana, Rogerio Boccato, David Finke, Adriano Santos, [[Adriano Giffoni]], João Cortez, Vanderlei Pereira, Cid Teixeira, Andrew Neu, Larry McKenna.

'''Mohammad Husni Thamrin''' (16 February 1894&amp;nbsp;– 11 January 1941) was an Indonesian political thinker and [[National Hero of Indonesia|National Hero]].

==Biography==
Thamrin was born in [[Sawah Besar|Weltevreden]], [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (modern day Jakarta), [[Dutch East Indies]], on 16 February 1894.{{sfn|Soedarmanto|2007|p=14}} His father, Thamrin Mohd. Tabri, was the son of an English businessman who owned hotel Ort in Batavia, but had been raised by his Javanese uncle and had adopted his name. Thamrin was therefore born into a neo-[[priyayi]] class and in 1906, his father became district head ({{lang|id|wedana}}) under Governor General [[Johan Cornelis van der Wijck]].&lt;ref&gt;B.O.B. Hering, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20072069?seq=1 M.H. Thamrin and his Quest for Indonesian Nationhood], 1917-1941, Stein (Limburg), 1996&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Koning Willem III Gymnasium,{{sfn|Soedarmanto|2007|p=14}} Thamrin took several government jobs before working for the shipping company [[Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij]].{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}}

In 1919, Thamrin was elected a member of the Jakarta City Council. He later became deputy mayor. In 1927 he was elected to the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]]; he soon formed the National Fraction ({{lang|id|Fraksi Nasional}}) to unite ten groups of [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian nationalists]] under one flag{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}} and counteract the reactionary Fatherlands Club ({{lang|nl|Vaderlandsche Club}}). Along with [[Soetomo|Dr. Soetomo]], Parindra's chair, Thamrin believed that independence could be achieved through cooperation with the Dutch colonial government.{{sfn|Elson|2008|p=60}}

As a Volksraad member, Thamrin and Kusumom Utoyo went to eastern [[Sumatra]] to look into working conditions at plantations there. Disgusted by what they found, upon his return Thamrin gave a speech condemning the plantation owners.{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}} He criticised the legalised gambling and corporal punishments given for minor offences.{{sfn|Soedarmanto|2007|p=13}} In 1935 he was a founding member of the Grand Indonesia Party ({{lang|id|Partai Indonesia Raya}}, or Parindra).{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}}

After the death of Dr. Soetomo in 1938, Thamrin became deputy chair of Parindra. In at a meeting of the Volksraad in 1939, Thamrin proposed that the Dutch terms Nederlands Indie, Nederlands Indisch and Inlander (Dutch Indies, Dutch Indian, and Dutch Indians) be replaced with the nationalist terms Indonesia, Indonesisch, and Indonesier (Indonesia, Indonesian, and Indonesians). Although this received majority support in the Volksraad, the Dutch government vetoed the motion. After his request, the colonial government kept him under surveillance.{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}} By 1940, his proposal for the use of the term Indonesian had begun to receive consideration, much to Thamrin's perplexity.{{sfn|Elson|2008|p=92}}

In May 1939, Thamrin spearheaded an effort to unite eight nationalist organisations, including Parindra, in the [[Indonesian Political Federation]] ({{lang|id|Gaboengan Politiek Indonesia}}, or GAPI). The group had four main goals: Indonesian self-determination, national unity, a democratically elected party answering to the Indonesian people, and solidarity  between Indonesians and the Dutch to combat fascism.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|pp=96–97}}

On 6 January 1941, Thamrin was put under [[house arrest]] under suspicion of aiding the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|advancing Japanese forces]];{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}} he had previously maintained warm relations with Japanese residents of the Indies.{{sfn|Elson|2008|p=63}} Already ill, he died five days after his arrest.{{sfn|JCG, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin}} He was buried in [[Karet Bivak Cemetery]], [[Central Jakarta]].{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, Even after you}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">'''Nazir''' ({{lang-he|נזיר}}) is a treatise of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Tosefta]] and in both [[Talmuds]], devoted chiefly to a discussion of the laws of the [[Nazirite]] laid down in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 6:1-21. In the Tosefta its title is ''Nezirut'' ("Nazariteness"). In most of the editions of the Mishnah this treatise is the fourth in the order [[Nashim]], and it is divided into 9 chapters, containing 48 paragraphs in all.

==Summary of the Mishnayot==
===The different kinds of vows===

'''Chapter 1''': The different kinds of vows which involve compulsory Nazariteship (§§ 1-2); Nazariteship for life, [[Samson]]'s Nazariteship (compare [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 12:4 et seq.), and the difference between these two kinds (§ 2); Nazariteship is calculated by days only, not by hours, and generally lasts thirty days if no definite period is given (§ 3); different expressions which make a sort of lifelong Nazariteship compulsory, although the hair may be cut once in thirty days (§ 4); peculiar indefinite expressions used in connection with the vow (§§ 5-7).

'''Chapter 2''': Whether vows which are expressed in a peculiar, incorrect manner are binding (§§ 1-2); cases in which a clearly expressed vow of Nazariteship is not binding (§ 3); vows made under conditions incompatible with Nazariteship (§ 4); combination of two Nazariteships, or of one with the vow to bring an additional [[Korban|sacrifice]] for a Nazarite; conditional vows (§§ 5-9).

'''Chapter 3''': When a Nazarite may cut his hair in case he has vowed only one term of Nazariteship, or when he has vowed two successive terms (§§ 1-2); whether a Nazarite who has become unclean on the last day of his term must recommence his Nazariteship, and the cases in which he must do so (§§ 3-4); the case of one who vows Nazariteship while in a burial-place (§ 5); Nazariteship may be observed only in the Holy Land; Helena, Queen of [[Adiabene]], once vowed Nazariteship for seven years, and fulfilled her vow; but when she went to the [[land of Israel]] at the end of the seventh year, the Bet [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] decided that she must observe her vow for another period of seven years, since the time which she had spent outside of the [[land of Israel]] could not be taken into account (§ 6).

===Wards and minors===
'''Chapter 4''': Cases in which a person utters a vow of Nazariteship and those present say, "We too"; dispensation from such vows; concerning the nullification of a wife's vows of Nazariteship by her husband (§§ 1-5); the father may make a vow of Nazariteship for his minor son, but not the mother; and in like manner the son, but not the daughter, may, in certain cases and in certain respects, succeed to the father's term of Nazariteship (§§ 6-7).

'''Chapter 5''': Cases in which a person dedicates or vows something by [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]]; Nazarites who had made their vows before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Temple]], and, on coming to [[Religious significance of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] to offer their sacrifices, had learned that the Temple had been destroyed (§ 4); conditional Nazaritic vows (§§ 5-7).

===Sacrifices of Nazarites===
'''Chapter 6''': Things forbidden to the Nazarite; enumeration of the different things coming from the vine; cases in which a Nazarite is guilty of trespassing against the interdiction prohibiting the drinking of [[wine]] (§§ 1-2); cases in which he is guilty of trespassing against that concerning the cutting of his hair (§ 3); in what respects the interdiction against defilement by a corpse is more rigorous than those against drinking wine and cutting the hair, and in what respects the last two interdictions are more rigorous than the first (§ 5); sacrifices and cutting of the hair if the Nazarite has become unclean (§ 6); sacrifices and cutting of the hair when the Nazariteship is fulfilled; burning of the cut hair under the pot in which the flesh of the sacrifice is cooked; other regulations regarding the sacrifices by Nazarites (§§ 7-11).

'''Chapter 7''': The Nazarite and the [[Kohen Gadol]] may not defile themselves through contact with corpses even in the case of the death of a near relative; discussion of the question whether the Nazarite or the high priest defiles himself if both together find a corpse which must be buried and no one else is there to do it (§ 1); things which defile the Nazarite, and other regulations regarding the uncleanness of a person entering the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] (§§ 2-3).

'''Chapter 8''': Regulations in cases where it is doubtful whether the Nazarite has become unclean.

'''Chapter 9''': Unlike [[slave]]s and [[Role of women in Judaism|women]], "Kutim" may not make a Nazaritic vow; in what respects Nazaritic vows of women are more rigorous than those of slaves, and vice versa (§ 1); further details regarding the defilement of a Nazarite; the examination of burial-places, and, in connection therewith, rules for the examination of a person suffering from discharges or [[tzaraath]] (§§ 2-4); discussion of the question whether [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was a Nazarite (§ 5).

==Tosefta==
The Tosefta to this treatise is divided into six chapters. Noteworthy is the story it narrates of the high priest [[Simon the Just]], who never partook of the sacrifice offered by a Nazarite, with the exception of that offered by a handsome youth from the south, since in this case he could assume that the young man had made his vow with the best intentions and acceptably to God. When Simon asked why he had decided to clip his hair, the youth replied that on beholding his image in a pool he had become vain of his own beauty, and had therefore taken the Nazaritic vow to avoid all temptations (4:7).

The Babylonian Gemara, whose introductory passage explains, by a reference to the Bible ([[Deuteronomy]] 24:1; comp. [[Rashi]] ad loc., and ''Sotah'' 2a), why the treatise Nazir belongs to the order Nashim, contains also many interesting sentences, a few of which may be quoted here: "The forty years ([[Books of Samuel|Samuel II]] 15:7) are reckoned from the time when the Israelites first asked for a king" (5a). "The Nazarite has sinned (Numbers 6:11) by denying himself wine; and if one who denies himself wine, which is not absolutely necessary, is deemed a sinner, one who denies himself other things which are needful for the sustenance of life is a much greater sinner" (19a). "An infringement of the Law with good intentions is better than its fulfilment without good intentions. Still one must study the Torah and observe its commandments, even though he is not in the proper mood, since he will gradually acquire thereby a sympathetic frame of mind" (23b).

'''Nicolasa Dayrit–Panlilio''' (10 September 1874 – 12 April 1945) was a Filipino [[non-combatant]] in the [[Philippine-American War]]. Her actions not only included helping to minister the sick and wounded Filipino combatants, but also played a major role in appeasing General [[Antonio Luna]] during his confrontation with General [[Tomas Mascardo]]. This contributed to the collapse of the [[Bagbag River|Bagbag]]-[[Plaridel, Bulacan|Quingua]]-Sta. Maria defense line based on the [[Pampanga River]], which was held against the [[United States|American]] forces. 

Governor [[Tiburcio Hilario]], at the same time sent three emissaries to convince General Mascardo to submit himself to Luna's authority as Chief of Staff. At first Mascardo was nowhere to be found but later, he appeared in [[Betis, Philippines|Betis]] to inform General Luna that he was willing to follow the latter's orders. That afternoon Luna returned to his headquarters, only to learn that his troops had been defeated in the [[Battle of Quingua]].&lt;ref name=WPR&gt;Hilario-Soriano, Rafaelita ''Women of the Philippine Revolution''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nicolasa Dayrit was born to Don Florentino Dayrit, a Cabeza de Barangay and Doña Antonina Pamintuan, in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], on September 10, 1874. She was one of the well-educated women of her time, having studied under Don Modesto Joaquin in [[Bacolor]]. Fluent in Spanish, she was also one of the two more accomplished pianists in the province, the other being Doña Josefa Henson.

==Activities in the Philippine-American War==
When [[Military of the United States|American forces]] started bombarding this area, General Luna requested reinforcements from General Tomas Mascardo in [[Guagua, Pampanga]] but the latter carried out the order slowly and in protest. As a result, Luna ordered Mascardo arrest. The latter reacted sharply, arguing to Luna's emissary that while President [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]]'s decree applied to all troops of the provinces of Pampanga and [[Nueva Ecija]], which were under Luna's jurisdiction, the decree did not apply to general officers of these troops. Mascardo concluded his response with the words, "If General Luna has enough guts to enforce his decree, Mascardo has enough to resist him." 

Incensed, General Luna wired Governor Tiburcio Hilario to prepare for his arrival. He also ordered a special train into which all available infantry, cavalry, and artillery forces were loaded. To Luna, Mascardo's non-cooperation was a sign of weakness. 

At this moment, the women of the province proved their high sense of [[patriotism]] while the men exerted every effort to bind and unite their [[armed forces]]. To the revolutionary leaders, the welfare of the Republic was greater than that of any man. Governor Tiburcio Hilario met General Luna first and pleaded with him to restore peace and unity at a crucial moment. He requested a delegation of women led by Nicolasa Dayrit and Pampanga's [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] President Praxedes Fajardo, to bring flowers and kneel before General Luna. The women met him on the steps of the convent in Bacolor on April 24, 1899, and successfully dissuaded Luna from violently confronting Mascardo.

==Later life==
At the end of the war, perhaps due to the rigors of ministering the sick and the wounded, Nicolasa found herself often ill, unable to leave her bed. Many doctors treated her, to no avail. Someone advised her family to consult a young doctor who had just arrived from [[Madrid]], Dr. Vicente Panlilio. She married Dr. Panlilio, and he built for his bride a two storey house at San Jose Street, near Doña Antonina's house in the center of town. It was an elegant semi-concrete house with a concrete porch and a verandah through which one entered the living room.  

The Panlilio's had five children: Luis, the eldest was a Harvard law graduate who became a good corporation lawyer and an industrialist, married Remedios Lazatin, the second was Carlos who seemed to be the tallest young man in town while Teresita who looked much like her mother, married Justice Augusto Luciano of Magalang; Pablo, an American, French educated architect, became successful in his field aside from being an industrialist, married socialite pianist Dolores Arguelles while the youngest is Lourdes. 

During the Japanese occupation, like most prominent families in San Fernando, the Panlilios lost their house to the Japanese. General [[Masaharu Homma]] occupied it. When Manila was declared an open city, the Panlilios moved in, hoping that they would be more secure there. But in the [[Battle of Malate]], Dr. Panlilio was lost, never to be seen again. Doña Nicolasa became despondent and died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on April 12, 1945, possibly due to her depression.&lt;ref name=WPR/&gt;

On September 9, 2004, her remains were transferred from Loyola Memorial Park in [[Sucat, Paranaque]] to the [[Regional Corporations and Municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago|City of San Fernando]], Pampanga with full honors and an overnight vigil with members of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine Marines]] serving as honor guards. On September 10, 2006, the [[National Historical Institute]] placed a marker in her monument, recognizing her contributions to the fight for Philippine Independence.

'''Nikolaos Zervas''' ({{lang-el|Νικόλαος Ζέρβας}}, 1800–1869) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] revolutionary and [[Hellenic Army|Army]] general.

Zervas was born in [[Souli]], [[Epirus]], then [[Ottoman Empire]], and became one of the leaders of the [[Souliotes]]. Zervas participated in the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1830) and distinguished at the [[Battle of Analatos]] (April 1827).&lt;ref name=Ekdotike&gt;{{cite book | title=Παγκόσμιο Βιογραφικό Λεξικό ("Universal Biographical Lexicon") | publisher=Ekdotiki Athninon | location=Athens | volume =III |year=1990 |pages=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; At March 1828, together with another revolutionary leader, Dimos Tselios, managed to push back an advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (Turkish-Albanian) force at [[Acharnes|Menidi]], [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Dakin]].

After Independence, Zervas participated in an anti-royalist revolt in [[Acarnania]] (1836).&lt;ref name=Ekdotike/&gt; At 1854, already a major general in the Hellenic Army, he resigned his post and joined general [[Theodoros Grivas]] in the [[Epirus revolt of 1854]]. The revolt aimed at the union of Epirus with the [[Kingdom of Greece]], but failed.&lt;ref&gt;M. V. Sakellariou.

Zervas".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Van Camp''' (born 8 September 1971)&lt;ref name="WhoWho"&gt;{{cite book|title=Canadian Who's Who Search|publisher=Grey House Publishing Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Tłı̨chǫ]] writer from [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]], [[Northwest Territories]].&lt;ref name="qq"&gt;[http://www.quillandquire.com/blog/index.php/authors/about-a-boy-richard-van-camp-and-the-lesser-blessed/ "About a boy: Richard Van Camp and The Lesser Blessed"]. ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'', November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his 1996 novel ''[[The Lesser Blessed (novel)|The Lesser Blessed]]'', which was adapted into a film by director [[Anita Doron]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="qq" /&gt;

Van Camp attended the [[En’owkin International School of Writing]], the [[University of Victoria]]’s Creative Writing BFA Program, and the Master’s Degree in Creative Writing at the [[University of British Columbia]]. He teaches creative writing with an aboriginal focus at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]] and teaches creative writing and storytelling at the [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design|Emily Carr Institute]]. Van Camp works with [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam First Nations]] youth with the Musqueaum Youth Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canlit.ca/an-interview-with-richard-van-camp-december-2008/|title=A Quarterly of Criticism and Review|website=Canadian Literature|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Van Camp began his career as an intern on the writing staff of the television series ''[[North of 60]]'', produced by the [[CBC Television|CBC]]. He was also a CBC script and cultural consultant for four seasons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.albertanativenews.com/edmonton-metro-libraries-welcome-2017-writer-in-residence-richard-van-camp/|title=Edmonton Metro Libraries welcome 2017 writer in residence Richard Van Camp|date=2016-12-08|work=Alberta Native News|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published several short story collections. Most of his work is set in the community of Fort Simmer, a fictionalization of his hometown.&lt;ref name="qq" /&gt; He has also published children's books, poetry and educational [[graphic novels]].&lt;ref&gt;"Comic tackles sexual health". ''[[Yellowknifer]]'', April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with the Healthy Aboriginal Network to create and edit graphic novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canlit.ca/interviews/6|title=An interview with Richard Van Camp|last=Wilson|first=Jordan|date=December 2008|website=Canadian Literature A Quarterly of Criticism and Review|publisher=Canadian Literature|accessdate=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Camp's writing has been influenced by the tradition of oral storytelling. He has stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I need oral storytelling in my life as a listener because I’m always filtering the pauses, the slang, the rockabilly of pacing, the delivery. When I listen to a master storyteller or someone just sharing a story, I’m studying how they’re talking and how they’re standing, and what the pitch is in their voice. I can sometimes take their techniques and put them into a story."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/an-interview-with-richard-van-camp|title=An Interview with Richard Van Camp|website=briarpatchmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In June 2014, Van Camp was announced as a juror for the prestigious NSK Neustadt Prize for Children's Literature. His finalist nominee was ''Little You'' artist [[Julie Flett]].

Van Camp was the 2017 Edmonton Metro Libraries writer in residence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of Van Camp's short stories, "Dogrib Midnight Runners", was re-imagined as a film directed by [[Zoe Leigh Hopkins]] called ''Mohawk Midnight Runners''. The film was released in 2013 through [[Big Soul Productions]]. The story appears in Van Camp's short story collection ''The Moon Letting Go'' (2013).

In 2018, his novella ''When We Play Our Drums, They Sing'' was published alongside [[Monique Gray Smith]]'s ''Lucy &amp; Lola'' in the compilation ''The Journey Forward''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/books/cherie-dimaline-s-the-marrow-thieves-among-finalist-for-10k-code-burt-award-for-indigenous-ya-literature-1.4831263 "Cherie Dimaline's The Marrow Thieves among finalists for $10K CODE Burt Award for Indigenous YA literature"]. [[CBC Books]], September 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was named as a shortisted finalist for the [[Burt Award for First Nations, Métis and Inuit Literature]].

'''Pieter Robert ("Rob") Rensenbrink''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpitər ˈroːbərt (ˈrɔp) ˈrɛnsə(m)ˌbrɪŋk}}; born 3 July 1947) is a former Dutch [[Association football|footballer]] and member of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national football team]] that reached two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in 1974 and 1978. A creative left [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]] or [[Forward (association football)|forward]] of considerable talent, he became a legend in Belgium whilst playing in the great [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] side of the 1970s. He is the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]]'s all-time top scorer, with 25 goals. A talented dribbler as well as a cool finisher and adequate passer, he only ever missed two penalties in his entire career. He was also the first winner of the [[Onze d'Or]].

==Playing career==

===Club career===
Born in [[Amsterdam]], Rensenbrink started his career at [[AFC DWS|DWS]], an Amsterdam amateur club, before moving to Belgian side [[Club Brugge]] in 1969. Between 1971 and 1980 he played for [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] where he enjoyed his greatest club successes. In total when in Belgium he twice won the Belgian Championships, the Belgian Cup five times and at European club level the European [[Cup Winners' Cup]] twice (in 1976 and 1978 as well as being runner-up in 1977). Rensenbrink delivered a notable performance in the [[1976 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1976 final]] as Anderlecht ran out 4-2 winners against [[West Ham United]]. He scored two goals, one from the penalty spot and set up [[Francois Van der Elst]] for the fourth goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anderlecht vs West Ham, 1978 Cup Winner's Cup Final|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOoZO89zctA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his team mates was Dutch internationalist compatriot, [[Arie Haan]]. In 1980, he left Anderlecht and wound down his career with a spell at [[Portland Timbers (NASL)|Portland Timbers]] in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL]], followed by a brief stay with [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] in France in 1981.

===International career===
Rensenbrink made his international debut for the [[Netherlands national football team]] against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 1968, but picked up relatively few caps due to competition for the forward positions with [[Johan Cruijff]] and [[Piet Keizer]]. However, [[Rinus Michels]] included him for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] squad that made the short trip to West Germany.

The Dutch side that took part in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] were the pinnacle of [[Total Football]]. Most of the 1974 team were made up of players from [[AFC Ajax]] and [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]], so Rensenbrink was an outsider and was unfamiliar with playing the system.  His preferred position was up front on the left, but that position was already [[Johan Cruijff]]'s domain, so he played on the left-wing position in midfield, taking over from Ajax player [[Piet Keizer]]. He missed one game in the tournament (when Keizer played instead) and was only half-fit for the final after picking up an injury during the semi-final against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Rinus Michels gambled on Rensenbrink's fitness and played him from start – however he only lasted until half-time and was replaced by [[René van de Kerkhof]]. The Netherlands took an early lead through a [[Johan Neeskens]] penalty, but goals from [[Paul Breitner]] and [[Gerd Müller]] gave West Germany a 2–1 victory. Rensenbrink's performances saw him named to the team of the tournament and he was sought by Ajax as a replacement for Keizer. However, contract negotiations fell through and he remained at Anderlecht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Player Profile on Robbie Rensenbrink|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwL4ev1QI1K6T25SWEpreFFtcDQ/edit?pli=1|website=World Soccer, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rensenbrink stayed in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] national side during the qualifiers and finals of the [[1976 European Football Championship]]. However, the Netherlands fell at the semi-final stage to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]].

In the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] tournament in [[Argentina]], the Netherlands again reached the final, but this time without Cruijff (who decided to retire from international football) and under the guidance of [[Ernst Happel]] rather than Michels. Out of the shadow of Cruijff, Rensenbrink found more room to showcase his own considerable talent, playing on the left-hand side of a front three alongside [[Johnny Rep]] and [[René van de Kerkhof]]. He scored a [[hat-trick]] in the opening game against [[Iran national football team|Iran]], another against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] which was goal number 1000 in [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] history and a penalty in the 5–1 win over [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. In the final against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], the Netherlands yet again met the hosts. In a tumultuous match, the Netherlands fell behind to a first-half [[Mario Kempes]] strike. After [[Dick Nanninga]]'s equalizer 9 minutes from time, a long pass from the Dutch captain [[Ruud Krol]] in the last 30 seconds of normal time gave Rensenbrink a half-chance to score but his shot from a very narrow angle was deflected on to the post and bounced clear. Had he scored, it is almost certain that Holland would have won the World Cup with Rensenbrink being top goal scorer. Argentina scored twice in extra-time for a 3–1 victory and the Netherlands again had to settle for the runners-up spot.&lt;ref name=Caple&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theversed.com/71224/rob-rensenbrink-a-post-away-from-being-a-legend/#.7uT8eY6ZUS |title=Rob Rensenbrink: A Post Away From Being A Legend |last=Caple |first=Alex |date=29 September 2017 |access-date=9 July 2018 |work=The Versed |publisher=Clickon Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rensenbrink played some of the qualifiers for [[1980 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 80]], but after earning his 46th cap in 1979 (a 2–0 defeat by Poland in a qualifier for [[1980 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 80]]), he retired from international football at the age of 32, having scored 14 times for his country. He along with [[Eusébio]] are the only players to score the most goals from a penalty spot in a tournament (4 in 1978).

He was named by [[Pelé]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004. He was also named [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht's]]  greatest ever player in 2008.

Savage was born on 31 January 1967&lt;ref name=surprise&gt;{{Cite news | title=Robbie's birthday surprise | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=2 February 2007 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=32168&amp;page=archive-read}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Windhoek]]'s [[Khomasdal]] suburb. He had [[Down syndrome]] and was the widest-known Namibian that lived with the disease.&lt;ref name=Hamata/&gt; Already in his youth he developed a passion for football and attended countless major and minor events. Later he supported other sports codes as well, notably boxing and athletics, and he was a noticeable member of the audience in uncountable high-profile Namibian social events. This was to an extent that on several occasions his unlikely absence would be noticed, for instance at a concert of [[The Rockets (South African band)|The Rockets]] in Windhoek that was opened with the question "Where is Robbie?"&lt;ref name=Kambaekwa/&gt;

Although a poor man throughout his life,&lt;ref name=Olivier&gt;{{Cite news | title=No One Like Robbie | last=Olivier | first=Francois | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | edition=''The Weekender'' Friday supplement | page=12 | series=The Gentleman's corner | date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage's role as mascot of the [[Brave Warriors]] enabled him to tour the African continent for several sports events. [[President of Namibia|Namibian President]] (then [[Prime Minister of Namibia|Prime Minister]]) [[Hage Geingob]], himself an ardent football fan, took him to the [[1998 African Cup of Nations]] in [[Burkina Faso]].

He was Tobacco Control's commissioning editor for Low and Middle Income Countries from 2008–2010 and is now editor emeritus.

Chapman studied health complaints regarding [[wind farm]]s in Australia in 2012 and concluded the complaints were likely to be the result of [[nocebo]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Simon|last2=St. George|first2=Alexis|last3=Waller|first3=Karen|last4=Cakic|first4=Vince|title=The Pattern of Complaints about Australian Wind Farms Does Not Match the Establishment and Distribution of Turbines: Support for the Psychogenic, 'Communicated Disease' Hypothesis|journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=8|issue=10|year=2013|issn=1932-6203  |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0076584|pages=e76584|pmid=24146893|pmc=3797792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/wind-turbine-sickness-all-in-the-mind-study-20130315-2g4zd.html |title=Wind turbine sickness 'all in the mind': study |author=Lenore Taylor |date=15 March 2013 |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Syrym Datuly Batyr''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]. Сырым Датұлы) (1712—1802) was the Sergeant Major of the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] clan [[Bayuly]], the leader of the national anti-feudal and anti-colonial movements of the Kazakhs of the Little Horde in the years 1783-1797. Syrym Datuly took part in the [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] of 1773-75. Preserved report to Count Alexander Suvorov P.I. Panin on June 22, 1775, in which he reports S. Datuly as one of the most active participants in the uprising. In any case, the excitement of the [[Kazakhs]] were a direct continuation of the events.

Syrym Datuly was from the Baibakty clan, Bayuli tribe of the [[Jüz#Junior Jüz|Younger Zhuz]]. He was Nuraly-khan’s trusted person until the beginning of the revolt. Winter of 1782-83 wassevere in the territory the Younger zhuz. Finally Kazakhs started to cross the [[Ural Mountains]]. [[Ural Cossacks]] started to attack on Kazakhs.

As a result of encounters with Ural Cossacks, Syrym Datuly’s children died. In response Kazakhs attacked on Russian settlements. In one of the affairs Syrym Datuly was taken as a prisoner. [[Iosif Igelström|O. Igelstrom]] was assigned as a new governor of the region and establishment of the Frontier court was announced in order to regulate conflicts between Kazakhs and Cossacks.

There are attempts to implement reforms in the system of Kazakh clans in the Younger zhuz which would make it possible to Tsarist administration to establish the order. One of these attempts was convocation of peculiar steppe parliament — people’s assembly in 1785. At this [[kurultai]] three tribal departments (Zhetiru, Alimuly and Baiuly) were founded, also Syrym Datuly was elected as the first adviser of the entire Younger Zhuz. 

After the kurultai Nuraly apprehended for his life and escaped to Russians in 1786. In 1786 Syrym was taken as a prisoner by Nuraly’s son Yesim and was taken to Yeraly, Nuraly’s brother. In 1787 Syrym was released thanks to O. Igelstrom’s activity. O. Igelstrom was resigned in 1790 and in 1791 Yeraly was proclaimed as the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. In response, Syrym Datuly declared the war against Russia and killed its placeman Yesim who became the Khan after Yeraly. Many raids at the frontier line were made during ten years. In 1797 Syrym Datuly, who was pursued by sultans, had to roam to the south, lands of [[Khanate of Khiva]] with fellow tribesmen. He died in 1802.

'''The Deaf Man''' is a character in the [[87th Precinct]] series of police procedurals by author [[Ed McBain]] (pseudonym of [[Evan Hunter]]).  A criminal mastermind who delights in creating complex schemes, The Deaf Man is usually pitted against the men of the [[87th Precinct]] as he creates havoc in the fictional city of Isola.

==Background==
The Deaf Man is a tall, blond man whose real name is never revealed.  He is a meticulous criminal planner who appears in a number of the 87th Precinct novels, usually plotting some spectacular crime while sending obscure, cryptic clues to the 87th Precinct, as if daring the detectives there to thwart him. In most of the stories, these clues are intended to mislead the police, directing them away from The Deaf Man's real goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Stasio|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/books/crime-609951.html|title=Crime|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 22, 2004|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deaf Man is not actually [[deaf]]; this is just another layer of disguise and misdirection. He wears a [[hearing aid]], and uses odd [[pseudonym]]s referring to deafness. Examples include "L. Sordo" ("el sordo" means "the deaf man" in Spanish), "Mort Orecchio" (roughly "dead ear" in Italian), "Den Dove" ("den döve" means "The deaf" in Swedish) and D. R. Taubmann ("der taub Mann" meaning "the deaf man" in German). When he calls the detectives of the 87th, he'll commonly start the conversation with some version of "You'll have to speak up. I'm a little hard of hearing".

His main "nemesis" at the 87th Precinct (at least the one he contacts the most) seems to be Det. Steve Carella, who always feels a sense of irony in his dealing with The Deaf Man, since Carella is himself married to a deaf person. Both Carella and The Deaf Man have bullet wounds inflicted by the other, Carella from a shotgun in ''The Heckler'' and The Deaf Man from Carella's service revolver in ''Fuzz''. The Deaf Man even had Carella mugged and his badge/police ID stolen in ''Let's Hear It For The Deaf Man!'', which he has since used to impersonate Carella.  The Deaf Man has no compunction about injuring or killing police officers or citizens during the commission of his crimes, but always has the motive of financial profit as his underlying goal.  In later novels, he also has a secondary goal of getting revenge against Carella and the 87th for (often inadvertently) thwarting some of his most ambitious criminal plans.

The Deaf Man was last seen in ''Hark!'' (2004). The ending of the novel has the Deaf Man still free, and presumably able to plot more mischief for the 87th Precinct at some later time. 

The Deaf Man appears in the following 87th Precinct novels:

*''The Heckler'' (1960)
*''Fuzz'' (1968)
*''Let's Hear it for the Deaf Man!'' (1973)
*''Eight Black Horses'' (1985)
*''Mischief'' (1993)
*''Hark!'' (2004)

In other 87th Precinct novels where The Deaf Man does not appear, characters on occasion make reference to him and his crimes.

==Film adaptations==
In [[Fuzz (film)|the movie version of ''Fuzz'']], he was played by [[Yul Brynner]].

He was also a renowned statesman, writer, and politician.&lt;ref name=Relf&gt;{{cite news|title=En "estado delicado" Tomás Borge, fundador del FSLN y embajador en Perú|url=http://www.centinelaeconomico.com/2012/04/10/en-estado-delicado-tomas-borge-fundador-del-fsln-y-embajador-en-peru/|publisher=Centinela Económico|date=10 April 2012|access-date=2 February 2014|author=Editor|page=http://www.centinelaeconomico.com/|language=spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221072801/http://www.centinelaeconomico.com/2012/04/10/en-estado-delicado-tomas-borge-fundador-del-fsln-y-embajador-en-peru/|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomás Borge also held the titles of "Vice-Secretary and President of the FSLN", member of the Nicaraguan Parliament and National Congress, and Ambassador to Peru. Considered a hardliner, he led the "prolonged [[people's war]]" tendency within the FSLN until his death.

In 2010, he stated in an interview: "I am proud to be a Sandinista, to continue being faithful to the red and black flag of our party, to continue being faithful to our revolutionary organization; and to die proud of raising the front, and not having been disloyal to my principles, nor disloyal with my friends nor my companions, nor with my flag, nor with my cries of war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.el19digital.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=23:nacionales&amp;id=14713:tomas-borge-80-anos-no-es-nada&amp;Itemid=12 Tomás Borge: 80 años no es nada.25 July,2010|El 19 Digital]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Borge was born in [[Matagalpa]] on August 13, 1930. His father, Tomás Borge Delgado, was one of [[Augusto César Sandino]]'s deputy commanders during the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua]], from 1926 to 1932. From a young age, Borge integrated himself in the fight against the [[Somoza family]] dictatorship, which had ruled Nicaragua since the assassination of Sandino. In 1943, he began participating in revolutionary activities, and in 1946, he was editing the newspaper "Espartako" against the regime of General [[Anastasio Somoza García]].

==Meeting Fonseca==
After his secondary education, Borge enrolled into the Law Faculty of the [[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua-León]] in 1956. The following year, he met [[Carlos Fonseca]] with whom Borge would forge a strong friendship. Borge was six years older than Fonseca, which influenced Borge strongly. With Fonseca, Borge read the first few books that would forge their political philosophies: "Utopia" by [[Thomas More]], some works by [[John Steinbeck]], works by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as some works by [[Lenin]].

Along with Fonseca, Borge participated in a group of Marxist Nicaraguan students, who formed the [[Nicaraguan Socialist Party]] (PSN), which was based on Marxist thought and pro-Soviet leanings.&lt;ref name=lajornada&gt;[http://www.lajornadanet.com/diario/archivo/2012/mayo/1/2.php «Tomás Borge Martínez formaba parte de la dirección nacional histórica del FSLN»], article from May 1, 2012 in the daily journal ''La Jornada'' (Nicaragua).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was put under house arrest from 1956 to 1959 during the government crackdown following the assassination of Somoza by poet [[Rigoberto López Pérez]]. In 1959, he escaped to [[Honduras]], where he was captured by the Honduran border patrol.

Otto Castro, a friend of both Borge and the president of Honduras at the time, arranged for Borge's release. Borge then travelled using a false passport to [[El Salvador]] and [[Costa Rica]],&lt;ref&gt;Borge, Tomas: ''The Patient Impatience'', pp. 91–106. Curbstone Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; where he would found the ''Juventud Revolucionaria Nicaragüense'' (Nicaraguan Youth Revolutionaries).&lt;ref&gt;Coordinadora Simón Bolívar (2014): [http://www.aporrea.org/internacionales/a187332.html «Tomás Borge Martínez, también es "de los muertos que nunca mueren"»], article from April 30, 2014 from Aporrea.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation of Sandinista National Liberation Front==
After the victorious [[Cuban Revolution]], Fonseca, Borge, and a few companions decided to use militant tactics to fight against the Somoza regime. They participated in the formation of a militia under the command of [[Rigoberto López Pérez]] to face off against the National Guard of Nicaragua. The results were disastrous on July 24, 1959, when Fonseca was gravely injured. Then, Borge was in Costa Rica with Silvio Mayorga; they thought Fonseca had perished. Upon reuniting with Fonseca, the three left to [[Cuba]] and formed friendships with [[Ernesto Guevara|Che Guevara]] and [[Tamara Bunke]], who had helped them with the guerilla.

In Cuba, Mayorga reunited with a group of young Nicaraguans from Venezuela, and they formed what would later be the "Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional" (National Sandinista Liberation Front). The name was derived from [[Augusto Sandino]] to convince Nicaraguans that Sandino's revolution was not dead. Also, the name Sandino was widely used to elicit strong emotion for the cause using the fallen leader's popularity. Fonseca traveled to Honduras to prepare the logistics that would permit the establishment of the group. On July 23, 1961, in [[Tegucigalpa]], Borge, along with Carlos Fonseca, Francisco Buitrago, Jorge Navarro, Silvio Mayorga, José Benito Escobar, Noel Guerrero, and Germán Pomares, formed the FSLN, which would be the key to the downfall of the Somoza regime and the start of the [[Sandinista Revolution]].

The FSLN was established in Honduras on the banks of the Patuka River. In 1962, the FSLN had 60 men in its ranks. Borge crossed into Nicaragua to recruit more members to the Sandinista cause.

==Insurrection==
Between 1965 and 1966, Tomás Borge headed the Sandinista newspaper "The Republican Mobilization." The next year, he tried again to create an active guerrilla group in the mountains near the Pancasán region, which was defeated. In 1969, the National Directorate of the FSLN (Borge was a member) named Fonseca as Secretary General.

In January 1969, along with Ruiz, Borge was arrested for arms smuggling on the border with Costa Rica. Both are deported to Colombia; there begins a period of exile that took him to Cuba and Peru. In that time, he also visited the base of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in Lebanon, passed by Mexico, and eventually returned to the ranks of the FSLN in Nicaragua.

On February 4, 1976, he was arrested again and sent to prison, where he was tortured. While in prison, the FSLN suffered several defeats and heavy losses. Fonseca perished in Zinica (Waslala, North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of Nicaragua). Borge was in prison in Matagalpa; a colonel in the National Guard told him the news of Fonseca's death, to which Borge said

{{quote|You are mistaken, Colonel, Carlos Fonseca, is among the dead who never die.}}

In August 1978, Borge was one of the highest ranking [[Sandinistas]] released from prison after the spectacular Sandinista raid (Operation Chanchera) on the Nicaraguan National Palace by 19 commandos, headed by [[Edén Pastora]] (Commander Zero) that took the entire Congress hostage.

The FSLN is divided into three factions and Tomás Borge lead the Prolonged Popular War fraction (GPP). On January 7, 1979, the FSLN came to an agreement on reunification, which was formalized in March, and Borge became one of the nine members of the National Directorate.

The triumphant guerrilla troops entered Managua on 19 July 1979. Days earlier, on July 11, Borge attended a meeting of the National Directorate along with [[Daniel Ortega]], Sergio Ramirez and Miguel d' Escoto in Costa Rica at the home of President Rodrigo Carazo Odio in Puntarenas with William Boudlerom, representative of the US government. At that meeting, Borge rejected the proposal to replace Somoza with Urcuyos Maliaños Francisco, President of the Congress, as established in the Constitution of 1974 would take place in the absence of the president. Somoza fled on 17 July and Urcuyos was named president.

Not too long after, Urcuyos was overthrown and power was passed to the Joint Government of National Reconstruction.

===The revolution===
On July 19, 1979, FSLN troops entered Managua and proclaimed the [[Sandinista Revolution]]. Borge, reputed to be the most radical of the nine commanders of the Front, was a member of the National Directorate of the FSLN and took charge of the Ministry of Interior (overseeing the Sandinista Police, prisons, immigration, Directorate General of State Security and Fire), a position he maintained until the loss of the presidential election in February 1990.

His first task in office was the dissolution of the National Guard and the reviewing of the cases of former Somoza government officials. He also attempted to eliminate crimes (moderate and minor), vagrancy, gambling and drinking.

Tomás Borge was part of the first revolutionary government delegation which visited the [[Soviet Union]] on March 17, 1980. On the trip, he described the situation in his country as follows: 

{{quote|The Government of National Reconstruction was a giant task to restore the devastated country, the need for international banks to pay a large external debt left by Somoza and his government. The country has high unemployment and poverty, the treacherous bourgeoisie - an ally of the most reactionary and aggressive circles of US imperialism - show a complete disregard for its people.}}

On July 19, 1981, in celebration of the third anniversary of the revolution, Borge reiterated that national unity, pluralism and a mixed economy were designed to strengthen, not to destabilize the revolutionary process. It was another warning to the opposition and entrepreneurs. At the same time, he ordered the dismissal of any officer who abused their authority.

In 1982, Tomás Borge was elected vicepresident of the [[COPPPAL|Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America]], an association of social democratic, socialist, liberal and nationalist parties on the continent.

===After defeat===
After the electoral defeat of 1990, some members of the National Directorate abandoned politics, and the FSLN underwent a transformation into the [[Sandinista Renovation Movement]] (MRS). Borge and [[Bayardo Arce]] with [[Daniel Ortega]] were the only members who remained in the FSLN.&lt;ref name=tercera&gt;[http://www.tercerainformacion.es/spip.php?article36790 Nicaragua Fallece fundador del FSLN, Tomás Borge Martínez "Es de los muertos que nunca mueren", dice Rosario Murillo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1997 and 2002, he was a member of the [[Central American Parliament]], Parlacén, and since 2001, a member of the [[National Assembly of Nicaragua|National Assembly]].

===Return to power===
In the presidential elections held on November 5, 2006, the Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega won with 38% of the vote.  Borge increased his influence in the government. On March 22, 2007, at his request, he was appointed Ambassador of Nicaragua to Peru, where he served until his death. His appointment was seen as a retreat from political life.

===Death===
On April 6, 2012, Borge entered the Military Hospital Alejandro Dávila Bolaños in Managua where he underwent a video-assisted thoracic surgery for a lung condition which had been progressing (according to some unofficial sources, he had cancer because he traveled to Cuba without being treated first). On April 9, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after a respiratory complication developed while staying under medical supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2012/04/10/ambito/97459-tomas-borge-delicado  Tomás Borge en estado delicado. Periódico: La Presa de Nicaragua. Fecha: 10 de abril de 2012. Autor:Elízabeth Romero]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, [[Rosario Murillo]], coordinator of the Communication and Citizenship Council, published news of his death, which had occurred at 20:55 p.m. that night.&lt;ref name=Granma&gt;[http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2012/05/01/interna/artic10.html Falleció el Comandante Tomás Borge] Periódico: Granma. Fecha:1 de mayo de 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Tomás Borge was 81 and had continued staying active in politics as ambassador in Lima, Peru.

Borge was the last survivor of the founders of the FSLN and one of its most important figures. Rosario Murillo said in reporting his death that Borge, as Borge had said of [[Carlos Fonseca]], is "among the dead that never die."

Official acts were performed in his honor at the National Palace of Culture, former National Palace, where the chapel once stood. Tomás Borge was buried in the mausoleum of Carlos Fonseca, at the Revolution Square in Managua and the government decreed three days of national mourning.&lt;ref name=nuevodiario1&gt;[http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/249879-muere-tomas-borge 1 de mayo de 2012 Gobierno prepara homenaje en Plaza de la Revolución Managua, Nicaragua | elnuevodiario.com.ni Muere Tomás Borge.  Al cierre de nuestra edición el Ejecutivo se aprestaba para declarar tres días de duelo nacional. Johnny Cajina | Nacionales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Borge was accused of exerting pressure against the Catholic Church hierarchy and accused it of siding with the Contras. Borge also established the censorship of the press, which was clarified after errors as well as compulsory military service.&lt;ref name=nuevodiario2&gt;[http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/52452 El 19 de julio y confesiones de Tomás Borge.] Nos convertimos en reyes y el pueblo nos sacó. El Nuevo Diario de Nicaragua. 15 de julio de 2009. Por José Adán Silva.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miskito people|Misquitos]] accused Borge, among others, of the displacement and killing of those who opposed the Sandinista government, as told by the President of the Permanent Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States(OAS), Marcos Carmona, to the FSLN and opposition in the context of an election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2006/06/08/nacionales/21333 El Nuevo Diario - Managua, Nicaragua - Ortega acusado de genocidio contra miskitos&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013222214/http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2006/06/08/nacionales/21333 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another accusation against Borge was that he gave the order to kill 37 dissidents imprisoned in [[Granada]] during the first term of Ortega. He was charged, along with the rest of the Sandinista government, after the victory of [[Violeta Chamorro]] in 1990, of the "[[Piñata Sandinista]]", where they were accused of confiscating public properties. The charges were always rejected by Borge.

He created the [[Council of Sandinista Defense]] (CDS), like the Cuban's [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution|CDR]], and the current Council of Citizen Power.

He founded the open prisons, where prisoners were without custody, and the women's prison "La Esperanza", a novelty in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;[http://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/fallece-tom-borge-ltimo-sobreviviente-fundador-sandinista-021618735.html Fallece Tomás Borge, último sobreviviente fundador Sandinista Por Por FILADELFO ALEMAN y MARJORIE MILLER]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the newspaper Nuevo Diario of Nicaragua for the 30th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution, Borge said:

{{Quote|We had come to power covered with an aura of holiness. We were 'the boys', heroes of the people we had released. But then came the war, the pressures, the economic crisis and mistakes, and the heroes we were became kings.}}

==Private life==
His first wife, Yelba Mayorga, was killed in 1979 during the guerrilla struggle and had a son. Later, he married Josephine Cerda and had several children with her. In 2007, he married the Peruvian actress [[Marcela Perez Silva]] and had three children with her.&lt;ref name="Esposas"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/tomas-borge-last-surviving-founder-of-the-sandinistas-7704217.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Borge was the author of several works of poetry, essays, and an autobiography. The Cuban poet Roberto Fernandez Retamar believes that Borge's book "''Carlos, el amanecer no es sólo un sueño''", which he wrote in prison, is comparable in literary merit to the documentary prose of [[Gabriel García Márquez]].

Some of his published titles are "The Patient Impatience", "A Grain of Corn", and "The Anticipated Ceremony".

'''Tomás Urbina''' (c. 1877&amp;ndash;1915) was a general during the [[Mexican Revolution]] who allied with [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]].&lt;ref name="Credo"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routmex/urbina_tomás|title=Encyclopedia of Mexico: History, Society &amp; Culture|author=Eva Tessler|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant '''Tomas Urbina''' and his counterpart and fellow General [[Rodolfo Fierro]], have been cited as the two halves of Pancho Villa, Fierro representing his more violent side.&lt;ref name="Katz98"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Pancho Villa |first=Friedrich |last=Katz|authorlink=Friedrich Katz |pages=221, 269–272, 328–329 |year=1998 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-3046-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbina was executed by General Fierro under the accusation that he betrayed Pancho Villa during the ''Battle of El Ébano'' (Spanish: Batalla de El Ébano), a 72-day [[siege]] of the town of [[Ebano, San Luis Potosí|El Ébano in the state of San Luis Potosí]], where Urbina finally surrendered his forces to the [[Constitutionalists in the Mexican Revolution|Constitutionalist faction]], and allegedly received a sum of money for his surrender.

== In film ==
In the film ''[[Villa Rides]]'' (1968), Urbina was portrayed by [[Robert Viharo]].

==In Literature==
Urbina is a major character in the novel, ''The Friends of Pancho Villa'' (1996), by ''[[James Carlos Blake]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">'''Antonio C. Agpaoa''' (1939-1982) most well known as '''Tony Agpaoa''' was a Filipino practitioner of [[psychic surgery]].

He worked in [[Manila]]. It was alleged that Agpaoa could remove tissue from the body of patients without making an incision.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Brooke Noel; Parker, Richard. (1979). ''Critical Thinking: Evaluating Claims and Arguments in Everyday Life''. Mayfield Publishing. p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0874848410}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] and skeptics were convinced his feats were the result of conjuring tricks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert Todd]]. (2003). ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary|The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions]]''.

Dover Publications. p. 171. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}} "Tony Agpaoa, the most popular of the psychic surgeons, has several times been detected in trickery."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Agpaoa was arrested and charged for fraud in the [[United States]] for pretending to mend a bone in a patients neck.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. p. 160. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}} "Antonio "Dr. Tony" Agpaoa who, in late 1968, was arrested in San Francisco. A month later, on December 19, he was indicted by a Detroit grand jury on a charge of fraud in foreign commerce. The indictment stemmed from a Michigan steelworker's 1966 visit to Manila, where Agpaoa pretended to mend fractured bones in the man's neck. Later X-rays, however, revealed the bones were as before although the man (briefly relieved of pain by suggestion) had believed himself healed."&lt;/ref&gt; American surgeon [[William A. Nolen]] has written "According to the [[American Medical Association|A.M.A.]] he had separated hundreds of patients from their life savings and had cured no one."&lt;ref&gt;[[William A. Nolen|Nolen, William A.]] (1974). ''Healing a Doctor in Search of a Miracle''. Random House. p. 24. {{ISBN|0-394-49095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magician [[James Randi]] has noted that Agpaoa had his own [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] removed in a hospital in [[San Francisco]], instead of visiting a psychic surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;Randi, James. (1982). ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]''. Prometheus Books. p. 182. {{ISBN|0-87975-199-1}} "Tony Agpaoa, one of the wealthiest men in the Philippines as a result of his quackery, had his own appendix removed — in San Francisco, in a real hospital."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valentin Petrovich Glushko''' ({{lang-ru|Валенти́н Петро́вич Глушко́}}, ''Valentin Petrovich Glushko''; {{lang-uk|Валентин Петрович Глушко}}, ''Valentyn Petrovych Hlushko''; born 2 September 1908 – 10 January 1989), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] engineer, and designer of [[rocket engine]]s during the Soviet/American [[Space Race]].

==Biography==
At the age of fourteen he became interested in [[aeronautics]] after reading novels by [[Jules Verne]]. He is known to have written a letter to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in 1923. He studied at an [[Odessa]] trade school, where he learned to be a [[sheet metal]] worker. After graduation he apprenticed at a hydraulics fitting plant. He was first trained as a fitter, then moved to lathe operator.

During his time in Odessa, Glushko performed experiments with explosives. These were recovered from unexploded artillery shells that had been left behind by the White Guards during their retreat. From 1924-25 he wrote articles concerning the exploration of the Moon, as well as the use of Tsiolkovsky's proposed engines for [[space flight]].

He attended [[Leningrad State University]] where he studied physics and mathematics, but found the specialty programs were not to his interest. He reportedly left without graduating in April, 1929. From 1929-1930 he pursued rocket research at the [[Gas Dynamics Laboratory]]. A new research section was apparently set up for the study of liquid-propellant and electric engines. He became a member of the [[Group for the Study of Reactive Motion|GIRD]] (Group for the study of Rocket Propulsion Systems), founded in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in 1931.

On 23 March 1938 he became caught up in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] and was rounded up by the [[NKVD]], to be placed in the [[Butyrka prison]]. By 15 August 1939 he was sentenced to eight years in the [[Gulag]]. Despite his supposed imprisonment, however, Glushko was put to work on various aircraft projects with other arrested scientists. In 1941 he was placed in charge of a design bureau for [[Liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engines]]. He was finally released in 1944 by special decree. In 1944, [[Sergei Korolev]] and Glushko designed the RD-1&amp;nbsp;{{sic|KhZ}} auxiliary rocket motor tested in a fast-climb [[Lavochkin]] [[La-7|La-7R]] for protection of the capital from high-altitude ''Luftwaffe'' attacks.&lt;ref&gt;"''Last of the Wartime Lavochkins''", AIR International, Bromley, Kent, U.K., November 1976, Volume 11, Number 5, pages 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of [[World War II]], Glushko was sent to Germany and Eastern Europe to study the German rocket program. In 1946, he became the chief designer of his own bureau, the OKB 456, and remained at this position until 1974. This bureau would play a prominent role in the development of rocket engines within the Soviet Union.

His OKB 456 (later [[NPO Energomash]]) would design the 35-[[metric ton-force|metric ton]] (340 [[kilonewton|kN]]) thrust RD-101 engine used in the R-2, the 120-ton (1,180&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust RD-110 employed in the R-3, and the 44-ton (430&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust RD-103 used in the [[R-5 Pobeda]] (SS-3 Shyster). The [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7 ("Semyorka")]] would include four of Glushko's [[RD-107]] engines and one RD-108. In 1954, he began to design engines for the [[R-12 Dvina]] (SS-4 Sandal), which had been designed by [[Mikhail Kuzmich Yangel|Mikhail Yangel]]. He also became responsible for supplying rocket engines for [[Sergei Korolev]], the designer of the [[R-9 Desna]] (SS-8 Sasin). Among his designs was the powerful [[RD-170]] liquid propellant engine.

In 1974, following the successful American moon landings, premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] decided to cancel the troubled Soviet program to send a man to the Moon. He consolidated the Soviet space program, moving [[Vasily Mishin]]'s [[Energia (corporation)#History|OKB-1]] (Korolev's former design bureau), as well as other bureaus, into a single bureau headed by Glushko, later named [[NPO Energia]]. Glushko's first act, after firing Mishin altogether, was to cancel the [[N-1 rocket]], a program he had long criticized, despite the fact that one of the reasons for its difficulties was his own refusal to design the high power engines Korolev needed because of friction between the two men and ostensibly a disagreement over the use of [[cryogenic]] or [[hypergolic]] fuel.

In 1965, after the [[UR-500]] booster began flying, the Chelomei Bureau offered a counterproposal to Korolev's N-1 in the [[UR-700]], a Saturn V-class booster with nine F-1 sized engines powered by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] and [[UDMH]]. Korolev was an outspoken opponent of hypergolic propellants due to their toxicity, often citing the 1960 [[Nedelin catastrophe]] as evidence of the danger posed by them, and had also objected to the UR-500 for the same reason.

Glushko meanwhile was an advocate of Chelomei's UR-700 as well as an even more powerful UR-900 with a nuclear-powered upper stage. When Korolev continued protesting about the safety risk posed by hypergolic propellants, Glushko responded with the counterargument that the US was launching the manned Gemini spacecraft atop a [[Titan II]] rocket with very similar propellants and it was not apparently a safety issue for them. He also argued that the N-1 was not a workable solution because they could not develop RP-1/LOX engines on the scale of the Saturn F-1. When Korolev also suggested developing a [[liquid hydrogen]] engine for the N-1, Glushko said that LH2 was completely impractical as a rocket fuel. Korolev's protests that the US was already using them on the Centaur stage and would soon be flying Saturn boosters with LH2 upper stages got nowhere.

The UR-700, Glushko said, could enable a direct-ascent trajectory to the Moon which he considered safer and more reliable than the rendezvous-and-dock approach used by the Apollo program and Korolev's N-1 proposals. He also imagined the UR-700 and 900 in all sorts of applications from lunar bases to manned Mars missions to outer planet probes to orbiting battle stations.

When Korolev died in January 1966, his deputy Vasily Mishin took over the OKB-1 design bureau. Mishin succeeded in getting the Kremlin to terminate the UR-700/900 project as well as the RD-270 engine Glushko planned for the launch vehicle family. His main arguments were the tremendous safety risk posed by a low-altitude launch failure of the UR-700 in addition to the waste of money by developing two [[Heavy-lift launch vehicle|HLV]] families at once.

After the complete failure of the Soviet manned lunar effort, unmanned Mars missions, and the deaths of four cosmonauts, Mishin was fired in 1973 and the Kremlin decided to consolidate the entire Soviet space program into one organization headed by Glushko.

One of Glushko's first acts was to suspend the N-1 program, which however was not formally terminated until 1976. He then began work on a completely new HLV. During this time, the US was developing the Space Shuttle and Soviet premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] had been told that the Shuttle was actually being constructed as an orbiting weapon system that could drop a nuclear bomb onto Moscow, bypassing all Soviet detection systems. Although the rumor was completely false, Brezhnev believed it anyway and ordered the development of a Soviet Space Shuttle.

Because the Soviets lacked expertise in large solid rocket motors, Glushko decided that the new HLV would use entirely liquid-fueled engines, with an LH2 core stage taking the place of the Shuttle main engines and strap-on boosters with LOX/RP-1 engines, an ironic situation given his opposition to those propellants years earlier.

While the RD-120 engine used for the Energia core stage was developed quickly and with little difficulty, the RD-170 proved harder to work out. As Soviet manufacturing technology was still not up to the task of building an F-1 class engine, Glushko instead decided to use an engine with four combustion chambers fed from a single propellant feed line. The RD-170 powered strap-on boosters designed for Energia became the basis for the Zenit booster family which began flying in 1985. Since the Buran space shuttle was not ready for operations, Energia's maiden flight in May 1987 carried aloft a prototype space station module called [[Polyus (spacecraft)|Polyus]]. Ultimately, Buran did fly the following summer, a few months before Glushko's death.

While Energia and Buran fell victim to loss of funding after the collapse of the USSR, the RD-170 engines and its derivatives are still flying today and the experience in LH2 engines made during the Energia project would be used in later upper stages such as Briz.

Glushko's team was part of the Soviet [[Ministry of General Machine Building]] headed by Minister [[Sergey Afanasyev (engineer)|Sergey Afanasyev]]. Before his death, he appointed [http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/225617/view Boris Gubanov] to become his successor.

Glushko died in January 1989. His obituary was signed by multiple [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] leaders, including [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and it was only following his death that Glushko's efforts became known to most of the Soviet populace.

For many years Glushko had worked in Korolev's shadow, and certainly never received the credit he deserved (at the time) for his contributions. He was reputed to be obstinate and egotistical. 

Perhaps his most significant engineering failure, as noted by division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that [[hydrogen fuel]] was unsuitable for use as a rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the [[Saturn V]] launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] used on the [[Saturn V]]; instead, his solution was the [[RD-270]], a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better [[specific impulse]] when compared to the F-1 engine. In addition, the RD-270 used the very advanced full-flow, staged, closed-cycle combustion concept as opposed to the simple open-cycle gas generator design used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N-1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion since Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the [[RD-170]] which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the [[Energia]] [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]], and is probably the finest example of Glushko's technical abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of [[Vasily Mishin]] and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program is a testament to the paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.
