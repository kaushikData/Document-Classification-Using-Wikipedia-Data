'''Aboriginal sites of New South Wales''' consist of a large number of places in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] where it is still possible to see visible signs of the activities and culture of the Australian Aboriginals who previously occupied these areas.

These sites are comparable with the [[petroglyphs]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the [[Rock Art]] found elsewhere in Australia, but are not restricted to rock carvings. Many of the sites are on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Publishers, 1981, pp.50-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==

The [[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived in the north of [[Australia]] around 50,000 years ago. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] area west of Sydney, while sites going back 40,000 years exist at [[Lake Mungo]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 Guide to NSW National Parks (National Parks and Wildlife Service) 2003, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; There are some thousands of known sites, many but not all located in national parks. Some sites are also found in more suburban settings; rock carvings can be seen in the Sydney suburbs of [[North Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]] and [[Tamarama, New South Wales|Tamarama]].

Their art was part of day-to-day life and would normally have had a purpose. One such purpose is thought to have been what some people call "wish fulfilment magic"—or sympathetic magic—in which the act of creating the magical work is thought to bring about the event depicted in the work. For example, a hunting scene—a common subject in rock carvings—would be aimed at bringing about the desired reality of good hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Aboriginal Art of Australia, Barbara Mullins (Mulavon Pty Ltd) 1986, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also many artworks that were created for specific ceremonial purposes and which were not intended to last after the ceremony was over.&lt;ref&gt;Aboriginal Art of Australia, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to such themes, there were also works of a more secular nature, which could be created for a number of reasons, including the instruction and entertainment of children.

There are substantial variations in the character of art developed in different parts of New South Wales. Art in the western part of the state could be very different from the art created in coastal areas.  Aboriginal sites in the state are administered by the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] of New South Wales. All known sites are recorded on the register known as the Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System (AHIMS), which is run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/licences/AboriginalHeritageInformationManagementSystem.htm AHIMS website:Retrieved 17 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is generally a policy of protecting Aboriginal sites, although a small number of sites are publicised. Notable examples are those at the Basin Track, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and the Bulgandry site, Brisbane Water National Park. However, most sites are not publicised, and restricted sites (colloquially known as sacred sites) will never be made public. If anyone thinks they have a legitimate reason for wanting to inspect sites that are not normally available to the public, they can apply to AHIMS for permission.

The sites are of many different types, for example:
* Paintings
* Rock carvings
* [[Hand stencil]]s
* Charcoal drawings
* Shell middens
* Shield trees
* Restricted sites

Image:Imitation1.jpg|European imitation, Grotto Point, [[Sydney Harbour National Park]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Paintings''' cover a wide range of subjects, both spiritual and secular. Coloured pigmentation was created with ochre (giving a red/orange colour), charcoal (for a black pigmentation) and ash (for grey pigmentation). One good example is the rock shelter popularly known as Baiame's Cave, at [[Milbrodale, New South Wales|Milbrodale]], with paintings depicting a large figure that may be [[Baiame]], the Sky Father.

'''Rock carvings''', also known as petroglyphs or Rock Engravings, are of a style known as "simple figurative", which conventional archaeological thinking dates to the last 5000 years. Other engravings show [[Europe]]an [[sailing ships]], and so cannot be more than about 200 years old. Thus we are left with a date range of 5000–200 years ago. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that we know the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies. Carvings could be very large. In some carvings, the figure of Baiame the Sky Father could be eighteen metres tall.&lt;ref&gt;Aboriginal Art of Australia, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to pictorial carvings, there are many grinding grooves, caused by grinding stone implements on a rock surface to shape them and give them an edge. Areas like Sydney and the Blue Mountains have many rock carvings because they predominantly consist of sandstone (known as Hawkesbury sandstone), which is a very suitable surface for rock carvings. See [[Sydney Rock Engravings]] for the main article on these.

'''Hand stencils''' can often be found in rock shelters and caves, which have given them protection from the elements over the years. They were created by placing the hand on a rocky surface and blowing pigmentation around it, leaving the silhouette of the hand on the rock. There is often a number of them in one place. The best-known example is Red Hands Cave, in the [[Blue Mountains National Park]], which has many stencils, including those created by children as well as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charcoal drawings''' were exactly that: drawings executed with a piece of charcoal. Like the rock carvings, they could be of a wide range of subjects, with animals often featured.

'''Shell middens''' developed in occupation sites where shell fish were consumed. Over the years, layers of shells would build up, creating a concentration of many shells in the soil around the occupation site.

'''Shield trees''' are seen occasionally in the Sydney bush. A substantial piece of bark would be cut out of a tree and used as a shield or tray. A visible "scar" was thus left behind, which could vary considerably in size, some being quite large.

'''Restricted areas''' (otherwise known as sacred sites) are usually of a spiritual nature and were restricted to adult males and, in some cases, women. These sites could include ceremonial sites, bora grounds, men's sites and women's birthing sites.

==Occupation sites and sacred sites==

It is necessary to distinguish between occupation sites and sacred sites, a subject about which there is often great confusion. Many people think that all Aboriginal sites are "sacred sites", but the reality is more complex. Before white settlement, most indigenous sites were occupation sites, which were used by all members of a tribe. Sacred sites, on the other hand, were restricted to adult males, except for certain women's sites. In more recent times, all indigenous sites 
have become known as sacred sites; those that were previously known as sacred sites are now known as restricted sites.

==Imitations==

It is worth noting that there are many imitation sites, in which Europeans created imitations of Aboriginal art, usually in the form of rock carvings. One of the most prominent examples is a large carving of a kangaroo alongside a walking track at Grotto Point, in the [[Sydney Harbour National Park]]. This has been known for some time to be an imitation (or fake, as some would say).&lt;ref&gt;Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 1987, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eschatology}}
'''Al-Masih ad-Dajjal''' ({{lang-ar|المسيح الدجّال}} ''{{transl|ar|Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl}}'', "the false messiah, liar, the deceiver") is an evil figure in [[Islamic eschatology]]. He is to appear, pretending to be ''al-Masih'' (i.e. the [[Messiah#Islam|Messiah]]), before ''Yawm al-Qiyamah'' (the Day of Resurrection). He is an anti-messianic figure, comparable to the [[Antichrist]] in [[Christian eschatology]] and to [[Armilus]] in medieval [[Jewish eschatology]].

==Name==
''{{transl|ar|Dajjāl}}'' (Arabic: دجال) is an adjective of [[Syriac language|Syriac]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;The Continuum History of Apocalypticism, edited by Bernard McGinn et al, The Continuum International publishing group Inc., 15 East 26th Street, New York, NY 10010, Published 2003, {{ISBN|0-8264-1520-2}}, 677 pages, page 387.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common [[Arabic]] [[wikt:superlative|superlative]] form  of the root word ''{{transl|ar|dajl}}'' meaning "lie" or "[[deception]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahiduddin Khan|title=The Alarm of Doomsday|date=2011|publisher=Goodword Books|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{transl|ar|Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl}}'', with the definite article ''[[al-]]'' ("the"), refers to "the deceiving Messiah", a specific [[end times]] deceiver. The ''{{transl|ar|Dajjāl}}'' is an [[evil]] being who will seek to impersonate the true Messiah.

The name Dajjal also is rooted in an Arabic word ''dajel'', which means "to gold plate" or "to coat in gold". It is derived from word meaning "to mix".

==Hadith==
According to ''[[hadith]]'', [[Muhammad the greatest ]] is said to have prophesied that the Masih ad-Dajjal would be the last of a series of thirty ''Dajjal'' or "deceivers".&lt;ref&gt;

* Muhammad is reported to have said:

{{Quote|Note: reference does not match the quoted text.
Ad-Dajjal is blind in the right eye and his eye looks like a bulging out grape.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|30|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[Ali]] was reported to have said:

{{Quote|His right eye will be punctured, and his left eye would be raised to his forehead and will be sparkling like a  star. Only the believers will be able to read the word "''Kafir''{{-"}} [disbeliever], inscribed in bold letters, on his forehead. There will be big mountains of smoke at both front and backsides of his caravan. People will anticipate food within those mountains, during the severe famine. All rivers, falling in his way, will become dry and he will call upon people in a loud voice, "O my friends come to me! I am your lord who has made your limbs and given you sustenance."&lt;ref name="EOL104"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bilgrami | first=Sayed Tahir | title=Essence of Life, A translation of Ain al-Hayat by Allama Mohammad Baqir Majlisi | year=2005 | publisher=Ansarian Publications | location=Qum |chapter=6 | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Muhammad is reported to have said:

{{Quote|If he comes forth while I am among you I shall be the one who will dispute with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth when I am not among you, a man must dispute on his own behalf, and Allah will take my place in looking after every Muslim. Those of you who live up to his time should recite over him the opening verses of Surat al–Kahf, for they are your protection from his trial. We asked: How long will he remain on the earth? He replied: Forty days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and rest of his days like yours. We asked: Messenger of Allah, will one day's prayer suffice us in this day which will be like a year? He replied: No, you must make an estimate of its extent. Then Jesus son of Mary will descend at the white minaret to the east of Damascus. He will then catch him up at the gate of Ludd and kill him.&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud 4321, In-book reference: Book 39, Hadith 31, English translation: Book 38, Hadith 4307&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Muhammad is reported to have said:

{{Quote|The flourishing state of Jerusalem will be when Yathrib is in ruins, the ruined state of Yathrib will be when the great war comes, the outbreak of the great war will be at the conquest of Constantinople and the conquest of Constantinople when the Dajjal ([[Antichrist]]) comes forth. He (the Prophet) struck his thigh or his shoulder with his hand and said: This is as true as you are here or as you are sitting (meaning [[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud 4294, In-book reference: Book 39, Hadith 4, English translation: Book 38, Hadith 4281, Hasan&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Signs of coming of Al-Masih ad-Dajjal ===

Isa will decline with the words, "The virtue of this nation that follows Islam is that they lead each other."

All those who embraced the evil of Dajjal shall perish even as the breath of Isa touches them. The breath of Isa shall precede him as far as the eye can see. Dajjal will be captured at the gate of [[Lod]]. Dajjal shall begin to melt, as salt dissolves in water.

Isa will break the cross, kill Dajjal and save the humanity. Then all battles shall cease and the world will know an age of peace. The rule of Isa will be just and all shall flock to him to enter the folds of the one true religion, Islam.

===Shi'a===
[[Shia]]s believe that Dajjal will be killed either by [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] or [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bilgrami | first=Sayed Tahir | title=Essence of Life, A translation of Ain al-Hayat by Allama Mohammad Baqir Majlisi | year=2005 | publisher=Ansarian Publications | location=Qum |chapter=6 | page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=al-Qarashi | first=Allama Baqir Sharif | title=The Life of Imam al-Mahdi Peace Be Upon Him | year=2006 | publisher=Ansarian Publications | location=Qum | page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Ahmadiyya community===
Prophecies concerning the emergence of the Dajjal are interpreted in [[Ahmadiyya ]] teachings as designating a specific group of nations centred upon falsehood instead of an individual, with the reference to the Dajjal as an individual indicating its unity as a class or system rather than its personal individuality. In particular, Ahmadis identify the Dajjal collectively with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of [[European Christianity]] throughout the world, a development which had begun soon after the Muslim [[conquest of Constantinople]], with the [[Age of Discovery]] in the [[15th century]] and accelerated by the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2003|publisher=Altamira Press|isbn=0-7591-0190-6|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_New_Encyclopedia_of_Islam.html?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;redir_esc=y|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jonker|first=Gerdien|title=The Ahmadiyya Quest for Religious Progress: Missionizing Europe 1900-1965|year=2015|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-30529-8|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GUUpCwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valentine|first=Simon|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat: history, belief, practice|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-70094-8|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malik Ghulam Farid, et al.

(1992) [http://aaiil.org/text/books/mali/gog/antichristgogmagog.pdf ''The Antichrist and Gog and Magog''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701133728/http://aaiil.org/text/books/mali/gog/antichristgogmagog.pdf |date=1 July 2018 }}, Ohio: Ahmadiyya Anjuman-i Ishāʿat-i Islām&lt;/ref&gt; As with other eschatological themes, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] wrote extensively on this topic. In defining the word ''dajjal'' he wrote:

{{quote|Then understand, my dear ones, that it has been disclosed to me that the reference to the Antichrist as one individual is not designed to indicate his personal individuality, but his unity as a class, meaning thereby that in that class there will be a unity of ideas as is, indeed, indicated by the word ''dajjāl'' itself and in this name there are many Signs for those who reflect. The meaning of the word ''dajjāl'' is a chain of deceptive ideas, the links of which are so attached to each other as if it was a structure of equal-sized bricks of the same colour, quality and strength, some of them firmly overlapping others and further strengthened by being plastered from outside.&lt;ref&gt;''Tadhkirah'', Translated by Muhammad Zafrullah Khan, Islam International Publications, "Islamabad" Sheephatch Lane, Tilford, Surrey GU10 2AQ UK, 1976, {{ISBN|978-1-84880-051-9}}, 1366 pages, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The identification of the Dajjal principally with [[Christianity and colonialism|colonial missionaries]] was drawn by Ghulam Ahmad through linking the ''hadith'' traditions about him with certain Quranic passages such as, ''inter alia'', the description in the ''hadith'' of the emergence of the Dajjal as the greatest tribulation since the creation of [[Adam]] taken in conjunction with the Quran’s description of the deification of Jesus as the greatest abomination; the warning only against the putative lapses of the Jews and Christians in ''[[Al-Fatiha]]'' – the principal Islamic prayer – and the absence therein of any warning specifically against the Dajjal; a prophetic ''hadith'' which prescribed the recitation of the opening and closing ten verses of chapter eighteen of the Quran, (''[[Al-Kahf]]'') as a safeguard against the mischief of the Dajjal, the former of which speak of a people “who assign a son to God” and the latter, of those whose lives are entirely given to the pursuit and manufacture of material goods; and the period of the Dajjal’s reign coinciding with the dominance of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Ghulam Ahmad randi' Ka baccha , batichood , najayaz aulaad , MAA ko bachnay wala, (2005), [https://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up ''The Essence of Islam'', Vol. III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111042054/https://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3 |date=11 November 2017 }}, Tilford: Islam International, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ali.

The Dajjal being blind in his right eye while being sharp and oversized in his left, for example, is seen as indicative of being devoid of religious insight and spiritual understanding but excellent in material and scientific attainment, with the right eye representing godliness and spirituality, and the left eye representing worldliness.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ali. (1992) [http://aaiil.org/text/books/mali/gog/antichristgogmagog.pdf ''The Antichrist and Gog and Magog''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701133728/http://aaiil.org/text/books/mali/gog/antichristgogmagog.pdf |date=1 July 2018 }}, Ohio: Ahmadiyya Anjuman-i Ishāʿat-i Islām, pp.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Dajjal not entering [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] is interpreted with reference to the failure of colonial missionaries in reaching these two places.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, (2005), [https://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/290/mode/1up ''The Essence of Islam'', Vol. III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111042054/https://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3 |date=11 November 2017 }}, Tilford: Islam International, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Dajjal in Ahmadi eschatology is to occur by force of argument and by the warding off of its mischief through the very coming of the Messiah, rather than by physical warfare;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ali.

"Ghulam Ahmad denied the historicity of Jesus' crucifixion and claimed that Jesus had fled to India where he died a natural death in Kashmir.

'The death of Jesus Christ' explained one of Ahmad's biographers ‘was to be the death-knell of the Christian onslaught against Islam'. As Ahmad argued, the idea of Jesus dying in old age, rather than death on a cross, as taught by the gospel writers, 'invalidates the divinity of Jesus and the doctrine of Atonement'."&lt;/ref&gt; The 'gate of Lud' (''Bāb al-Ludd'') spoken of in the ''hadith'' literature as the site where the Dajjal is to be slain (or captured)&lt;ref&gt;'Gate of Lud' Abul Husayn Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Qushayri al-Nishapuri.

Upon his arrival in London in 1924, Ghulam Ahmad's son and second [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Successor]], [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud]] proceeded directly to this site and led a lengthy [[Dua|prayer]] outside the entrance of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] before laying the foundation for a [[Fazl Mosque, London|mosque in London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geaves|first=Ron|title=Islam and Britain: Muslim Mission in an Age of Empire|year=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4742-7173-8|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Islam_and_Britain.html?id=mMA2DwAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shahid, Dost Mohammad, [http://alislam.org/urdu/pdf/Tarikh-e-Ahmadiyyat-V04.pdf ''Tarikh e Ahmadiyyat'' vol IV.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807003931/http://www.alislam.org/urdu/pdf/Tarikh-e-Ahmadiyyat-V04.pdf |date=7 August 2011 }} p446.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Amaleki''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|æ|l|ə|k|aɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-măl´a-kī»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] explorer who lived in the [[Americas]] in the 2nd century BC.  He is mentioned briefly as one of the brothers of [[Ammon (Book of Mormon explorer)|Ammon]], and one of sixteen men that were part of Ammon's band.  Under the direction of king [[King Mosiah I|Mosiah]], the band embarked upon a quest from the land of [[Zarahemla]] to find the group of Nephites that had left years before to settle in the [[land of Nephi]] (which was predominantly populated by [[Lamanites]] at the time).  Their exploration party wandered in the wilderness for 40 days before finally stumbling upon the people of [[Zeniff]], who mistook them for Lamanite spies and threw them in prison.  Ammon's band was eventually released and helped the people of Zeniff escape the occupation of the Lamanites and return to Zarahemla.

The '''Bai''' or '''Baip''' ([[Bai language]]: Baipho /pɛ̰˦˨xo̰˦/ (白和); {{zh|c=白族|p=Báizú}}; [[endonym]] pronounced {{IPA-xx|pɛ̀tsī|}}) are an East Asian ethnic group. They constitute one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]]. They numbered 1,858,063 as of 2000.

==Names==
The Bai people hold the colour white in high esteem and call themselves "Baipzix" (''pɛ42 tsi33''; Baizi 白子), "Baip'ho" (''pɛ42 xo44''; Baihuo 白伙), "Baip yinl" (''pɛ42 ji21''; Baini 白尼), or "Miep jiax". Baip people literally means 'white people' in Chinese. In 1956, the Chinese authorities named them the Bai nationality according to their preference.

Historically, the Bai had also been called Minjia (民家) by the Chinese from the 14th century to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/edmondson1994voice.pdf|format=PDF|title=Voice quality|website=Sealang.net|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minjia means civil people and natives, as opposite to Junjia (軍家), which means the military people who were Han Chinese.

The origin of the name Bai is not clear, but most scholars believe that it has a strong connection to the first state Bai people built in roughly the 3rd century AD. This state, called ''Baizi Guo'' (白子國; State of Bai), was not documented in Chinese orthodox history but was frequently mentioned in the oral history of Yunnan Province. It was believed to be built by the first king, Longyouna (龍佑那), who was given the family name "[[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]]" (張) by [[Zhuge Liang]], the chancellor of the state of [[Shu Han]] (221–263 CE). Zhuge Liang conquered the Dali region at that time and picked up Longyouna and assisted him in building the State of Bai. The State of Bai was located in present-day [[Midu County]], [[Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture]], Yunnan Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=释|first=同揆|title=洱海丛谈(Erhai Congtan)|year=c. 1681|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[Image:Lago-erhai-casa-bai-c03.jpg|left|thumb|Bai Architecture]]
Bai people live mostly in the provinces of [[Yunnan]] ([[Dali, Yunnan province|Dali]] area), and  in neighboring [[Guizhou]] ([[Bijie]] area) and  [[Hunan]] ([[Sangzhi]] area) provinces. Of the 2 million Bai people, eighty percent live in concentrated communities in the [[Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture]] in Yunnan Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-2-bai.htm|title=Ethnic Groups|website=China.org.cn|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The origin of Bai was heavily debated over roughly the past century. Ironically those debates were of the groups of people who were assimilated into Bai, rather than the issue per se. According to archaeological excavations around the Lake Erhai, Bai people were originated in the lake area. The earliest human site was discovered in the early 20th century, which was called the paleolithic Malong relics of Mt. Cangshan (苍山马龙遗址), dated circa 4000 bp. The late sites include Haimenkou of Jianchuan (剑川海门口，3000 bp), Baiyangcun of Binchuan (宾川白羊村, 3500 bp), and Dabona of Xiangyun(祥云大波那, 2350 bp).

An estimated 1,240,000 (as of 2003) of the Bai speak the [[Bai language]] in all its varieties. The origins of the language have been obscured by intensive Chinese influence of an extended period. Different scholars have proposed that it is an early offshoot or sister language of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese]], or a separate group (though usually still within the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] family).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | surname = Wang | given = Feng | title = On the genetic position of the Bai language | journal =  Cahiers de Linguistique – Asie Orientale | year = 2005 | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–127 | doi = 10.3406/clao.2005.1728 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bai call themselves Baizi, Baini, or Baihuo. They have 60 other names, including the Han term Minjia (for the Bai in Dali). In the Tang and Song Dynasty, Bai was written using Chinese characters in a manner similar to the way in which the [[Man'yōgana]] (万叶假名) were used to write Japanese. A Latin-based writing system was developed in 1957.

==Religion==
[[Image:Bai Tea Serving Ceremonial Ground.JPG|thumb|A tea-serving ceremonial ground.]]
Although most Bai people adhere to [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-bai.htm|title=Ethnic Groups - china.org.cn|website=China.org.cn|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/religion.htm|title=Ethnic Groups - china.org.cn|website=China.org.cn|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also have a native religion of [[Benzhuism]]: the worship of ''ngel zex'' ({{zh|c=本主 |p=běnzhǔ |labels=no}}), local gods and ancestors. Ngel zex could be any heroes in history, the prince of the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] regime, a hero of folklore or even a tiger (for instance, Laojun Jingdi {{lang|zh|老君景帝}} is a tiger).

There are minorities practicing [[Taoism]] and [[Christianity]].

There are a few villages in Yunnan where residents are [[Muslim]]s, but speak Bai as their first language. These people are officially classified by Chinese authorities as belonging to the [[Hui people|Hui nationality]] and call themselves ''Bai Hui'' ("Bai-speaking Muslims"). They usually say that their ancestors were [[Hui people]], who came to Yunnan as followers of the Mongolian army in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dru C.|last=Gladney|title=Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic|year=1996|edition=2|isbn=0-674-59497-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC|page=33}} (1st edition appeared in 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
The Bai diet typically comprises sharp, cold and spicy flavours. Cured ham or fish with rice are common dishes; for some groups based in mountain areas corn is a staple food.

==Tea Ceremony==
The Bai [[tea ceremony]], San Dao Cha 三道茶 (Three Course Tea), is most popular among the Bai in the [[Dali City, Yunnan|Dali]] area and is a common sight at festivals and marriages. It is both a cultural ceremony and method of honouring a guest.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper39/6561/643399.html|title=大理白族"三道茶"（民俗风情）|website=People.com.cn|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony is often described in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as, 'Yiku, ertian, sanhuiwei' 一苦二甜三回味 (First is bitter, Second is sweet, Third brings reflection (aftertaste)).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daliandaily.com.cn/gb/daliandaily/2005-02/04/content_631869.htm |title=大连日报 |website=Daliandaily.com |accessdate=18 March 2015 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first tea course starts with baking the [[tea leaves]] in a clay pot over a small flame, shaking the leaves often whilst they bake. When they turn slightly brown and give off a distinct fragrance, heated water is added to the pot. The water should immediately begin bubbling. When the bubbling ceases a small amount of bitterly fragrant, concentrated tea remains. Due to the sound the hot water makes when it enters the clay pot the first course tea was, in previous times, also known as Lei Xiang Cha 雷响茶 (Sound of Thunder Tea).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The second course is sweet tea. Pieces of walnut kernel and roasted ru shan (乳扇) (a dairy product specific to the Dali region)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7c6u.cn/0909/955.html|title=100道 云南美食 图文版 大理乳扇 大理名菜 大理小吃-大理-昆明中国国际旅行社有限公司|website=7c6u.cn|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are put into a tea cup with brown sugar and other ingredients. Boiling water is added and the tea is then offered to the guest. This tea is sweet without being oily, so the guest can easily drink it.&lt;ref name="QQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.qq.com/a/20070314/000008.htm |title=腾讯文学 - 文字之美，感动心灵 |website=Book.qq.com|accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425062852/http://book.qq.com/a/20070314/000008.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third tea is made by mixing honey, [[Sichuan pepper]], slices of ginger and [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]] together in a china cup with hot [[Cangshan Xue]] green tea.&lt;ref name="QQ"/&gt; The product is a tea that is sweet, coarse and spicy all at once. This Dali specialty has a noticeable aftertaste, which meant it was known as Hui Wei Cha 回味茶 (Reflection Tea).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The 18 procedures of the tea ceremony are governed by strict etiquette, which follows the principles of etiquette, honesty and beauty. As such, the tea ceremony is considered by some to perfectly embody the hospitable Bai people's current customs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Fashion==
The Bai people, as their name would suggest, favor white clothes and decorations. Women generally wear white dresses, sleeveless jackets of red, blue or black color, embroidered belts, loose trousers, embroidered shoes of white cloth, and jewelry made of gold or silver. Women in [[Dali City, Yunnan|Dali]] traditionally wear a white coat trimmed with a black or purple collar, loose blue trousers; embroidered shoes, silver bracelets and earrings. Unmarried women wear a single pigtail on the top of the head, while married women roll their hair. The men wear white jackets, black-collared coats, and dark loose shorts. Their headwear and costume reflect the Bai symbols:{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} the snow, the moon, the flower, and the wind.

The modern Bai are famous for their tie dyes and use them for wall hangings, table decorations, clothing, etc.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Festivals==
The grandest festival of the Bai people is the [[Third Month Fair]], held annually at the foot of [[Cang Mountain|Mount Cangshan]] in Dali between the fifteenth and the twentieth day of the third lunar month. Originally it was religious activity to rally and pay homage, but it gradually evolved into a fair including performances of traditional sports and dance, as well as the trade of merchandise from different regions.

Another important festival is the [[Torch Festival]], held on the 25th day of the sixth lunar month to wish health and a good harvest. On that evening, the countryside is decorated with banners with auspicious words written upon them. Villagers then light torches in front of their gates and walk around the fields while holding yet more torches in order to catch pests.

== Cormorant fishing ==
[[Cormorant fishing]] uses [[cormorant]]s for fishing and is practiced among the Bai fishermen.

== Architecture ==
The Bai architecture is characterized by three buildings forming a U and a fourth wall as a screen. The middle has a courtyard. The houses are usually built out of brick and wood, and the main room is in the middle (opposite the screen wall). The screen wall is built with brick and stone. The house is painted in white with black tile paintings depicting animals and other natural images. The detailing usually is made of clay sculpture, woodcarving, colored drawing, stone inscription, marble screens and dark brink. It produces a very striking and elegant effect.

Dali is well known for its marble. The name for marble is 'Dali marble' in Chinese. It is used in modern architecture by the Bai.

'''Bishops of [[Samogitia]]''', [[Samogitian diocese]] (now a part of [[Lithuania]]) from 1417 to 1926.

The seat of the diocese was in [[Varniai]]/Medininkai until 1864, when it was moved to [[Kaunas]]. It was liquidated in 1926 by [[Pope Pius XI]] when the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas|archdiocese of Kaunas]] was created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5703">The religious group known as the '''Blackburn Cult''', the '''Divine Order of the Royal Arms of the Great Eleven''', or the '''Great Eleven Club''', was started in 1922 on [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] in [[Downtown]] [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and later formed a retreat in the [[Southern California]] [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]]. The group's founder, [[May Otis Blackburn]], is said to have received revelations directly from [[angel]]s, and, along with her daughter Ruth Wieland Rizzio, believed that she was charged by the archangel [[Gabriel]] to write books revealing the mysteries of [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]], and life and death.&lt;ref name="appleton"&gt;{{Citation | surname1= Havens| given1=Patricia | surname2=Appleton | given2=Bill | year= 1997   | title=Simi Valley - A Journey Through Time | publisher=Simi Valley Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

== Indicted for grand theft ==
In 1929, group leaders were indicted in [[Los Angeles]] for [[grand theft]] and investigated in connection with the disappearances of several members.&lt;ref name="appleton" /&gt;  These indictments created a sensation after the background of the grand theft was revealed to the public.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;"Photos of Early Simi Valley Richly Illustrate History Book", Douglas Clark, ''Daily News'', Nov 29, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  May Otis Blackburn was charged with twelve counts of grand theft, and articles at that time referred to her as a "cult leader".&lt;ref&gt;"DIVINE ARM CULT CHIEF ARRAIGNED: Mrs. Blackburn's Plea Set for Monday on Charges of $28,000 Grand Theft", ''Los Angeles Times '', Dec 4, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine , the Blackburn Cult was also known as "The Great Eleven", and May Otis Blackburn was referred to as the "Heel of God".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738983-3,00.html California Cults], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]]'', March 31, 1930, Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The cult collapsed after May Otis Blackburn was imprisoned for stealing 40,000 dollars from Clifford Dabney.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Priestess of Mystic Cult Guilty in $40,000 Swindle: Jury Out Three Days Decides Finally Woman Defrauded Oil Man. PRIESTESS OF CULT IS GUILTY OF FRAUD", ''The Washington Post'', March 3, 1930, -- "Mrs. May Otis Blackburn, high priestess of the mystic cult known as the Divine Order of the Royal Arm of the Great Eleven, was convicted of grand theft today by a jury which began deliberation last Thursday."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depicted in theatrical productions ==
In October 2007, actresses playing May Otis Blackburn and Ruth Rizzio appeared in the Ghost Tour in Strathearn Park, in [[Simi Valley, California]].  The actress playing Blackburn stated: "May Otis is really fun and flamboyant..She's a cult leader. Who wouldn't want to play a cult leader?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2007/1005/Front_Page/003.html Ghost Tour Brought to Life After Two Years in Suspended Animation], by Angela Randazzo, ''Simi Valley Acorn'', Front Page, October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Ghost Tour" in Robert P. Strathearn Historical Park had previously featured Blackburn in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;"Past Presence; Ghost Tour Opens Tonight, Will Bring Simi History to Life", Sylvia L. Oliande, ''Daily News'', October 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject of fictionalized history ==
In 2008, R.J. Baudé, son of the last surviving member of the Great Eleven, published a fact-based novel about the group, "The Blackburn Chronicles: A Tale of Murder, Money and Madness". 
"The Kept Girl," &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekeptgirl.com/ The Kept Girl website.&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Cooper's novel about the cult, [[Raymond Chandler]] and the real-life [[Philip Marlowe]], was published in 2014.

== Non-fiction/Historical Accounts ==
In 2014, Samuel Fort published "Cult of the Great Eleven," a detailed historical account of the rise and fall of the Divine Order of the Royal Arms of the Great Eleven.

'''Egyptian mythology''' is the collection of [[myth]]s from [[ancient Egypt]], which describe the actions of the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian gods]] as a means of understanding the world. The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Myths appear frequently in Egyptian [[Ancient Egyptian literature|writings]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]], particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]], and [[Egyptian temple|temple]] decoration. These sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments.

Inspired by the cycles of nature, the Egyptians saw time in the present as a series of recurring patterns, whereas the earliest periods of time were linear. Myths are set in these earliest times, and myth sets the pattern for the cycles of the present. Present events repeat the events of myth, and in doing so renew ''[[maat]]'', the fundamental order of the universe. Amongst the most important episodes from the mythic past are the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]], in which the gods form the universe out of primordial chaos; the stories of the reign of the sun god [[Ra]] upon the earth; and the [[Osiris myth]], concerning the struggles of the gods [[Osiris]], [[Isis]], and [[Horus]] against the disruptive god [[Set (mythology)|Set]]. Events from the present that might be regarded as myths include Ra's daily journey through the world and its otherworldly counterpart, the [[Duat]]. Recurring themes in these mythic episodes include the conflict between the upholders of ''maat'' and the forces of disorder, the importance of the [[pharaoh]] in maintaining ''maat'', and the continual death and regeneration of the gods.

The details of these sacred events differ greatly from one text to another and often seem contradictory. Egyptian myths are primarily metaphorical, translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that humans can understand. Each variant of a myth represents a different symbolic perspective, enriching the Egyptians' understanding of the gods and the world.

Mythology profoundly influenced Egyptian culture. It inspired or influenced many religious rituals and provided the ideological basis for kingship. Scenes and symbols from myth appeared in art in tombs, temples, and [[amulet]]s. In literature, myths or elements of them were used in stories that range from humor to allegory, demonstrating that the Egyptians adapted mythology to serve a wide variety of purposes.

==Origins==
The development of Egyptian myth is difficult to trace. [[Egyptologists]] must make educated guesses about its earliest phases, based on written sources that appeared much later.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes in Kramer 1961, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; One obvious influence on myth is the [[Geography of Egypt#Natural regions|Egyptians' natural surroundings]]. Each day the sun rose and set, bringing light to the land and regulating human activity; each year the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile flooded]], renewing the fertility of the soil and allowing the highly productive farming that sustained Egyptian civilization. Thus the Egyptians saw water and the sun as symbols of life and thought of time as a series of natural cycles. This orderly pattern was at constant risk of disruption: unusually low floods resulted in famine, and high floods destroyed crops and buildings.&lt;ref name="David 2002, pp. 1–2"&gt;David 2002, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The hospitable [[Nile valley]] was surrounded by harsh desert, populated by peoples the Egyptians regarded as uncivilized enemies of order.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, David, "Egypt's View of 'Others'", in Tait 2003, pp. 155, 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the Egyptians saw their land as an isolated place of stability, or ''[[maat]]'', surrounded and endangered by chaos. These themes—order, chaos, and renewal—appear repeatedly in Egyptian religious thought.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible source for mythology is ritual. Many rituals make reference to myths and are sometimes based directly on them.&lt;ref name="Morenz 81"&gt;Morenz 1973, pp. 81–84&lt;/ref&gt; But it is difficult to determine whether a culture's myths developed before rituals or vice versa.&lt;ref name="Baines 83"&gt;Baines 1991, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about this [[myth and ritual|relationship between myth and ritual]] have spawned much discussion among Egyptologists and scholars of [[comparative religion]] in general. In ancient Egypt, the earliest evidence of religious practices predates written myths.&lt;ref name="Morenz 81"/&gt; Rituals early in Egyptian history included only a few motifs from myth. For these reasons, some scholars have argued that, in Egypt, rituals emerged before myths.&lt;ref name="Baines 83"/&gt; But because the early evidence is so sparse, the question may never be resolved for certain.&lt;ref name="Morenz 81"/&gt;

In private rituals, which are often called "magical", the myth and the ritual are particularly closely tied. Many of the myth-like stories that appear in the rituals' texts are not found in other sources. Even the widespread motif of the goddess [[Isis]] rescuing her poisoned son [[Horus]] appears only in this type of text. The Egyptologist David Frankfurter argues that these rituals adapt basic mythic traditions to fit the specific ritual, creating elaborate new stories (called [[historiola]]s) based on myth.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter in Meyer and Mirecki 2001, pp. 472–474&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Joris Borghouts|J. F. Borghouts]] says of magical texts that there is "not a shred of evidence that a specific kind of 'unorthodox' mythology was coined... for this genre."&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Egyptian mythology consists of [[origin myths]], explaining the beginnings of various elements of the world, including human institutions and natural phenomena. Kingship arises among the gods at the beginning of time and later passed to the human [[pharaoh]]s; warfare originates when humans begin fighting each other after the sun god's withdrawal into the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 113, 115, 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; Myths also describe the supposed beginnings of less fundamental traditions. In a minor mythic episode, Horus becomes angry with his mother Isis and cuts off her head. Isis replaces her lost head with that of a cow. This event explains why Isis was sometimes depicted with the horns of a cow as part of her headdress.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gwyn Griffiths|Griffiths, J. Gwyn]], "Isis", in Redford 2001, vol. II, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

Some myths may have been inspired by historical events. The unification of Egypt under the pharaohs, at the end of the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic Period]] around 3100 BC, made the king the focus of Egyptian religion, and thus the ideology of kingship became an important part of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes in Kramer 1961, pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of unification, gods that were once local patron deities gained national importance, forming new relationships that linked the local deities into a unified national tradition. [[Geraldine Pinch]] suggests that early myths may have formed from these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian sources link the mythical strife between the gods [[Horus]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]] with a conflict between the regions of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], which may have happened in the late Predynastic era or in the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]].&lt;ref name="Meltzer in Redford 119"&gt;Meltzer, Edmund S., "Horus", in Redford 2001, vol. II, pp. 119–122&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Horus and Set, portrayed together, often stand for the pairing of Upper and Lower Egypt, although either god can stand for either region. Both of them were patrons of cities in both halves of the country. The conflict between the two deities may allude to the presumed conflict that preceded the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt at the start of Egyptian history, or it may be tied to an apparent conflict between worshippers of Horus and Set near the end of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Meltzer in Redford 119"/&gt;|group="Note"}}

After these early times, most changes to mythology developed and adapted preexisting concepts rather than creating new ones, although there were exceptions.&lt;ref name="Bickel in Johnston 580"&gt;Bickel in Johnston 2003, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have suggested that the myth of the sun god withdrawing into the sky, leaving humans to fight among themselves, was inspired by the breakdown of royal authority and national unity at the end of the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686 BC&amp;nbsp;– 2181 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1070 BC), minor myths developed around deities like [[Yam (god)|Yam]] and [[Anat]] who had been adopted from [[Canaanite religion]]. In contrast, during the [[Ptolemaic Period|Greek]] and [[Roman Egypt|Roman]] eras (332 BC–641 AD), Greco-Roman culture had little influence on Egyptian mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Meeks and Favard-Meeks 1996, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and scope==
Scholars have difficulty defining which ancient Egyptian beliefs are [[myth]]s. The basic definition of myth suggested by the Egyptologist [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]] is "a sacred or culturally central [[narrative]]". In Egypt, the narratives that are central to culture and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]] are almost entirely about events among the [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Baines, in Loprieno 1996, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Actual narratives about the gods' actions are rare in Egyptian texts, particularly from early periods, and most references to such events are mere mentions or allusions. Some Egyptologists, like Baines, argue that narratives complete enough to be called "myths" existed in all periods, but that Egyptian tradition did not favor writing them down. Others, like [[Jan Assmann]], have said that true myths were rare in Egypt and may only have emerged partway through its history, developing out of the fragments of narration that appear in the earliest writings.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1991, pp. 81–85, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, Vincent Arieh Tobin&lt;ref name="Tobin in Redford 464"&gt;Tobin, Vincent Arieh, "Myths: An Overview", in Redford 2001, vol. II, pp. 464–468&lt;/ref&gt; and Susanne Bickel have suggested that lengthy narration was not needed in Egyptian mythology because of its complex and flexible nature.&lt;ref name="Bickel in Johnston 578"&gt;Bickel in Johnston 2003, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; Tobin argues that narrative is even alien to myth, because narratives tend to form a simple and fixed perspective on the events they describe. If narration is not needed for myth, any statement that conveys an idea about the nature or actions of a god can be called "mythic".&lt;ref name="Tobin in Redford 464"/&gt;

==Content and meaning==
Like myths in many other cultures, Egyptian myths serve to justify human traditions and to address fundamental questions about the world,&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; such as the nature of disorder and the [[ultimate fate of the universe]].&lt;ref name="Bickel in Johnston 580"/&gt; The Egyptians explained these profound issues through statements about the gods.&lt;ref name="Bickel in Johnston 578"/&gt;

Egyptian deities represent natural phenomena, from physical objects like the earth or the sun to abstract forces like knowledge and creativity. The actions and interactions of the gods, the Egyptians believed, govern the behavior of all of these forces and elements.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, the Egyptians did not describe these mysterious processes in explicit [[theology|theological]] writings. Instead, the relationships and interactions of the gods illustrated such processes implicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 107–112&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Egypt's gods, including many of the major ones, do not have significant roles in mythic narratives,&lt;ref name="Tobin 1989, pp. 38–39"&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; although their nature and relationships with other deities are often established in lists or bare statements without narration.&lt;ref name="Baines 100"&gt;Baines 1991, pp. 100–104&lt;/ref&gt; For the gods who are deeply involved in narratives, mythic events are very important expressions of their roles in the cosmos. Therefore, if only narratives are myths, mythology is a major element in Egyptian religious understanding, but not as essential as it is in many other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1991, pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nut1.JPG|thumb|The sky depicted as a cow goddess supported by other deities. This image combines several coexisting visions of the sky: as a roof, as the surface of a sea, as a cow, and as a goddess in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes in Kramer 1961, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The true realm of the gods is mysterious and inaccessible to humans. Mythological stories use symbolism to make the events in this realm comprehensible.&lt;ref name="Tobin 23"&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 18, 23–26&lt;/ref&gt; Not every detail of a mythic account has symbolic significance. Some images and incidents, even in religious texts, are meant simply as visual or dramatic embellishments of broader, more meaningful myths.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin 1989, pp. 48–49"&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Few complete stories appear in Egyptian mythological sources. These sources often contain nothing more than allusions to the events to which they relate, and texts that contain actual narratives tell only portions of a larger story. Thus, for any given myth the Egyptians may have had only the general outlines of a story, from which fragments describing particular incidents were drawn.&lt;ref name="Tobin 1989, pp. 38–39"/&gt; Moreover, the gods are not well-defined characters, and the motivations for their sometimes inconsistent actions are rarely given.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian myths are not, therefore, fully developed tales. Their importance lay in their underlying meaning, not their characteristics as stories. Instead of coalescing into lengthy, fixed narratives, they remained highly flexible and non-[[dogma]]tic.&lt;ref name="Tobin 23"/&gt;

So flexible were Egyptian myths that they could seemingly conflict with each other. Many descriptions of the creation of the world and the movements of the sun occur in Egyptian texts, some very different from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung 1992, pp. 41–45, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships between gods were fluid, so that, for instance, the goddess [[Hathor]] could be called the mother, wife, or daughter of the sun god [[Ra]].&lt;ref&gt;Vischak, Deborah, "Hathor", in Redford 2001, vol. II, pp.82–85&lt;/ref&gt; Separate deities could even be [[syncretized]], or linked, as a single being. Thus the creator god [[Atum]] was combined with Ra to form Ra-Atum.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes in Kramer 1961, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

One commonly suggested reason for inconsistencies in myth is that religious ideas differed over time and in different regions.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1989, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The local [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] of various deities developed theologies centered on their own patron gods.&lt;ref&gt;Traunecker 2001, pp. 101–103&lt;/ref&gt; As the influence of different cults shifted, some mythological systems attained national dominance. In the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181 BC) the most important of these systems was the cults of Ra and Atum, centered at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. They formed a mythical family, the [[Ennead]], that was said to have created the world. It included the most important deities of the time but gave primacy to Atum and Ra.&lt;ref&gt;David 2002, pp. 28, 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians also overlaid old religious ideas with new ones. For instance, the god [[Ptah]], whose cult was centered at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], was also said to be the creator of the world. Ptah's creation myth incorporates older myths by saying that it is the Ennead who carry out Ptah's creative commands.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes in Kramer 1960, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the myth makes Ptah older and greater than the Ennead. Many scholars have seen this myth as a political attempt to assert the superiority of Memphis' god over those of Heliopolis.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1989, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; By combining concepts in this way, the Egyptians produced an immensely complicated set of deities and myths.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptologists in the early twentieth century thought that politically motivated changes like these were the principal reason for the contradictory imagery in Egyptian myth. However, in the 1940s, [[Henri Frankfort]], realizing the symbolic nature of Egyptian mythology, argued that apparently contradictory ideas are part of the "multiplicity of approaches" that the Egyptians used to understand the divine realm. Frankfort's arguments are the basis for much of the more recent analysis of Egyptian beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Traunecker 2001, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Political changes affected Egyptian beliefs, but the ideas that emerged through those changes also have deeper meaning. Multiple versions of the same myth express different aspects of the same phenomenon; different gods that behave in a similar way reflect the close connections between natural forces. The varying symbols of Egyptian mythology express ideas too complex to be seen through a single lens.&lt;ref name="Tobin 23"/&gt;

==Sources==
The sources that are available range from solemn hymns to entertaining stories. Without a single, canonical version of any myth, the Egyptians adapted the broad traditions of myth to fit the varied purposes of their writings.&lt;ref name="Traunecker 1"&gt;Traunecker 2001, pp. 1–5&lt;/ref&gt; Most Egyptians were illiterate and may therefore have had an elaborate [[oral tradition]] that transmitted myths through spoken storytelling. Susanne Bickel suggests that the existence of this tradition helps explain why many texts related to myth give little detail: the myths were already known to every Egyptian.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel in Johnston 2003, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Very little evidence of this oral tradition has survived, and modern knowledge of Egyptian myths is drawn from written and pictorial sources. Only a small proportion of these sources has survived to the present, so much of the mythological information that was once written down has been lost.&lt;ref name="Baines 100"/&gt; This information is not equally abundant in all periods, so the beliefs that Egyptians held in some eras of their history are more poorly understood than the beliefs in better documented times.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1991, pp. 84, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious sources===
Many gods appear in artwork from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]] of [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt's history]] (c. 3100–2686 BC), but little about the gods' actions can be gleaned from these sources because they include minimal writing. The Egyptians began using writing more extensively in the Old Kingdom, in which appeared the first major source of Egyptian mythology: the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]''. These texts are a collection of several hundred incantations inscribed in the interiors of [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] beginning in the 24th century BC. They were the first [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|Egyptian funerary texts]], intended to ensure that the kings buried in the pyramid would pass safely through the afterlife. Many of the incantations allude to myths related to the afterlife, including [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]] and the [[Osiris myth|myth of Osiris]]. Many of the texts are likely much older than their first known written copies, and they therefore provide clues about the early stages of Egyptian religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 6–11&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181–2055 BC), the ''Pyramid Texts'' developed into the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', which contain similar material and were available to non-royals. Succeeding funerary texts, like the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' in the New Kingdom and the ''[[Books of Breathing]]'' from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (664–323 BC) and after, developed out of these earlier collections. The New Kingdom also saw the development of another type of funerary text, containing detailed and cohesive descriptions of the nocturnal journey of the sun god. Texts of this type include the ''[[Amduat]]'', the ''[[Book of Gates]]'', and the ''[[Book of Caverns]]''.&lt;ref name="Traunecker 1"/&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Gaspa - Dendara, tempio di Hator (56).jpg|thumb|right|Temple decoration at [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]], depicting the goddesses Isis and [[Nephthys]] watching over the corpse of their brother [[Osiris]]]]

[[Egyptian temple|Temple]]s, whose surviving remains date mostly from the New Kingdom and later, are another important source of myth. Many temples had a ''per-ankh'', or temple library, storing [[papyrus|papyri]] for rituals and other uses. Some of these papyri contain hymns, which, in praising a god for its actions, often refer to the myths that define those actions. Other temple papyri describe rituals, many of which are based partly on myth.&lt;ref&gt;Morenz 1971, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered remnants of these papyrus collections have survived to the present. It is possible that the collections included more systematic records of myths, but no evidence of such texts has survived.&lt;ref name="Baines 100"/&gt; Mythological texts and illustrations, similar to those on temple papyri, also appear in the decoration of the temple buildings. The elaborately decorated and well-preserved temples of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman]] periods (305 BC–AD 380) are an especially rich source of myth.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians also performed rituals for personal goals such as protection from or healing of illness. These rituals are often called "magical" rather than religious, but they were believed to work on the same principles as temple ceremonies, evoking mythical events as the basis for the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Ritner 1993, pp. 243–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Information from religious sources is limited by a system of traditional restrictions on what they could describe and depict. The murder of the god [[Osiris]], for instance, is never explicitly described in Egyptian writings.&lt;ref name="Baines 100"/&gt; The Egyptians believed that words and images could affect reality, so they avoided the risk of making such negative events real.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] were also poorly suited for portraying whole narratives, so most myth-related artwork consists of sparse individual scenes.&lt;ref name="Baines 100"/&gt;

===Other sources===
References to myth also appear in non-religious [[Ancient Egyptian literature|Egyptian literature]], beginning in the Middle Kingdom. Many of these references are mere allusions to mythic motifs, but several stories are based entirely on mythic narratives. These more direct renderings of myth are particularly common in the Late and Greco-Roman periods when, according to scholars such as Heike Sternberg, Egyptian myths reached their most fully developed state.&lt;ref name="Baines 365"&gt;Baines, in Loprieno 1996, pp. 365–376&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitudes toward myth in nonreligious Egyptian texts vary greatly. Some stories resemble the narratives from magical texts, while others are more clearly meant as entertainment and even contain humorous episodes.&lt;ref name="Baines 365"/&gt;

A final source of Egyptian myth is the writings of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers like [[Herodotus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]], who described Egyptian religion in the last centuries of its existence. Prominent among these writers is [[Plutarch]], whose work ''[[Moralia#De Iside et Osiride|De Iside et Osiride]]'' contains, among other things, the longest ancient account of the myth of Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 35, 39–42&lt;/ref&gt; These authors' knowledge of Egyptian religion was limited because they were excluded from many religious practices, and their statements about Egyptian beliefs are affected by their biases about Egypt's culture.&lt;ref name="Baines 100"/&gt;

==Cosmology==

===Maat===
{{main|Maat}}
The Egyptian word written ''m3ˁt,'' often rendered ''maat'' or ''ma'at,'' refers to the fundamental order of the universe in Egyptian belief. Established at the creation of the world, ''maat'' distinguishes the world from the [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] that preceded and surrounds it. ''Maat'' encompasses both the proper behavior of humans and the normal functioning of the forces of nature, both of which make life and happiness possible. Because the actions of the gods govern natural forces and myths express those actions, Egyptian mythology represents the proper functioning of the world and the sustenance of life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 79–82, 197–199&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Egyptians, the most important human maintainer of ''maat'' is the [[pharaoh]]. In myth the pharaoh is the son of a variety of deities. As such, he is their designated representative, obligated to maintain order in human society just as they do in nature, and to continue the rituals that sustain them and their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape of the world===
[[File:Geb, Nut, Shu.jpg|thumb|280px|The air god Shu, assisted by other gods, holds up Nut, the sky, as Geb, the earth, lies beneath.]]
In Egyptian belief, the disorder that predates the ordered world exists beyond the world as an infinite expanse of formless water, personified by the god [[Nu (mythology)|Nun]]. The earth, personified by the god [[Geb]], is a flat piece of land over which arches the sky, usually represented by the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]. The two are separated by the personification of air, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]]. The sun god [[Ra]] is said to travel through the sky, across the body of Nut, enlivening the world with his light. At night Ra passes beyond the western horizon into the [[Duat]], a mysterious region that borders the formlessness of Nun. At dawn he emerges from the Duat in the eastern horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1989, pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the sky and the location of the Duat are uncertain. Egyptian texts variously describe the nighttime sun as traveling beneath the earth and within the body of Nut. The Egyptologist [[James P. Allen]] believes that these explanations of the sun's movements are dissimilar but coexisting ideas. In Allen's view, Nut represents the visible surface of the waters of Nun, with the stars floating on this surface. The sun, therefore, sails across the water in a circle, each night passing beyond the horizon to reach the skies that arch beneath the inverted land of the Duat.&lt;ref name="Allen 25"&gt;Allen, James P., "The Egyptian Concept of the World", in O'Connor and Quirke 2003, pp. 25–29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard H. Lesko]], however, believes that the Egyptians saw the sky as a solid canopy and described the sun as traveling through the Duat above the surface of the sky, from west to east, during the night.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, in Shafer 1991, pp. 117–120&lt;/ref&gt; Joanne Conman, modifying Lesko's model, argues that this solid sky is a moving, concave dome overarching a deeply convex earth. The sun and the stars move along with this dome, and their passage below the horizon is simply their movement over areas of the earth that the Egyptians could not see. These regions would then be the Duat.&lt;ref&gt;Conman 2003, pp. 33–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The fertile lands of the Nile Valley ([[Upper Egypt]]) and [[Nile Delta|Delta]] ([[Lower Egypt]]) lie at the center of the world in Egyptian cosmology. Outside them are the infertile deserts, which are associated with the chaos that lies beyond the world.&lt;ref name="Meeks and Favard-Meeks 82"&gt;Meeks and Favard-Meeks 1994, pp. 82–88, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere beyond them is the horizon, the ''[[Akhet (hieroglyph and season)|akhet]]''. There, two mountains, in the east and the west, mark the places where the sun enters and exits the Duat.&lt;ref&gt;Lurker 1980, pp. 64–65, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign nations are associated with the hostile deserts in Egyptian ideology. Foreign people, likewise, are generally lumped in with the "[[nine bows]]", people who threaten pharaonic rule and the stability of ''maat'', although peoples allied with or subject to Egypt may be viewed more positively.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, David, "Egypt's View of 'Others'", in Tait 2003, pp. 155–156, 169–171&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, events in Egyptian mythology rarely take place in foreign lands. While some stories pertain to the sky or the Duat, Egypt itself is usually the scene for the actions of the gods. Often, even the myths set in Egypt seem to take place on a plane of existence separate from that inhabited by living humans, although in other stories, humans and gods interact. In either case, the Egyptian gods are deeply tied to their home land.&lt;ref name="Meeks and Favard-Meeks 82"/&gt;

===Time===
The Egyptians' vision of time was influenced by their environment. Each day the sun rose and set, bringing light to the land and regulating human activity; each year the [[flooding of the Nile|Nile flooded]], renewing the fertility of the soil and allowing the highly productive agriculture that sustained Egyptian civilization. These periodic events inspired the Egyptians to see all of time as a series of recurring patterns regulated by ''maat'', renewing the gods and the universe.&lt;ref name="David 2002, pp. 1–2"/&gt; Although the Egyptians recognized that different historical eras differ in their particulars, mythic patterns dominate the Egyptian perception of history.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung 1992, pp. 151–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Egyptian stories about the gods are characterized as having taken place in a primeval time when the gods were manifest on the earth and ruled over it. After this time, the Egyptians believed, authority on earth passed to human pharaohs.&lt;ref name="Pinch 2004, p. 85"&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; This primeval era seems to predate the start of the sun's journey and the recurring patterns of the present world. At the other end of time is the end of the cycles and the dissolution of the world. Because these distant periods lend themselves to linear narrative better than the cycles of the present, [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]] sees them as the only periods in which true myths take place.&lt;ref name="Baines 364"&gt;Baines, in Loprieno 1996, pp. 364–365&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, to some extent, the cyclical aspect of time was present in the mythic past as well. Egyptians saw even stories that were set in that time as being perpetually true. The myths were made real every time the events to which they were related occurred. These events were celebrated with rituals, which often evoked myths.&lt;ref name="Tobin 27"&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 27–31&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual allowed time to [[eternal return (Eliade)|periodically return]] to the mythic past and renew life in the universe.&lt;ref name="Assmann 77"&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 77–80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major myths==
Some of the most important categories of myths are described below. Because of the fragmentary nature of Egyptian myths, there is little indication in Egyptian sources of a chronological sequence of mythical events.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the categories are arranged in a very loose chronological order.

===Creation===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian creation myths}}
Among the most important myths were those describing the creation of the world. The Egyptian developed many accounts of the creation, which differ greatly in the events they describe. In particular, the deities credited with creating the world vary in each account. This difference partly reflects the desire of Egypt's cities and priesthoods to exalt their own patron gods by attributing creation to them. Yet the differing accounts were not regarded as contradictory; instead, the Egyptians saw the creation process as having many aspects and involving many divine forces.&lt;ref&gt;David 2002, pp. 81, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sunrise at Creation.jpg|thumb|right|The sun rises over the circular mound of creation as goddesses pour out the primeval waters around it]]
One common feature of the myths is the emergence of the world from the waters of chaos that surround it. This event represents the establishment of ''maat'' and the origin of life. One fragmentary tradition centers on the eight gods of the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], who represent the characteristics of the primeval water itself. Their actions give rise to the sun (represented in creation myths by various gods, especially Ra), whose birth forms a space of light and dryness within the dark water.&lt;ref&gt;Dunand and Zivie-Coche 2005, pp. 45–50&lt;/ref&gt; The sun rises from the first mound of dry land, another common motif in the creation myths, which was likely inspired by the sight of mounds of earth emerging as the Nile flood receded. With the emergence of the sun god, the establisher of ''maat'', the world has its first ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Meeks and Favard-Meeks, pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts from the first millennium BC focus on the actions of the creator god in subduing the forces of chaos that threaten the newly ordered world.&lt;ref name="Bickel in Johnston 580"/&gt;

[[Atum]], a god closely connected with the sun and the primeval mound, is the focus of a creation myth dating back at least to the Old Kingdom. Atum, who incorporates all the elements of the world, exists within the waters as a potential being. At the time of creation he emerges to produce other gods, resulting in a set of nine deities, the [[Ennead]], which includes Geb, Nut, and other key elements of the world. The Ennead can by extension stand for all the gods, so its creation represents the differentiation of Atum's unified potential being into the multiplicity of elements present within the world.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1989, pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the Egyptians developed more abstract perspectives on the creation process. By the time of the ''Coffin Texts'', they described the formation of the world as the realization of a concept first developed within the mind of the creator god. The force of ''[[Heka (god)|heka]]'', or magic, which links things in the divine realm and things in the physical world, is the power that links the creator's original concept with its physical realization. ''Heka'' itself can be personified as a god, but this intellectual process of creation is not associated with that god alone. An inscription from the [[Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070–664 BC), whose text may be much older, describes the process in detail and attributes it to the god [[Ptah]], whose close association with craftsmen makes him a suitable deity to give a physical form to the original creative vision. Hymns from the New Kingdom describe the god [[Amun]], a mysterious power that lies behind even the other gods, as the ultimate source of this creative vision.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1989, pp. 36–42, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of humans is not a major feature of Egyptian creation stories. In some texts the first humans spring from tears that Ra-Atum or his feminine aspect, the [[Eye of Ra]], sheds in a moment of weakness and distress, foreshadowing humans' flawed nature and sorrowful lives. Others say humans are molded from clay by the god [[Khnum]]. But overall, the focus of the creation myths is the establishment of cosmic order rather than the special place of humans within it.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

===The reign of the sun god===
In the period of the mythic past after the creation, Ra dwells on earth as king of the gods and of humans. This period is the closest thing to a [[golden age]] in Egyptian tradition, the period of stability that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of ''maat''.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode known in different versions from temple texts, some of the gods defy Ra's authority, and he destroys them with the help and advice of other gods like [[Thoth]] and [[Horus#Heru-ur (Horus the Elder)|Horus the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;Meeks and Favard-Meeks 1994, pp. 22–25&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Horus the Elder is often treated as a separate deity from Horus, the child born to Isis.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} At one point he faces dissent even from an extension of himself, the Eye of Ra, which can act independently of him in the form of a goddess. The Eye goddess becomes angry with Ra and runs away from him, wandering wild and dangerous in the lands outside Egypt. Weakened by her absence, Ra sends one of the other gods—Shu, [[Thoth]], or [[Anhur]], in different accounts—to retrieve her, by force or persuasion. Because the Eye of Ra is associated with the star [[Sothis]], whose [[heliacal rising]] signaled the start of the Nile flood, the return of the Eye goddess to Egypt coincides with the life-giving inundation. Upon her return, the goddess becomes the consort of Ra or of the god who has retrieved her. Her pacification restores order and renews life.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ra grows older and weaker, humanity, too, turns against him. In an episode often called "The Destruction of Mankind", related in ''[[The Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'', Ra discovers that humanity is plotting rebellion against him and sends his Eye to punish them. She slays many people, but Ra apparently decides that he does not want her to destroy all of humanity. He has beer dyed red to resemble blood and spreads it over the field. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, becomes drunk, and ceases her rampage. Ra then withdraws into the sky, weary of ruling on earth, and begins his daily journey through the heavens and the Duat. The surviving humans are dismayed, and they attack the people among them who plotted against Ra. This event is the origin of warfare, death, and humans' constant struggle to protect ''maat'' from the destructive actions of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 113–116&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Book of the Heavenly Cow'', the results of the destruction of mankind seem to mark the end of the direct reign of the gods and of the linear time of myth. The beginning of Ra's journey is the beginning of the cyclical time of the present.&lt;ref name="Baines 364"/&gt; Yet in other sources, mythic time continues after this change. Egyptian accounts give sequences of divine rulers who take the place of the sun god as king on earth, each reigning for many thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Uphill, E. P., "The Ancient Egyptian View of World History", in Tait 2003, pp. 17–26&lt;/ref&gt; Although accounts differ as to which gods reigned and in what order, the succession from Ra-Atum to his descendants Shu and Geb—in which the kingship passes to the male in each generation of the Ennead—is common. Both of them face revolts that parallel those in the reign of the sun god, but the revolt that receives the most attention in Egyptian sources is the one in the reign of Geb's heir [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osiris myth===
{{main|Osiris myth}}
The collection of episodes surrounding [[Osiris]]' death and succession is the most elaborate of all Egyptian myths, and it had the most widespread influence in Egyptian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In the first portion of the myth, Osiris, who is associated with both fertility and kingship, is killed and his position usurped by his brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]]. In some versions of the myth, Osiris is actually dismembered and the pieces of his corpse scattered across Egypt. Osiris' sister and wife, [[Isis]], finds her husband's body and restores it to wholeness.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pp. 30–33&lt;/ref&gt; She is assisted by funerary deities such as [[Nephthys]] and [[Anubis]], and the process of Osiris' restoration reflects Egyptian [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|traditions of embalming and burial]]. Isis then briefly revives Osiris to conceive an heir with him: the god [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hermitage Egyptian statuettes.jpg|thumb|right|Statues of Osiris and of Isis nursing the infant Horus]]
The next portion of the myth concerns Horus' birth and childhood. Isis gives birth to and raises her son in secluded places, hidden from the menace of Set. The episodes in this phase of the myth concern Isis' efforts to protect her son from Set or other hostile beings, or to heal him from sickness or injury. In these episodes Isis is the epitome of maternal devotion and a powerful practitioner of healing magic.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 131–134&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third phase of the story, Horus competes with Set for the kingship. Their struggle encompasses a great number of separate episodes and ranges in character from violent conflict to a legal judgment by the assembled gods.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; In one important episode, Set tears out one or both of Horus' eyes, which are later restored by the healing efforts of Thoth or Hathor. For this reason, the [[Eye of Horus]] is a prominent symbol of life and well-being in Egyptian iconography. Because Horus is a sky god, with one eye equated with the sun and the other with the moon, the destruction and restoration of the single eye explains why the moon is less bright than the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Kaper, Olaf E., "Myths: Lunar Cycle", in Redford 2001, vol. II, pp. 480–482&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts present two different resolutions for the divine contest: one in which Egypt is divided between the two claimants, and another in which Horus becomes sole ruler. In the latter version, the ascension of Horus, Osiris' rightful heir, symbolizes the reestablishment of ''maat'' after the unrighteous rule of Set. With order restored, Horus can perform the funerary rites for his father that are his duty as son and heir. Through this service Osiris is given new life in the Duat, whose ruler he becomes. The relationship between Osiris as king of the dead and Horus as king of the living stands for the relationship between every king and his deceased predecessors. Osiris, meanwhile, represents the regeneration of life. On earth he is credited with the annual growth of crops, and in the Duat he is involved in the rebirth of the sun and of deceased human souls.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 129, 141–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Horus to some extent represents any living pharaoh, he is not the end of the lineage of ruling gods. He is succeeded first by gods and then by spirits that represent dim memories of Egypt's Predynastic rulers, the [[souls of Nekhen and Pe]]. They link the entirely mythical rulers to the final part of the sequence, the lineage of Egypt's historical kings.&lt;ref name="Pinch 2004, p. 85"/&gt;

===Birth of the royal child===
Several disparate Egyptian texts address a similar theme: the birth of a divinely fathered child who is heir to the kingship. The earliest known appearance of such a story does not appear to be a myth but an entertaining folktale, found in the Middle Kingdom [[Westcar Papyrus]], about the birth of the first three kings of Egypt's [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]]. In that story, the three kings are the offspring of Ra and a human woman. The same theme appears in a firmly religious context in the New Kingdom, when the rulers [[Hatshepsut]], [[Amenhotep III]], and [[Ramesses II]] depicted in temple reliefs their own conception and birth, in which the god [[Amun]] is the father and the historical queen the mother. By stating that the king originated among the gods and was deliberately created by the most important god of the period, the story gives a mythical background to the king's coronation, which appears alongside the birth story. The divine connection legitimizes the king's rule and provides a rationale for his role as intercessor between gods and humans.&lt;ref name="Assmann 116"&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar scenes appear in many post-New Kingdom temples, but this time the events they depict involve the gods alone. In this period, most temples were dedicated to a mythical family of deities, usually a father, mother, and son. In these versions of the story, the birth is that of the son in each triad.&lt;ref&gt;Feucht, Erika, "Birth", in Redford 2001, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these child gods is the heir to the throne, who will restore stability to the country. This shift in focus from the human king to the gods who are associated with him reflects a decline in the status of the pharaoh in the late stages of Egyptian history.&lt;ref name="Assmann 116"/&gt;

===The journey of the sun===
[[Ra|Ra's]] movements through the sky and the Duat are not fully narrated in Egyptian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Baines in Loprieno 1996, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; although funerary texts like the ''[[Amduat]]'', ''[[Book of Gates]]'', and ''[[Book of Caverns]]'' relate the nighttime half of the journey in sequences of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung 1992, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This journey is key to Ra's nature and to the sustenance of all life.&lt;ref name="Tobin 1989, pp. 48–49"/&gt;

In traveling across the sky, Ra brings light to the earth, sustaining all things that live there. He reaches the peak of his strength at noon and then ages and weakens as he moves toward sunset. In the evening, Ra takes the form of Atum, the creator god, oldest of all things in the world. According to early Egyptian texts, at the end of the day he spits out all the other deities, whom he devoured at sunrise. Here they represent the stars, and the story explains why the stars are visible at night and seemingly absent during the day.&lt;ref name="Pinch 91"&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

At sunset Ra passes through the ''akhet'', the horizon, in the west. At times the horizon is described as a gate or door that leads to the Duat. At others, the sky goddess Nut is said to swallow the sun god, so that his journey through the Duat is likened to a journey through her body.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung 1992, pp. 96–97, 113&lt;/ref&gt; In funerary texts, the Duat and the deities in it are portrayed in elaborate, detailed, and widely varying imagery. These images are symbolic of the awesome and enigmatic nature of the Duat, where both the gods and the dead are renewed by contact with the original powers of creation. Indeed, although Egyptian texts avoid saying it explicitly, Ra's entry into the Duat is seen as his death.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 49, 136–138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book of Gates Barque of Ra cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Ra]] (at center) travels through the underworld in his [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]], accompanied by other gods&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2004, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Certain themes appear repeatedly in depictions of the journey. Ra overcomes numerous obstacles in his course, representative of the effort necessary to maintain ''maat''. The greatest challenge is the opposition of [[Apep]], a serpent god who represents the destructive aspect of disorder, and who threatens to destroy the sun god and plunge creation into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; In many of the texts, Ra overcomes these obstacles with the assistance of other deities who travel with him; they stand for various powers that are necessary to uphold Ra's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke 2001, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; In his passage Ra also brings light to the Duat, enlivening the blessed dead who dwell there. In contrast, his enemies—people who have undermined ''maat''—are tormented and thrown into dark pits or lakes of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung 1992, pp. 95, 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;

The key event in the journey is the meeting of Ra and Osiris. In the New Kingdom, this event developed into a complex symbol of the Egyptian conception of life and time. Osiris, relegated to the Duat, is like a mummified body within its tomb. Ra, endlessly moving, is like the ''ba'', or soul, of a deceased human, which may travel during the day but must return to its body each night. When Ra and Osiris meet, they merge into a single being. Their pairing reflects the Egyptian vision of time as a continuous repeating pattern, with one member (Osiris) being always static and the other (Ra) living in a constant cycle. Once he has united with Osiris' regenerative power, Ra continues on his journey with renewed vitality.&lt;ref name="Assmann 77"/&gt; This renewal makes possible Ra's emergence at dawn, which is seen as the rebirth of the sun—expressed by a metaphor in which Nut gives birth to Ra after she has swallowed him—and the repetition of the first sunrise at the moment of creation. At this moment, the rising sun god swallows the stars once more, absorbing their power.&lt;ref name="Pinch 91"/&gt; In this revitalized state, Ra is depicted as a child or as the [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]] god [[Khepri]], both of which represent rebirth in Egyptian iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pp. 57, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the universe===
Egyptian texts typically treat the dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. However, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles of renewal, is destined to end. This end is described in a passage in the ''Coffin Texts'' and a more explicit one in the ''Book of the Dead'', in which Atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. All things other than the creator will cease to exist, except Osiris, who will survive along with him.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung 1982, pp. 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; Details about this [[eschatology|eschatological]] prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Dunand and Zivie-Coche 2005, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; Yet with the creator god and the god of renewal together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there is the potential for a new creation to arise in the same manner as the old.&lt;ref&gt;Meeks and Favard-Meeks 1996, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in Egyptian culture==

===In religion===
[[File:SethAndHorusAdoringRamsses crop.jpg|thumb|right|Set and Horus support the pharaoh. The reconciled rival gods often stand for the unity of Egypt under the rule of its king.&lt;ref&gt;te Velde, Herman, "Seth", in Redford 2001, vol. III, pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Because the Egyptians rarely described theological ideas explicitly, the implicit ideas of mythology formed much of the basis for Egyptian religion. The purpose of Egyptian religion was the maintenance of ''maat'', and the concepts that myths express were believed to be essential to ''maat''. The rituals of Egyptian religion were meant to make the mythic events, and the concepts they represented, real once more, thereby renewing ''maat''.&lt;ref name="Tobin 27"/&gt; The rituals were believed to achieve this effect through the force of ''heka'', the same connection between the physical and divine realms that enabled the original creation.&lt;ref&gt;Ritner 1993, pp. 246–249&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, Egyptian rituals often included actions that symbolized mythical events.&lt;ref name="Tobin 27"/&gt; Temple rites included the destruction of models representing malign gods like Set or Apophis, private magical spells called upon Isis to heal the sick as she did for Horus,&lt;ref&gt;Ritner 1993, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; and funerary rites such as the [[Opening of the Mouth]] ceremony&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Ann Macy, "Opening of the Mouth" in Redford 2001, vol. II, pp. 605–608&lt;/ref&gt; and ritual offerings to the dead evoked the myth of Osiris' resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt; Yet rituals rarely, if ever, involved [[drama]]tic reenactments of myths. There are borderline cases, like a ceremony alluding to the Osiris myth in which two women took on the roles of Isis and Nephthys, but scholars disagree about whether these performances formed sequences of events.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rourke, Paul F., "Drama", in Redford 2001, vol. I, pp. 407–409&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Egyptian ritual was focused on more basic activities like giving offerings to the gods, with mythic themes serving as ideological background rather than as the focus of a rite.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1991, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, myth and ritual strongly influenced each other. Myths could inspire rituals, like the ceremony with Isis and Nephthys; and rituals that did not originally have a mythic meaning could be reinterpreted as having one, as in the case of offering ceremonies, in which food and other items given to the gods or the dead were equated with the Eye of Horus.&lt;ref&gt;Morenz 1973, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingship was a key element of Egyptian religion, through the king's role as link between humanity and the gods. Myths explain the background for this connection between royalty and divinity. The myths about the Ennead establish the king as heir to the lineage of rulers reaching back to the creator; the myth of divine birth states that the king is the son and heir of a god; and the myths about Osiris and Horus emphasize that rightful succession to the throne is essential to the maintenance of ''maat''. Thus, mythology provided the rationale for the very nature of Egyptian government.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin 1989, pp. 90–95&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
{{further|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Hidden treasures 19.jpg|thumb|right|Funerary amulet in the shape of a scarab]]
Illustrations of gods and mythical events appear extensively alongside religious writing in tombs, temples, and funerary texts.&lt;ref name="Traunecker 1"/&gt; Mythological scenes in Egyptian artwork are rarely placed in sequence as a narrative, but individual scenes, particularly depicting the resurrection of Osiris, do sometimes appear in religious artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1991, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Allusions to myth were very widespread in Egyptian art and architecture. In temple design, the central path of the temple axis was likened to the sun god's path across the sky, and the sanctuary at the end of the path represented the place of creation from which he rose. Temple decoration was filled with solar emblems that underscored this relationship. Similarly, the corridors of tombs were linked with the god's journey through the Duat, and the burial chamber with the tomb of Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson 1992, pp. 27–29, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]], the best-known of all Egyptian architectural forms, may have been inspired by mythic symbolism, for it represented the mound of creation and the original sunrise, appropriate for a monument intended to assure the owner's rebirth after death.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke 2001, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols in Egyptian tradition were frequently reinterpreted, so that the meanings of mythical symbols could change and multiply over time like the myths themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson 1992, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

More ordinary works of art were also designed to evoke mythic themes, like the [[amulet]]s that Egyptians commonly wore to invoke divine powers. The [[Eye of Horus]], for instance, was a very common shape for [[apotropaic|protective]] amulets because it represented Horus' well-being after the restoration of his lost eye.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Carol A. R., "Amulets", in Redford 2001, vol. I, pp. 75–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scarab (artifact)|Scarab-shaped amulets]] symbolized the regeneration of life, referring to the god [[Khepri]], the form that the sun god was said to take at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Lurker 1980, pp. 74, 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
Themes and motifs from mythology appear frequently in Egyptian literature, even outside of religious writings. An early [[sebayt|instruction text]], the "[[Teaching for King Merykara]]" from the Middle Kingdom, contains a brief reference to a myth of some kind, possibly the Destruction of Mankind; the earliest known Egyptian short story, "[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]", incorporates ideas about the gods and the eventual dissolution of the world into a story set in the past. Some later stories take much of their plot from mythical events: "[[Tale of the Two Brothers]]" adapts parts of the Osiris myth into a fantastic story about ordinary people, and "[[The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood]]" transforms the conflict between Horus and Set into an allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Baines in Loprieno 1996, pp. 367–369, 373–374&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment of a text about the actions of Horus and Set dates to the Middle Kingdom, suggesting that stories about the gods arose in that era. Several texts of this type are known from the New Kingdom, and many more were written in the Late and Greco-Roman periods. Although these texts are more clearly derived from myth than those mentioned above, they still adapt the myths for non-religious purposes. "[[The Contendings of Horus and Seth]]", from the New Kingdom, tells the story of the conflict between the two gods, often with a humorous and seemingly irreverent tone. The Roman-era "Myth of the Eye of the Sun" incorporates fables into a framing story taken from myth. The goals of written fiction could also affect the narratives in magical texts, as with the New Kingdom story "[[Isis, the Rich Woman's Son, and the Fisherman's Wife]]", which conveys a moral message unconnected to its magical purpose. The variety of ways that these stories treat mythology demonstrates the wide range of purposes that myth could serve in Egyptian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Baines in Loprieno 1996, pp. 366, 371–373, 377&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7012">The '''Elmendorf Christian Community''', called '''Elmendorf Hutterite Colony''' by [[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|GAMEO]], is an independent [[Anabaptist]] community of [[Hutterite]] tradition. Even though the majority of the members are [[Ethnic Mennonite|ethnic Hutterites]], there are also members from different other backgrounds in the community. They are located in [[Mountain Lake Township, Cottonwood County, Minnesota|rural Mountain Lake, Minnesota]]. As of 2016 the ministers are Gary Wurtz  and Dwayne Wipf and the manager is Leanard Wurtz.

== History ==

The history of Elmendorf Christian Community goes back to the times of the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[Anabaptists]] under the leadership of [[Jakob Hutter]] established [[community of goods]] in [[Moravia]] in the 1530s. After a long and complicated [[Hutterite#History|history of migrations]] in [[Eastern Europe]], Hutterites arrived in America in 1874, forming three communities, that practiced community of goods, of which one was [[Bon Homme Hutterite Colony|Bon Homme Colony]], the mother colony of all [[Schmiedeleut]] Hutterites. Because of population growth, Hutterite colonies frequently branch out to form new colonies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Upland Hutterite Colony in [[Letcher, South Dakota]], branched out in 1994 to form the Elmendorf Community.&lt;ref name="GAMEO-EDC"/&gt; Upland had branched out of Spring Valley Hutterite Colony, located at [[Wessington Springs, South Dakota]] in 1988, Spring Valley had branched out of [[Platte, South Dakota]] in 1964, and Platte had branched out of Bon Homme in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bon_Homme_Hutterite_Colony_%28Tabor,_South_Dakota,_USA%29 ''Bon Homme Hutterite Colony (Tabor, South Dakota, USA)'' at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Elmendorf was excommunicated from [[Schmiedeleut]] affiliation with the Huttterites and became an independent colony. It was soon followed by Altona which was always in good standing with Elmendorf.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In 2006 Elmendorf Christian Community started a new community, named Detention River Christian Community, formerly known as [[Rocky Cape Christian Community]], between [[Smithton, Tasmania|Smithton]] and [[Wynyard, Tasmania|Wynyard]] on the [[Australia]]n island of [[Tasmania]]. In 2013/14 they started another new community, named Grand River, near the town of [[Jamesport, Missouri|Jamesport]] in Missouri.&lt;ref name="gallatinnorthmissourian.com"&gt;[http://gallatinnorthmissourian.com/2014/01/22/first-hutterite-colony-in-missouri-moves-here/#.Vj26O30VGZg ''First Hutterite Colony in Missouri Moves Here'' at The North Missourian]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs and belief ==

=== Belief ===

The doctrine of the Elmendorf Christian Community does not differ markedly from the doctrine of other [[Old Order Movement|Old Order]] or Conservative [[Anabaptists]]. Like other Hutterites, they believe in and practice [[Common ownership|community of goods]] and [[Nonconformity to the world|separate from the world]]. They "discourage speculation about end-time events, the restoration of Israel, the thousand-year reign, and the “rapture” of the children of God".&lt;ref name="elmendorfchristiancommunity.sharepoint.com"&gt;[https://elmendorfchristiancommunity.sharepoint.com/Pages/WhatweBelieve.aspx Elmendorf Christian Community: ''What We Believe and How We Live'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plain dress ===

They reject fashions of the world in clothing and hair styles and the wearing of jewellery. Women are expected to wear long hair and to keep it covered and not to wear trousers. Men and women are expected to dress in a "simple uniform way".&lt;ref name="elmendorfchristiancommunity.sharepoint.com"/&gt; In practice their Plain dress is similar to the dress of other Schmiedeleut Hutterites.

=== Restriction on technologies ===

Like other Hutterites they have only few restrictions on technology, they mainly forbid public television and do not have internet in private homes, but in a common computer room at the colony. They pool their ownership of cars because they live in a community of goods.&lt;ref name="GAMEO-EDC"&gt;[http://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Elmendorf_Hutterite_Colony_%28Mountain_Lake,_Minnesota,_USA%29 ''Elmendorf Hutterite Colony (Mountain Lake, Minnesota, USA)'' at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]&lt;/ref&gt; They operate their own website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elmendorfchristiancommunity.sharepoint.com/Pages/default.aspx Elmendorf Christian Community's own website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Openness to outsiders ===

The Elmendorf Christian Community is much more open to outsiders, so-called [[Seeker (Anabaptism)|seekers]], than all other Hutterite communities. They welcome all visitors for at least one visit but "subsequent visits of an extended or indefinite duration should be petitioned for and arranged."&lt;ref&gt;[https://elmendorfbelievers.com/ Elmendorf Christian Community: ''What We Believe and How We Live'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
They are affiliated with the Altona Christian Community at [[Henderson, Minnesota]] and with the [[Fort Pitt Farms Christian Community]]. Elmendorf branched out to form [[Rocky Cape Christian Community]] in Australia and Grand River Christian Community in [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://elmendorfchristiancommunity.sharepoint.com/Pages/Links.aspx Elmendorf Christian Community: ''Links to Christian communities'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrollpublishing.com/store/peterhoover-newsletters.html ''Peter Hoover’s Newsletters'' at scrollpublishing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
They do not belong to one of the four established ''Leut'' (branches) of [[Ethnic Mennonite#Controversy|ethnic Hutterites]] and therefore it is not totally clear if they should be seen as Hutterites. Sometimes Elmendorf and Altona are listed as independent Schmiedeleut colonies and Fort Pitt an independent [[Dariusleut]] colony, because this is where they originally came from.
 
The ''2016 Hutterite Directory'' of the James Valley Hutterite Colony lists Elemendorf along with Altona, Fort Pitt, Grand River and Rocky Cape as "Independent" Hutterites.  These same five "Independent" Hutterite colonies compose a group of Hutterites known as the [[Hutterite Christian Communities]], which Elmendorf is associated with.

== Population ==

In 2014 there were altogether some 170 people living in the two communities, Elmendorf and Grand River.&lt;ref name="gallatinnorthmissourian.com"/&gt; In 2016 there were some 160 people living in Elmendorf, some 50 in Grand River and some 25 in Rocky Cape.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The '''Executive Minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo''' ({{lang-fil|Tagapamahalang Pangkalahatan ng Iglesia ni Cristo}}) is the primary leader of the [[Philippine]]-based [[Christian denomination]], the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]].&lt;ref name=laidtorest&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dizon|first1=Nikko|title=Iglesia leader ‘Ka Erdy’ Manalo laid to rest|url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/eranomanalo/view.php?article=20090908-224140&amp;db=1|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=8 September 2009|quote=Also written on the marker (on Eraño Manalo's tomb) were the words: “Tagapamahalang Pangkalahatan ng Iglesia Ni Cristo mula 1963-2009 (Chief Minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo from 1963-2009).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been three Executive Ministers of the church since the Iglesia's founding in 1914 and all of them came from the Manalo family. The Executive Minister serves a [[life tenure]]. The Deputy Executive Minister assumes the duties of Executive Minister during the latter's absence and succeeds him when he (Executive Minister) dies or retires. For example, the current Executive Minister, Eduardo V. Manalo was elected Deputy Executive Minister by the INC District Ministers, also known as the Division Ministers in 1994.&lt;ref name=sfpost/&gt;

The Executive Minister along with Deputy Executive Minister and 11 other Senior Ministers (The ''Sanggunian'' or Church Economic Council) forms the Church's Central Administration.&lt;ref name=union&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mangahas|first1=Malou|last2=Olarte|first2=Avigail|title='A Most Powerful Union'|url=http://pcij.org/stories/2002/inc2.html|publisher=Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Spain}}
The '''Expulsion of the Moriscos''' ({{lang-es|Expulsión de los moriscos}}, {{lang-ca|Expulsió dels moriscos}}) was decreed  by [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III of Spain]] on April 9, 1609. The [[Morisco]]s were descendants of Spain's [[Muslim]] population that had [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|converted to Christianity]] by coercion or by Royal Decree in the early 16th century. Since the Spanish were fighting wars in the Americas, feeling threatened by the Turks raiding along the Spanish coast and by [[Morisco revolt|two Morisco revolts]] in the century since Islam was outlawed in Spain, it seems the expulsions were a reaction to an internal problem of the stretched Spanish Empire. &lt;ref&gt;Dwight Reynolds, speaking on 'Bettany Hughes:When the Moors Ruled in Europe'.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1609 through 1614, the Crown systematically expelled Moriscos through a number of decrees affecting Spain's various kingdoms, meeting varying levels of success.

Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre range between 275,000 and 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and actual success of the expulsion order in purging Spain of its Moriscos has been increasingly challenged by modern historians, starting with the seminal studies carried out by François Martinez (1999) and Trevor J. Dadson (2007). Dadson estimates that, out of a total Morisco population of 500,000, a figure accepted by many, around 40% avoided expulsion altogether and tens of thousands of those expelled managed to return.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.af/books?id=RtDCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=trevor+dadson+mill%C3%B3n+moriscos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ydsSW_zi66&amp;sig=nyJ7j2o0MPobhKIJY01NteAyy14&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7moGy4_bSAhWIA5oKHbpgAzYQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=million&amp;f=false|title=Tolerance and Coexistence in Early Modern Spain: Old Christians and Moriscos in the Campo de Calatrava|first=Trevor J.|last=Dadson|date=15 October 2018|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibliotecaspublicas.es"&gt;Trevor J. Dadson:  [http://www.bibliotecaspublicas.es/villarrubiadelosojos/imagenes/Dadson_Assimilation_Reality_or_Fiction.pdf ''The Assimilation of Spain's Moriscos: Fiction or Reality?''].

As a result, this region implemented the expulsion most severely and successfully, leading to the economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory and aggravated by the bubonic plague which hit Valencia only a few years later.

While some Moriscos did hold influence and power, and even had positions in the clergy, others, particularly in Valencia and Aragon, were a source of cheap labour for the local nobility. Where sectarian conflict existed, old Christian communities suspected the Moriscos of not being sincere in their Christianity. The Moors who remained Muslims were known as [[Mudéjar]].&lt;ref name="Coles2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coles|first=Kimberly Anne|title=The Cultural Politics of Blood, 1500-1900|date=27 January 2015|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|language=English |isbn=9781137338211|page=6|quote=After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, and the forcible conversion of those who remained, Spanish society consisted nominally of Christians and ''mudéjars''--Moors who lived under Christian rule but who did not convert.

Several revolts broke out, the most notable being the [[Morisco Revolt|1568&amp;ndash;1573 revolt]] against an edict of Phillip II's banning [[Arabic]], Arabic names, and requiring Moriscos to give up their children to be educated by priests.  After the suppression of the revolt,  Philip ordered the dispersal of the Moriscos of [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] to other areas. Philip expected that this would break down the Morisco community and facilitate their assimilation into the rest of the Christian population.  This may have happened to a degree to Granada's Moriscos, but not in Valencia or Aragon, where Islam was still widely practised and ethnic tensions were much higher than in the rest of Spain.&lt;ref name="lyn44"&gt;Lynch, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, Spain recognized the loss of more than half of its holdings in the Low Countries to the Protestant [[Dutch Republic]].  The ruling class already thought of Spain as the defender of Catholic Christendom, and this defeat helped lead to a radicalization of thinking and a desire to strike a blow to regain Spain's honor.&lt;ref name="lyn43"&gt;Lynch, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critiques of Spain from Protestant countries included insults of the Spanish as corrupted by the Muslims and crypto-Muslims amongst them, which some of the nobility may have taken personally.

The situation further deteriorated in the early 17th century.  A recession struck in 1604 as the amount of gold and treasure from [[Spanish Empire|Spain's American holdings]] fell.  The reduction in the standard of living led to increased tension between the Moriscos and Old Christians for precious jobs.&lt;ref name="lyn43" /&gt;

==Attitudes toward the Moriscos by region==


The number of Moriscos in Spain at the time of expulsion is unknown and most estimates are based on the numbers of Moriscos who were expelled. Figures of between 300,000 and 400,000 are often cited. However, modern studies estimate between 500,000 and one million moriscos present in Spain at the beginning of the 17th century out of a total population of 8.5 million.&lt;ref name="Stallaert, C. 1998"&gt;Stallaert, C. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=VL3t5uEW6nsC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=stallaert+moriscos+un+mill%C3%B3n&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ov3U_TICPv&amp;sig=ws6nqGn3yo7WTIydyVBtVavQwRs&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs2rahnNjNAhWHuhQKHUrhAjwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=stallaert+moriscos+un+mill%C3%B3n&amp;f=false|title=Etnogénesis y etnicidad en España: una aproximación histórico-antropológica al casticismo|first=Christiane|last=Stallaert|date=15 October 1998|publisher=Anthropos Editorial|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
A significant proportion resided in the former [[Crown of Aragon]], where it is estimated they constituted 20% of the population, and the [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] area specifically, where they were 33% of the total population. The rich and those who lived in the cities were mostly Christians, while the Moriscos occupied the outlying countryside and the poor suburbs of the cities.&lt;ref name="lyn45"&gt;Lynch, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown of Castile===

In the [[Crown of Castile]], which included the [[Guadalquivir]] valley in present Andalusia, the situation was considerably different. Overall, the proportion of Moriscos is considered to be lower but more significantly, the majority of them were former Mudejar (Muslims) Christians who were highly integrated in mainstream society, had abandoned many of their distinguishing cultural traits and crucially, unlike in Valencia, they did not suffer from hostility from their old-Christian neighbours, many of whom actively protected them from attempts by the Crown to expel them, to the point that in Plasencia the Crown officials sent to deport the Moriscos were immediately jailed upon arrival and in Avila the local Moriscos were integrated in the clergy and government positions to avoid expulsion. 

At the time however, an additional Morisco community co-existed with these Mudejar Moriscos: a large number of Granada Moriscos who had been deported or dispersed after the uprising and war of the Alpujarras, who were the target of more suspicion within the communities in which they settled. Local sympathies for Moriscos meant that Castile and Andalusia experienced only half-hearted efforts at identifying and expelling them. The expulsion was slower and a far less thorough process than in the Crown of Aragon and particularly Valencia and a significant portion of Moriscos - according to Dadson a majority - either avoided expulsion or returned in the years following expulsion.&lt;ref name="lyn44" /&gt;

===Crown of Aragon===

In the kingdom of Valencia, which held the bulk of the Morisco population in the Crown of Aragón, the situation was radically different to Castile. Valencian moriscos were the overwhelming majority of the landless peasantry and lived segregated from Christian populations. Economic and social rivalry was a major driver of resentment towards the them, particularly from the Middle classes of artisans.&lt;ref name="lyn44" /&gt;  This had boiled over before in 1520, when in the [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]], the artisan guilds of Valencia revolted against both the landed aristocracy and the Muslim [[mudéjar]] peasantry. Although the rebellion was ultimately defeated in 1523, the rebels killed many, and forced the mass [[baptism]] and [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] of the remainder of the Muslim population. In 1525, these forced conversions were upheld by King Charles, thus creating the Moriscos of Valencia. The plight of the Valencian Moriscos was the worst during the expulsion due to the long-standing hostility of their Christian neighbors.

There was practically universal agreement in Spain that Islam was a threat that should be crushed.  However, it was not clear how that should apply to the Moriscos, who were officially Christian.  Some clerics such as Fray Luis de Aliaga, a royal councilor, supported giving time to the Moriscos to assimilate and become full Christians.&lt;ref name="lyn44" /&gt;  This option was lightly supported by the Catholic Church in Rome, too.  The most dedicated defenders of the Moriscos were the Valencian and Aragonese nobility, as their self-interest was involved.  These nobles benefited the most from the poor and cheap workforce that the Moriscos provided.

Opposing this view were a variety of notables and classes of people.  Clerics against Aliaga included [[Jaime Bleda]], the most prominent member of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] in Valencia.  Bleda made several early proposals to [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] to banish or otherwise end the Morisco problem; he even recommended [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="lyn44" /&gt;  At first, these entreaties were without success.  In 1596 the [[Duke of Lerma]], King Philip III's chief financial officer, accused the Moriscos of collaboration with the Muslim [[Barbary pirate]]s, a charge that had dogged them for years.  Still, while many in the population held to this, others considered that this threat had long since passed.  The Council of Aragon, in opposing any punitive measures, wrote that even if they wished to betray Spain, the Moriscos were in no position to do so "for they possess no arms, nor supplies, nor fortified positions, nor a base for the Turkish fleet."  Nothing came of it at the time, but the Duke of Lerma continued his antipathy toward the Moriscos.&lt;ref name="lyn43" /&gt;

==Edict and expulsion==

[[File:Moriscos Port d'Orán. Vicente Mestre.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Disembarking of the Moriscos at [[Oran]] port  (1613, Vicent Mestre), Fundación Bancaja de Valencia]]
The Duke of Lerma eventually convinced King Philip III with the help of the Archbishop of Valencia, [[Juan de Ribera]], who considered the Moriscos as universally heretics and traitors.  The archbishop added an idea to make the plan more persuasive to the king: the king could confiscate the assets and properties of the Moorish population, thereby providing a dramatic one-time boost to the royal coffers.  Ribera also encouraged the king to [[Slavery|enslave]] the Moriscos for work in [[galley]]s, mines, and [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|abroad]] as he could do so "without any scruples of conscience," but this proposal was rejected.&lt;ref name="lyn44" /&gt;

On April 9, 1609, the edict was signed to expel the Moriscos.&lt;ref name="lyn45" /&gt;  The government knew that exiling so many would be problematic.  It was decided to start with Valencia, where the Morisco population was greatest.  Preparations were taken in the strictest secrecy.  Starting in September, [[tercio]] battalions arrived from Italy.&lt;ref name="lyn46"&gt;Lynch, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  They took up positions in the main ports of Valencia: [[Alfaques]], [[Dénia]], and [[Alicante]].  On September 22, the [[List of Spanish Viceroys of Valencia|viceroy]] ordered the publication of the decree.  The Valencian aristocracy met with the government to protest the expulsion, as losing their workers would ruin their agricultural incomes.  The government offered some of the confiscated property and territory of the Moriscos to them in exchange, but this didn't come close to compensating for the loss.  The Moriscos would be allowed to take anything that could carry, but their homes and land would pass into the hands of their masters.  Burning or other destruction of their homes before the transfer was prohibited on pain of death.&lt;ref name="lyn46" /&gt;

Certain exceptions were granted: 6 families out of every 100 would be allowed to stay behind and maintain the infrastructure of towns that had been predominantly Morisco-inhabited.  Very few took advantage of this, considering that it was thought likely that they'd be exiled anyway later.  Additionally, the exile was optional for children less than 4 years old.  This was later expanded to 16 years of age.  Archbishop Ribera strongly opposed this part of the measure; he lobbied that at the very least the children should be separated from their parents, enslaved, and Christianized "for the good of their souls."&lt;ref name="lyn46" /&gt;

On September 30, the first of the exiles were taken to the ports, where, as a last insult, they were forced to pay their own fare for the trip.&lt;ref name="lyn46" /&gt;  The Moriscos were transported to North Africa, where at times they were attacked as invaders by the people of the recipient countries.  Other times, small revolts broke out on the ships, causing some of the exiles to be slain in battle with the crew.  This caused fears in the Morisco population remaining in Valencia, and on October 20 there was a rebellion against the expulsion.  The rebels numbered 6,000 and held the remote valley of [[Ayora]] and [[Muela de Cortes]].  Five days later, a new rebellion broke out on the southern coast, with 15,000 rebels holding the [[Valley of Lugar]].&lt;ref name="lyn47"&gt;Lynch, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels were defeated by November. In only three months, 116,000 Moriscos had been transported to North Africa from Valencia.  The start of 1610 saw the expulsion of the Moriscos of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] (the specific area of Aragon, not all the lands of the old [[Crown of Aragon]]).  41,952 were sent to North Africa via Alfaques, and 13,470 were sent over the [[Pyrenees Mountains]] to France.&lt;ref name="lyn47" /&gt;  The exasperated French sent most of them to the port of [[Agde]], and those who took the land route were charged both the transit fee and the sea fare.&lt;ref name="lyn47" /&gt;  In September, the Moriscos of [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] were exiled.  [[Andalusia]] exiled some 32,000 Moriscos as well.&lt;ref name="lyn47" /&gt;

The expulsion of the Moriscos of Castile, Extremadura and Andalusia (then all part of the Crown of Castile) was the most difficult task, since they were dispersed across the land after being [[Morisco Revolt|broken in 1571 by the rebellion]] rather than being concentrated in any one place.  Because of this, the Moriscos were given a first option of voluntary departure, where they could take their most valuable possessions and anything else that might sell. Thus, in Castile the expulsion lasted three years, from 1611 to 1614.

==Numbers and success of the expulsion==

It is very difficult to gauge the success of the expulsion in purging Spain of its Morisco population, a topic which has been recently subject to a rather intense academic reassessment. Even estimates on the number of Moriscos present in Spain prior to expulsion vary, ranging from numbers based on records of expulsion orders such as those of Lynch and Lapeyre (around 300,000)&lt;ref name="lyn47" /&gt; to more recent estimates of up to one million.&lt;ref name="Stallaert, C. 1998"/&gt;

Equally, traditional Spanish historiography and early studies which drew heavily from it paint a picture of a very well run affair which succeeded in channeling the vast majority of Moriscos (around 270,000) out of the country in a short period of time. As a result, early estimates of Moriscos who succeeded in remaining in the country after the expulsion were judged to be as low as 15,000.&lt;ref name="lyn47" /&gt;

However, a number of recent investigative studies have been challenging the traditional discourse on the supposed success of the expulsion in purging Spain of its Morisco population. Indeed, a number of modern studies have concluded that expulsion met widely differing levels of success, particularly between the two major Spanish crowns of Castile and Aragon.

One of the earliest anglophone re-examinations of Morisco expulsion was carried out by Trevor J. Dadson in 2007. Dadson estimates that as much as 40% of Moriscos (around 200,000) never left the country and up to an additional 70,000 of those expelled, managed to return. A significant section of his work is devoted to the example of Villarubia de los Ojos in southern Castille. The Morisco population of this town was target of three expulsions which they managed to avoid or from which they succeeded in returning from to their town of origin, being protected and hidden by their non-Morisco neighbours. Dadson provides numerous examples, of similar incidents throughout Spain whereby Moriscos were protected and supported by non-Moriscos and returned en masse from North Africa, Portugal or France to their towns of origin.&lt;ref name="bibliotecaspublicas.es"/&gt;  

A similar study on the expulsion in Andalusia concluded it was an inefficient operation which was significantly reduced in its severity by resistance to the measure among local authorities and populations. It further highlights the constant flow of returnees from North Africa, creating a dilemma for the local inquisition who did not know how to deal with those who had been given no choice but to convert to Islam during their stay in Muslim lands as a result of the Royal Decree. Upon the coronation of Felipe IV, the new king gave the order to desist from attempting to impose measures on returnees and in September 1628 the Council of the Supreme Inquisition ordered inquisitors in Seville not to prosecute expelled Moriscos "unless they cause significant commotion." &lt;ref&gt;[http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CHMO/article/view/37358/36158 Michel Boeglin: ''La expulsión de los moriscos de Andalucía y sus límites. El caso de Sevilla (1610-1613)''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation published in 2012 sheds light on the thousands of Moriscos who remained in the province of Granada alone, surviving both the initial expulsion to other parts of Spain in 1571 and the final expulsion of 1604. These Moriscos managed to evade in various ways the royal decrees, hiding their true origin thereafter. More surprisingly, by the 17th and 18th centuries much of this group accumulated great wealth by controlling the silk trade and also holding about a hundred public offices. Most of these lineages were nevertheless completely assimilated over generations despite their endogamic practices. A compact core of active crypto-Muslims was prosecuted by the Inquisition in 1727, receiving comparatively light sentences. These convicts kept alive their identity until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/noticia-experto-descubre-linajes-ocultos-moriscos-quedaron-andalucia-pesar-orden-expulsion-20101123171241.html ''Europa Press'' News Agency: ''Experto descubre "linajes ocultos" de moriscos que se quedaron en Andalucía, a pesar de la orden de expulsión''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion of Moriscos and population genetics==
{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}
{{Main article|Genetic history of the Iberian Peninsula}}
[[File:Map of African admixture in European populations.png|thumb|Map of North and Sub-Saharan African admixture in European populations]]
Spain's Morisco population was the last population who self-identified and traced its roots to the various waves of Muslim conquerors from North Africa. Modern population genetics generally assume Moriscos to have had both significant Iberian and North African ancestry, even if, after centuries of presence and intermarriage in the Iberian peninsula they were unlikely to differ significantly in ethnic terms from the wider Spanish population. For this reason, studies in population genetics which aim to ascertain Morisco ancestry in modern populations search for Iberian or European genetic markers among contemporary Morisco descendants in North Africa,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fadhlaoui-Zid|first1=Karima|last2=Martinez-Cruz|first2=Begoña|last3=Khodjet-el-khil|first3=Houssein|last4=Mendizabal|first4=Isabel|last5=Benammar-Elgaaied|first5=Amel|last6=Comas|first6=David|title=Genetic structure of Tunisian ethnic groups revealed by paternal lineages|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=October 2011|volume=146|issue=2|pages=271–280|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21581|pmid=21915847}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for North African genetic markers among modern day Spaniards.&lt;ref name="Susan M 2008"/&gt;

As for tracing Morisco descendants in North Africa, to date there have been few genetic studies of populations of Morisco origin in the Maghreb region, although studies of the Moroccan population have not detected significant recent genetic inflow from the Iberian peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  A recent study of various Tunisian ethnic groups has found that all were indigenous North African, including those who self-identified as Andalusians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Consequences==
The [[Council of Castile]] evaluated the expulsion in 1619 and concluded that it had no economic impact for the country.  This was basically true for Castile, as some scholars of the expulsion have found no economic consequences on sectors where the Morisco population was important.&lt;ref name="lyn48"&gt;Lynch, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], fields were abandoned and a vacuum was left in sectors of the economy the Christians could not possibly fill.  With the removal by 33% of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Valencia, some counties in the north of the current [[Alicante province]] lost virtually their entire population.  The infrastructure decayed, and the Christian nobles and landlords fell into [[arrears]].  Strapped for cash, many of the Valencian nobles increased rents on their Christian tenants to get even close to their previous income.  The increase in rents drove off any new tenants from coming to replace them, and as a result agricultural output in Valencia dropped tremendously.&lt;ref name="lyn49"&gt;Lynch, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expulsion was a crippling blow not just to the economies of Aragon and Valencia, but also the power of their nobles.  The former [[Crown of Aragon]] had been in the shadow of the richer and more populous [[Crown of Castile]] for some time, but with this, their stature dropped still further.  Of the Eastern Kingdoms themselves, the [[History of Catalonia|Catalan]] nobles now rose to prominence, their incomes far less affected since, unlike their southern and westerly neighbours, they never had a significant morisco population.  Thus the expulsion helped shift power away from its traditional centers in Valencia to [[Catalonia]] within the Crown of Aragon.&lt;ref name="lyn51"&gt;Lynch, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern initiatives ==

In reaction to the policy of Spain to facilitate access to [[Spanish nationality law|Spanish citizenship]] by descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain, there has been demand from Muslims to apply a similar policy to the [[Morisco#Descendants and Spanish citizenship|descendants of the ''Moriscos'']]. In 2006 this demand received support from the parliament of Andalusia&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/06/25/andalucia/1182723731_850215.html ''El País'': ''Morisco, palabra maldita''] (In Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; but has not gained broader support.

The '''history of Christianity''' concerns the [[Christianity|Christian religion]], [[Christendom]], and the [[Christian Church|Church]] with its various [[Christian denomination|denominations]], from the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] to the [[Christianity in the 21st century|present]].

[[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity spread to all of Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. Since the [[Renaissance era]], Christianity has expanded throughout the world and become the world's largest religion.&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are more than two billion Christians worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|History of early Christianity}}

During its early history, Christianity grew from a [[Jewish Christianity|1st-century Jewish following]] to a religion that existed across the entire Greco-Roman world and beyond.

[[Early Christianity]] may be divided into 2 distinct phases: the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]], when the first apostles were alive and led the Church, and the [[post-apostolic period]], when an early [[Bishop|episcopal]] structure developed, and persecution was periodically intense. The [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|Roman persecution of Christians]] ended in AD 324 when [[Constantine the Great]] decreed tolerance for the religion. He then called the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in AD 325, beginning the period of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]].

===Apostolic Church===
{{Main article|Apostolic Age}}
{{See also|Christianity in the 1st century|Split of Christianity and Judaism}}
[[File:Broad overview of geography relevant to paul of tarsus.png|thumb|Spread of Christianity in the eastern Mediterranean region (by [[Paul the Apostle]])]]
The Apostolic Church was the community led by the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], and to some degree, Jesus's [[desposyni|relatives]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In his "[[Great Commission]]", the [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrected Jesus]] commanded that [[Ministry of Jesus|his teachings]] be spread to all the world. While the [[historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]] is disputed by critics, the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' is the major [[primary source]] of information for this period. Acts gives a history of the [[Christian Church|Church]] from this commission in {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:3–11}} to the spread of the religion among the Gentiles&lt;ref name=Cornelius&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Cornelius}}: "The baptism of [[Centurion Cornelius|Cornelius]], a Gentile, is an important event in the history of the Early Church. The newly formed Church, within which thus far only those who were [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]] and observed the Law of Moses had been admitted, was now thrown open to the uncircumcised Gentiles without [[Biblical law in Christianity|the obligation of submitting to the Jewish ceremonial laws]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] by [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and others.

The first Christians were essentially all ethnically Jewish or Jewish [[proselytes]]. In other words, Jesus preached to the Jewish people and called from them his first disciples, see for example [[Matthew 10]]. However, the Great Commission is specifically directed at "all nations", and an early difficulty arose concerning the matter of Gentile (non-Jewish) converts as to whether they had to "become Jewish" (usually referring to [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] and adherence to [[Kashrut|dietary law]]), as part of becoming Christian. Circumcision in particular was considered repulsive by [[Greeks]] and [[Hellenists]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&amp;letter=C&amp;search=circumcision#2 Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature] ''Jewish Encyclopedia'': "Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved nudity], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18;, Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer. Peah i. 16b; Yeb. viii. 9a). All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.";{{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = The Bulletin of the History of Medicine| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate =24 July 2007| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Circumcision advocacy|circumcision advocates]] were labelled [[Judaisers]], see [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity#Jewish background|Jewish background to the circumcision controversy for details]]. The actions of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], at the conversion of [[Cornelius the Centurion]],&lt;ref name=Cornelius/&gt; seemed to indicate that circumcision and food laws did not apply to Gentiles, and this was agreed to at the apostolic [[Council of Jerusalem]]. [[Biblical law in Christianity|Related issues are still debated today]].

The doctrines of the apostles brought the Early Church into conflict with some Jewish religious authorities. This eventually led to their expulsion from the [[synagogues]], according to one theory of the [[Council of Jamnia]]. Acts records the martyrdom of the Christian leaders, [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] and [[James, son of Zebedee|James of Zebedee]]. Thus, Christianity acquired an identity distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], but this distinction was not recognised all at once by the [[Roman Empire]], see [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]] for details. The name "Christian" (Greek {{lang|grc|Χριστιανός}}) was first applied to the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], as recorded in Acts 11:26.&lt;ref&gt;E. Peterson, "Christianus" pp. 353–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Christian beliefs and creeds==

[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|160px|Christ Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;"The figure (…) is an allegory of Christ as the shepherd" [[André Grabar]], ''Christian iconography, a study of its origins'', {{ISBN|0-691-01830-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Good Shepherd, [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].]]
The sources for the beliefs of the apostolic community include the Gospels and [[New Testament]] [[epistles]]. The very earliest accounts of belief are contained in these texts, such as early [[creed]]s and [[hymns]], as well as accounts of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the empty tomb, and Resurrection appearances; some of these are dated to the 30s or 40s AD, originating within the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Creeds, see Oscar Cullmann, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'', trans. J. K. S. Reid (London: Lutterworth, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; According to a tradition recorded by Eusebius and Epiphanius, the Jerusalem church [[Flight to Pella|fled to Pella]] at the outbreak of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Church History 3, 5, 3; Epiphanius, Panarion; On Weights and Measures 15.

H. R. van Houwelingen, "Fleeing forward: The departure of Christians from Jerusalem to Pella", ''Westminster Theological Journal'' 65 (2003), 181–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-apostolic period concerns the time after the death of the apostles (roughly 100 AD) until persecutions ended with the legalisation of Christian worship under Emperors [[Constantine the Great]] and [[Licinius]].

====Persecutions====
{{Main article|Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|l1=Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire}}
{{See also|Persecution of Christians in the New Testament}}

According to the New Testament, Christians were subject to various [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions]] from the beginning. This involved even death for Christians such as [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|7:59}}) and [[James, son of Zebedee]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|12:2}}). Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the [[Roman Empire]], beginning with the year 64, when, as reported by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]], the [[Emperor Nero]] blamed them for that year's [[Great Fire of Rome]].

According to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] were each martyred in Rome. Similarly, several of the [[New Testament]] writings mention persecutions and stress endurance through them.

Early Christians suffered sporadic persecutions as the result of local pagan populations putting pressure on the imperial authorities to take action against the Christians in their midst, who were thought to bring misfortune by their refusal to honour the gods.&lt;ref&gt;"As the existence of the Christians became more widely known, it became increasingly clear that they were (''a'') antisocial, in that they did not participate in the normal social life of their communities; (''b'') sacrilegious, in that they refused to worship the gods; and (''c'') dangerous, in that the gods did not take kindly to communities that harbored those who failed to offer them cult. By the end of the second century, the Christian apologist (literally, 'defender' of the faith) Tertullian complained about the widespread perception that Christians were the source of all disasters brought against the human race by the gods. 'They think the Christians the cause of every public disaster, of every affliction with which the people are visited. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not send its waters up over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there is an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straightway the cry is, "Away with the Christians to the lion!"' (Apology 40)" – [https://books.google.com/books?ei=6MOpTbCjLIywhQfep9jUCQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=NrRBAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Ehrman%2C+Bart+D.+%282004%29.+A+Brief+Introduction+to+the+New+Testament.&amp;q=Tertullian#search_anchor Bart D. Ehrman, ''A Brief Introduction to the New Testament''] (Oxford University Press 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-19-536934-2}}),''' pp.&amp;nbsp;313–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ste. Croix 1963 pp. 105-152"&gt;de Ste. Croix, Geoffrey Ernest Maurice. "Why Were Early Christians Persecuted?". Past &amp; Present, No. 26 (Nov., 1963), pp.&amp;nbsp;105–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
The last and most severe persecution organised by the imperial authorities was the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], 303–311.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=Michael|title=There Is No Crime for Those Who Have Christ: Religious Violence in the Christian Roman Empire|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24104-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasons for the spread of Christianity====
[[File:Krist spred 1.jpg|thumb|left|Spread of Christianity in 100 C.E.]]
In spite of these sometimes intense persecutions, the Christian religion continued its spread throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Whitby, et al. eds. '' Christian Persecution, Martyrdom and Orthodoxy'' (2006) [https://www.questia.com/read/115080283?title=Christian%20Persecution%2c%20Martyrdom%2c%20and%20Orthodoxy online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no agreement on how Christianity managed to spread so successfully prior to the [[Edict of Milan]] and the [[State church of the Roman Empire|establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire]]. In ''[[The Rise of Christianity]]'', [[Rodney Stark]] argues that Christianity triumphed over [[paganism]] chiefly because it improved the lives of its adherents in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark. ''The Rise of Christianity.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor was the way in which Christianity combined its promise of a general [[resurrection of the dead]] with the [[Resurrection#Ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek belief]] that true [[Eternal life (Christianity)|immortality]] depended on the survival of the body, with Christianity adding practical explanations of how this was going to actually happen at the [[End time|end of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;Dag Øistein Endsjø. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Mosheim]], the rapid progression of Christianity was explained by two factors: translations of the New Testament and the [[Christian apologetics|Apologies]] composed in defence of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Moishem, Johann Lorenz von, ''The Ecclesiastical History of the Second and Third Centuries : Illustrated from the Writings of Tertullian'', F. &amp; J. Rivington, London, 1845, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Gibbon]] in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' discusses the topic in considerable detail in his famous Chapter Fifteen, summarizing the historical causes of the early success of Christianity as follows: "(1) The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses. (2) The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. (3) The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church. (4) The pure and austere morals of the Christians. (5) The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman empire."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=decline%20and%20fall%20of%20the%20roman%20empire Gibbon, Edward, ''History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter Fifteen.] in 6 volumes at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structure and the episcopacy====
In the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy of clergy gradually took on the form of ''[[bishop|episkopos]]'' (overseers, in-spectors; and the origin of the term [[bishop]]) and ''[[presbyter]]s'' ([[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]; and the origin of the term [[Priest#Christianity|priest]]), and then ''[[deacons]]'' (servants). But this emerged slowly and at different times for different locations. Clement, a 1st-century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in [[First Epistle of Clement|his epistle to Corinthians]] as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms overseer and elders interchangeably and as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Carrington, ''The Early Christian Church'' (2 vol. 1957) [https://www.questia.com/read/13569586?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%201) online edition vol 1]; [https://www.questia.com/read/23514152?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%202) online edition vol 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-apostolic bishops of importance include [[Polycarp|Polycarp of Smyrna]], [[Clement I|Clement of Rome]], and [[Ignatius of Antioch]]. These men reportedly knew and studied under the apostles personally and are therefore called [[Apostolic Fathers]]. Each Christian community also had [[presbyter]]s, as was the case with Jewish communities, who were also ordained and assisted the bishop. As Christianity spread, especially in rural areas, the presbyters exercised more responsibilities and took distinctive shape as priests. Lastly, [[deacon]]s also performed certain duties, such as tending to the poor and sick. In the 2nd century, an episcopal structure becomes more visible, and in that century this structure was supported by teaching on [[apostolic succession]], where a bishop becomes the spiritual successor of the previous bishop in a line tracing back to the apostles themselves.

The diversity of early Christianity can be documented from the New Testament record itself. The [[Book of Acts]] admits conflicts between Hebrews and Hellenists, and Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians, and [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic speakers]] and [[Greek Primacy|Greek speakers]]. The letters of Paul, Peter, John, and Jude all testify to intra-Church conflicts over both leadership and theology. In a response to the [[Gnostic]] teaching, [[Irenaeus]] created the first document describing what is now called [[apostolic succession]].&lt;ref name=langan107&gt;Langan, ''The Catholic Tradition'' (1998), p. 107/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Christian writings====
{{Main article|Ante-Nicene Fathers}}
As Christianity spread, it acquired certain members from well-educated circles of the Hellenistic world; they sometimes became bishops, but not always. They produced two sorts of works: theological and "[[Christian apologetics|apologetic]]", the latter being works aimed at defending the faith by using reason to refute arguments against the veracity of Christianity. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus of Lyons]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]].

====Early art====
[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].]]
{{Main article|Early Christian art}}
Christian art only emerged relatively late, and the first known Christian images emerge from about 200 AD,&lt;ref&gt;"The earliest Christian images appeared somewhere about the year 200." Andre Grabar, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; though there is some literary evidence that small domestic images were used earlier. The oldest known Christian paintings are from the Roman [[Catacombs]], dated to about AD 200, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 3rd century.&lt;ref name = "Grabar-p7"/&gt;

Although many Hellenised Jews seem, as at the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], to have had images of religious figures, the [[Ten Commandments#Idolatry|traditional Mosaic prohibition of "graven images"]] no doubt retained some effect, although never proclaimed by theologians. This early rejection of images, and the necessity to hide Christian practise from persecution, leaves us with few archaeological records regarding early Christianity and its evolution.&lt;ref name = "Grabar-p7"&gt;Andre Grabar, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early heresies====
{{Main article|Christian heresy#Early Christian heresies}}
The [[New Testament]] itself speaks of the importance of maintaining correct ([[Orthodoxy|orthodox]]) doctrine and refuting heresies, showing the antiquity of the concern.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{bibleverse-nb||2Corinthians|11:13–15}}; {{bibleverse-nb||2Peter|2:1–17}}; {{bibleverse-nb||2John|7–11}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jude|4–13}}, and the Epistle of James in general.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Bible|biblical]] proscription against [[false prophet]]s, Christianity has always been occupied with orthodoxy.  Indeed, one of the main roles of the [[bishop]]s in the early Church was to determine and retain correct beliefs, and refute contrarian, [[heresy|heretical]] ones. As the bishops themselves sometimes differed, defining orthodoxy would occupy the Church for some time.

The earliest controversies were often [[Christology|Christological]]; that is, they were related to Jesus's divinity or humanity. Prominent alternatives included [[Docetism]] which denied the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] (God becoming human). [[Arianism]] held that Jesus had lesser status than [[God the Father|the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|14:28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinitarianism]] held that the Father, [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]] were all one being with three [[Hypostatic union|hypostases]] or persons. Many groups, such as the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], held [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic beliefs]], seeing reality as having two radically opposing parts: matter, seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good.  Such views sometimes led to heresies. Most scholars agree that the Bible teaches that both the material and the spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the various opinions is a matter of continuing academic debate. Since most Christians today subscribe to the doctrines established by the [[Nicene Creed]], modern Christian theologians tend to regard the early debates as a [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|unified orthodox position]] against a minority of heretics. Other scholars, drawing upon distinctions between [[Jewish Christians]], [[Pauline Christianity]], and other groups such as [[Marcionites]] and [[Montanism|Montanists]], argue that [[early Christianity]] was always fragmented, with contemporaneous competing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Walter|title=Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity|year=1971|isbn= 0-8006-1363-5}}; {{cite book|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|authorlink=Elaine Pagels|title=The Gnostic Gospels|year=1979|isbn= 0-679-72453-2}}; {{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman|title=Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew|year=2003|publisher=Oxford|location=New York|isbn=0-19-514183-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biblical canon====
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|250px|A folio from [[Papyrus 46|P46]], an early-3rd-century collection of [[Pauline epistles]].]]
{{Main article|Development of the Christian biblical canon}}
{{See also|Development of the New Testament canon}}

The Biblical canon is the set of books Christians regard as divinely inspired and thus constituting the Christian Bible. Though the Early Church used the Old Testament according to the canon of the [[Septuagint]] (LXX), the apostles did not otherwise leave a defined set of new [[scriptures]]; instead the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament developed over time]].

The writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities. The [[Pauline epistles]] were circulating in collected form by the end of the 1st century AD.

A four gospel canon (the ''Tetramorph'') was in place by the time of Irenaeus, c. 160, who refers to it directly.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson, "Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon", in ''The Canon Debate''. eds.

Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' 3.11.8&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 3rd century, [[Origen of Alexandria]] may have been using the same 27 books as in the modern New Testament, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of Hebrews, James, II Peter, II and III John, and Revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Both points taken from Mark A. Noll's ''Turning Points'', (Baker Academic, 1997) pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Such works that were sometimes "spoken against" were called ''[[Antilegomena]]''. In contrast, the major writings and most of what is now the [[New Testament]] were ''Homologoumena'', or universally acknowledged for a long time, since the middle of the 2nd century or before.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of the Bible'' (volume 1) eds. P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans (Cambridge University Press, 1970) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the [[Muratorian fragment]] shows that by 200 there existed a set of Christian writings similar to the current New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. De Jonge, "The New Testament Canon", in ''The Biblical Canons''. eds. de Jonge &amp; J. M. Auwers (Leuven University Press, 2003) p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave the earliest preserved list of exactly the books that would become the [[New Testament]] canon.&lt;ref name = "Lingberg-2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity

L. M. McDonald &amp; J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) p. 320; F. F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture'' (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 230; cf. Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 22.8&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus]]' commissioning of the Latin Vulgate edition of the [[Bible]], c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture'' (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In 405, [[Pope Innocent I]] sent a list of the sacred books to [[Exuperius]], a Gallic bishop.

These bishops and councils were not defining something new, but "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Everett Ferguson, "Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon", in ''The Canon Debate''. eds. L. M. McDonald &amp; J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) p. 320; Bruce Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origins, Development, and Significance'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987) pp. 237–38; F. F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture'' (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by the 4th century, there existed unanimity in the West concerning the New Testament canon,&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture'' (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]] the East, with a few exceptions, had come to accept the Book of Revelation and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of the Bible'' (volume 1) eds. P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans (Cambridge University Press, 1970) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon was not made until the 1546 [[Council of Trent]] for Roman Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Canon of the New Testament}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1563 [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] for the [[Church of England]], the 1647 [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] for [[Calvinism]], and the 1672 [[Synod of Jerusalem]] for [[Greek Orthodox]]y.

[[Galerius]], who had previously been one of the leading figures in persecution, in 311 [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|issued an edict]] which ended the persecution.&lt;ref name="PersecutionEnded"&gt;
Lactantius, [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#XXXIV ''De Mortibus Persecutorum''] "On the Deaths of the Persecutors" ch. 35–34
&lt;/ref&gt; Galerius reigned for another 2 years and was succeeded by an emperor with distinctively ''pro'' Christian leanings, [[Constantine the Great]].

The Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] was exposed to Christianity by his mother, [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]].&lt;ref name="H. Moran Cruz 2004 p. 55"&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]] in 312, Constantine commanded his troops to adorn their shields with the Christian symbol in accordance with a vision that he had had the night before. Victory allowed him to claim the emperorship in the West.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55; cf. Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine''&lt;/ref&gt; In 313, he issued the [[Edict of Milan]], officially legalizing Christian worship.

How much Christianity Constantine adopted at this point is difficult to discern. Roman coins minted up to eight years later still bore the images of Roman gods.&lt;ref name="H. Moran Cruz 2004 p. 55"/&gt; Nonetheless, his accession of was a turning point for the Christian Church. Constantine supported the Church financially, built various basilicas, granted privileges (e.g., exemption from certain taxes) to clergy, promoted Christians to some high offices, and returned confiscated property.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 324 and 330, Constantine built, virtually from scratch, a new imperial capital that came to be named for him: [[Constantinople]]. It had overtly Christian architecture, contained churches within the city walls, and had no pagan temples.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with a prevailing custom, Constantine was baptised on his deathbed.

Constantine also played an active role in the leadership of the Church. In 316, he acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the [[Donatism|Donatist]] controversy. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], the first [[Ecumenical Council]]. Constantine thus established a precedent for the emperor as responsible to [[God]] for the spiritual health of their subjects, and thus with a duty to maintain orthodoxy. The emperor was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's son's successor, his nephew [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], under the influence of his adviser [[Mardonius (philosopher)|Mardonius]], renounced Christianity and embraced a [[Neoplatonism|Neo-platonic]] and mystical form of paganism shocking the Christian establishment.&lt;ref name="Ricciotti"&gt;{{harvnb|Ricciotti|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began reopening pagan temples, modifying them to resemble Christian traditions such as the episcopal structure and public charity (previously unknown in Roman paganism). Julian's short reign ended when he died while campaigning in the East.

Later [[Church Fathers]] wrote volumes of theological texts, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory Nazianzus]], [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], [[Ambrose|Ambrose of Milan]], [[Jerome]], and others. Some, such as [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], suffered exile, persecution, or martyrdom from Arian [[Byzantine Emperors]].

===Arianism and the first Ecumenical Councils===
[[File:Christian states 495 AD (en).svg|thumb|Spread of Arianism in the Western Europe]]
{{Main article|Arianism|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}
{{Further information|Germanic Christianity}}
A popular doctrine of the 4th century was [[Arianism]], the denial of the divinity of Christ, as propounded by [[Arius]]. Though this doctrine was condemned as heresy and eventually eliminated by the Roman Church it remained popular underground for some time. In the late 4th century [[Ulfilas]], a Roman bishop and an Arian, was appointed as the first bishop to the [[Goths]], the Germanic peoples in much of Europe at the borders of and within the Empire. Ulfilas spread Arian Christianity among the Goths firmly establishing the faith among many of the Germanic tribes, thus helping to keep them culturally distinct.&lt;ref name="Padberg 1998, 26"&gt;Padberg 1998, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

During this age, the first Ecumenical Councils were convened. They were mostly concerned with Christological disputes. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) resulted in condemning Arian teachings as heresy and producing the [[Nicene Creed]].

===Christianity as Roman state religion (380)===
{{Further information|State church of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Orient méditerranéen de l'Empire romain - Mosaïque byzantine -2.JPG|thumb|An [[Eastern Roman]] [[mosaic]] showing a [[basilica]] with towers, mounted with [[Christian cross]]es, 5th century AD, [[Louvre]]]]
On 27 February 380, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] put forth under [[Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire officially adopted [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity as its state religion. Prior to this date, [[Constantius II#Christianity under Constantius|Constantius II]] (337-361) and [[Valens#Struggles with the religious nature of the Empire|Valens]] (364–378) had personally favoured Arian or [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] forms of Christianity, but Valens' successor [[Theodosius I]] supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the [[Nicene Creed]].

After its establishment, the Church adopted the same organisational boundaries as the Empire: geographical provinces, called dioceses, corresponding to imperial governmental territorial division. The bishops, who were located in major urban centres as per pre-legalisation tradition, thus oversaw each diocese. The bishop's location was his "seat", or "see". Among the sees, [[Pentarchy|five]] came to hold special eminence: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]]. The prestige of most of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, from whom the bishops were therefore the spiritual successors. Though the bishop of Rome was still held to be the [[First among equals]], Constantinople was second in precedence as the new capital of the empire.

Theodosius I decreed that others not believing in the preserved "faithful tradition", such as the Trinity, were to be considered to be practitioners of illegal [[heresy]],&lt;ref&gt;It is our desire that all the various nations... should continue to profess that religion which... has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching... let us believe in the one deity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. ...others... shall be branded... heretics, and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches. —Henry Bettenson, ed., ''Documents of the Christian Church'', (London: Oxford University Press, 1943), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and in 385, this resulted in the first case of capital punishment of a heretic, namely [[Priscillian]].&lt;ref name="TheodosiusDecree"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HereticsExecuted"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2009 | url = http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/lecture27b.html | title= Lecture 27: Heretics, Heresies and the Church | accessdate =24 April 2010}} Review of Church policies towards heresy, including capital punishment (see Synod at Saragossa).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nestorianism and the Sasanian Empire===
{{Further information|Nestorian schism|Syriac Christianity|Church of the East}}
[[File:Church of the East in the Middle Ages.svg|thumb|right|260px|Largely extinct [[Church of the East]] and its largest extent during the Middle Ages.]]
During the early 5th century the [[School of Edessa]] had taught a Christological perspective stating that Christ's divine and human nature were distinct persons. A particular consequence of this perspective was that Mary could not be properly called the mother of God, but could only be considered the mother of Christ. The most widely known proponent of this viewpoint was the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Nestorius]]. Since referring to Mary as the mother of God had become popular in many parts of the Church this became a divisive issue.

The Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&amp;nbsp;II]] called for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431), with the intention of settling the issue. The councils ultimately rejected Nestorius' view. Many churches who followed the Nestorian viewpoint broke away from the Roman Church, causing a major schism. The Nestorian churches were persecuted and many followers fled to the Sasanian Empire where they were accepted.

The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian (Persian) Empire]] had many Christian converts early in its history tied closely to the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] branch of Christianity. The Empire was officially [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and maintained a strict adherence to this faith in part to distinguish itself from the religion of the Roman Empire (originally the pagan Roman religion and then Christianity). Christianity became tolerated in the Sasanian Empire and as the Roman Empire increasingly exiled ''heretics'' during the 4th and 6th centuries, the Sasanian Christian community grew rapidly.&lt;ref name="culture-61"&gt;''Culture and customs of Iran'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 5th century the Persian Church was firmly established and had become independent of the Roman Church. This church evolved into what is today known as the [[Church of the East]].

===Miaphysitism===
{{Further information|Oriental Orthodoxy}}
In 451 the [[Council of Chalcedon]] was held to further clarify the Christological issues surrounding Nestorianism. The council ultimately stated that Christ's divine and human nature were separate but both part of a single entity, a viewpoint rejected by many churches who called themselves [[miaphysites]]. The resulting schism created a communion of churches, including the Armenian, Syrian, and Egyptian churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bussell (1910), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Though efforts were made at reconciliation in the next few centuries the schism remained permanent resulting in what is today known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].

===Monasticism===
{{Main article|Christian monasticism}}

[[Christian monasticism|Monasticism]] is a form of asceticism whereby one renounces worldly pursuits and goes off alone as a hermit or joins a tightly organized community. It began early in the Church as a family of similar traditions, modelled upon Scriptural examples and ideals, and with roots in certain strands of Judaism. [[John the Baptist]] is seen as an archetypical monk, and monasticism was also inspired by the organisation of the Apostolic community as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts 2]].

Eremetic monks, or [[hermit]]s, live in solitude, whereas [[cenobitic]]s live in communities, generally in a [[monastery]], under a rule (or code of practice) and are governed by an [[abbot]]. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits, following the example of [[Anthony the Great]]. However, the need for some form of organised spiritual guidance lead [[Pachomius]] in 318 to organise his many followers in what was to become the first monastery. Soon, similar institutions were established throughout the Egyptian desert as well as the rest of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Women were especially attracted to the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey F. Hamburger et al. ''Crown and Veil: Female Monasticism from the Fifth to the Fifteenth Centuries'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Central figures in the development of monasticism were [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]] in the East and, in the West, [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]], who created the famous [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], which would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages, and starting point for other monastic rules.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Dunn, ''Emergence of Monasticism: From the Desert Fathers to the Early Middle Ages'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Middle Ages (476–799)==
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[mosaic]] of [[Justinian I]] in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy.]]
{{Main article|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Christianity in the 6th century|Christianity in the 7th century|Christianity in the 8th century}}
The transition into the Middle Ages was a gradual and localised process. Rural areas rose as power centres whilst urban areas declined. Although a greater number of Christians remained in the [[Orthodox Church|East]] (Greek areas), important developments were underway in the [[Western Christianity|West]] (Latin areas) and each took on distinctive shapes.

The [[Bishop of Rome|Bishops of Rome]], the Popes, were forced to adapt to drastically changing circumstances. Maintaining only nominal allegiance to the Emperor, they were forced to negotiate balances with the "barbarian rulers" of the former Roman provinces. In the East the Church maintained its structure and character and evolved more slowly.

===Western missionary expansion===
The stepwise loss of [[Western Roman Empire]] dominance, replaced with [[foederati]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] kingdoms, coincided with early missionary efforts into areas not controlled by the collapsing empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''A history of the expansion of Christianity: vol. 2, The thousand years of uncertainty: A.D. 500 – A.D. 1500''&lt;/ref&gt; Already as early as in the 5th century, missionary activities from [[Roman Britain]] into the Celtic areas (current [[Scotland]], Ireland and [[Wales]]) produced competing early traditions of [[Celtic Christianity]], that was later reintegrated under the [[Holy See|Church in Rome]].

Prominent missionaries were Saints [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]], [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]]. The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribes that invaded southern Britain some time after the Roman abandonment, were initially pagan, but converted to Christianity by [[Augustine of Canterbury]] on the mission of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. Soon becoming a missionary centre, missionaries such as [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Lullus]] and [[Boniface]] would begin converting their [[Saxons|Saxon]] relatives in [[Germania]].

The largely Christian Gallo-Roman inhabitants of [[Gaul]] (modern France) were overrun by the [[Franks]] in the early 5th century. The native inhabitants were persecuted until the Frankish king [[Clovis I]] converted from paganism to [[Roman Catholic]]ism in 496. Clovis insisted that his fellow nobles follow suit, strengthening his newly established kingdom by uniting the faith of the rulers with that of the ruled.&lt;ref name="Janet L. Nelson 1996"&gt;Janet L. Nelson, ''The Frankish world, 750–900'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rise of the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and the stabilizing political conditions, the Western part of the Church increased the missionary activities, supported by the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kingdom as a means to pacify troublesome neighbour peoples. After the foundation of a church in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] by [[Willibrord]], backlashes occurred when the pagan [[Frisians|Frisian]] king [[Radbod, king of the Frisians|Radbod]] destroyed many Christian centres between 716 and 719. In 717, the English missionary [[Boniface]] was sent to aid Willibrord, re-establishing churches in Frisia continuing missions in Germany.&lt;ref name="Janet L. Nelson 1996"/&gt;

===Byzantine iconoclasm===
[[File:Andrej Rublëv 001.jpg|thumb|[[Andrei Rublev]]'s [[Trinity]].]]
{{Main article|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}

Following a series of heavy military reverses against the [[Islam|Muslims]], the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]] emerged in the early 8th century. In the 720s the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] banned the pictorial representation of Christ, saints, and biblical scenes. In the West, [[Pope Gregory III]] held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions. The Byzantine [[Council of Hieria|Iconoclast Council]], held at [[Hieria]] in 754, ruled that holy portraits were heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Epitome, Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement destroyed much of the Christian church's early artistic history. The iconoclastic movement itself was later defined as heretical in 787 under the [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]], but enjoyed a brief resurgence between 815 and 842.

===Carolingian Renaissance===
The [[Carolingian Renaissance]] was a period of intellectual and cultural revival of literature, arts, and scriptural studies during the late [[Christianity in the 8th century|8th]] and [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th centuries]], mostly during the reigns of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers. To address the problems of illiteracy among clergy and court scribes, Charlemagne founded schools and attracted the most learned men from all of Europe to his court.

===Monastic Reform===
[[File:Clocher abbaye cluny 2.JPG|right|125px|thumb|A view of the Abbey of Cluny.]]

====Cluny====
From the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]] onward most of the monasteries in the West were of the [[Benedictine Order]]. Owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed [[Rule of St Benedict|Benedictine rule]], the abbey of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. The Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church, at its height from the second half of the [[Christianity in the 10th century|10th centuries]] through the early [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th]].

====Cîteaux====
The next wave of monastic reform came with the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Movement]]. The first Cistercian [[abbey]] was founded in 1098, at [[Cîteaux Abbey]]. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine rule]], rejecting the developments of the [[Benedictines]]. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work.

Inspired by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the primary builder of the Cistercians, they became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. By the end of the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]] the Cistercian houses numbered 500, and at its height in the [[Christianity in the 15th century|15th century]] the order claimed to have close to 750 houses. Most of these were built in wilderness areas, and played a major part in bringing such isolated parts of Europe into economic cultivation
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
====Mendicant orders====
A third level of monastic reform was provided by the establishment of the [[Mendicant orders]]. Commonly known as friars, mendicants live under a monastic rule with traditional vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], but they emphasise preaching, missionary activity, and education, in a secluded monastery. Beginning in the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]], the [[Franciscan]] order was instituted by the followers of [[Francis of Assisi]], and thereafter the [[Dominican order]] was begun by [[Saint Dominic|St. Dominic]].

===Investiture Controversy===
{{Main article|Investiture Controversy}}
[[File:Canossa-gate.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at the gate of Canossa, by August von Heyden.]]

The [[Investiture Controversy]], or Lay investiture controversy, was the most significant [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|conflict between secular and religious]] powers in [[medieval Europe]]. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Pope Gregory VII]] concerning who would appoint bishops ([[investiture]]). The end of lay investiture threatened to undercut the power of the Empire and the ambitions of noblemen.

Bishoprics being merely lifetime appointments, a king could better control their powers and revenues than those of hereditary noblemen.  Even better, he could leave the post vacant and collect the revenues, theoretically in trust for the new bishop, or give a bishopric to pay a helpful noble.  The Church wanted to end lay investiture to end this and other abuses, to reform the episcopate and provide better [[pastoral care]].

Pope Gregory VII issued the ''[[Dictatus Papae]]'', which declared that the pope alone could appoint bishops.  Henry IV's rejection of the decree lead to his excommunication and a ducal revolt . Eventually Henry received absolution after dramatic public penance (see [[Road to Canossa]]), though the [[Great Saxon Revolt]] and conflict of investiture continued.

A similar controversy occurred in England between [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], Archbishop of Canterbury, over investiture and episcopal vacancy.  The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London, 1107, where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty.

This was a partial model for the [[Concordat of Worms]] (''Pactum Calixtinum''), which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their [[canon (priest)|cathedral canons]].  As a symbol of the compromise, both ecclesiastical and lay authorities invested bishops with respectively, the [[Crozier|staff]] and the [[Ecclesiastical ring|ring]].

===Medieval Inquisition===
{{Main article|Medieval Inquisition}}

The [[Medieval Inquisition]] is a series of Inquisitions ([[Roman Catholic]] Church bodies charged with suppressing [[heresy]]) from around 1184, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184–1230s) and later the Papal Inquisition (1230s). It was in response to movements within Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[Christian heresy|heretical]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]], in particular the [[Catharism|Cathars]] and the [[Waldensians]] in southern France and northern Italy. These were the first inquisition movements of many that would follow. The inquisitions in combination with the [[Albigensian Crusade]] were fairly successful in ending heresy. Historian Thomas F. Madden has written about popular myths regarding the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731045745/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion of the Scandinavians===
{{main|Christianization of Scandinavia}}
Early evangelisation in Scandinavia was begun by [[Ansgar]], [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Bremen]], "Apostle of the North". Ansgar, a native of [[Amiens]], was sent with a group of monks to Jutland Denmark in around 820 at the time of the pro-Christian Jutish king Harald Klak. The mission was only partially successful, and Ansgar returned two years later to Germany, after Harald had been driven out of his kingdom.

In 829 Ansgar went to [[Birka]] on [[Lake Mälaren]], Sweden, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in 831 which included the king's own steward Hergeir. Conversion was slow, however, and most Scandinavian lands were only completely Christianised at the time of rulers such as [[Saint Canute IV]] of Denmark and [[Olaf I of Norway]] in the years following AD&amp;nbsp;1000.

===Conversion of the Slavs===
{{main article|Christianization of the Slavs}}
[[File:Sevastopol Chersonesus Saint Vladimir Cathedral IMG 0723 1725.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Korsun ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) [[Crimea]], a place where the East Slavic Christianity was born.]]
[[File:Cyril Metodej.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Saint Cyril the Philosopher|St. Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|St. Methodius]] monument on [[Radhošť|Mt. Radhošť]].]]
Though by 800 Western Europe was ruled entirely by Christian kings, East and Central Europe remained an area of missionary activity. For example, in the 9th century SS. [[Cyril and Methodius]] had extensive missionary success in the region among the [[Slavic peoples]], translating the Bible and liturgy into [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]. The [[Baptism of Kiev]] in 988 spread Christianity throughout [[Kievan Rus']], establishing Christianity among [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into [[Eastern Europe]], including Bulgaria and [[Kievan Rus']]. The evangelisation, or Christianisation, of the Slavs was initiated by one of Byzantium's most learned churchmen—the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (Photius). The Byzantine emperor Michael III chose Cyril and Methodius in response to a request from Rastislav, the king of Moravia who wanted missionaries that could minister to the Moravians in their own language.

The two brothers spoke the local [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] vernacular and translated the Bible and many of the prayer books.&lt;ref name=Pravmir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_39.html |title=Sts. Cyril and Methodius |publisher=Pravmir |date= |access-date= 31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language [[Old Church Slavonic]] was created.

Methodius later went on to convert the [[Serbs]].&lt;ref name=IUN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iun.edu/~hisdcl/h113_2001/byzantium.htm |title=From Eastern Roman to Byzantine: transformation of Roman culture (500–800) |publisher=Indiana University Northwest |date= |access-date= 31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the disciples returned to Bulgaria where they were welcomed by the Bulgarian [[Knyaz]] [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] who viewed the Slavonic liturgy as a way to counteract Byzantine influence in the country. In a short time the disciples of Cyril and Methodius managed to prepare and instruct the future Slavic clergy into the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] and the biblical texts.

Bulgaria was officially recognised as a patriarchate by Constantinople in 927, Serbia in 1346, and Russia in 1589. All these nations, however, had been converted long before these dates.

The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people's native language rather than [[Latin]] as the Roman priests did, or Greek.

==== Mission to Great Moravia ====

[[Image:Central europe 9th century.png|thumb|right|240px|alt=Map of Moravia under Rastislav|Conversion of Moravia (under Ratislav)]]
When king [[Rastislav of Moravia]] asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, Byzantine emperor Michael III chose two brothers, [[Cyril and Methodius]]. As their mother was a Slav from the hinterlands of Thessaloniki, the two brothers had been raised speaking the local [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] vernacular. Once commissioned, they immediately set about creating an alphabet, the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]. They then translated the Scripture and the liturgy into Slavonic.

This Slavic dialect became the basis of [[Old Church Slavonic]] which later evolved into [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] which is the common liturgical language still used by the Russian Orthodox Church and other Slavic Orthodox Christians.

====Conversion of Bulgaria====
 {{main article|Christianization of Bulgaria}}
Bulgaria was a pagan country since its establishment in 681 until 864 when [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (852–889) converted to Christianity. The reasons for that decision were complex; the most important factors were that Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and [[East Francia]]; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth, while Boris also saw it as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;Andreev, J., ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'', Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans. A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century.'', 1983, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 885 some of the disciples of Cyril and Methodius, including [[Clement of Ohrid]], [[Saint Naum|Naum of Preslav]] and Angelaruis, returned to Bulgaria where they were welcomed by Boris I who viewed the Slavonic liturgy as a way to counteract Byzantine influence in the country. In a short time they managed to prepare and instruct the future Bulgarian clergy into the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] and the biblical texts. As a result of the [[Council of Preslav]] in AD&amp;nbsp;893, Bulgaria expelled its Greek clergy and proclaimed the [[Bulgarian language|Old Bulgarian language]] as the official language of the church and the state.

====Conversion of the Rus'====

[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|250px|thumb|The Baptism of Vladimir.]]
The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of other East [[Slavic peoples]], most notably the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], predecessors of [[Belarusians]], Russians, and Ukrainians, as well as [[Rusyns]]. By the beginning of the 11th century most of the pagan Slavic world, including Rus', Bulgaria and Serbia, had been converted to Byzantine Christianity. The traditional event associated with the conversion of Rus' is the baptism of Vladimir of Kiev in 989. However, Christianity is documented to have predated this event in the city of Kiev and in Georgia. Today the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the largest of the Orthodox Churches.

==Controversy and Crusades dividing East and West==
{{See also|Christianity in the 11th century|Christianity in the 12th century|Christianity in the 13th century|Christianity in the 14th century}}

===Growing tensions between East and West===
The cracks and fissures in Christian unity which led to the [[East-West Schism]] started to become evident as early as the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. Cultural, political, and linguistic differences were often mixed with the theological, leading to schism.

The transfer of the Roman capital to Constantinople inevitably brought mistrust, rivalry, and even jealousy to the relations of the two great sees, Rome and Constantinople. It was easy for Rome to be jealous of Constantinople at a time when it was rapidly losing its political prominence. Estrangement was also helped along by the German invasions in the West, which effectively weakened contacts. The rise of Islam with its conquest of most of the Mediterranean coastline (not to mention the arrival of the pagan Slavs in the Balkans at the same time) further intensified this separation by driving a physical wedge between the two worlds. The once homogeneous unified world of the Mediterranean was fast vanishing. Communication between the [[Greek East and Latin West]] by the 7th century had become dangerous and practically ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two basic problems were involved: the nature of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|primacy of the bishop of Rome]] and the theological implications of adding a clause to the [[Nicene Creed]], known as the ''[[Filioque]]'' clause. These doctrinal issues were first openly discussed in Photius's patriarchate.

By the 5th century, Christendom was divided into a pentarchy of five sees with Rome accorded a primacy. The four Eastern sees of the pentarchy considered this determined by canonical decision and not entailing hegemony of any one local church or patriarchate over the others. However, Rome began to interpret her primacy in terms of sovereignty, as a God-given right involving universal jurisdiction in the Church. The collegial and conciliar nature of the Church, in effect, was gradually abandoned in favour of supremacy of unlimited papal power over the entire Church. These ideas were finally given systematic expression in the West during the [[Gregorian Reform]] movement of the 11th century.

The Eastern churches viewed Rome's understanding of the nature of episcopal power as being in direct opposition to the Church's essentially conciliar structure and thus saw the two ecclesiologies as mutually antithetical. For them, specifically, [[primacy of Simon Peter|Simon Peter's primacy]] could never be the exclusive prerogative of any one bishop. All bishops must, like St. Peter, confess Jesus as the Christ and, as such, all are Peter's successors. The churches of the East gave the Roman See primacy but not supremacy, the Pope being the first among equals but not infallible and not with absolute authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Orthodox Church London |last=Ware |first=Kallistos |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-913836-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other major irritant to Eastern Christendom was the Western use of the ''Filioque'' clause—meaning "and the Son"—in the Nicene Creed . This too developed gradually and entered the Creed over time. The issue was the addition by the West of the Latin clause ''Filioque'' to the Creed, as in "the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father ''and the Son''", where the original Creed, sanctioned by the councils and still used today by the Eastern Orthodox simply states "the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father." The Eastern Church argued that the phrase had been added unilaterally, and therefore illegitimately, since the East had never been consulted.&lt;ref&gt;History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky {{ISBN|978-0-8236-8074-0}} Quoting [[Aleksey Khomyakov]] p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final analysis, only another ecumenical council could introduce such an alteration. Indeed, the councils, which drew up the original Creed, had expressly forbidden any subtraction or addition to the text. In addition to this ecclesiological issue, the Eastern Church also considered the'' Filioque'' clause unacceptable on dogmatic grounds. Theologically, the Latin interpolation was unacceptable since it implied that the Spirit now had two sources of origin and procession, the Father and the Son, rather than the Father alone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church by [[Vladimir Lossky]], SVS Press, 1997.

===Photian schism===
{{Main article|Photian schism}}

In the 9th century AD, a controversy arose between Eastern (Byzantine, Greek Orthodox) and Western (Latin, Roman Catholic) Christianity that was precipitated by the opposition of the Roman [[Pope John VII]] to the appointment by the Byzantine [[emperor Michael III]] of [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios I]] to the position of patriarch of Constantinople. Photios was refused an apology by the pope for previous points of dispute between the East and West. Photios refused to accept the supremacy of the pope in Eastern matters or accept the ''Filioque'' clause. The Latin delegation at the council of his consecration pressed him to accept the clause in order to secure their support.

The controversy also involved Eastern and Western ecclesiastical jurisdictional rights in the Bulgarian church, as well as a doctrinal dispute over the ''Filioque'' ("and from the Son") clause. That had been added to the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Latin church, which was later the theological breaking point in the ultimate Great [[East-West Schism]] in the 11th century.

Photios did provide concession on the issue of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]], the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims.

===East-West Schism (1054)===
{{Main article|East-West Schism}}
[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|The East-West Schism]]
The [[East-West Schism]], or Great Schism, separated the Church into Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) branches, i.e., Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. It was the first major division since certain groups in the East rejected the decrees of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (see [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]), and was far more significant. Though normally dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between Latin and Greek Christendom over the nature of papal primacy and certain doctrinal matters like the ''Filioque'', but intensified by cultural and linguistic differences.

The "official" schism in 1054 was the excommunication of Patriarch [[Michael Cerularius]] of Constantinople, followed by his excommunication of papal legates. Attempts at reconciliation were made in 1274 (by the [[Second Council of Lyon]]) and in 1439 (by the [[Council of Basel]]), but in each case the eastern hierarchs who consented to the unions were repudiated by the Orthodox as a whole, though reconciliation was achieved between the West and what are now called the "[[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]]". More recently, in 1965 [[Catholic-Orthodox joint declaration of 1965|the mutual excommunications were rescinded]] by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople, though schism remains.

Both groups are descended from the Early Church, both acknowledge the [[apostolic succession]] of each other's bishops, and the validity of each other's [[sacrament]]s. Though both acknowledge the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, Eastern Orthodoxy understands this as a primacy of honour with limited or no ecclesiastical authority in other dioceses.

The Orthodox East perceived the Papacy as taking on monarchical characteristics that were not in line with the church's tradition.

The final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Crusades against Christians in the East by Roman Catholic crusaders was not exclusive to the Mediterranean though (see also the [[Northern Crusades]] and the [[Battle of the Ice]]). The sacking of [[Constantinople]] and the [[Hagia Sophia|Church of Holy Wisdom]] and establishment of the [[Latin Empire]] as a seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1204 is viewed with some rancour to the present day.

Many in the East saw the actions of the West as a prime determining factor in the weakening of Byzantium. This led to the Empire's eventual conquest and fall to Islam. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]] extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204; the apology was formally accepted by [[Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople]]. Many things that were stolen during this time: holy [[relic]]s, riches, and many other items, are still held in various Western European cities, particularly [[Venice]], Italy.

=== Crusades ===
{{Main article|Crusades}}
[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The Crusader states of Jerusalem]]
Generally, the Crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land against Muslim forces sponsored by the Papacy. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily, as well as the campaigns of [[Teutonic Knights]] against pagan strongholds in North-eastern Europe (see [[Northern Crusades]]).  A few crusades were waged within Christendom against groups that were considered heretical and schismatic (also see the [[Battle of the Ice]] and the [[Albigensian Crusade]]).

[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Krak des Chevaliers]] was built in the [[County of Tripoli]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the Crusades.]]

The Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus Byzantine Empire, until the Islamic conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the [[Seljuk Turks]] closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].

Emperor [[Alexius I]] asked for aid from [[Pope Urban II]] (1088–1099) for help against Islamic aggression. He probably expected money from the pope for the hiring of mercenaries. Instead, Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the [[Council of Clermont]] on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels.

The [[First Crusade]] captured Antioch in 1099 and then Jerusalem. The [[Second Crusade]] occurred in 1145 when [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was retaken by Islamic forces. Jerusalem would be held until 1187 and the [[Third Crusade]], famous for the battles between [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]]. 

The [[Fourth Crusade]], begun by [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1202, intended to retake the Holy Land but was soon subverted by Venetians who used the forces to sack the Christian city of [[Zadar|Zara]].&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1998"&gt;For such an analysis, see Brian Tierney and Sidney Painter, ''Western Europe in the Middle Ages 300–1475''. 6th ed. (McGraw-Hill 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; When the crusaders arrived in Constantinople, they sacked the city and other parts of Asia Minor and established the [[Latin Empire]] of Constantinople in Greece and Asia Minor.  This was effectively the last crusade sponsored by the papacy, with later crusades being sponsored by individuals.&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1998"/&gt;

Jerusalem was held by the crusaders for nearly a century, and other strongholds in the Near East would remain in Christian possession much longer. The crusades in the Holy Land ultimately failed to establish permanent Christian kingdoms. Islamic expansion into Europe would renew and remain a threat for centuries culminating in the campaigns of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1998"/&gt;

Crusades in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily eventually lead to the demise of Islamic power in Europe.&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1998"/&gt; The Teutonic Knights expanded Christian domains in Eastern Europe, and the much less frequent crusades within Christendom, such as the [[Albigensian Crusade]], achieved their goal of maintaining doctrinal unity.&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1998"/&gt;

===Hesychast Controversy===
{{Main article|Hesychast controversy}}
[[File:Gregor Palamas.jpg|thumb|160px|Gregory Palamas.]]
In 1337 [[Hesychasm]]—a mystical teaching at [[Mount Athos]] came under attack from [[Barlaam of Calabria]], an abbot in Constantinople. Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught. Hesychasm is a form of constant purposeful prayer or experiential prayer, explicitly referred to as [[Theoria|contemplation]] focusing on the idea of stillness and the characteristic mystical idea of light as the vehicle for knowing God.

[[Gregory Palamas]], afterwards Archbishop of [[Thessalonica]], defended Hesychasm. Several synods took one position or the other until in 1351 at a synod under the presidency of the Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]], Hesychast doctrine was established as the doctrine of the Orthodox Church. the theology was especially attractive in the East because it validated the use of icons as a vehicle for contemplation of divine light.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years'' (2010) pp. 486–91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Constantinople===
In 1453, Constantinople fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. By this time Egypt had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries, but Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia which had recently acquired an [[autocephalous]] status; and thus Moscow called itself the [[Third Rome]], as the cultural heir of Constantinople.

Under Ottoman rule, the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] acquired substantial power as an autonomous ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]''. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire "Greek Orthodox nation" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire.

Eastern Christians fleeing Constantinople, and the Greek manuscripts they carried with them, is one of the factors that prompted the literary [[renaissance]] in the West at about this time.

===Isolation from the West===
As a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire.

It is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.

===Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire===
{{Further information|Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Persecution of Christians#Ottoman Empire|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire}}
[[Image:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror]] receives [[Gennadius II Scholarius]] ([[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 1454 to 1464)]]
The new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] that conquered the Byzantine Empire followed Islamic law when dealing with the conquered Christian population. Christians were officially tolerated as [[People of the Book]]. As such, the Church's canonical and hierarchical organisation were not significantly disrupted and its administration continued to function. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]].

Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest-ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. This meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. However, these rights and privileges, including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. Christians were viewed as [[Dhimmitude|second-class citizens]], and the legal protections they depended upon were subject to the whims of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]].&lt;ref name="AIHG-NYT"&gt;[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=7 June 2007 }} ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ottoman occupation the Church could no longer bear witness to Christ. Christian missionary work among Muslims was illegal and dangerous, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements. Violent persecutions of Christians were common, and reached their climax in the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]], and [[Greek Genocide|Greek]] genocides.

===Corruption===
The Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy.

Few patriarchs between the 15th and the 19th centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. The hierarchy's positions were often dangerous as well. The hanging of patriarch [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]] from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops.

===Avignon Papacy (1309–1378)===
The [[Avignon Papacy]], sometimes referred to as the Babylonian Captivity, was a period from 1309 to 1378 during which seven [[Pope]]s resided in [[Avignon]], in modern-day France.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The period was one of conflict and controversy during which French Kings held considerable sway over the Papacy and rulers across Europe felt sidelined by the new French-centric papacy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Troubles reached their peak in 1378 when, [[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]] died while visiting Rome. A [[papal conclave]] met in Rome and elected [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]], an Italian. Urban soon alienated the French cardinals, and they held a second conclave electing [[Antipope Clement VII|Robert of Geneva]] to succeed Gregory XI, beginning the Western Schism.

===Western Schism (1378–1416)===
[[File:Western schism 1378-1417.svg|thumb|Map showing support for Avignon (red) and Rome (blue) during the Western Schism; this breakdown is accurate until the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409), which created a third line of claimants.]]
The [[Western Schism]], or Papal Schism, was a prolonged period of crisis with two or more claimants to the See of Rome. The conflict was political rather than doctrinal.

In 1309, [[Pope Clement V]], due to political considerations, moved to Avignon in southern France. For sixty-nine years popes resided in Avignon rather than Rome. This was a of confusion and of political animosity as the prestige and influence of Rome waned without a resident pontiff. Though [[Pope Gregory XI]], a Frenchman, returned to Rome in 1378, the strife between Italian and French factions intensified.

In 1378 the conclave elected an Italian from Naples, [[Pope Urban VI]]. He soon alienated the French cardinals, who withdrew to a conclave of their own, asserting the previous election was invalid, and elected one of their own, Robert of Geneva, who took the name [[Pope Clement VII]]. By 1379, he was back in the palace of popes in Avignon, while Urban VI remained in Rome.

For nearly forty years, there were two papal curias and two sets of cardinals, each electing a new pope for Rome or Avignon when death created a vacancy. Each pope lobbied for support among kings and princes who played them off against each other. In 1409, a council at Pisa to resolve the issue declared both existing popes to be schismatic (Gregory XII from Rome, Benedict XIII from Avignon) and appointed a new one, Alexander V. The existing popes refused to resign and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the [[Council of Constance]].

In March 1415 the Pisan pope John XXIII fled from Constance in disguise. He was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance, nor would he consider resignation. The council deposed him in July 1417 and elected [[Pope Martin V]] as pope in November, having finally cleared the field of popes and [[antipope]]s.

=== John Wycliff and Jan Hus ===
[[File:Brožík, Václav - Hus před koncilem 6. července 1415.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Painting of [[Jan Hus]] in Council of Constance by [[Václav Brožík]].]]
[[File:Hussites.gif|thumb|250px|Evolution of the Hussite movements]]
[[John Wycliffe]] (or Wyclif) (1330–1384) was an English scholar and heretic best known for denouncing the corruptions of the Church, and his sponsoring the first translation of the Bible from Latin into English. He was a precursor of the Protestant Reformation. He emphasized the supremacy of the Bible, and called for a direct relationship between man and God, without interference by priests and bishops. His followers, called [[Lollards]], faced persecution by the Church of England. They went underground for over a century and played a role in the English Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;G. R.

[[Jan Hus]] (or Huss) (1369?–1415) a Czech theologian in Prague, was influenced by Wycliffe and spoke out against the corruptions he saw in the Church; his continued defiance led to his excommunication and condemnation by the [[Council of Constance]], which also condemned [[John Wycliff]]. Hus was executed in 1415, but his followers organized a peasants' war, 1419–1436, that was put down by the Empire with great brutality. Hus was a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation and his memory has become a powerful symbol of Czech culture in Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Fudge, ''Jan Hus: Religious Reform and Social Revolution in Bohemia'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Renaissance (c. 1375 – 1520)===

{{See also|Italian Renaissance}}

The [[Renaissance]] was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The City of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church patroned such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].

In addition to being the head of the Church, the Pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers, and pontiffs such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] often waged campaigns to protect and expand their temporal domains. Furthermore, the popes, in a spirit of refined competition with other Italian lords, spent lavishly both on private luxuries but also on public works, repairing or building churches, bridges, and a magnificent system of [[aqueducts in Rome]] that still function today.

From 1505 to 1626, [[St. Peter's Basilica]], perhaps the most recognised Christian church, was built on the site of the old Constantinian basilica. It was also a time of increased contact with Greek culture, opening up new avenues of learning, especially in the fields of [[philosophy]], poetry, [[classics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[political science]], fostering a spirit of [[humanism]]–all of which would influence the Church.

==Reformation and Counter-Reformation==

===Protestant Reformation (1521–1610)===
{{Main article|Protestant Reformation|Protestantism}}
[[File:Reformation.gif|thumb|Approximate spread of Protestantism after the Reformation, and following the Counter-Reformation.]]
In the early 16th century, movements were begun by two theologians, [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]], that aimed to reform the Church; these reformers are distinguished from previous ones in that they considered the root of corruptions to be doctrinal (rather than simply a matter of moral weakness or lack of ecclesiastical discipline) and thus they aimed to change contemporary doctrines to accord with what they perceived to be the "true gospel." The word ''Protestant'' is derived from the Latin ''protestatio'' meaning ''declaration'' which refers to the [[Protestation at Speyer|letter of protestation]] by [[Lutheran]] princes against the decision of the [[Second Diet of Speyer|Diet of Speyer]] in 1529, which reaffirmed the edict of the [[Diet of Worms]] against the Reformation.&lt;ref name="TECGlossary"&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm Definition of Protestantism at the Episcopal Church website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815180519/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm |date=15 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the term has been used in many different senses, but most often as a general term refers to [[Western Christianity]] that is not subject to papal authority.&lt;ref name="TECGlossary" /&gt; The term "Protestant" was not originally used by Reformation era leaders; instead, they called themselves "evangelical", emphasising the "return to the true gospel (Greek: ''euangelion'')."&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the Protestant Reformation is generally identified with [[Martin Luther]] and the posting of the [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] on the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany. Early protest was against corruptions such as [[simony]], episcopal vacancies, and the sale of [[indulgence]]s. The Protestant position, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as [[sola scriptura]] and [[sola fide]]. The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Protestant Reformation were the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]], [[Presbyterian]], etc.), and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] traditions, though the latter group identifies as both "Reformed" and "Catholic", and some subgroups reject the classification as "Protestant."

The Protestant Reformation may be divided into two distinct but basically simultaneous movements, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] and the [[Radical Reformation]]. The Magisterial Reformation involved the alliance of certain theological teachers (Latin: ''magistri'') such as Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Cranmer, etc. with secular magistrates who cooperated in the reformation of Christendom. Radical Reformers, besides forming communities outside state sanction, often employed more extreme doctrinal change, such as the rejection of tenets of the Councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon. Often the division between magisterial and radical reformers was as or more violent than the general Catholic and Protestant hostilities.

The Protestant Reformation spread almost entirely within the confines of Northern Europe, but did not take hold in certain northern areas such as Ireland and parts of Germany. By far the magisterial reformers were more successful and their changes more widespread than the radical reformers. The Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation is known as the Counter Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, which resulted in a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. The Counter Reformation reconverted approximately 33% of Northern Europe to Catholicism and initiated missions in South and Central America, Africa, Asia, and even China and Japan. Protestant expansion outside of Europe occurred on a smaller scale through colonisation of North America and areas of Africa.

====Martin Luther====
{{Main article|Martin Luther}}
{{See also|Theology of Martin Luther}}
[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Martin Luther, by Lucas Cranach the Elder]]

Martin Luther was an Augustinian friar and professor at the [[University of Wittenberg]]. In 1517, he published a list of [[95 Theses]], or points to be debated, concerning the illicitness of selling indulgences. Luther had a particular disdain for Aristotelian philosophy, and as he began developing his own theology, he increasingly came into conflict with [[Thomism|Thomistic]] scholars, most notably [[Thomas Cajetan|Cardinal Cajetan]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 124–25&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Luther had begun to develop his theology of [[Justification (theology)|justification]], or process by which one is "made right" (righteous) in the eyes of God. In Catholic theology, one is made righteous by a progressive infusion of grace accepted through faith and cooperated with through good works. Luther's doctrine of justification differed from Catholic theology in that justification rather meant "the declaring of one to be righteous", where God imputes the merits of Christ upon one who remains without inherent merit.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, good works are more of an unessential byproduct that contribute nothing to one's own state of righteousness. Conflict between Luther and leading theologians lead to his gradual rejection of authority of the Church hierarchy. In 1520, he was condemned for heresy by the papal bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', which he burned at Wittenberg along with books of [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ulrich Zwingli====
{{Main article|Huldrych Zwingli}}

[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|Ulrich Zwingli, wearing the scholar's cap.]]

Ulrich Zwingli was a Swiss scholar and parish priest who was likewise influential in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. Zwingli claimed that his theology owed nothing to Luther, and that he had developed it in 1516, before Luther's famous protest, though his doctrine of justification was remarkably similar to that of the German friar.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1518, Zwingli was given a post at the wealthy collegiate church of the [[Grossmünster]] in [[Zürich]], where he would remain until his death at a relatively young age. Soon he had risen to prominence in the city, and when political tension developed between most of Switzerland and the Catholic [[Habsburg]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. In this environment, Zwingli began preaching his version of reform, with certain points as the aforementioned doctrine of justification, but others (with which Luther vehemently disagreed) such as the position that veneration of icons was actually idolatry and thus a violation of the first commandment, and the denial of the [[real presence]] in the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 146–48&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the city council had accepted Zwingli's doctrines and Zurich became a focal point of more radical reforming movements, and certain admirers and followers of Zwingli pushed his message and reforms far further than even he had intended, such as rejecting infant baptism.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 148–49&lt;/ref&gt; This split between Luther and Zwingli formed the essence of the Protestant division between Lutheran and Reformed theology. Meanwhile, political tensions increased; Zwingli and the Zurich leadership imposed an economic blockade on the inner Catholic states of Switzerland, which led to a [[Second War of Kappel|battle]] in which Zwingli, in full armor, was slain along with his troops.

====John Calvin====
{{Main article|John Calvin}}
{{See also|Calvinism}}
John Calvin was a French cleric and doctor of law turned Protestant reformer. He belonged to the second generation of the Reformation, publishing his theological tome, the ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', in 1536 (later revised), and establishing himself as a leader of the Reformed church in [[Geneva]], which became an "unofficial capital" of Reformed Christianity in the second half of the 16th century. He exerted a remarkable amount of authority in the city and over the city council, such that he has (rather ignominiously) been called a "Protestant pope." Calvin established an eldership together with a "[[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|consistory]]", where pastors and the elders established matters of religious discipline for the Genevan population.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calvin's theology]] is best known for his doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|(double) predestination]], which held that God had, from all eternity, [[Divine Providence|providentially]] foreordained who would be saved ([[unconditional election|the elect]]) and likewise who would be damned ([[reprobation|the reprobate]]). Predestination was not the dominant idea in Calvin's works, but it would seemingly become so for many of his Reformed successors.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Reformation====
{{See also|English Civil War}}
[[File:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|150px|Statue of [[Richard Hooker]], whose emphases on reason, tolerance and inclusiveness influenced [[Anglicanism]].]]

Unlike other reform movements, the [[English Reformation]] began by royal influence. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] considered himself a thoroughly Catholic King, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, ''[[Defence of the Seven Sacraments|The Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', for which [[Leo X|Pope Leo X]] awarded him the title ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with [[Catherine of Aragon]], for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the [[Church of England|English Church]]. England would later experience periods of frenetic and eclectic reforms contrasted by periods led by staunch conservatives. Monarchs such as [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[William Laud]] pushed the Church of England in many directions over the course of only a few generations. What emerged was a state church that considered itself both "Reformed" and "Catholic" but not "Roman" (and hesitated from the title "Protestant"), and other "unofficial" more radical movements such as the [[Puritan]]s.

===Counter-Reformation (1545–1610)===
{{Main article|Counter-Reformation}}

The Counter-Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. The essence of the Counter-Reformation was a renewed conviction in traditional practices and the upholding of Catholic doctrine as the source of ecclesiastic and moral reform, and the answer to halt the spread of Protestantism. Thus it experienced the founding of new religious orders, such as the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], the establishment of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests, renewed worldwide missionary activity, and the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. The entire process was spearheaded by the [[Council of Trent]], which clarified and reasserted doctrine, issued dogmatic definitions, and produced the ''[[Roman Catechism]]''.

Though Ireland, Spain, France, and elsewhere featured significantly in the Counter-Reformation, its heart was Italy and the various popes of the time, who established the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (the list of prohibited books) and the [[Roman Inquisition]], a system of juridical tribunals that prosecuted heresy and related offences. The Papacy of [[Pope Pius V|St. Pius V]] (1566–1572) was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church, but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick, and supporting missionaries. The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome. As [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] stated, "Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch|MacCulloch, Diarmaid]], ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Council of Trent====
{{Main article|Council of Trent}}
[[File:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Council in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] church; Museo Diocesiano Tridentino, Trento]]

The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563), initiated by [[Pope Paul III]] (1534–1549) addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as [[simony]], [[absenteeism]], [[nepotism]], and other abuses, as well as the reassertion of traditional practices and the dogmatic articulation of the traditional doctrines of the Church, such as the episcopal structure, clerical celibacy, the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|seven Sacraments]], [[transubstantiation]] (the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ), the veneration of relics, icons, and saints (especially the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]), the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of purgatory and the issuance (but not the sale) of indulgences, etc. In other words, all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected. The Council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care. [[Milan]]'s Archbishop [[Saint Charles Borromeo]] (1538–1584) set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.

====Catholic missions====
Catholic missions were carried to new places beginning with the new [[Age of Discovery]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] as well as other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than [[cultural imperialism]].

===Trial of Galileo===
[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|350px|''Galileo before the Holy Office'', a 19th-century painting by [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]]]]
The [[Galileo affair]], in which [[Galileo Galilei]] came into conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over his support of [[heliocentrism|Copernican astronomy]], is often considered a defining moment in the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]].

In 1610, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]]. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the [[Heaven]]s that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].

In reaction, many scholars maintained that the motion of the Earth and immobility of the Sun were [[heresy|heretical]], as they contradicted some accounts given in the [[Bible]] as understood at that time. Galileo's part in the controversies over [[theology]], astronomy and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633, on a grave suspicion of heresy.

===Puritans in North America===
{{Main article|Migration to New England (1620–1640)}}
{{See also|History of the Puritans}}
The most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; The Puritans, or [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, and thus they set out for the New World and the hopes of a Puritan utopia.

==Early Modern era==
This is the period from the [[Industrial revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] until the mid 19th century.

===Revivalism (1720–1906)===
{{Main article|Revivalism}}
{{See also|Christianity in the 18th century|Christianity in the 19th century}}
Revivalism refers to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and Wesleyan revival, called the [[Great Awakening]], in North America which saw the development of evangelical [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], and new [[Methodist]] churches.

===Great Awakenings===
[[File:Philipp Jakob Spener.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Philipp Spener]] the founder of [[Pietism]] ]]
{{Main article|First Great Awakening|Second Great Awakening|Third Great Awakening}}

The [[First Great Awakening]] was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies c. 1730–1740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a "great international Protestant upheaval" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]], and [[Methodism]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], German Reformed, [[Baptist]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800–1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the "great awakenings" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].

===Restorationism===
{{Main article|Restoration Movement}}
{{See also|Restorationism (Christian primitivism)}}
Restorationism refers to the belief that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the [[Early Christianity|early church]] as a model.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Models of Restoration"&gt;Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B.

Mudge, ''The Routledge companion to the Christian church'', Routledge, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-415-37420-0}}, 684 pages&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|217}} In many cases, restorationist groups believed that contemporary Christianity, in all its forms, had deviated from the true, original Christianity, which they then attempted to "Reconstruct", often using the [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]] as a "guidebook" of sorts. Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as "reforming" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. "Restorationism" is often used to describe the [[Restoration Movement|Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]].

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
The term "Restorationist" is also used to describe the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]]

===Modern Eastern Orthodoxy===

====Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire====
[[File:2003-04-18 Moscow Kremlin.jpg|thumb|300px|Churches of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], as seen from the [[Balchug]] ]]

The Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the [[Russian Empire]], expressed in the motto of the late Empire from 1833: [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism]]. Nevertheless, the [[Church reform of Peter I]] in the early 18th century had placed the Orthodox authorities under the control of the [[Tsar]]. An official (titled [[Ober-Procurator]]) appointed by the Tsar himself ran the committee which governed the Church between 1721 and 1918: the [[Most Holy Synod]].

The Church became involved in the various campaigns of [[russification]],&lt;ref&gt;Natalia Shlikhta (2004) "'Greek Catholic'–'Orthodox'–'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?" in ''Religion, State &amp; Society'', Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge)
&lt;/ref&gt; and was accused of involvement in [[anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]].&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Lambroza, John D. Klier (2003) ''Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History'' (Cambridge University Press)
&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of anti-Semitism and the anti-Jewish pogroms, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the Church, and many Russian Orthodox clerics, including senior hierarchs, openly defended persecuted Jews, at least from the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=JCR&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787 "Jewish-Christian Relations"], by the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, the Church has no official position on Judaism as such.&lt;ref name=JCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
It is no coincidence that the entry on 'Orthodoxy' in the seventh volume of the ''Kratkaya Evreiskaya Entsyklopedia'' [Concise Jewish Encyclopedia], devoted to the Russian Orthodox Church (pp. 733–43), where numerous examples are given of persecution of the Jews in Russia, including religious persecution, offers no evidence of the direct participation of the Church, either in legislative terms or in the conduct of policy. Although the authors of the article label the active role of the Church in inciting the government to conduct anti-Jewish acts (for example in the case of Ivan the Terrible's policy in the defeated territories) as "obvious", no facts are given in their article to support this. http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bolsheviks]] and other Russian revolutionaries saw the Church, like the Tsarist state, as an [[enemy of the people]].

====Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union====
{{Further information|Religion in the Soviet Union}}

The Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the [[White Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] (see [[White movement]]) after the October Revolution. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus against the church.

After the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (25 October Old Calendar) there was a movement within the Soviet Union to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see [[Communist International]]). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States.

The Soviet Union was the first state to have as an ideological objective the elimination of religion. Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated [[anti-religious]] atheistic propaganda in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organised religions were never outlawed.
Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with [[execution]] included torture being sent to [[gulags|prison camps]], [[sharashka|labour camps]] or [[Psikhushka|mental hospitals]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Father Arseny 1893–1973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.

The result of [[state atheism]] was to transform the Church into a persecuted and martyred Church. In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ostling|Ostling, Richard]]. "Cross meets Kremlin" TIME Magazine, 24 June 2001. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; This included people like the [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] who was at this point a monastic. Along with her murder was [[Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich]] Romanov; the Princes [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia|Ioann Konstantinovich]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Konstantin Konstantinovich]], [[Igor Konstantinovich of Russia|Igor Konstantinovich]] and [[Vladimir Paley|Vladimir Pavlovich Paley]]; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and [[Varvara Yakovleva]], a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent. They were herded into the forest, pushed into an abandoned mineshaft and grenades were then hurled into the mineshaft. Her remains were buried in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Church of Maria Magdalene]].

The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly its entire clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to fewer than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Father [[Pavel Florensky]] was one of the [[New-martyr]]s of this particular period.

After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.&lt;ref&gt;Ostling, Richard. "Cross meets Kremlin" ''Time Magazine'', 24 June 2001. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or [[samizdat]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
Since the fall of the Soviet Union there have been many [[New-martyr]]s added as Saints from the yoke.

====Diaspora emigration to the West====
One of the most striking developments in modern historical Orthodoxy is the dispersion of Orthodox Christians to the West. Emigration from Greece and the Near East in the last hundred years has created a sizable Orthodox diaspora in Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. In addition, the Bolshevik Revolution forced thousands of Russian exiles westward. As a result, Orthodoxy's traditional frontiers have been profoundly modified. Millions of Orthodox are no longer geographically "eastern" since they live permanently in their newly adopted countries in the West. Nonetheless, they remain Eastern Orthodox in their faith and practice.

===Modern trends in Christian theology===

====Modernism and liberal Christianity====
{{Main article|Liberal Christianity}}
[[Liberal Christianity]], sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically informed religious movements and moods within late 18th, 19th and 20th-century Christianity. The word "liberal" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main article|Christian fundamentalism}}
Fundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves "Christian." Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the "[[The Fundamentals|fundamentals]]": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|return of Jesus Christ]].

====Under/During Nazism====
[[File:Papst Pius XI. 1JS.jpg|thumb|150px|Pope Pius XI]]
The position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.

Regarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, "There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones."&lt;ref&gt;Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XI]] declared – ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' – that Fascist governments had hidden "pagan intentions" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and [[Totalitarian]] Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God, fundamental [[human rights]] and dignity. His declaration that "Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites" prompted the Nazis to give him the title "Chief Rabbi of the Christian World."&lt;ref&gt;Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in [[Dachau]], and 2,000 of them were executed. A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.&lt;ref&gt;John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 &amp; n. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Catholic laymen and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876–1958). The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).&lt;ref&gt;John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2008), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: "The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together."&lt;ref&gt;Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the [[German Lutheran Church]], was complex. Though many&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicarrogance.org/Catholic/Hitlersfaith-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.

===Second Vatican Council===
{{Main article|Second Vatican Council}}
On 11 October 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was "pastoral" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin.

===Ecumenism===
{{Main article|Ecumenism}}
Ecumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. "''Ecumenism''" is derived from Greek {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means "the inhabited world", but more figuratively something like "universal oneness." The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of "denominationalism" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).

====Catholic ecumenism====
{{Main article|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}
Over the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]]. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.

On 30 November 1894, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the Apostolic Letter ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm Orientalium Dignitas]'' (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.

Some of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. ''Filioque'', [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.

With respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.

=== Pentecostal movement ===

|caption2=Countries by percentage of Protestants in 1938 and 2010. Pentecostal and [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations fueled much of the growth in Africa and Latin America.}}
The [[Third Great Awakening]] (1904 onwards) had its roots in the Holiness movement which had developed in the late 19th century. The Pentecostal revival movement began, out of a passion for more power and a greater outpouring of the Spirit. In 1902, the American evangelists Reuben Archer Torrey and Charles M. Alexander conducted meetings in Melbourne, Australia, resulting in more than 8,000 converts. News of this revival travelled fast, igniting a passion for prayer and an expectation that God would work in similar ways elsewhere.

Torrey and Alexander were involved in the beginnings of the great Welsh revival (1904) which led Jessie Penn-Lewis to witness the working of Satan during times of revival, and write her book "War on the Saints".  In 1906, the modern Pentecostal Movement was born on [[Azusa Street]] in Los Angeles.  Pentecostalism in turn inspired the [[Charismatic]] movement within already established denominations.

In reaction to these developments, [[Christian fundamentalism]] was a movement to reject the radical influences of philosophical humanism, as this was affecting the Christian religion. Especially targeting critical approaches to the interpretation of the Bible, and trying to blockade the inroads made into their churches by atheistic scientific assumptions, the fundamentalists began to appear in various denominations as numerous independent movements of resistance to the drift away from historic Christianity. Over time, the Fundamentalist Evangelical movement has divided into two main wings, with the label Fundamentalist following one branch, while [[Evangelical]] has become the preferred banner of the more moderate movement. Although both movements primarily originated in the English-speaking world, the majority of Evangelicals now live elsewhere in the world.

====Ecumenism within Protestantism====
[[Ecumenical]] movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a "first among equal" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of "the Church" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of "being Christian") is a sub-group of a greater "Christian Church", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or "denomination", claims to be "the Church." This [[ecclesiology]] is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be "the Church." The "essential criteria" generally consist of belief in the [[Trinity]], belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], and that He died and rose again bodily.

[[File:Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary.png|thumb|Immaculate Heart of Mary]]
The '''Immaculate Heart of Mary''' is a [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]]al name used to refer to the interior life of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], her joys and sorrows, her virtues and hidden perfections, and, above all, her virginal love for [[God the Father]], her maternal love for her son [[Jesus]], and her compassionate love for all people.&lt;ref name=bainvel&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07168a.htm Bainvel, Jean. "Devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] occasionally utilize the image, devotion, and theology associated with the Immaculate Heart of Mary. However, this is a cause of some controversy, some seeing it as a form of [[liturgical latinisation]]. The Roman Catholic view is based on [[Mariology]], as exemplified by [[Pope John Paul II]]'s Apostolic Letter ''[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae_en.html Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Letter ''Rosarium Virginis Mariae'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the heart is depicted pierced with seven wounds or swords, in homage to the [[Our Lady of Sorrows#Seven Sorrows|seven dolors of Mary]]. Also, roses or another type of flower may be wrapped around the heart.

== Veneration ==
{{The Sacred Heart}}
The veneration of the Heart of Mary is analogous to the worship of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]. There are, however, differences in this analogy as devotion to the heart of Jesus is especially directed to the "divine heart" as overflowing with love for humanity. In the devotion to Mary, however, the attraction is the love of her heart for Jesus and for God.&lt;ref name=bainvel/&gt;

The second difference is the nature of the devotion itself: in the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the [[Roman Catholic]] venerates in a sense of love responding to love,  in the devotion to the Heart of Mary, study and imitation hold as important a place as love.&lt;ref name=bainvel/&gt; The aim of the devotion is to unite humankind to God through Mary's heart, and this process involves the ideas of consecration and reparation.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/mary/popular-marian-devotions/the-immaculate-heart-of-mary/ "The Immaculate Heart of Mary", Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the devotion being to love God and Jesus better by uniting one's self to Mary for this purpose and by imitating her virtues. (There also exists a private devotion to the Most Chaste Heart of [[Saint Joseph]], the spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, foster-father of Jesus Christ God.)

== History of devotion ==
===Scriptural basis===
In Chapter 2 of [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]]'s gospel, the evangelist twice reports that Mary kept all things in her heart, that there she might ponder over them.&lt;ref name=mauriello&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/DevImacc.html Mauriello, Rev. Matthew R., "Devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary", University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; Luke 2:35 recounts the prophecy of Simeon that her heart would be pierced with a sword. This image (the pierced heart) is the most popular representation of the Immaculate Heart.&lt;ref name=bainvel/&gt;

St. John's [[Gospel]] further invited attention to Mary's heart with its depiction of Mary at the foot of the cross at Jesus' [[Passion (Christianity)|crucifixion]]. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] said of this that Mary was not merely passive at the foot of the cross; "she cooperated through charity in the work of our redemption".&lt;ref name=bainvel/&gt;

St. Leo said that through faith and love she conceived her son spiritually, even before receiving him into her womb,&lt;ref name=mauriello/&gt; and St. Augustine tells us that she was more blessed in having borne [[Christ]] in her heart than in having conceived him in the flesh.

===Various saints===
[[File:Pfärrich Pfarrkirche Marienstatue aus Fatima.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Statue depicting the Immaculate Heart of Mary as described by [[Sister Lúcia]], the famous visionary of [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]].]]
[[File:El Rosario de Fátima.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Immaculate Heart of Mary with the [[Rosary|Holy Rosary]] as Our Lady appeared at [[Fátima, Portugal]].]]

Devotion to the Heart of Mary began in the Middle Ages with saints like [[Anselm of Canterbury]], and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. It was practiced and developed by [[Mechtilde]], [[Gertrude the Great]] and [[Bridget of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Roten&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/h/heart-of-mary.php Roten, Johan G. "The Heart of Mary", Marian Library, University of Dayton, June 4, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is also discernible in the pious meditations on the ''[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]'' and the ''[[Salve Regina]]'', usually attributed either to [[Anselm of Lucca|Saint Anselm of Lucca]] (d. 1080) or Saint Bernard; and also in the large book "De laudibus Beatae Mariae Virginis" (Douai, 1625) by Richard de Saint-Laurent, Penitentiary of Rouen in the thirteenth century.

A little earlier it had been included by [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]] in the devotion to the joys and sorrows of Mary, by [[Hermann Joseph|Saint Hermann]] (d.1241) in his devotions to Mary, and somewhat later it appeared in Bridget of Sweden's "Book of Revelations". [[Bernardino of Siena|Saint Bernardine of Siena]] (d.1444), is sometimes called "Doctor of the Heart of Mary",&lt;ref name=Roten/&gt; and from him the Church has borrowed the lessons of the second nocturn for the feast of the Heart of Mary. [[Francis de Sales|Saint Francis de Sales]] speaks of the perfections of this heart, the model of love for God, and dedicated his "Theotimus" to it.

During this same period one finds occasional mention of devotional practices to the Heart of Mary, e.g., in the "Antidotarium" of Nicolas du Saussay (d. 1488),&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/marysimmaculateh013481mbp#page/n41/mode/2up Murphy, John F., ''Mary's Immaculate Heart'', The Bruce Publishing Company, Milwaukee, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt; in Pope [[Julius II]], and in the "Pharetra" of Lanspergius. In the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth, ascetic authors dwelt upon this devotion at greater length.

It was, however, Saint [[John Eudes]] (d. 1681) who propagated the devotion, to make it public, and to have a feast celebrated in honor of the Heart of Mary, first at [[Autun]] in 1648 and afterwards in a number of French dioceses. He established several religious societies interested in upholding and promoting the devotion, of which his large book on the ''Coeur Admirable'' (''Admirable Heart''), published in 1681, resembles a summary. Jean Eudes' efforts to secure the approval of an office and feast failed at Rome, but, notwithstanding this disappointment, the devotion to the Heart of Mary progressed. Eudes began his devotional teachings with the Heart of Mary, and then extended it to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHRIST/dev2hear.txt EWTN on the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life Of The Venerable John Eudes'' by Charles De Montzey, Cousens Press 2008, {{ISBN|1-4097-0537-4}} page 215&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was only in 1805 that Pope [[Pius VII]] allowed a feast to honor the Immaculate Heart of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;''Saints and feasts of the liturgical year'' by Joseph N. Tylenda 2003 {{ISBN|0-87840-399-X}} page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699 Father Pinamonti (d. 1703) published a short work on the Holy Heart of Mary in Italian, and in 1725, [[Joseph de Gallifet]] combined the cause of the Heart of Mary with that of the Heart of Jesus in order to obtain Rome's approbation of the two devotions and the institution of the two feasts. In 1729, his project was defeated, and in 1765, the two causes were separated, to assure the success of the principal one.

In its principal object this feast is identical with the feast of the "Inner Life of Mary", celebrated by the [[Sulpicians]] on 19 October. It commemorates the joys and sorrows of the Mother of God, her virtues and perfections, her love for God and her Divine Son and her compassionate love for mankind.&lt;ref name=Holweck&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10600a.htm Holweck, Frederick. "Feast of the Most Pure Heart of Mary." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 10 March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1643, St. John Eudes and his followers observed 8 February as the feast of the Heart of Mary.&lt;ref name=mauriello/&gt;
In 1799 [[Pius VI]], then in captivity in [[Florence]], granted the [[Bishop of Palermo]] the feast of the ''Most Pure Heart of Mary'' for some of the churches in his diocese. In 1805 [[Pope Pius VII]] made a new concession, thanks to which the feast was soon widely observed. Such was the existing condition when a twofold movement, started in Paris, gave fresh impetus to the devotion; the two factors of this movement were, first of all, the revelation of the "[[Miraculous Medal]]" in 1830, and then the establishment at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires of the Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners, which spread rapidly. 
On 21 July 1855, the Congregation of Rites finally approved the Office and Mass of the Most Pure Heart of Mary without, however, imposing them upon the Universal Church.

[[Pope Pius XII]] instituted the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1944 to be celebrated on 22 August,&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional [[octave (liturgy)|octave]] day of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare 22 August in the [[Tridentine Calendar]] with the same date on the [[General Roman Calendar as in 1954]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, [[Pope Paul VI]] moved the celebration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to the Saturday, immediately after the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This means in practice that it is now held on the third Saturday after [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 94, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as he closely associated the celebrations of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the [[Queenship of Mary]] from 31 May to 22 August, bringing it into association with the feast of her Assumption. Those who use the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] or an earlier one (but not more than 17 years before 1962) observe the day established by Pius XII.

It is kept as the patronal feast of the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]], of the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and of the Missionary Society of the Heart of Mary.&lt;ref name=Holweck/&gt;

The celebration of this feast is omitted in those years when it is impeded by a higher ranking feast. This would apply 
when it is due to fall on 24 June ([[Nativity of St John the Baptist]]) and
29 June ([[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]]), and more rarely
31 May ([[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]) and 3 July ([[Saint Thomas the Apostle]]).
It is also impeded when it is due to fall on 25 June and 30 June because of the coincidence of solemnities the day
before, necessitating the transfer of one of them to the following [available] day.
(Note that there may be variations in local calendars. For example, this feast is not impeded in
England and Wales in 2019 since Saints Peter and Paul will be celebrated on Sunday 30 June.)

==Related devotions==

===Seven Dolors===
{{Main|Our Lady of Sorrows}}
Traditional depictions of the IHM show it pierced with seven wounds or swords, in homage to the seven dolors of Mary.  The Seven Sorrows of Mary are a popular Roman Catholic devotion. There are devotional prayers which consist of meditation on her Seven Sorrows. One practice is to pray seven Hail Marys daily. The term "Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary" refers to the combined devotion of both the Immaculate Heart and the Seven Sorrows of Mary as first used by the Franciscan Tertiary [[Berthe Petit]].

===The Miraculous Medal===
[[File:Miraculous medal.jpg|thumb|140px|The Immaculate Heart pierced by a sword, appearing on the Miraculous Medal]]
{{Main|Miraculous Medal}}
The devotion to Mary's Heart has had a greater flowering following the manifestation of the Miraculous Medal to St. [[Catherine Labouré]] in 1830.&lt;ref name=mauriello/&gt; The Immaculate Heart is depicted on the Miraculous Medal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10115a.htm Glass, Joseph. "Miraculous Medal." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 20 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; pierced by a sword. The [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] also appears on the medal, next to the Immaculate Heart, crowned with thorns. The M on the medal signifies the Blessed Virgin at the foot of the Cross when Jesus was being crucified.

===Five First Saturdays===
[[Our Lady of Fátima]] asked that, in reparation for the [[sin]]s committed against her Immaculate Heart, on the first Saturday of five consecutive months a Catholic believer go to the [[Sacrament of Penance]] (within eight days before or after the first Saturday), receive the [[Holy Communion]], recite five decades of the [[Rosary]], and keep her company for 15 minutes while meditating on the 15 mysteries of the Rosary. She promised that, whoever would ever do this, would be given the graces necessary for [[salvation]] at the hour of one's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/~cathlife/First_Saturdays.html First Saturday Devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515115416/http://campus.udayton.edu/~cathlife/First_Saturdays.html |date=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.piercedhearts.org/hearts_jesus_mary/theology_alliance_hearts_calkins.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The joint devotion to the hearts was first formalized in the 17th century by St. [[John Eudes]] who organized the scriptural, theological and liturgical sources relating to the devotions and obtained the approbation of the Church, prior to the visions of St. [[Margaret Mary Alacoque]].&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Catholic worship: Trent to today'' by James F.

In the 18th and 19th centuries the devotions grew, both jointly and individually through the efforts of figures such as St. [[Louis de Montfort]] who promoted [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Catholic Mariology]] and St. Catherine Labouré's Miraculous Medal depicting the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword.&lt;ref&gt;''In Prayer With Mary the Mother of Jesus'' by Jean Lafrance 1988 {{ISBN|2-89039-183-3}} page 310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Companion to the Calendar: A Guide to the Saints and Mysteries'' by Mary Ellen Hynes 2007 {{ISBN|1-56854-011-6}} page 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Butler's lives of the saints'', Volume 12 by Alban Butler, Kathleen Jones, 2000 {{ISBN|0-86012-261-1}} page 245&lt;/ref&gt; The devotions, and the associated prayers, continued in the 20th century, e.g., in the [[Immaculata prayer]] of St. [[Maximillian Kolbe]] and in the reported messages of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] which stated that the Heart of Jesus wishes to be honored together with the Heart of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;''Youngest Prophet'' by Christopher Rengers 1998 {{ISBN|0-85342-815-8}} page 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The children of Fatima: Blessed Francisco &amp; Blessed Jacinta Marto'' by [[Leo Madigan]] 2003 OSV Press {{ISBN|1-931709-57-2}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The Popes have supported the individual and joint devotions to the hearts through the centuries; in 1956 the encyclical ''[[Haurietis aquas]]'', Pope Pius XII encouraged the joint devotion to the hearts, In 1979 the encyclical ''[[Redemptor hominis]]'', Pope John Paul II explained the theme of unity of Mary's Immaculate Heart with the Sacred Heart.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stravinskas, 2002, Catholic Dictionary, OSV Press {{ISBN|978-0-87973-390-2}} page 485&lt;/ref&gt; In his Angelus address on 15 September 1985 he coined the term ''The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary'', and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at [[Fátima, Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1986/september/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19860922_simposio-maria-gesu_en.html Pope John Paul II 1986 Speech at the Vatican Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Calkins, ''The Alliance of the Two Hearts and Consecration'', [[Miles Immaculatae]] XXXI (July/December 1995) 389-407.

==Acts of Consecration==
[[File:Statue of Pope Pius XII in Fatima Portugal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fatima Statue of [[Pope Pius XII]], who consecrated Russia and the World: ''Just as a few years ago We consecrated the entire human race to the Immaculate Heart of the [[Virgin Mary]], [[Mother of God]], so today We consecrate and in a most special manner We entrust all the peoples of Russia to this Immaculate Heart...'']]
During the third apparition at [[Fátima, Portugal]], on 13 July 1917, Our Lady allegedly said to the three little shepherds: ''God wishes to establish the devotion to her Immaculate Heart in the world'' in order to save souls from hell and bring about world peace, and also asked for the consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. Pope Pius XII, in his Apostolic Letter of 7 July 1952 ''[[Sacro Vergente]]'', consecrated Russia to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.

Also, the Blessed [[Alexandrina Maria da Costa|Alexandrina of Balazar]], in [[Portugal]], reported many private apparitions, messages and prophecies received directly from Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. In June 1938, based on the request of her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] Father Mariano Pinho, several bishops from Portugal wrote to [[Pope Pius XI]], asking him to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. At that time [[Eugenio Pacelli|Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli]] (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican, and later he performed the [[Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary|consecration of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Arthur Burton. ''Totus tuus: John Paul II's program of Marian consecration and entrustment'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-9635345-0-5}} page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1984 Pope John Paul II fulfilled this request again, when he made the solemn act of consecration of the world, and implicitly of Russia, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary before the miraculous statue of Our Lady of Fátima brought to Saint Peter's Square in the Vatican for the occasion. [[Sister Lúcia]], [[Discalced Carmelites|OCD]], then the only surviving visionary of Fátima apparitions, confirmed that the request of Mary for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was accepted by Heaven, and therefore, was fulfilled. 
Again on October 8, 2000, the same pope made an act of entrustment of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, Jubilee of Bishops, Rome, 8 October 2000, http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20001008_act-entrustment-mary_en.html ; retrieved June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, [[Pope Francis]] announced that he would consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on 13 October 2013, as part of the Marian Day celebration that involved the iconic statue of [[Our Lady of Fátima|Our Lady of the Rosary of Fátima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-to-consecrate-world-to-marys-immaculate-heart/ Catholic News Agency] - Pope Francis will consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interfaith relations in Kazan''' describe the status of the two major religious groups that inhabit the capital city of [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], in [[Russia]]. This region is populated by roughly even numbers of ethnic [[Tatars]] (42%), whose primarily religion is [[Sunni Islam]], and ethnic [[Russians]] (50%), whose primarily religion is Eastern [[Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graney|first=Kate|date=2007|title=Making Russia Multicultural Kazan at Its Millennium and Beyond|url=|journal=Problems of Post-Communism|volume=54|pages=17–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This relationship is notable because it serves as major case study of successful [[interfaith]] cooperation, particularly between [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] peoples. As a city, Kazan has established several mechanisms of sociopolitical regulation including bordering processes, political cooperation, and social openness.

== Historical background ==
Kazan is located at the confluence of the [[Volga]] and [[Kama]] rivers. The region of Tatarstan became Islamic in the year 922, and thus its Islamic history stretches back further historically than its Orthodox presence which was at one time viewed as the religious influence of conquerors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khakimov|first=Raphael|date=March 1996|title=Prospects of Federalism in Russia: A View from Tatarstan|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=27|pages=69–80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region developed with relative prosperity at the time of the takeover of the [[Kazan Khanate]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaykhutdinov|first=Renat|date=2010|title=Peaceful Tactics and Territorial Autonomy Formation: Analyzing Post-Soviet Transformation|url=|journal=The International Journal of the Humanities|volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the period of Kazan's 1552 defeat by [[Moscow]], periods of forced [[Christianization]] occurred.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derrick|first=Matthew|date=Winter 2010|title=Kazan: The Religiously Undivided Frontier City|url=|journal=Caucasian Review of International Affairs|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of Russian nation-building changed the discourse of Kazan into one of primarily Orthodox hegemony. 

Then, for much of the twentieth century, forced [[atheism]] characterized the religious space in Kazan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was influenced by the political discourses of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[modernization]] efforts undertaken to shift attention away from religious bounds and towards a centralized national identity. By the end of the Soviet period, Tatarstan was one of the most industrially advanced parts of the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, approximately 200,000 people lived in Kazan and only around 30,000 of that population was Tatar.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Christopher|date=2011|title=Russian Federalism and Tatarstan's Ethnic Peace|url=|journal=Federal Governance|volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hundred years later, Kazan's population is over 1 million with an equal ethnic split, following the common pattern of Soviet demographic shift and rapid [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Political institutions ==
Kazan is the capital of the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] which is a federal subject of the [[Russian Federation]]. Kazan is known as the “Third Capital” of Russia. It has achieved large wealth from oil and is therefore more financially independent from Moscow than nearby republics, in addition to its political power-sharing agreements with the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koesel|first=Karrie|date=October 2017|title=Religion and the Regime: Cooperation and Conflict in Contemporary Russia and China|url=|journal=World Politics|volume=69|pages=676–712|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the political institutions in Kazan are the discursive definitions of “in–out” groups that determine the social construction of identity. The sociopolitical boundaries enacted into the political narrative of the territory of Kazan helped ascertain its [[autonomy]] and identity as 'historically wronged'—yet deeply similar in proximity both physically and psychologically to Russia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This both stabilizes the political strength of Tatars within Tatarstan while aligning ethnic Russians more closely to Tatars than to Volga Russians who are their ethnic counterparts. 

Tatarstan's government publications aim to stress the common territory and culture of those who have formed the 'native land' and have lived a specific lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The unifying discourse of in Tatar public messaging is one of the political institutions that has served to created inclusive yet distinct urban environments in Kazan. Political focuses have been the protection, cohesion, and [[solidarity]] of the [[cultural identity]] of Tatarstan and proffering [[religious symbols]] from both major religious groups.

The multi-ethnic nature of modern Russia has been characterized by growth of [[nationalism]] and migration from neighboring areas.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myuller|first=Dmitriy|date=November 2016|title=Interethnic Relations Among the Students of the Republic of Tatarstan: On An Example of Students from Kazan Federal University|url=|journal=The Turkish Online Journal of Design, Art and Communication|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of [[federalism]] marks the ways in which Tatarstan interacts with the federal government while maintaining the ability to manage many internal affairs as 'Tatar'. The 1991 negotiation between Moscow and Kazan resulted in the ''Treaty on Delimiting the Jurisdictions and Mutual Transmissions of Authorities Between the Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan''. These agreements involved several regulatory relations regarding trade, finance, and defense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Known as the 'Tatarstan model', this experience of positive negotiations between a central government and a subnational region are regarded as a basis for the strength of interfaith and interethnic relations in the modern context and a rarity particularly among post-Soviet states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kazan's success can be attributed to the political stability, multi-leveled nature of treaties, and pressures of Tatar citizens to develop a working cooperative framework within the Russian Federation indicated movement towards independent but integrated political institutions in the region. 

As in its establishment of internal affairs regarding Muslim and Christian freedom to worship, politically, this Tatarstan-Russian Treaty settled roots of conflict with Moscow and developed on the paradox of both decentralized power and the strive towards respecting the heritage of the former-Soviet central government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Language use ===
{{More|Tatar language}}
Tatarstan is a dual-language environment that expresses both Tatar and Russian identity through the political institutions of [[official language]] policy. Street signs are one important marker of this in Kazan. In the 1990s, legislation passed ensuring the official status of both Russian and Tatar which led to the creation of bilingual street signs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Tatar language]] is a [[Turkic language]] closely related to Turkish and Azeri while the [[Russian language]] is a [[Slavic language]] more closely related to Ukrainian, Belarusian, and others. Around a decade after the creation of Tatar official language status, the decision was made to introduce the [[Latin alphabet]] in the urban environment of Kazan, which served to change the optics of Tatar more to that of other Turkic languages as well as European languages. 

The selection of official script is often employed in [[sociolinguistics]] for societies to indicate political alignments towards a certain [[hegemonic]] tradition or culture. However, this choice showed little of the 'walling'-type demarcation against prior scripts that is found in many other bilingual environments. Instead, this choice is a more invisible spatial–political pattern that has not threatened  cooperative relations. Given the importance of script both in political, religious, and personal domains, Tatar's changes with Latin indicated a certain relationship bound with former [[Cyrillic]]-dominated and thus Russian-dominated sociolinguistic realities. 

== Social attitudes ==
Social attitudes in Kazan on an interfaith level also indicate a high level of cooperation. Studies of the youth of Tatarstan indicate current attitudes about the interfaith relations of are generally stable as many of the conflictogenic factors, such as resentments towards other nationalities or [[xenophobic]] tendencies, are largely absent in surveys.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

An 84% majority of youth in Tatarstan indicated in a 2016 study that nationality was not a determining factor in communicating with other people and that the government has a crucial role in maintaining peaceful relations both internationally and within Tatarstar. Over 50% of the respondents feel the proximity of different nationalities is a benefit and would like to learn more about the customs of other groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

These results from a student population at [[Kazan Federal University]] sample the attitudes that are held at the level of the education system and at a household-level in terms of respect for difference in an ethnoreligious sense. While the younger population does show elements of slippage towards ethnic nationalism for example in [[social media]] circles, generally it is found that this population—which is engaged in building the current intellectual discourse around the city—hold a positive or ambivalent view of interethnic relations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Conflict avoidance mechanisms ==
[[File:Kazan Kremlin Qolsharif Mosque 08-2016 img2.jpg|thumb|The Qolsharif Mosque in the Kazan Kremlin]]
Interfaith relations in Kazan operate under several key conflict-avoidance mechanisms. Socio-spatial borders are constructed in Tatarstan through the use of [[narratives]] and symbols that constitute a 'bordering process' and establishes a sense of place for both ethnic Tatars and Russians.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These borders provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms through which Tatarstan has been successful in mitigating strife.

The notion that religious narratives and symbols are not immutable—that is, they are able to evolve and change within new political realities—helps account for the relative non-divisiveness of the religious worlds of Kazan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reinterpretation of these symbols, such as in architecture, language, and family life, has happened as Kazan political leaders initiated bridging efforts between Muslim Tatars and Christian Russians which prevented any bases of resentments from manifesting into larger-scale conflict.  

Tatars have used [[Islamic]] religious symbols to ascertain a special status within the Russian federative framework and within Tatarstan as an ethnic homeland identity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yusupova|first=Guzel|date=2016|title=The Islamic representation of Tatarstan as an answer to the equalization of the Russian regions|url=|journal=Nationalities Papers|volume=44|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet system of ethnic federalism called for titular ethnic groups to enjoy special privileges in their territories and post-Soviet Tatarstan has employed the use of Islamic representations to continue to legitimize the public space of Tatar.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, Soviet Orthodox symbolism is present in the city which sustains the long tradition of ethnic Russian religious practice. 

Interfaith relations are also seen through the construction of key architectural pieces that establish either Tatar Islamic or Russian Orthodox presence, such as in the construction of [[Qolşärif Mosque|Qolsharif Mosque]] inside of the [[Kazan Kremlin]]. Rather than seeing this as an accosting of Russian power, the Kazan environment recognizes this with a sense of normalcy and status-quo to the interfaith peace. Concurrent with this project, the Tatar government ordered the refurbishment of the Cathedral of the Annunciation. This act signified both the reaffirmation of Tatar statehood as well as the respect of Russian ethnic nation, distinct 'from' but not 'against' the other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Temple of All Religions ===
{{More|Temple of All Religions}}
[[File:All Religions Kazan Temple 110.jpeg|alt=The Templee of All Religions, Kazan, Tatarstan|thumb|The Templee of All Religions, Kazan, Tatarstan]]
In addition, architecture serves as a cohesive ground for integrating Kazan not only in distinct coexisting places but within one site. The [[Temple of All Religions]] is a religious complex in the [[Staroye Arakchino]] [[Microdistrict]] of Kazan which is notable in its cohesion of several types of religious architectural elements which include an Orthodox [[Church (building)|church]], a [[mosque]], a [[synagogue]], and others. Construction began in 1992 by Kazan artist [[Ildar Khanov (artist)|Ildar Khanov]] and it serves as a cultural hub and residence for Khanov.

The Temple's mission is to depart from the traditional paradigm of housing only one religion and instead provide a 'temple of culture and truth' which peacefully combines the different cultural influences found in Kazan. The structure also serves as a center for the treatment of alcoholism, drug addiction, and other conditions and is attended by visitors both for these services and for experiencing its unique combination of religious symbols. 

== Global perspective  ==
Kazan's interfaith relations have attracted considerable attention given current global breakdowns towards interethnic and political strife. [[Hillary Clinton]]'s October 2009 visit to Kazan also indicated the [[US Department of State]]'s recognition of Kazan as a case study of productive interfaith relations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:RIAN archive 477235 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Tatarstan.jpg|alt=U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Tatarstan in 2009|thumb|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Tatarstan in 2009]]
Bearing in mind many of its geographic and historical factors, dominant social science theory might anticipate greater levels of conflict. Examples of cities in a similar geographic and historic position often exhibit characteristics traditionally associated with division.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Among these characteristics are disputes over sovereignty, the issue of political legitimacy, and active unrest and conflict in the public space. 

Kazan has been identified as a [[frontier city]] in terms of its religious demographic composition. Frontier cities exist along the 'fault lines' of ethnic and religious division and are often the place of dispute because they represent the ideal zone of power afforded to discrete territories of one group over another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For frontier cities, issues of cultural and religious identity by claiming specific lands often trump a more generalized focus on the acquisition of new resources and sovereignty. In other words, the meaning placed on the '[[indivisible good]]' of a specific city may instigate opposing groups' collective action against any perceived incursion on that space. These discourses are largely absent in modern-day Kazan where the urban space is interpreted in a more spatially integrated system. 

Kazan's trajectory is often contrasted with histories of cities of major religious contact which can also be identified specifically as 'religious frontier cities'. Major among these are [[Jerusalem]], which has long been the nexus of the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict, as well as [[Sarajevo]], where tensions between Muslim and Christian groups wrought violent ethnic conflict in the 1990s, or [[Belfast]], where ethno-nationalist conflicts spurred riots across Northern Ireland throughout the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Whereas, for instance, in the case of the bridge separating the Catholics and Muslims in [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia]]—or the [[Berlin Wall]] characterizing political divide in Germany—the focus was on spatial segregation and clear lines of demarcation, Kazan's methodology has reduced antagonism by focusing on the social and economic benefits of interethnic peace and the incentive to cooperate not only on political but also religious and cultural bases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An explanation for this, popular in other regions, is the aggressive [[state atheist]] policies of [[German Democratic Republic]]'s [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]. However, the enforcement of atheism existed only for the first few years. After that, the state allowed churches to have a relatively high level of autonomy.&lt;ref name="nogod"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As those born after [[Reunification of Germany|reunification]], the oldest of whom would be about 28 in 2018, never directly experienced it, the argument that the DDR could be an influence in their lack of belief is problematic.

Also, the same high numbers of atheists do not exist in Western Germany, other European countries that have a history of [[state communism]] and Northern Europe generally.

Another explanation could be the secularizing trend (the "[[Kulturkampf]]") dating back to the second half of the 19th century in [[Prussia]] and through the [[Weimar Republic]] which was strongest in the states of [[Thuringia]] and [[Saxony]] as well as the [[Northern Crusades|late arrival of Christianity]] to the region as opposed to southern Europe where it was the state religion from late antiquity.

Christianity still has a notable presence in the rest of Germany, though a majority of the population in the Northern Bundesländer [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] are not registered members of the main Catholic and Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ekd.de/statistik/105157.html Church Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ekd.de/download/kirchenmitglieder_2015.pdf Church Statistics 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jainism]] has had a significant influence in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=jainism+in+gujarat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIjYLclIfqxgIV0fSACh2HYQXU#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism%20in%20gujarat&amp;f=false|title=Jainism|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jains believe that their 22nd [[Tirthankara]] (propagators of Jain religion) [[Neminath]] attained salvation on [[Girnar]] in Gujarat. Many other monks have also got salvation; especially on the holy mountains of Girnar and [[Shatrunjaya]]. The [[Jain councils]] were held in [[Vallabhi]] c. 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLNQKGcDIhsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=jainism+in+gujarat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBmoVChMIjYLclIfqxgIV0fSACh2HYQXU#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism%20in%20gujarat&amp;f=false|title=Jainism|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their canonical scriptures were written down during this council. King [[Vanaraja Chavda]] (c. 720-780 CE) of the [[Chavda dynasty]] was brought up by a Jain monk named Shilaguna Suri.

[[Jain temples]] are found in Gujarat from as early as the 6th and 7th centuries CE. It was patronized by the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukyas]] and [[Chavada]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75FlxDhZWpwC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=jainism+in+gujarat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBGoVChMIjYLclIfqxgIV0fSACh2HYQXU#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism%20in%20gujarat&amp;f=false|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhank Caves]] (3rd-7th century CE) in Rajkot district has Jain Tirthankara carvings. Northern Gujarat became a principle center of Jainism in the 13th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzpYb5UOeiwC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=jainism+in+gujarat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwCGoVChMIjYLclIfqxgIV0fSACh2HYQXU#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism%20in%20gujarat&amp;f=false|title=Cultural History of India|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known [[Old Gujarati]] text ''Bharat-Bahubali Ras'', was written by a Jain monk. Of the most important people in Gujarat's Jain history were the Acharya [[Hemachandra]] Suri and his pupil, the [[Chaulukya]] ruler [[Kumarapala (Chaulukya dynasty)|Kumarapala]].

'''Justin L. Barrett''' (born 1971) is an [[Americans|American]] [[cognitive scientist]], Director of the Thrive Center for Human Development in [[Pasadena, California]], Thrive Professor of Developmental Science, and Professor of Psychology at Fuller Graduate School of Psychology. He previously held a post as senior researcher of the Centre for Anthropology and Mind and The Institute for Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at [[Oxford University]].

==Career==
Barrett earned a B.A. in [[psychology]] from [[Calvin College]] and a Ph.D in experimental psychology (cognitive and developmental focus) from [[Cornell University]]. He served on the psychology faculties of Calvin College and the [[University of Michigan]] (Ann Arbor), and as a research fellow of the [[Institute for Social Research]].

Dr. Barrett is a founding editor of the ''Journal of Cognition &amp; Culture'' and is author of numerous articles and chapters concerning the [[cognitive science of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionofreligion.org/speakers.php?s=Justin+Barrett Speakers Bio Hawaii conference of the evolution of religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/staff/publications/justin.barrett.shtml Barrett's Selected Publications] at the [[University of Oxford]] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728102522/http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/staff/publications/justin.barrett.shtml |date=July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on evolution of religious belief==
Barrett is described in the [[New York Times]] as a  "prominent member of the byproduct camp" and "an observant Christian who believes in “an all-knowing, all-powerful, perfectly good God who brought the universe into being,” [and] “that the purpose for people is to love God and love each other.” He considers that “[[Christian theology]] teaches that people were crafted by God to be in a loving relationship with him and other people, Why wouldn’t God, then, design us in such a way as to find belief in divinity quite natural?” Having a scientific explanation for mental phenomena does not mean we should stop believing in them. “Suppose science produces a convincing account for why I think my wife loves me — should I then stop believing that she does?”&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=11&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;em&amp;en=166dbd9e75680e73&amp;ex=1173243600 Darwin's God] March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?''==
In  his book ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'' he suggests that "belief in God is an almost inevitable consequence of the kind of minds we have. Most of what we believe comes from mental tools working below our conscious awareness. And what we believe consciously is in large part driven by these unconscious beliefs." and "that beliefs in gods match up well with these automatic assumptions; beliefs in an all-knowing, all-powerful God match up even better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759106673 Book description ] - see also the preface [http://www.altamirapress.com/Chapters/Index.shtml?SKU=0759106673&amp;Site=altamirapress&amp;Title=Why%20Would%20Anyone%20Believe%20in%20God%3F&amp;FileType=PDF online here]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202081331/http://www.altamirapress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=%5EDB%2FCATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0759106673 |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaveri''' (anglicized as Cauvery), also referred as Ponni, is an [[India]]n river flowing through the states of [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is the third largest after [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]] in south India and the largest in Tamil Nadu which on its course, bisects the state into North and South. Originating in the foothills of [[Western Ghats]] at [[Talakaveri]], [[Kodagu]] in [[Karnataka]] it flows generally south and east through [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] and across the southern [[Deccan plateau]] through the southeastern lowlands, emptying into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through two principal mouths in [[Poompuhar]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. Amongst the river valleys, the Kaveri delta forms one of the most fertile regions in the country.

The Kaveri basin is estimated to be {{convert|81155|km2|mi2}} with many tributaries including [[Harangi Reservoir|Harangi]], [[Hemavati River|Hemavati]], [[Kabini]], [[Bhavani]], [[Arkavathy]], [[Lakshmana Tirtha]], [[Noyyal]] and [[Arkavati]]. The river's basin covers three states and a Union Territory as follows: [[Tamil Nadu]], {{convert|43856|km2|mi2}}; Karnataka, {{convert|34273|km2|mi2}}; [[Kerala]], {{convert|2866|km2|mi2}}, and [[Puducherry]], {{convert|160|km2|mi2}}.&lt;ref name="cwc databook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/integrated-hydrological-data-non-classified-river-basins-cwc-mowr-2012.pdf |title=INTEGRATED HYDROLOGICAL DATA BOOK|publisher= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rising in southwestern Karnataka, it flows southeast some {{convert|800|km|mi}} to enter the Bay of Bengal. In [[Mandya district]] it forms the island of [[Shivanasamudra]], on either side of which are the scenic [[Shivanasamudra Falls]] that descend about {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="waterfall"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=149|title=World Waterfall Database|accessdate=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is the source for an extensive [[irrigation system]] and for [[hydroelectric power]].&lt;ref name="cauvery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cauvery.com/shivasamudram.html|title=Shivasamudram Falls|publisher=cauvery.com|accessdate=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river has supported irrigated agriculture for centuries and served as the lifeblood of the ancient kingdoms and modern cities of [[South India]]. Access to the river's waters has pitted [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] against each other for decades.

== River course ==
After the river leaves the [[Kodagu]] hills and flows onto the Deccan plateau, it forms two islands in [[Mandya]] district's [[Srirangapatna]] and [[Shivanasamudra]]. First, comes the Srirangapatna which forms the sangam and then comes Shivanasamudra. At Shivanasamudra the river drops {{convert|320|ft|m|order=flip}}, forming the famous [[Shivanasamudra Falls]] known separately as ''Gagana Chukki'' and ''Bhara Chukki''.&lt;ref&gt;The Cauvery Trail : [http://paru.in/the-cauvery-trail Kaveri has many religious and tourism spots between KRS and Mettur ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702150826/http://paru.in/the-cauvery-trail |date=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia's first [[hydroelectric]] plant (built in 1902) was on the left falls and supplied power to the city of [[Bangalore]].

In its course through Karnataka, the channel is interrupted by 12 "anekattu" (dams) for the purpose of irrigation. From the Anekattu at Madadkatte, an artificial channel is diverted at a distance of {{convert|72|mi|km|order=flip}}, irrigating an area of {{convert|10000|acre|ha|order=flip}}, and ultimately bringing its [[water supply]] to the town of Mandya.

Three kilometres away from Srirangapatna, the Kaveri is the basis for the [[Ranganthittu Bird Sanctuary]]. Near Srirangapatna is also an [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]], the Bangara Doddi Nala, which was constructed in the 17th century by the [[Wodeyar]] [[maharaja of Mysore]], Ranadhira Kantirava, in memory of his favourite consort. It is said to be the only aqueduct where the water from a river, dammed upstream, is carried by the aqueduct over the very same river few miles downstream {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. This aqueduct also served as a motorable bridge until 1964.The kabini river tributary of Kaveri joins Kaveri at Tirumakudal Narasipura where triveni sangama takesplace along with mythological river Spatika. The [[Moyar River]] is an east flowing river originates in the Mudumalai, Bandipur, and Wayanad National Parks draining the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and is one of the tributaries to the Kaveri River.

The river enters Tamil Nadu through [[Dharmapuri district]] leading to the flat plains where it meanders. It drops into the [[Hogenakkal Falls]] just before it arrives in the town of [[Hogenakkal (village)|Hogenakkal]] in Tamil Nadu. The three minor tributaries, Palar, Chinnar and Thoppar enter into the Kaveri on her course, above [[Stanley Reservoir]] in [[Mettur]], where the dam has been constructed. It then flows further through the length of Erode district where the river Bhavani, running through the breadth of the district, merges with it. The confluence of the rivers Kaveri, Bhavani and Akash Ganga (mythological) is at the exact place of [[Bhavani, Tamil Nadu]] Kooduthurai or Tiriveni Sangamam, Northern part of Erode City.

While passing through [[Erode]], two more tributaries merge. Thirumani Mutharu joins it in a village called Kududurai in [[Namakkal district|Namakkal District]]. Noyyal and Amaravathi join it in [[Karur district]] before it reaches [[Tiruchirapalli district]]. Here the river becomes wide, with a sandy bed, and flows in an eastern direction until it splits into two at upper Anicut about {{convert|14|km|mi|0}} west of Tiruchirappalli. The northern branch of the river is called the [[Kollidam]] while the southern branch retains the name Kaveri and then goes directly eastwards into [[Thanjavur District]]. These two rivers join again and form the [[Srirangam]] island that is a part of the city of [[Tiruchirapalli]]. The oldest functional dam&lt;ref&gt;http://www.water-technology.net/features/feature-the-worlds-oldest-dams-still-in-use/&lt;/ref&gt;[[Grand Anicut]] or Kallanai was present at this place. From Thanjavur, the river splits and goes to few places in the Delta Kaveri.

== Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) 2018 ==

Acting on the Supreme Court's direction, the Centre constituted a Cauvery Water Management Authority (CMA) on 1st June 2018 to address the dispute over sharing of river water among Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry. 

On February 16 2018, the apex court had directed the government to form the CMA within six weeks in a verdict that marginally increased Karnataka's share of Cauvery water, reduced the allocation for Tamil Nadu and sought to settle the protracted water dispute between the two sout.

On June 22 2018, Despite opposition from Karnataka, the Central government constituted the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee as per the provisions in the Cauvery Management Scheme laid down by the Supreme Court. 

Central Water Commission chairman, S. Masood Hussain will head the CWMA and chief engineer of the Central Water Commission, Navin Kumar will be the first chairman of the CWRC. While the CWMA is an umbrella body, the CWRC will monitor water management on a day-to-day basis, including the water level and inflow and outflow of reservoirs in all the basin states.

It is the Japanese derivative of the Chinese '''[[gu (poison)|Gu]]''' magic.

To create kodoku, sorcerers would mix several insects in a jar, and let them kill one another until only one survived.  The fluids of the insect that survived would be used to poison an individual with a curse that would control them, cause them misfortune, or kill them. The remaining insect could also be used as a sort of "luck charm" granting the one who performed the ritual great wealth. In return the owner is supposed to feed the bug. Neglecting to do so would enrage the insect, if the owner does not equivalently repay the insect by placing all his or her riches beside a road, plus interest in gold and silver, the insect would devour the home owner. Therefore, this ritual could also be used as a death curse by giving the riches to an ignorant individual. The term "kodoku" can also be applied to the spirit which is the incarnation of this particular magic (which usually appears in the shape of a worm or other animal).
The technique was used in the [[Nara Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Kunimitsu, Kawamura.  "Tsukimono."  ''Encyclopedia of Shinto.'' http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=792&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
*The technique plays an important role in the first part of the 1985 [[historical fantasy]] novel ''[[Teito Monogatari]]''.  The protagonist [[Yasunori Katō]] is a master of ''kodoku'' magic and uses it to manipulate his victims.  The spirit is represented as an insectoid worm (腹中虫, fukuchu-mushi) which lives in the stomach of the victim.
*The term "spiritual kodoku" is used in the anime ''[[Ghost Hunt (novel series)|Ghost Hunt]]'' for a curse technique in which spirits are trapped like insects are in traditional kodoku practice. A dominant spirit devours the weaker spirits until it has enough power to kill the target of the curse. The only way to stop the curse is to "feed" the spirit as compensation.
* In ''[[InuYasha]]'' the main antagonist Naraku creates a kodoku inside a mountain to gather and merge hundreds of [[yōkai]] to form a new body for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode  | title = Jaki ni Ochita Kikyō to Inuyasha  | script-title = 邪気に落ちた桔梗と犬夜叉  | trans-title = Kikyo and Inuyasha, Into the Miasma  | series = [[Inuyasha]]  | date = June 25, 2001  | season = 2  | number = 5  | language = Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Liberal Catholicism}}
{{Liberal Catholic Movement sidebar}}
The name '''Liberal Catholic Church''' ('''LCC''') is used by a number of separate [[Christianity|Christian]] churches throughout the world which are open to [[esoteric]] beliefs and hold many ideas in common.

Though the term "Liberal Catholic" might suggest otherwise, it does not refer to [[liberalism|liberal]] groups within the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] but to groups within the "[[Independent Catholic]]" movement, unrecognised and not in communion with the [[Pope]] or the rest of the Catholic Church.

There are essentially two groups of Liberal Catholic churches: those which espouse [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical ideas]] and those which do not do so.

==History==

===Foundation===
The founding bishops of the Liberal Catholic churches were [[J. I. Wedgwood]] of the [[Wedgwood|Wedgwood China]] family and the Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. Wedgwood was a former Anglican priest who left the Anglican church on becoming a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] in 1904. After serving in several high offices in the [[Theosophical Society]], including being general secretary of the society in England and Wales from 1911 to 1913, he was ordained as a priest in the [[Old Catholic]] movement on July 22, 1913, by [[Arnold Harris Mathew]]. Matthew in turn was a former [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest who had left to be ordained as a bishop in the [[Old Catholic Church]], which had separated from papal authority in 1873 over the issue of [[papal infallibility]]. The Old Catholics  maintained that their ordinations were valid within the Catholic tradition, and the Liberal Catholic Church thus claims to trace its [[apostolic succession]] back to [[Rome]] through Old Catholicism.

In 1915 Wedgwood visited Australia in his capacity as Grand Secretary of the Order of Universal CoMasonry ([[Co-Freemasonry]] a branch of liberal or adogmatic Freemasonry consisting of mixed-sex lodges), another of the organisations in which he was prominent. On his return to England, he learned that Frederick Samuel Willoughby, a bishop of the Old Catholic Church of Britain, had become enmeshed in a homosexuality scandal and as a result had been suspended by Archbishop Mathew. He also learned that Mathew wanted all the clergy of the church to renounce Theosophy on the grounds that the beliefs of the Church and the Society were incompatible. Shortly afterwards Archbishop Mathew dissolved the Old Catholic Church in Great Britain and published a letter in ''[[The Times]]'' announcing his intention to return to the Roman Catholic Church.

Few bothered to reply to Archbishop Mathew. Willoughby offered to consecrate Wedgwood to the episcopate, but Wedgwood approached a number of other bishops seeking consecration, including the Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht [[Gerardus Gul]] (by whom Mathew had originally been consecrated), and Bishop Frederick James, a fellow Theosophist. Eventually, Wedgwood was consecrated as a bishop by Bishop Willoughby on 13 February 1916 with Bishop King and Bishop Gauntlett assisting.

With the Old Catholics continuing to disapprove of Mathew's creation in Britain, Wedgwood started the organisation that would later become the Liberal Catholic Church, of which he became the first [[Presiding Bishop]]. At the same time he maintained his close connections with the Theosophical movement, and many of Wedgwood's priests and bishops were simultaneously Theosophists.

===1941 schism===
In 1941 a schism occurred in the church due to breaches of canon law and the laws of the state of California on the part of the Presiding Bishop, which led to the church known abroad as the [[Liberal Catholic Church International]] earning the legal right to be known as the Liberal Catholic Church in the United States. In America, the entity originally known as the Liberal Catholic Church is known as "The [[Liberal Catholic Church, Province of the United States of America]]."&lt;ref&gt;Deceptio, Falsum, et Dissimulatio.  Matthews, Edward M. St. Alban Press, San Diego. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Catholic Church, Province of the United States of America is more Theosophical in belief while the Liberal Catholic Church International maintains freedom of belief and does not promote any singular philosophy or tradition.

===2003 schism===
In 2003 within the Liberal Catholic Church, the issue of the limitation of the right of a bishop to ordain candidates of his choice gave rise to a differences of opinions which resulted in two groups: a "traditional" and a more "liberal" one. The ordination of women was the primary point of conflict. Since both groups use the name "Liberal Catholic Church" distinguishing between the two may be confusing.

The article on the [[Liberal Catholic Movement]] provides more detail on this separation.

==Structure==
The Liberal Catholic Church is governed by three "General Episcopal Synods" of all bishops. The General Episcopal Synods are the assemblies of all bishops recognized as such by its members.  The synods meet formally from time to time and they elect a presiding bishop from among themselves. The current Presiding Bishops of the Liberal Catholic Church are the Right Reverend Graham Wale, for the conservative branch and the Right Reverend James Zinzow for the progressive one. The Liberal Catholic Church International's Presiding Bishop is Most Reverend James P. Roberts. The General Episcopal Synods also elect [[priest]]s to the episcopacy, with the approval of the  parishes of their respective provinces. The [[bishop]]s of the Liberal Catholic Church may hold office until the mandatory retirement age of 75. (There is no such rule for the Liberal Catholic Church International.)

Each province is governed by a regionary bishop who, in turn, may have one or more bishops functioning as assistants. A province may also have its own clerical synod of [[deacon]]s, priests and bishops. These clergy are seldom financially compensated and hold secular jobs. They also may marry and hold property.

Training for the clergy varies from province to province. The Liberal Catholic Institute of Studies was created to standardise the program of studies for the development of future deacons and priests, but laypersons may follow the courses as well. The Liberal Catholic Church International's (LCCI) clergy training program is called the St. Alban Theological Seminary. The Universal Catholic Church's (an offshoot of the LCCI) is called the St. Clement (of Alexandria) Seminary.

The Liberal Catholic Church also has monasteries although they are not official.

==Teaching==
According to church teaching, the Liberal Catholic Church draws its central inspiration from an earnest faith in a [[Christ]] who is eternal, being alive before, during, and after the events of the New Testament, to the present day.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Liberal Catholicism finds any form of Christian worship valid as long as it is earnest and true, and that individuals can experience the presence of Christ. But it also holds that Christ also appointed certain rites or [[sacraments]], called "mysteries" in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to be handed down in the church as special channels of power and blessing. Through these "means of grace" the Liberal Catholic Church believes that Christ is ever present within his church, in fellowship and [[Communion (Christian)|communion]], guiding and protecting them from [[birth]] to [[death]]. Many in the Liberal Catholic Church believe that there are many churches because there are many ways in which people want to worship [[God]].{{facts|date=May 2017}}

Many in the church accept the concept of purgatory, and in the Liturgy of the Mass the priest prays for the dead. The church is open to [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnC6KSp1LBM |title=Christianity and reincarnation, Kristendomen och reinkarnation |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingsgarden.org/english/organizations/lcc.gb/Summary.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026013750/http://kingsgarden.org/english/organizations/lcc.gb/Summary.html |date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacraments and apostolic succession==
According to the Liberal Catholic Church's ''Statement of Principles'', "The Liberal Catholic Church recognises seven fundamental [[sacrament]]s, which it enumerates as follows: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], Holy [[Eucharist]], [[Absolution]], Holy [[Unction]], Holy [[Matrimony]], and [[Holy Orders]]. It claims an unbroken [[apostolic succession]] through the Old Catholic [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Union of Utrecht]] and claims that its orders are 'acknowledged as valid throughout the whole of those churches of [[Christendom]] which maintain the [[apostolic succession]] of orders as a tenet of their [[faith]]." The LCC International has modified their Statement of Principles to read "it (the LCC) has preserved an episcopal succession that is valid, as understood throughout the whole of those churches in Christendom that maintain the apostolic succession as a tenet of their faith." The LCC International permits the ordination of non-celibate [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|gays and lesbians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalcatholic.tripod.com/services.htm |title=Services of The Liberal Catholic Church |publisher=Liberalcatholic.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingsgarden.org/English/Organizations/LCC.gb/LCIS/Scriptures/Liberal/Cooper/Ceremonies/BlueBook/INDEX_S.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111334/http://kingsgarden.org/English/Organizations/LCC.gb/LCIS/Scriptures/Liberal/Cooper/Ceremonies/BlueBook/INDEX_S.htm |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unity of all religions==
The Liberal Catholic Church believes that there is a body of doctrine and mystical experience common to all the great [[religion]]s of the world and which cannot be claimed as the exclusive possession of any. Moving within the orbit of [[Christianity]] and regarding itself as a distinctive Christian church it nevertheless holds that the other great religions of the world are also divinely inspired and that all proceed from a common source, though religions may stress different aspects of the various teachings and some aspects may even temporarily be ignored. These teachings, as facts in nature, rest on their own intrinsic merit. They form that true catholic faith which is [[catholic]] because it is the statement of universal principles. The LCC bases these beliefs on what [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] said: "The identical thing that we now call the Christian religion existed among the ancients and has not been lacking from the beginnings of the human race until the coming of Christ in the flesh, from which moment on the true religion, which already existed, began to be called Christian." (Retract I. XIII,3).

This is a '''list of former mosques in Portugal'''.  It lists some but by no means all of the former mosques of [[Portugal]]. It lists former [[Muslim]] [[mosques]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Mezquita [[Arabic]]: Masjid) and [[Islamic]] places of worship in Portugal.  

The term '''former mosque''' in this list includes any [[mosque]] (building) or site used for Islamic Prayer ([[Salah]]) in Portugal but is not so any longer.  

Most of the former Portuguese mosques were built and used as Muslim places of worship during the [[Al-Andalus]] era when several Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] kingdoms and empires ruled large parts of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including most of modern Portugal. Many former mosques and Islamic religious buildings were either converted into churches or demolished after the Christian [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web |title=5 Most Impressive Historic Mosques in Spain |url=http://historylists.org/architecture/5-most-impressive-historic-mosques-in-spain.html |website=historylists.org |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this list does not include the [[List of former mosques in Spain|former mosques in Spain]] that were built during [[Al-Andalus|Al-andalus]] period.

Mosques were important buildings during Arab Moor rule in Portugal. They formed an important part of [[Moorish architecture]]. Portuguese mosques and religious buildings had a square plan layout. [[Minaret]] towers were normally built in a corner of the mosque. They were used for announcing the Islamic prayer call known as [[Adhan]], five times a day. The [[qibla]] or direction the faithful should face when performing Islamic prayers ([[Salah]]) was indicated by a small niche called [[mihrab]] on the main wall. The mihrab and minaret usually projected out from the main walls of the mosque.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/moorish-architecture-in-portugal.html|title=Moorish Architecture in Portugal|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some mosques like the former Great mosque of Silves, water tanks or cisterns were built to store and supply water for [[Wudu]], the washing ritual performed before prayers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Horseshoe arches were a distinctive Iberian Moor architectural feature. They were commonly used to frame doorways, windows or just as decoration in Portuguese mosques. Four horseshoe doorways remain that opened into a inner courtyard or [[Sahn]] remain in Mertola mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;pt;Mon01;10;en|title=Mértola Mosque|last=|first=|date=|website=islamicart.museumwnf.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mihrabs]], horseshoe arches and door frames were decorated with detailed patterns formed by intertwining lines, known as arabesque. They had patterns of geometric and floral motifs. Simple shapes, repeated in symmetrical arrays giving a beautiful artistic finish.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Unfortunately unlike neighboring Spain only a few of these original mosques and religious structures are still standing.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

[[Image:Conway Hall South Place Ethical Society night.jpg|thumb|220px|Conway Hall Humanist Centre, home of the [[South Place Ethical Society]], the oldest [[freethought]] community in the world. (Established 1793)]]

'''Secularist organizations''' promote the view that [[morality|moral standards]] should be based solely on concern for the good of humanity in the present, without reference to [[supernatural]] concepts, such as [[God]] or an [[afterlife]], any desire to do good for a reward after death, or any fear of punishment for not believing in life after death. The term ''[[secularism]]'', as coined and promulgated by [[George Jacob Holyoake]], originally referred to such a view.&lt;ref&gt;"Secularism". ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Secularism'' may also refer to the belief that [[Secular state|government should be neutral on matters of religion]], and that [[Separation of church and state|church and state should be separate]]. The term here is used in the first sense, though most organizations listed here also support secularism in the second sense.

== Background ==
'''Secularists''', and their organizations, identify themselves by a variety of terms, including, [[Brights movement|bright]], [[Freethought|freethinker]], [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalist]], [[Rationalist movement|rationalist]], or [[Religious skepticism|skeptic]].&lt;ref&gt;The Secular Coalition for America, which has been [http://www.the-brights.net/movement/bulletin/bulletin.html?b=45 identified] by Brights.net as representing the interests of "secularist organizations", describes its constituency as "nontheistic Americans", including those who go by the labels "atheist, humanist, freethinker, agnostic, skeptic, bright, ignostic, materialist, and naturalist, among others." [http://www.secular.org/constituency.html Who does the Secular Coalition for America represent?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416200747/http://www.secular.org/constituency.html |date=2008-04-16 }} at the [http://www.secular.org/ Secular Coalition for America website] (Accessed 5 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some less common secularist labels include: [[Apatheism|apatheist]], [[Nontheism|godless]] (in the non-pejorative, literal sense), [[Ignosticism|ignostic]], [[infidel]] (or unbeliever), [[Pagan#Heathen|heathen]], [[Materialism|materialist]], or [[Scientific realism|realist]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the use of these various terms, the organizations listed here have secularist goals in common. Note that, while most of these organizations and their members consider themselves [[Irreligion|irreligious]], there are certain exceptions ([[Ethical Culture]], for example).

In some jurisdictions, a provincial or national '''humanist society''' may confer upon [[Humanist officiant]]s the ability to conduct memorial services, child naming ceremonies or [[marriage commissioner|officiate marriages]] &amp;mdash; tasks which would be carried out by clergy in most [[organised religion|organized religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanistcanada.ca/content/humanist-weddings Humanist Canada: Humanist Weddings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-03-humanists-stand-ready-to-perform-same-sex-marriage-ce American Humanist Association: Humanists Stand Ready to Perform Same-Sex Marriage Ceremonies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanist-society.org/celebrants/ The Humanist Society Listing of Humanist Celebrants]&lt;/ref&gt;

This ceremony is a late afternoon or early evening festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browngirlmagazine.com/2013/03/wedding-season-wedding-wear/|title=Wedding Season: Wedding Wear|date=2013-03-31|work=Brown Girl Magazine|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the couple's parental homes. It consists of many rites, including the ''Batna'', ''Choora'', ''Jaggo'' fireworks and sometimes the Ladies ''[[Sangeet (music)|Sangeet]]'' and ''[[mehndi]]''.

== The Ceremony ==

One day before the wedding, the ceremony of mayian is performed at the couple's respective homes. The prospective bride or groom is seated on a wooden plank called a ''patri'', and a red cloth is held above by four female relatives, while married women of the household and ''[[baradari (brotherhood)|biradari]]'', led by the mother, rub a paste of turmeric, flour and [[mustard oil]] on his or her face, arms and legs. During the ritual women sing traditional songs and those of the biradari receive the ritual gift of ''gogley'' (Punjabi sweets specially cooked for weddings) at the end of the ceremony.

===Choora===

On the morning before the wedding, a ritual of ''choora'' or ''chura'' is performed at the bride-to-be's residence, involving a set of ivory and red bangles. Her maternal uncle makes a gift of clothes, jewellery and some cash called ''nankey-shak''. He puts the bangles on his niece while the women sing traditional songs depicting the role of maternal uncles. Before the wedding ceremony, the bride-to-be takes a ritual bath and dresses in the clothes in which she will be wed, provided by her maternal uncles. Similarly, the bridegroom-to-be also receives a set of clothes called ''sherwani'' from his maternal uncles which he, too, wears at the wedding ceremony. It signifies the importance of the role of the mother's natal family at the wedding rituals, and reinforces the alliance established at the mother's own wedding.

===Batna===

In the ''Batna'' rite, the couple's families rub yellow [[turmeric]] paste upon their legs, face, and arms while sitting on a ''patri'' (a special red board with embroidery) below a red cloth held by four women. This is done to cleanse and balance the body for married life.

===Jaggo===

In the ''Jaggo'' ceremony, the family dances and sings on the road in front and around the beautifully decorated wedding home. Jaggo is held in the last hours of the night. Copper vessels called "gaffers" are decorated with [[diya (lamp)|divas]] (clay lamps), filled with [[mustard oil]], and lit. The bride/bridegroom's maternal aunt (''mammi'') carries it on her head, and another lady carries a long stick with bells, which she shakes. The ladies then go into other friends' and families' homes to be welcomed with sweets and drinks. They dance there and move on. It is a solemn ceremony filled with joy, dancing, fireworks, and food. The Ladies ''Sangeet'' (Ladies' Night of Singing) and ''[[mehndi]]'' might follow the ''mayian'' and dinner.

'''Mersin Interfaith Cemetery''' ({{lang-tr|Mersin Şehir Mezarlığı}}, also called '''Mersin Asri Cemetery''' and '''Akbelen Cemetery'''), is a burial ground in [[Mersin]], [[Turkey]]. It is notable for being a common cemetery of all religions  and includes graves of [[Muslim]]s, [[Christians]], and [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;

==Geography==
The rectangular cemetery is located in the Yusuf Kılıç neighborhood, one of the northernmost neighborhoods of Mersin. The bird's flight distance to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast (hence the city center) is {{convert|3.6|km}}. Administratively, the cemetery is part of the [[Toroslar]] Municipality.&lt;ref name="Mezarlık"/&gt; Akbelen Boulevard, which connects the city center to the [[Toros Mountains]], is to the west and Okan Merzeci Boulevard, which is a ring road of Mersin, is to the south of the cemetery.&lt;ref name="Map"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netkayit.com/adres_arabul.php?adres=Mersin-Merkez_Asri-Mezarlik |title="Asri Mezarlık - Mersin Merkez" Harita üzerinde|language=Turkish|trans-title="Asri Cemetery Mersin Central" on the map|publisher=Netkayıt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main gate is on the south wall. The total area of the cemetery is about {{convert|360|daa|m2}}, including a "soldiers-memorial cemetery" ({{lang-tr|şehitlik}}).

==History==
[[File:Mersin Cemetery b.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Muslim and Christian graves in Mersin Interfaith Cemetery]]
Until the 1930s there were many small cemeteries in the urban fabric of Mersin. But as the city grew, establishing a new and large cemetery became one of the priorities of the municipality. Mayor [[Mithat Toroğlu]] assigned German architect [[Hermann Jansen]] to prepare a city plan for Mersin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jfa.arch.metu.edu.tr/archive/0258-5316/2012/cilt29/sayi_2/1-34.pdf|date=27 April 2012|title=Planning as a Tool for Modernization in Turkey: The Case of Hermann Jansen's Plan for Mersin |first1=Burak|last1=Beyhan|first2=Selçuk|last2=Uğuz|publisher=[[Middle East Technical University]]|doi=10.4305/METU.JFA.2012.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 the Mersin cemetery was established in one of the locations that Jansen proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yumuktepe.com/mersinin-dizili-tarihi-ziya-aykin/ |title=MERSİN’İN KRONOLOJİK TARİHİ |first=Ziya|last=Aykin|language=Turkish|trans-title=Chronological History of Mersin |year=2013|publisher=Yumuktepe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery originally measured {{convert|260|decare}} and was located outside the city's residential area. Later the grounds were expanded. Toroğlu initiated a project of transferring corpses to the new cemetery, which was used up until the 2010s. There are now about 75,000 graves in the cemetery.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=not-only-bodies-but-prejudices-buried-in-mersin-cemetery-2008-03-10 |title=Not only bodies, but prejudices buried in Mersin Cemetery|first=İZGİ |last=GÜNGÖR|work=Hurriyet Daily News|date=10 March 2008|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the cemetery is completely filled and new quarters of the city have been established around the cemetery. The municipality has established new cemeteries that are farther away from the city center.

==Interfaith characteristics==
In Turkey all religions traditionally use many different cemeteries for their burials.   Mersin City Cemetery is an exception. While different religions were initially separated by section, spousal burials brought different religions into the same plot (newspaper columnist [[Özdemir İnce]] notes that one family plot has a Muslim man and Jewish woman) and gradually the sections opened to all religions.&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="İnce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=193737 |title=Medeniyetler buluşması|language=Turkish|trans-title=Meeting of the Civilizations|first=Özdemir |last=İnce|date=5 January 2004|publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 5,000 of the graves in the cemetery are of Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; On 26 February 1998 the cemetery was included in the ''List of Cultural Property'' of the [[Ministry of Culture (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/mersin/Haber/Genel/Normal/mezarlikta-hosgoru-dersi-verdiler/c4b8d326-8008-431e-9e5c-657efb0e2b69|title=Mezarlıkta hoşgörü dersi verdiler|trans-title=Cemeteries Gave Lessons in Tolerance|language=Turkish|date=25 January 2005|work=Kenthaber.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131223195400/http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/mersin/Haber/Genel/Normal/mezarlikta-hosgoru-dersi-verdiler/c4b8d326-8008-431e-9e5c-657efb0e2b69|archivedate=23 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

İnce recalls that in 2003, both Christian [[priest]]s and Muslim hocas prayed during the burial ceremony of Hanri Atat, a celebrity of Mersin.&lt;ref name="İnce"/&gt; In 1999, Lina Nasif, a painter and a citizen of Mersin, organized an annual multi-religion ceremony, called a "traditional praying ceremony" ({{Lang-tr|geleneksel dua töreni}}), to stress and preserve the characteristics of the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haberler.com/mersin-sehir-mezarligi-nda-semavi-dinler-bulusmasi-5185952-haberi/|title=Mersin Şehir Mezarlığı'nda Semavi Dinler Buluşması|trans-title=Mersin City Cemetery Abrahamic Religions Gathering|language=Turkish|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=13 January 2014|publisher=Haberler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony, hocas and priests pray and give speeches on peace. Hymns are sung in several languages. In a 2009 ceremony, Mersin mayor [[Macit Özcan]] stressed that the deceased of different religions all lay in peace and everybody should do his/her best to keep this feature of the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersin.bel.tr/mbb-sayfa-haber.asp?id=1267 |title=BAŞKAN ÖZCAN, "BÜTÜN DİNLERİN ORTAK NOKTASI SEVGİDİR"|language=Turkish|trans-title=President Özcan: "The mid-point of all religions is love"|year=2009|publisher=Department of Information Processing of Mersin Metropolitan Municipality, Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mirari vos''''' - Latin: I was surprised - (On Liberalism and Religious Indifferentism), sometimes referred to as '''''Mirari vos arbitramur''''', is the first [[Papal Encyclical|encyclical]] of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and was issued in August 1832.  Addressed "To All Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World", it is general in scope.

==Background==
[[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Felicité Robert de Lamennais]], [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]] started a newspaper, ''L'Avenir'' ("The Future"). While the paper was a strong proponent of [[Ultramontanism]], supporting the authority of the papacy in opposition to nationalist and secularist ideas, it also advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, and universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. They saw no conflict between Catholicism and liberal reform. The conservative French hierarchy regarded such views as dangerous nonsense. In November 1831, Lammennais and Montalembert traveled to [[Rome]], seeking confirmation from Pope Gregory that views expressed in their newspaper were orthodox.

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;[https://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/lamann.htm Bernard, Cook. "Lamennais, Hugues-Felicité Robert de (1782-1854)", ''Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions'', (James Chastain, ed.), Ohio University, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; After much opposition, they gained an audience on March 15, 1832, only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. [[Klemens von Metternich]], whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtbLJZOKxx8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Singulari+Nos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-NiMTwLNwx&amp;sig=LFTMJ0M5z-1cTIdbK7NME2T7whg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihvtST-aHJAhXL1B4KHe4BBxQ4ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Singulari%20Nos&amp;f=false Chadwick, Owen. "Gregory XVI", ''A History of the Popes, 1830-1914'', Oxford University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|9780199262861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope's advisors were convinced that if he said nothing, it would viewed that he did not disapprove of Lamennais's opinions. ''Mirari vos'' was issued the following August, criticizing Lamennais's views without mentioning him by name.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

==Content== 
He voiced support for Christian freedom, upheld the ecclesiastical supremacy of the papacy and raised concerns over alliances that were too close between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated a married clergy: "We ask that you strive with all your might to justify and to defend the law of clerical celibacy as prescribed by the sacred canons, against which the arrows of the lascivious are directed from every side."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/greg16/g16mirar.htm Pope Gregory XVI, ''Mirari vos'', §11, Rome, August 15, 1832]&lt;/ref&gt; He also denounced those who advocated divorce{{sfn|Mirari vos, §12}} and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

He attacked religious [[indifferentism]], which was defined as the opinion that one religion is as good as another, which he saw as the basis for the argument for liberty of conscience. He saw it as the state's duty to restrain the promotion of false truth, which leads to immorality and so denounced freedom to publish or distribute any writings indiscriminately. Owen Chadwick explains Gregory's perspective: "To provide legally that writers or speakers shall be free to promote what is not true or to utter words that declare that racial prejudice, or paederasty, or pornography, or adultery, or murder not to be sins, cannot be what God demands of any State.{{sfn|Chadwick, p. 25}}

He stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some are so carried away that they contentiously assert that the flock of errors arising from them is sufficiently compensated by the publication of some book which defends religion and truth. Every law condemns deliberately doing evil simply because there is some hope that good may result. Is there any sane man who would say poison ought to be distributed, sold publicly, stored, and even drunk because some antidote is available and those who use it may be snatched from death again and again?{{sfn|Morari vos, §15}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor his detractors.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

The '''Northern Palace''', also called the '''North Palace''', is located in the abandoned [[North City, Amarna|Northern Suburbs]] of the city of Ahketaten (modern [[Amarna]], in [[Egypt]]). This palace should not be confused with the [[North Riverside Palace]] further north in Amarna. &lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reeves"/&gt;

The North Palace is situated between the North Suburb and the North City of Amarna. It is an isolated building facing west to the river and oriented perpendicularly with respect to an extension of the Royal Road.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;  The rectangular structure is arranged around a large open space. &lt;ref&gt; Amarna Project Website [http://amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/north_palace/index.shtml|North Palace]&lt;/ref&gt; On one end of the open space is a throne-room complex. The complex included a pillared hall and a stone built balcony. Next to that area was the private bedroom and bathroom. &lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;

To the north of the throne room is a garden court with rooms for personal servants. The staff may have included the unguent preparer Ramose known from two letters that place in Meritaten's household. To the south of the throne-room are further servant quarters. On one side of the open center is and area that was used to house animals. The mangers were decorated with images of cattle, ibexes and antelopes. The structure featured limestone feeding troughs and mangers combined with tethering stones. &lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;

The palace is well known for its decorations. &lt;ref name="Reeves"/&gt; Many of the decorations were found in their original position. Common themes include papyrus plants growing in a swampy environment with birds and butterflies. &lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt; Kemp, Barry, The City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People, Thames and Hudson, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The residence was initially the home of one of [[Akhenaten]]'s Queens. It had been proposed that the palace was the home of the [[great Royal Wife]] [[Nefertiti]], and that the palace was later given as the primary residence of the eldest royal daughter [[Meritaten]]. In recent times however it has become clear that the palace was the home of Queen [[Kiya]], and that after her death the palace became the residence of Meritaten. &lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;Reeves, Nicholas.

'''Oz Almog''' is an Israeli artist and author who was born on 15 April 1956, in [[Kfar Saba]], Israel.

==Biography==
Oz Almog was born to a family of Russian/Ukrainian pioneers (Avrutzki) and Romanian/Russian immigrants (Abramovich). After studying classical painting and completing his military service in the [[Israeli Navy]], he studied at the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]].

==Work==
Oz Almog's artistic work is confrontational and provocative. In the 1980s, as a student of the Academy of Fine Arts in Austria, Almog took an active part with in off-scene underground culture in Europe. In the 1990s he addressed complex issues of human sexuality, totalitarian ideologies, consumerism and terrorism. In 1994, his ''Birth of a Myth'' (German title ''Geburt eines Mythos'') exhibition took place at WUK, an alternative arts center in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;GEBURT EINES MYTHOS http://bildung-beratung.wuk.at/bildung-beratung/event/id/17009&lt;/ref&gt; The center was converted into a shrine with flags and a flower-strewn floor. In some 70 oil paintings Almog auto-portrayed himself in the style of [[Art of the Third Reich|Nazi art]], classicism and [[Soviet art|social realism]] as a ruler and savior, as a naked, provocatively muscle-bound godlike figure, as a fiery agitator or simply with the stern regard of a [[stormtrooper]], complete with leather belt and [[jackboots]].&lt;ref name="maurer"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Maurer |first1= Thomas |author2= Oz Almog, Thomas Mauer|title= Him too...??

Almog’s 1995 exhibition ''The Psychonaut and His Mind Navigator'', featured 360 oils, mostly self-portraits in the style of [[Pulp magazine|pulp magazine covers]]. The artist presented himself as a lecherous vampire drooling over a beautiful blond, a revolver-toting gangster, a crazed toy [[Bug-eyed monster|alien]], or monstrously endowed porno star.&lt;ref name="maurer" /&gt; The same year Oz Almog undertook the project ''En Face – Not seen and/or less seen of/by'', reconstructing the images of the famous visual artists by using an original collection of interchangeable facial features' templates of Austrian Federal Police from the 70s.&lt;ref&gt;See exhibition catalog ''En Face'' (1995), publisher ISR, Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by conceptual exhibitions: ''Blok Brut'' (auto-erotic deaths) and ''Blood Addict - Bloody scenes of Murder 1949-1960'', presented in Janco Dada Museum in Israel in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Almog |first= Oz |title= Blood Addict |publisher= Institute of Strategic Research, Janko Dada Museum |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Shaheed'' (Suicide Terror phenomena) in Limbus Gallery, Tel Aviv. It is a series of selected real police photos of fatal [[Erotic asphyxiation|auto-erotic strangulations]], extracts from the scene-of-the-crime photos, metamorphosed with real blood into abstract light and dark compositions,&lt;ref name="maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Almog |first= Oz |title= Shaheed | publisher= Institute of Strategic Research, Limbus Gallery Tel Aviv |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Him Too?''===
With his exhibition ''Him too? ... A Chronicle of a Cultural Obsession'', Oz Almog confronts visitors with the question as to what [[Anne Frank]] and [[Jesus]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Fred Astaire]], [[Mr. Spock]] and [[Albert Einstein]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Madeleine Albright]] could possibly have in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.messis.nl/en/project.html?project=8|title= Die Ook – Oz Almog’s beknopte Index Judaeorum|work=The Messis Foundation |year=2001 |accessdate=3 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more than 400 small size oil portraits, each accompanied by a short biography, Oz Almog features flamboyant heroes and anti-heroes whose only common denomination is their Jewish origin: names like [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Jack Ruby]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].

===2000–2001 exhibitions===
''Aktion T-4: Opera Euthanasia'' – part of the Memorial exhibition at the Upper Austrian State Museum, Linz in the year 2000 – featured a child's bedroom with over 350 paintings of prominent Nazis, serial killers and other criminals and once again produced a massive public reaction. ''Wiener en face – Portraits of Careers'' (Viennese en face – Portraits of Careers), with 350 paintings of prominent Viennese personalities, was shown from October 2000 to April 2001 at the Hermes Villa (part of the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna).&lt;ref name="Hadzivukovic 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hadzivukovic |first1= Vesna |author2= Oz Almog |title= Walls of Sound - Jewish Worlds of Music |chapter= Oz Almog - Biography |publisher= Jewish Museum Vienna |year= 2010 | isbn= 978-3-901398-55-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been followed by ''Towards the Light of Dawn – Jewish Heroes of the Soviet Union'' (Dem Morgenrot Entgegen). With this exhibition Oz Almog has attempted to uncover what he says is the "repressed history" of the 500,000 Jews who fought in the Soviet army – a third of the 1.5 million Jewish soldiers from all Allied nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/10912/ |title= Art exhibit honors Soviet Jews|publisher= Kyiw News |date= 18 April 2002|accessdate= 3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/385567_Co_Zachod_wie_o_Wschodzie_i_na_odwrot.html|title= Co Zachód wie o Wschodzie i na odwrót |author= Grzegorz Sowula |publisher=Rzeczpospolitej |date= 18 May 2002 |accessdate=31 August 2010|language=Polish |trans-title=What the West knows about the East and vice versa }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kosher Nostra''===
In the exhibition ''Kosher Nostra. Jewish Gangsters in America 1890–1980'', Oz Almog created an impressive documentary summary of an entire epoch of crimes committed by [[Kosher Nostra|Jewish gangsters]]. Through pictures, newspaper articles, and official documents, he showed how such criminals as [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel]], and [[Louis Buchalter|Louis "Lepke" Buchalter]] had a determining influence on the development of [[Organized crime|organized crime in America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title= American Jewish Year Book Vol. 104|page= 406|publisher= American Jewish Committee |year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kosher Nostra'', shown in 2004-2005 at the Jewish Museum, Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;Kosher Nostra – History of Jewish Gangsters in America 1890 - 1980 http://www.jmw.at/en/exhibitions/kosher-nostra-history-jewish-gangsters-america-1890-1980&lt;/ref&gt; featured more than 160 realistic oil portraits, with most of personalities shown both full-face and from profile. Each "[[mug shot]]" was accompanied with a short biography, resulting in two books with over 1000 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austria.gv.at/site/infodate__13.04.2004/4108/default.aspx#id4880|title= Jewish Museum Vienna: no less than three fascinating exhibitions |author= Federal Chancellery Austria |date=13 April 2004|accessdate= 3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Viena/reconstruye/violenta/historia/mafias/judias/Estados/Unidos/elpepicul/20040113elpepicul_6/Tes

&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–present===
In 2004 Oz Almog presented his art installation ''Colors of War''. ''Camouflage'' was shown in the [[Imperial Furniture Museum]] in Vienna, exhibiting the original furniture of Austo-Hungarian Emperors, re-furbished with the military camouflage fabrics. ''A Warrior Cult'' was on view at the Jewish Museum&lt;ref&gt;Colors of War. A Warrior Cult http://www.jmw.at/en/exhibitions/colors-war-warrior-cult&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the mosaic of shoulder sleeve insignias oil paintings. 
2007/08 a number of international artists joined Almog in ''Judaica Kid’s Box''  project, taking up the challenge of presenting Jewish tradition, concepts, symbolism, thought and teachings in a form accessible to children. The colorful and entertaining presentation was designed to provide young and "adult" children with the means to understand the significance of the Hebrew alphabet. ''Judaica Kid’s Box'' was running for more than two years in the Jewish Museum, Vienna. At the same time Oz presented an exhibition entitled ''GODDEVILAETHEAR - Oz Almog + Wilhelm Reich: A Journey to Hell'' ("GOTTTEUFELAETHER - Oz Almog + Wilhelm Reich: Ausfluss der Hölle"). Like Wilhelm Reich has a fanatical and often esoterically inspired following, so here we have Oz’s artistic interpretation of the complex plane of [[Wilhelm Reich]]’s concepts in conjunction with a dark, phantasmagorical underworld of Jewish Hell ([[Gehinom]]).&lt;ref name="Hadzivukovic 2010"/&gt;

In 2010 Oz Almog showed in Jewish Museum, Vienna, the exhibition ''Walls of Sound – Jewish Worlds of Music'' featuring Jewish music and Jewish musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Oz Almog ''Walls of Sound - Jewish Worlds of Music'' (Vienna, Judishes Museum der Stadt Wien, 2010) in German/English, {{ISBN|978-3-901398-55-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011 Oz Almog released with DJ Shantel the compilation CD ''Kosher Nostra: Jewish Gangsters Greatest Hits'', containing a wild mix of swing, jazz, twist, Charleston and Yiddish songs, the sound of the American Jewish Mafia throughout the '20s to the '60s.&lt;ref&gt;Kosher Nostra: Jewish Gangsters Greatest Hits http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/oz_almog_shantel-kosher_nostra_jewish_gangsters_greatest_hits&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Iby''', {{lang-hu|Iby Pál}} (January 23, 1935, [[Raiding, Austria|Doborján]] ({{lang-de|Raiding}})) is [[Bishop#Retired bishops|Bishop Emeritus]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Eisenstadt]], [[Austria]].

== Views ==

=== Clerical celibacy ===
Bishop Iby is convinced the Catholic church should drop its [[celibacy]] requirement for priests. It should be up to priests to decide whether they want to live a celibate life. "It should be at the discretion of every priest whether to live in voluntary celibacy or in a family," [[Die Presse]] quoted Iby as saying.&lt;ref name="Die Presse"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/12/paul-iby-reformist-bishop_n_573536.html Paul Iby, Reformist Bishop, Pushes Vatican To End Celibacy Requirement For Priests], cit. by Huffingtonpost.com, May 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He would also welcome it if married men could be ordained.

=== Ordination of women ===
Bishop Iby also said that eventually the ordination of women should be considered.&lt;ref name="Die Presse"/&gt;

=== Homosexuality, divorce ===
Iby indicated that a “more welcoming church,” one that “is more free and open,” would relax its attitude toward [[homosexuality]] and give approval to [[divorce|divorced couples]] who have entered another relationship while their spouses are still living.

“It means to cease the discrimination of homosexuals and finding a solution for divorcees,” said Iby. “What we suggest is looking at the [[Orthodox church]]: after a time of [[penance]], the blessing of a second relationship should be possible. Only nothing is moving in Rome!”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue9784.html Austrian bishop wants softer church stand on gays, divorce], christiantelegraph.com, May 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion in [[Catalonia]]''' is diversified. Historically, virtually all the population was [[Christianity|Christian]], specifically [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], but since the 1980 there has been a trend of decline of Christianity and parallel growth of [[irreligion]] and other religions. The secularisation of Catalan culture started in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but conscious disaffiliation from Catholicism has also been driven since the 1980s by the religion's association with [[Francoist Spain]].{{sfn|Capdevila|2013|pp=9–10}} According to the most recent study sponsored by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|government of Catalonia]], as of 2016, 61.9% of the Catalans identify as Christians, up from 56.5% in 2014&lt;ref name="Barometer20142"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/Barometre2014_resultats.pdf|title=Baròmetre sobre la religiositat i sobre la gestió de la seva diversitat|date=2014|publisher=Institut Opiniòmetre, Generalitat de Catalunya|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926184822/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/Barometre2014_resultats.pdf|archive-date=26 September 2017}} p. 30.

==Religions==

===Bahá'í Faith===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has nearly one thousand members and nine centres in Catalonia as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fe Bahá'í — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Bahai.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927205136/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Bahai.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í group in Catalonia was established in [[Barcelona]] in 1949, while the first formal centre was inaugurated in [[Terrassa]], in the [[Vallès Occidental]], in 1962. The Vallès Occidental is still the region where most of the Catalan Bahá'ís reside, and where six out of the nine Bahá'í centres are situated.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=122}} Most Bahá'ís are ethnic Catalan converts, while a small minority are immigrants of [[Iran]]ian or other origins.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=123}}

===Buddhism===
1.3% of the Catalans identify as Buddhists as of 2016.&lt;ref name="Barometer2016" /&gt; Buddhism has 68 temples in Catalonia as of the same year, holding their services in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] language, reflecting the ethnic origins of the Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budisme — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Budisme.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927130541/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Budisme.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Buddhists, though, are ethnic Catalan converts.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=76}} These practise a variety of traditions of Buddhism, collectively represented since 2007 by the Catalan Coordinator of Buddhist Entities (''Coordinadora Catalana d’Entitats Budistes'', CCEB).{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|pp=71–73}} Buddhist temples in Catalonia are mostly of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] (54%) and [[Zen]] (32%) traditions as of 2014, with the rest representing other traditions such as [[Pure Land Buddhism]] and [[Soka Gakkai]]'s [[Nichiren Buddhism]].{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=74}}

===Christianity===
61.9% of the population of Catalonia identify as Christians as of 2016.&lt;ref name="Barometer2016" /&gt;

====Orthodox Christianity and Eastern Catholicism====
0.9% of the Catalans identify as Orthodox Christians as of 2016.&lt;ref name="Barometer2016" /&gt; As of the same year, there are 55 Orthodox Christian and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches (most of them being Orthodox Christian) in the country, mostly for [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]-speaking communities (the few Eastern Catholic churches being of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholic tradition]]), with a small proportion of [[Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Esglésias orientals — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_orientals.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927171352/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_orientals.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3.0% of the Catalans identify as Protestants or Evangelicals as of 2016.&lt;ref name="Barometer2016" /&gt; As of 2014 there are 725 Protestant and Evangelical churches in Catalonia, which conduct their services mostly in Spanish, Catalan, [[English language|English]], Romanian, and a minority in [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and African languages. Many followers are immigrants from [[South America]], Africa and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Esglésies evangèliques — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Evageliques.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927144012/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Evageliques.pdf|date=2014|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most churches are Evangelical, 469 of them belonging to [[Pentecostalism]], while historical Protestantism ([[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]]) is represented by less than 20% of the churches.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|pp=33–34}}

====Restorationism====

=====Adventism=====
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has about 1,500 members in Catalonia, belonging to 24 churches. Most of these churches hold their services in Spanish and Catalan, with a minority using Romanian, and an even smaller minority using languages of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Església Adventista del Setè Dia — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Adventista.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927202346/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Adventista.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jehovah's Witnesses=====
[[File:Sala del Regne dels Testimonis Cristians de Jehovà - C. Doctor Aiguader.jpg|thumb|Kingdom hall in Barcelona.]]
0.6% of the Catalans identify as Jehovah's Witnesses as of 2014.&lt;ref name="Barometer2016" /&gt; As of the same year, there are 118 Jehovah's [[kingdom hall]]s in the country, found in all [[comarca|co-marches]] of Catalonia but with a high concentration in the [[province of Barcelona]]. Most Jehovah's Witnesses are ethnic Catalans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimonis Cristians de Jehovà — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Testimonis.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927200020/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Testimonis.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mormonism=====
The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the major body of [[Mormonism]], has more than 6,000 members and 15 places of worship as of 2014, most of them using Spanish as their liturgical language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Església de Jesucrist dels Sants dels Darrers Dies — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Sants_Darrers_Dies.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927203850/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Sants_Darrers_Dies.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mormons in Catalonia are South American immigrants, and this is the reason why Spanish is the primary language of the Mormon communities in the country.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=109}}

===Germanic Heathenry===
[[Germanic Heathenry]] is represented in Catalonia by "Gotland Forn Sed" ([[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian Germanic]] for "Gothland Old Belief"). Catalonia in the early [[Middle Ages]] was known as the [[March of Gothia]] within the [[Carolingian Empire]]. It was an area of settlement of [[Visigoths]] and the same name "Catalonia" (''Catalunya'') is traditionally explained as being an alteration of "Gothland", through the [[Latin]]isation ''Gothalandia'', and then the early alteration ''Cathalaunia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulick Ralph Burke|title=A History of Spain from the Earliest Times to the Death of Ferdinand the Catholic|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tz3g_YzTQaUC&amp;pg=PA154|year=1900|publisher=Longmans, Green, and co.|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]] has 27 temples in Catalonia as of 2014, 14 of which are situated in the province of Barcelona. The religion is mostly represented by [[India]]n immigrants, though there is also a significant number of Catalan converts. Indeed, the vast majority of Hindu temples hold their services in Catalan or Spanish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hinduisme — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_hinduisme.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927135544/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_hinduisme.pdf|date=2014|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|pp=98–100}} Hindus in Catalonia follow a variety of traditions of worship and thought.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=97}}

===Islam===
4.8% of the population of Catalonia identify as Muslims as of 2016.&lt;ref name="Barometer2016" /&gt; There are 256 [[mosque]]s in Catalonia as of the same year, most of them holding their services in [[Arabic]], with a smaller proportion of mosques serving in [[Urdu]] and an even smaller one in some [[Africa]]n languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Islam.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927133522/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_Islam.pdf|date=2014|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all mosques are of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] tradition, with only one mosque representing [[Shia Islam]]. There are also six [[Sufism|Sufi]] centres.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=48}} As of 2014 there are five organisations of Muslims in Catalonia: the Catalan Islamic Federation (''Federació Islàmica Catalana''), the Islamic Federative Council of Catalonia (''Federació Consell Islàmic de Catalunya''), the Union of Islamic Communities of Catalonia (''Unió de Comunitats Islàmiques de Catalunya''), the Union of Islamic Cultural Centres of Catalonia (''Unió de Centres Culturals Islàmics de Catalunya'') and an umbrella organisation, the Islamic Junta (''Junta Islàmica'').{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=49}}

===Judaism===
[[File:555 Casa de Sant Jordi, o Sinagoga, c. Major de Remolins 44 - cantonada tv. Mur (Tortosa).JPG|thumb|Ancient synagogue in [[Tortosa]].]]
[[Jews]] in Catalonia are about 15,000 as of 2014, and there are four [[synagogue]]s in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judaisme — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_judaisme.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928101520/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_judaisme.pdf|date=2014|archive-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Jews are followers of the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]]. Indeed, 80% of Jews in Catalonia are non-religious or secular, while only 20% are observant. The Israelitic Community of Barcelona (''Comunitat Israelita de Barcelona'', CIB), is the oldest Jewish religious community in Catalonia, founded in 1918, and follows [[Orthodox Judaism]]. In 1992 the Jewish Community Atid of Catalonia (''Comunitat Jueva Atid de Catalunya'') was established as a splinter of the CIB, adopting [[Reform Judaism]]. In the early 2000s a [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], outreach centre was founded in Catalonia. In 2006 another Reform group, the Progressive Jewish Community Bet Shalom, was founded as a splinter of Atid.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=131}}

Ethnically, Jews who belong to the CIB are predominantly [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], although there is a small minority of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] as well. Members of Atid are, instead, mostly of South American origin, specifically [[Argentina|Argentines]]. Endly, Bet Shalom predominantly hosts ethnic Catalan converts, and other minorities of converts without ethnic Jewish origin.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=134}}

===Sikhism===
[[Sikhism]] in Catalonia has ten temples ([[gurdwara]]s) as of 2014 and some thousands of believers. Virtually all Sikhs are [[Punjabis]] who immigrated from the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] region of India, Sikhism being strongly linked to the Punjabi ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikhisme — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_sikhisme.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927194342/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_sikhisme.pdf|date=2014|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] has six registered temples in Catalonia as of 2014, most of them holding their services in Catalan or Spanish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taoisme — Mapa Religiós de Catalunya|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_taoisme.pdf|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance and Institutional Relations, General Direction of Religious Affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927141258/http://governacio.gencat.cat/web/.content/afers_religiosos/documents/Mapa_2014/2014_Fitxa_taoisme.pdf|date=2014|archive-date=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these temples, five are situated in the province of Barcelona, where most [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants, who the temples serve, are gathered. There are also many ethnic Catalan converts.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=128}} Catalan Taoists have established the Taoist Association of Catalonia (''Associació Taoista de Catalunya''), led by the Chinese [[Taoist priest]] Tian Chengyang, while at the same time there are many Chinese Taoist centres which do not use Catalan language and do not integrate in the broader society.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=129}}

The first Taoist group in Catalonia was established in 1979 by a Catholic priest of Chinese origin, Peter Yang, who proposed a synthesis of Taoism and Christianity. All the other centres have been established from 2000 onwards.{{sfn|ISOR researchers|2014|p=128}} Another [[:ca:Temple Taoista de Barcelona|Taoist temple]] was opened in 2014 by the Chinese of Barcelona, led by master Liu Zemin, a 21st-generation descendant of poet, soldier and prophet [[Liu Bowen]] (1311-1375). The temple, located in the district of [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]] and inaugurated in the presence of the People's Republic of China consul Qu Chengwu, enshrines 28 [[Chinese gods and immortals|deities]] of the province of China where most of the Chinese in Barcelona come from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S'ha inaugurat un temple taoista a Barcelona|url=http://governacio.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/013_taoista|publisher=Government of Catalonia, Department of Governance, Public Administration and Housing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928093534/http://governacio.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/013_taoista|date=2014|archive-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irreligion, atheism and agnosticism==
27.9% of the Catalans identify as irreligious as of 2016. Of them, 16.0% are atheists and 11.9% are agnostics.&lt;ref name=Barometer2016/&gt;

A '''religious war''' or '''holy war''' ({{lang-la|bellum sacrum}}) is a [[war]] primarily caused or justified by differences in [[religion]]. In the [[modern period]], debates are common over the extent to which religious, [[War#Economic|economic]], or [[ethnic conflict|ethnic]] aspects of a conflict predominate in a given war. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Wars'', out of all 1,763 known/recorded historical conflicts, 123, or 6.98%, had religion as their primary cause, and of that percentage, 65, or 53.66%, were related to Islam.&lt;ref name="Axelrod, Alan 2004"&gt;Axelrod, Alan &amp; Phillips, Charles ''Encyclopedia of Wars'', Facts on File, November 2004,  {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2851-1}}. Deem, Richard.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew White (historian)|Matthew White]]'s ''[[The Great Big Book of Horrible Things]]'' gives religion as the cause of 13 of the world's 100 deadliest atrocities.&lt;ref name = "White"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew White|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-08192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several conflicts including the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the [[Syrian civil war]], and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraqi insurgency (post-U.S. withdrawal)|Iraq]], religious elements are overtly present but variously described as [[fundamentalism]] or [[religious extremism]]—depending upon the observer's sympathies. However, studies on these cases often conclude that ethnic animosities drive much of the conflicts.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;

Some historians argue that what is termed "religious wars" is a largely "Western dichotomy" and a modern invention from the past few centuries, arguing that all wars that are classed as "religious" have secular (economic or political) ramifications.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"/&gt; Similar opinions were expressed as early as the 1760s, during the [[Seven Years' War]], widely recognized to be "religious" in motivation, noting that the warring factions were not necessarily split along confessional lines as much as along secular interests.&lt;ref name="p. 110"&gt;John Entick, ''The General History of the [[Seven Years' War|Later War]]'', Volume 3, 1763, [https://books.google.com/books?id=21pSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=%22religious+war%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=COoAUrOGNoGJ4ASK14HYAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20war%22&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], numerous cases of supposed acts of religious wars such as the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[French Wars of Religion]], the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and other terrorist attacks, the [[Bosnian War]], and the [[Rwandan Civil War]] were all primarily motivated by social, political, and economic issues rather than religion.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Jeffrey Burton|title=Exposing Myths about Christianity|date=2012|publisher=IVP Books|location=Downers Grove, Ill.|isbn=9780830834662|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept of religion==
The modern word ''religion'' comes from the Latin word ''religio''. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship, never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; The modern concept of "religion" as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and more prevalent colonization or globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=022618448X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other ancient sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus and is found in texts like the New Testament, is sometimes translated as "religion" today, however, the term was understood as "worship" well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''din'' is often translated as "religion" in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as "law".&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; Even in the 1st century AD, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as "Judaism" today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt;  It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", and "Confucianism" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Josephson |first1=Jason Ananda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of "religion" since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this Western idea.&lt;ref name="Invention Japan" /&gt;

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word "religion", the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only "reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]]" (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean "diligence").&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33 (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called "law".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA28&amp;id=aM0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=4 Introduction to the science of religion]''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages have words that can be translated as "religion", but they may use them in a very different way, and some have no word for religion at all. For example, the [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as "religion", also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between "imperial law" and universal or "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I. Stone, translator. {{cite web|url=http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/477.pdf |title="The Imperial Law and the Buddhist Law" |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030323095019/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/477.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2003 |df= }}.

There is no precise equivalent of "religion" in Hebrew, and [[Judaism]] does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit, Abraham J. Edelheit,  [https://www.questia.com/library/book/history-of-zionism-a-handbook-and-dictionary-by-abfaham-j-edelheit-hershel-edelheit.jsp History of Zionism: A Handbook and Dictionary], p. 3, citing [[Solomon Zeitlin]], ''The Jews. Race, Nation, or Religion?'' ( Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;  One of its central concepts is "halakha", meaning the "walk" or "path" sometimes translated as "law", which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.&lt;ref name="WhitefordII2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whiteford |first1=Linda M. |last2=Trotter II |first2=Robert T. |title=Ethics for Anthropological Research and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeokAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2008 |publisher=Waveland Press |isbn=978-1-4786-1059-5 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for classification==
{{See also|Just war|Religious terrorism|Religious violence}}
The [[Crusades]] against [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]] in the 11th century was recognized as a "holy war" or ''bellum sacrum'' by later writers in the 17th century. The early modern wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] were seen as a seamless continuation of this conflict by contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Bellum sacrum Ecclesiae militantis contra Turcum'' by Léonard de Vaux (1685).&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "religious war" was used to describe, controversially at the time, what are now known as the [[European wars of religion]], and especially the then-ongoing [[Seven Years' War]],  from at least the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Mauduit, ''Considerations on the Present German War'', 1760, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lrBJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25].
John Entick, ''The General History of the Later War'', Volume 3, 1763, [https://books.google.com/books?id=21pSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=%22religious+war%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=COoAUrOGNoGJ4ASK14HYAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20war%22&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;!-- both these authors argue *against* the designation --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In their ''Encyclopedia of Wars'', authors [[Charles Phillips (historian)|Charles Phillips]] and [[Alan Axelrod]] document 1763 notable wars in world history. They note that before the 17th century, much of the "reasons" for conflicts were explained through the lens of religion and that after that time wars were explained through the lens of wars as a way to further sovereign interests. They note, "Wars have always arisen, and arise today, from territorial disputes, military rivalries, conflicts of ethnicity, and strivings for commercial and economic advantage, and they have always depended on, and depend on today, pride, prejudice, coercion, envy, cupidity, competitiveness, and a sense of injustice. But for much of the world before the 17th century, these “reasons” for war were explained and justified, at least for the participants, by religion. Then, around the middle of the 17th century, Europeans began to conceive of war as a legitimate means of furthering the interests of individual sovereigns."&lt;ref name="Axelrod, Alan 2004"/&gt; Some commentators have concluded that only 123 wars (7%) out of these 1763 wars were fundamentally originated by religious motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheiman|first1=Bruce|title=An Atheist Defends Religion : Why Humanity is Better Off with Religion than Without It|date=2009|publisher=Alpha Books.|isbn=1592578543|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Vox|title=The Irrational Atheist: Dissecting the Unholy Trinity of Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=BenBella Books|isbn=1933771364|pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lurie|first1=Alan|title=Is Religion the Cause of Most Wars?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious wars account for less than 2% of all people killed in warfare. This includes 3 million during the Crusades and 3,000 during the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestarpress.com/story/life/faith/2015/11/20/burkes-religion-responsible-most-wars/76039940/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---indirect---&gt;

''The Encyclopedia of War'', edited by Gordon Martel, using the criteria that the armed conflict must involve some overt religious action, concludes that 6% of the wars listed in their encyclopedia can be labelled religious wars.&lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopedia of War" by Gordon Martel (17 Jan 2012, 2912 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}}

[[William T. Cavanaugh]] in his ''Myth of Religious Violence'' (2009) argues that what is termed "religious wars" is a largely "Western dichotomy" and a modern invention, arguing that all wars that are classed as "religious" have secular (economic or political) ramifications.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=William T.|title=The Myth of Religious Violence : Secular Ideology and the Roots of Modern Conflict|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-538504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar opinions were expressed as early as the 1760s, during the [[Seven Years' War]], widely recognized to be "religious" in motivation, noting that the warring factions were not necessarily split along confessional lines as much as along secular interests.&lt;ref name="p. 110"/&gt;

It is evident that [[religion]] as one aspect of a people's [[cultural heritage]] may serve as a cultural marker or ideological rationalisation for a conflict that has deeper ethnic and cultural differences. This has been specifically argued for the case of [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], often portrayed as a religious conflict of a Catholic vs. a Protestant faction, while the more fundamental cause of the conflict  was in fact ethnic or nationalistic rather than religious in nature.&lt;ref name="McGarry J 1995"&gt;McGarry J, O'Leary B, 1995. ''Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images.'' Oxford, Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Since the native Irish were mostly Catholic and the later British-sponsored immigrants were mainly Protestant, the terms become shorthand for the two cultures, but it is inaccurate to describe the conflict as a religious one.&lt;ref name="McGarry J 1995"/&gt;

According to Irfan Omar and Michael Duffey's review of violence and peacemaking in world religions, they note that studies of supposed cases of religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities.&lt;ref name="Omar"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|page=1|ref=Omar Peacemaking|chapter=Introduction|quote=This book does not ignore violence committed in the name of religion. Analyses of case studies of seeming religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of "Holy War" in individual religious traditions==

While early empires could be described as [[henotheistic]], i.e. dominated by a single god of the ruling elite (as [[Marduk]] in the [[Babylonian empire]], [[Assur (god)|Assur]] in the [[Assyrian empire]], etc.), or more directly by deifing the ruler in an [[imperial cult]], the concept of "Holy War" enters a new phase with the development of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kirsch  ''God Against The Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism'', Penguin, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient warfare and polytheism===
{{further|Ancient warfare|Polytheism|God of war|}}

[[Classical Antiquity]] had a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] with particular attributes and interest areas.  [[Ares]] personified war. While he received occasional sacrifice from armies going to war, there was only a very limited "cult of Ares".&lt;ref name="Burkert, p. 170"&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sparta]], however, each company of youths sacrificed to [[Enyalios]] before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum.&lt;ref&gt;"Here each company of youths sacrifices a puppy to Enyalius, holding that the most valiant of tame animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppies except the people of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]; these too sacrifice a puppy, a black bitch, to the Wayside Goddess." [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 3.14.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{further|Christianity and violence|Crusades|European wars of religion}}
[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of French Protestants, 1572]]

In early Christianity, St. Augustine's concept of [[Just war theory|just war]] (''bellum iustum'') was widely accepted, but warfare was not regarded as a virtuous activity&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usna"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abels|first1=Richard|title=Timeline for the Crusades and Christian Holy War|url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/crusades_timeline.htm|website=US Naval Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressions of concern for the salvation of those who killed enemies in battle, regardless of the cause for which they fought, was common.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; According to historian Edward Peters, before the 11th century Christians had not developed a concept of "Holy War" (''bellum sacrum''), whereby fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act.&lt;ref name="Peters First"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Edward|title=The First Crusade: The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres and Other Source Materials|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0812216563|edition=2|chapter=Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSOSJWG3E2MC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine War" /&gt; During the 9th and 10th centuries, multiple invasions occurred which lead some regions to make their own armies to defend themselves and this slowly lead to the emergence of the Crusades, the concept of "holy war", and terminology such as "enemies of God" in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine War"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=David|title=Conflicts of Ideology in Christian and Muslim Holy War|url=https://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/journal-of-history/david-levine.html|publisher=Binghamton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Crusades, some of those who fought in the name of God were recognized as the ''[[Miles Christianus|Milites Christi]]'', soldiers or knights of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Tyerman, Christopher. The Crusades: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, London, 2004. PP. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Crusades]] were a series of military campaigns that took place during the 11th through 13th centuries against the [[Muslim Conquests]]. Originally, the goal was to recapture [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Islam|Muslims]], and support the besieged Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] against the [[Muslim]] [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] expansion into Asia Minor and Europe proper. Later, Crusades were launched against other targets, either for religious reasons, such as the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the [[Northern Crusades]], or because of political conflict, such as the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. In 1095, at the [[Council of Clermont]], [[Pope Urban II]] raised the level of war from ''[[bellum iustum]]'' ("just war"), to ''bellum sacrum'' ("holy war").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |title=Christian Jihad: The Crusades and Killing in the Name of Christ |publisher=Cbn.com |accessdate=20 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709000007/http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |archivedate=9 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 16th-century France there was a succession of wars between [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]] ([[Hugenots]] primarily), known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. In the first half of the 17th century, the [[Germany|German]] states, Scandinavia ([[Sweden]], primarily) and [[Poland]] were beset by religious warfare in the [[Thirty Years War]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] figured in the opposing sides of this conflict, though Catholic [[France]] did take the side of the Protestants but purely for political reasons.

The [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]], known in Arab history as the Battle of Al-Uqab (معركة العقاب), took place on 16 July 1212 and was an important turning point in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and in the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval history of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] describes the battle as a "major turning point in the reconquista..."  See Lynn Hunt, R. Po-chia Hsia, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie Smith, ''The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures: A Concise History: Volume I: To 1740'', Second Edition (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's 2007), 391.&lt;/ref&gt;  The forces of King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] were joined by the armies of his [[Christian]] rivals, [[Sancho VII of Navarre]], [[Pedro II of Aragon]] and [[Afonso II of Portugal]] in battle&lt;ref&gt;Guggenberger, Anthony, ''A General History of the Christian Era: The Papacy and the Empire'', Vol.1, (B. Herder, 1913), 372.&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Muslim]] [[Almohad]] conquerors of the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

===Islam===
{{further|Jihad|Early Muslim conquests|Ghazi (warrior)}}

The [[Muslim conquests]] were a military expansion on an unprecedented scale, beginning in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] and spanning the centuries, down to the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].  Until the 13th century, the Muslim conquests were those of a more or less coherent [[empire]], the [[Caliphate]], but after the [[Mongol invasions]], expansion continued on all fronts (other than Iberia which was lost in the [[Reconquista]]) for another half millennium until the final collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the east  and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the west with the onset of the [[modernity|modern period]].

There were also a number of periods of infighting among Muslims; these are known by the term [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]] and mostly concern the early period of Islam, from the 7th to 11th centuries, i.e. before the collapse of the Caliphate and the emergence of the various later [[Islamic empires]].

While technically, the millennium of Muslim conquests could be classified as "religious war", the applicability of the term has been questioned.
The reason is that the very notion of a "religious war" as opposed to a "secular war" is the result of the Western concept of the  [[separation of Church and State]]. No such division has ever existed in the Islamic world, and consequently there cannot be a real division between wars that are "religious" from such that are "non-religious". Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and warfare has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of Muhammad. This was formalised in the juristic definition of [[Islam and war|war in Islam]], which continues to hold normative power in contemporary Islam,  inextricably linking political and religious justification of war.&lt;ref&gt;James Turner Johnson, ''The Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions'',  Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997,  {{ISBN|9780271042145}}, chapter 1, esp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA2%200 pp. 20–25].&lt;/ref&gt; This normative concept is known as ''[[Jihad]]'', an Arabic word with the meaning "to strive; to struggle" (viz.

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Medina]] from [[Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was surah 22, verses 39-40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p.4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|To those against whom war is made, permission is given (to fight), because they are wronged;- and verily, Allah is most powerful for their aid. (They are) those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right,- (for no cause) except that they say, "our Lord is Allah". Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure. Allah will certainly aid those who aid his (cause);- for verily Allah is full of Strength, Exalted in Might, (able to enforce His Will).|Abdullah Yusuf Ali}}
This happened many times throughout history, beginning with [[Muhammad]]'s battles against the [[polytheist]] Arabs including the [[Battle of Badr]] (624), and battles in [[Uhud]] (625), [[Battle of the Trench|Khandaq]] (627), [[Mecca]] (630) and [[Battle of Hunayn|Hunayn]] (630).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Milkhemet Mitzvah}}

In the [[Jewish]] religion, the expression ''Milkhemet Mitzvah'' ([[Hebrew]]: מלחמת מצווה, "[[Mitzvah|commandment]] [[war]]") refers to a war that is obligatory for all Jews (men and women). Such wars were limited to territory within the borders of [[Eretz Israel|the land of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The geographical limits of Israel and conflicts with surrounding nations are detailed in the [[Tanakh]], the [[Hebrew Bible]], especially in Numbers 34:1-15 and Ezekiel 47:13-20. The concept of a religious war was absent in Jewish thought for approximately 2000 years, though it reemerged in some factions of the [[Zionist movement]], particularly [[Revisionist Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Holy War in Judaism: The Fall and Rise of a Controversial Idea&lt;/ref&gt; "From the earliest days of Israel's existence as a people, holy war was a sacred institution, undertaken as a cultic act of a religious community.&lt;ref&gt;Marva J. Dawn, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezaCr3i3JeIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Holy War in Ancient Israel]'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reuven Firestone, ""Holy War" is a Western concept referring to war that is fought for religion, against adherents of other religions, often in order to promote religion through conversion, and with no specific geographic limitation. This concept does not occur in the Hebrew Bible, whose wars are not fought for religion or in order to promote it but, rather, in order to preserve religion and a religiously unique people in relation to a specific and limited geography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firestone|first1=Reuven|title=Holy War Idea in the Hebrew Bible|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/cmje/issues/more_issues/Holy_War_in_the_Hebrew_Bible.pdf|publisher=USC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious conflict in the modern period==

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
[[File:Sumayya and her cat in front of her demolished home 2002, 2nd Intifada.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Demolished home in Balata, 2002, [[Second Intifada]]]]
The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] can be viewed primarily as an [[ethnic conflict]] between two parties where one party is most often portrayed as a singular ethno-religious group consisting only of the Jewish majority and ignores non-Jewish minority Israeli citizens who at varying levels support a [[State of Israel|Zionist state]], especially the [[Druze]] and [[Circassians]] who for example volunteer in higher numbers for [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] combat service and are represented in the [[Knesset|Israeli parliament]] in greater percentages than Israeli Jews are&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.openedition.org/bcrfj/5911 In search of a lost time, construction of identity in the Circassian diaspora in Israel p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-adelman/the-druze-of-israel-hope-_b_8265050.html The Druze of Israel: Hope for Arab-Jewish Collaboration&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Israeli Arabs]], [[Samaritans]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/365747cc-07c4-11e6-a623-b84d06a39ec2 Financial Times - Samaritans form bridge of peace between Israelis and Palestinians&lt;/ref&gt; various other Christians, and [[Negev Bedouin]];&lt;ref&gt;https://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/profiles/2013/04/24/Bedouin-army-trackers-scale-Israel-social-ladder-.html  Al Arabiya - Muslim Arab Bedouins serve as Jewish state’s gatekeepers&lt;/ref&gt; the other party is sometimes presented as an ethnic group which is multi-religious (although most numerously consisting of Muslims, then Christians, then other religious groups up to and including Samaritans and even Jews). Yet despite the multi-religious composition of both of the parties in the conflict, elements on both sides often view it as a religious war between Jews and Muslims. In 1929, religious tensions between Muslim and Jewish Palestinians over Jews praying at the [[Wailing Wall]] led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]]&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=1999 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 |pages=295–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron]] and [[1929 Safed pogrom|Safed]] ethnic cleansings of Jews.

In 1947, the UN decided on [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partitioning]] the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]], led to the creation of the state of Israel and [[Jordan]] annexing the West Bank portion of the mandate, since then the region has been plagued with [[Arab–Israeli conflict|conflict]].

The [[All India Muslim League]] (AIML) was formed in [[Dhaka]] in 1906 by Muslims who were suspicious of the Hindu-majority [[Indian National Congress]]. They complained that Muslim members did not have the same rights as Hindu members. A number of different scenarios were proposed at various times.This was fuelled by the British policy of "Divide and Rule", which they tried to bring upon every political situation. Among the first to make the demand for a separate state was the writer/philosopher [[Allama Iqbal]], who, in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that a separate nation for Muslims was essential in an otherwise [[Hindu]]-dominated subcontinent.

After the dissolution of the [[British Raj]] in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formed—the [[Union of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. The subsequent [[Partition of India|partition of the former British India]] displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]] emerged as a [[secularism in India|secular nation]] with a [[Hinduism in India|Hindu majority]], while [[Pakistan]] was established as an [[Islamic republic]] with [[Islam in Pakistan|Muslim majority]] population.&lt;ref name="Indian Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx|title=Census of India : Religious Composition|publisher=Censusindia.gov.in|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222185234/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html |date=22 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abyssinia – Somalia===
{{Main|Abyssinian–Adal war}}
[[Image:YagbeaSionBattlingAdaSultan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Abyssinian–Adal war]] broke out in the [[Horn of Africa]] after the arrival of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the region.]]

The [[Abyssinian–Adal war]] was a military conflict between the [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinians]] and the [[Adal Sultanate]] from 1529 until 1559. The [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (nicknamed ''Gurey'' in [[Somali language|Somali]] and ''Gragn'' in [[Amharic language|Amharic]] (ግራኝ ''Graññ''), both meaning "the left-handed") came close to extinguishing the ancient realm of Abyssinia, and forcibly converting all of its surviving subjects to [[Islam]]; the intervention of the European [[Cristóvão da Gama]], son of the famous navigator [[Vasco da Gama]], attempted to help to prevent this outcome but was killed by al-Ghazi. However, both polities exhausted their resources and manpower in this conflict, allowing the northward migration of the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] into their present homelands to the north and west of [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopians: A History'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), pp. 96f and sources cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians trace the origins of hostility between [[Somalia]] and Ethiopia to this war.&lt;ref&gt;For example, David D. Laitin and Said S. Samatar, ''Somalia: Nation in Search of a State'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians also argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of [[firearms]] such as the [[matchlock]] [[musket]], [[cannons]], and the [[arquebus]] over traditional weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge illustrated atlas, warfare: Renaissance to revolution, 1492–1792 By Jeremy Black p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigerian conflict===
Inter-ethnic conflict in Nigeria has generally had a religious element. Riots against Igbo in 1953 and in the 1960s in the north were said to have been sparked by religious conflict. The riots against Igbo in the north in 1966 were said to have been inspired by radio reports of mistreatment of Muslims in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor = Alexander Laban Hilton |author=Kevin Lewis O'Neill|title= Genocide: truth, memory, and representation  |publisher= [[Duke University Press]] |date=March 2009|isbn= 978-0-8223-4405-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JHnEI2m5tFIC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;dq=igbo+riots+1966+radio#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A military coup d'état led by lower and middle-ranking officers, some of them Igbo, overthrew the NPC-NCNC dominated government. Prime Minister Balewa along with other northern and western government officials were assassinated during the coup. The coup was considered an Igbo plot to overthrow the northern dominated government. A counter-coup was launched by mostly northern troops. Between June and July there was a mass exodus of Ibo from the north and west. Over 1.3 million Ibo fled the neighboring regions in order to escape persecution as anti-Ibo riots increased. The aftermath of the anti-Ibo riots led many to believe that security could only be gained by separating from the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MARP,,NGA,,469f38c3467,0.html|title=Refworld - Chronology for Ibo in Nigeria|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, serious outbreaks between Christians and Muslims occurred in [[Kafanchan]] in southern [[Kaduna State]] in a border area between the two religions.

The [[2010 Jos riots]] saw clashes between Muslim herders against Christian farmers near the volatile city of [[Jos]], resulting in hundreds of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0308/Nigeria-violence-Muslim-Christian-clashes-kill-hundreds |title=Nigeria violence: Muslim-Christian clashes kill hundreds |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials estimated that 500 people were massacred in night-time raids by rampaging Muslim gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7054630.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=500 butchered in Nigeria killing fields | first1=Jonathan | last1=Clayton | first2=Ruth | last2=Gledhill | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist uprising===
During the rule of the Catholic [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] in [[South Vietnam]], the discrimination against the majority Buddhist population generated the growth of Buddhist institutions as they sought to participate in national politics and gain better treatment. The [[Buddhist Uprising]] of 1966 was a period of civil and military unrest in [[South Vietnam]], largely focused in the [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] area in the north of the country in central Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-vc-nva-pow-camp-1965-1966-2.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815093633/http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-vc-nva-pow-camp-1965-1966-2.asp |date=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam|Catholic Vietnamese]] minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.

===Chinese conflict===
The [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)]] and [[Panthay Rebellion]] (1856–1873) by the [[Hui people|Hui]] were also set off by racial antagonism and class warfare, rather than the mistaken assumption that it was all due to Islam that the rebellions broke out.&lt;ref&gt;John Alexander Selbie, Louis Herbert Gray 1916 893&lt;/ref&gt; During the Dungan revolt fighting broke out between [[Uyghurs]] and Hui.

In 1936, after Sheng Shicai [[Kazakh exodus from Xinjiang|expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai]], the Hui led by General [[Ma Bufang]] massacred their fellow Muslims, the [[Kazakhs]], until there were only 135 of them left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m98sAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=A+group+of+Kazakhs,+originally+numbering+over+20000+people+when+expelled+from+Sinkiang+by+Sheng+Shih-ts'ai+in+1936,+was+reduced,+after+repeated+massacres+by+their+Chinese+coreligionists+under+Ma+Pu-fang,+to+a+scattered+135+people&amp;dq=A+group+of+Kazakhs,+originally+numbering+over+20000+people+when+expelled+from+Sinkiang+by+Sheng+Shih-ts'ai+in+1936,+was+reduced,+after+repeated+massacres+by+their+Chinese+coreligionists+under+Ma+Pu-fang,+to+a+scattered+135+people|title=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 277|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NnY5AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang&amp;dq=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang|title=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volumes 276-278|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dramatic increase in the Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur Muslim populations. Some old Uyghurs in [[Kashgar]] remember that the Hui army at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=THis+dramatic+increase+in+the+hui+population+led+inevitably+to+significant+tensions+between+the+hui+and&amp;q=This%20dramatic%20increase%20in%20the%20hui%20population%20led%20inevitably%20to%20significant%20tensions%20between%20the%20hui%20and|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim borderland|author=S.

===Lebanese Civil War===
[[File:Beirut- building from before civil war.jpeg|thumb|War-damaged buildings in Beirut]]
There is no consensus among scholars on what triggered the Lebanese Civil War. However, the militarization of the [[Palestinian refugee]] population, with the arrival of the [[PLO]] guerrilla forces did spark an [[arms race]] amongst the different [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] political factions. However the conflict played out along three religious lines, [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Christian Lebanese]] and [[Shiite Muslim]], [[Druze]] are considered among Shiite Muslims.

It has been argued that the antecedents of the war can be traced back to the conflicts and political compromises reached after the end of Lebanon's administration by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Cold War]] had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] that preceded the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|1958 political crisis]]. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] an exodus of [[Palestinian refugees]] who [[1948 Palestinian exodus|fled the fighting or were expelled from their homes]], arrived in Lebanon. Palestinians came to play a very important role in future Lebanese civil conflicts, whilst the establishment of Israel radically changed the local environment in which Lebanon found itself.

Lebanon was promised independence and on 22 November 1943 it was achieved. [[Free France|Free French troops]], who had invaded Lebanon in 1941 to rid Beirut of the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, left the country in 1946. The Christians assumed power over the country and economy. A confessional parliament was created, where Muslims and Christians were given quotas of seats in parliament. As well, the President was to be a Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim and the Speaker of Parliament a Shia Muslim.

In March 1991, parliament passed an [[amnesty law]] that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment. The amnesty was not extended to crimes perpetrated against foreign diplomats or certain crimes referred by the cabinet to the Higher Judicial Council. In May 1991, the militias (with the important exception of [[Hezbollah]]) were dissolved, and the [[Military of Lebanon|Lebanese Armed Forces]] began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.

Some violence still occurred. In late December 1991 a car bomb (estimated to carry 220 pounds of TNT) exploded in the Muslim neighborhood of [[Basta, Lebanon|Basta]]. At least thirty people were killed, and 120 wounded, including former Prime Minister [[Shafik Wazzan]], who was riding in a bulletproof car.

===Yugoslav Wars===
{{main|Yugoslav Wars}} {{see also|Foreign fighters in the Bosnian War}}
The [[Croatian War]] (1991–95) and [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95), have been viewed of as religious wars between the Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim populations of former [[Yugoslavia]], that is, [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]].&lt;ref name="RadeljićTopić2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Branislav Radeljić|author2=Martina Topić|title=Religion in the Post-Yugoslav Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VEiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=1 July 2015|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-4985-2248-9|pages=5–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoyleSheen1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin Boyle|author2=Juliet Sheen|title=Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxXIwVPran0C&amp;pg=PA409|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15977-7|pages=409 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional religious symbols were used during the wars.&lt;ref&gt;Velikonja, Mitja.

===Sudanese Civil War===
The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] from 1983 to 2005 have describe the conflict as an [[ethnoreligious]] one where the Muslim central government's pursuits to impose sharia law on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war. The war resulted in the independence of [[South Sudan]] six years after the war ended.

The '''Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha''' is the major [[Sanātanī|Sanātanī Hindu (Orthodox Hindu)]] organisation in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It operates 150 [[Hindu temple|mandirs]], over 50 [[Parochial school|schools]], and has it very own radio station, [[Radio Jaagriti 102.7 FM]], and TV channel, TV Jaagriti Trinidad and Tobago. It was formed in 1952 when [[Bhadase Maraj]] engineered the merger of the ''Satanan Dharma Association'' and the ''Sanatan Dharma Board of Control''. An affiliated group, the '''[[Pandit|Pundits]]' Parishad''', has 200 affiliated [[Pandit|pundits]]. The organisation's headquarters are located in [[Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/_Theatre_in_motion___at_Baal_Vikaas_finals-123727174.html|title='Theatre in motion' at Baal Vikaas finals|work=Trinidad Express|accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President General of the Maha Sabha is [[Pandit|Pt.]] Utham Maharaj  and the Secretary General is [[Satnarayan Maharaj]], son-in-law of the founder, Bhadase Maraj{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

In 1881, a Sanatan Dharma Association was founded in Trinidad and Tobago in an attempt to consolidate [[Hindu]]s and lobby on their behalf. This Association, however, was not known for any significant advances in Hindu organizational development. Other groups existed by the 1920s including the Trinidad Hindu Maha Sabha, San Feranado Hindu Sabha, and the Sanatan Dharma Prabartakh Sabha{{cn|date=April 2015}}. But these, too, were not especially dynamic in shaping the course of Hindu history. The most significant advances in Hindu organizational development of these Sabhas came as a response to the Arya Samaj and its missionaries{{cn|date=April 2015}}.

The controversies stirred by the [[Arya Samaj]] spokesmen acted as a kind of catalyst for the leaders of the [[Hindu|Sanatan Dharma]] community to make greater strides towards effective organization.The Sanatan Dharma Association was incorporated by an act of Legislature in 1932{{cn|date=April 2015}}. A conservative group of [[Hindu]]s led by [[Pandit|Pt.]] [[Sahadeo Tiwari]], established a rival organization, the Sanatan Dharma Board of Control which was also incorporated in 1932. Each of these served to represent the interests of the Hindu community with regard to social action or issues surrounding the orthodoxy; they also served to liaise with colonial or parliamentary authorities. In 1935, in a move to demonstrate greater legitimacy, the Board became formally affiliated with the Sanatan Dharma Pratindhi Sabha based in [[Lahore]], [[British Raj|British India]] (present day [[Pakistan]]). Pundits and laymen throughout the island became affiliated with one or the other of the two national Hindu bodies. The Sanatan Dharma Board of Control, for example had branches in 32 villages by the late 1930s{{cn|date=April 2015}}.

The greatest development in the [[Hindu]] communal activity in Trinidad and Tobago began in 1952 when under the guidance and direction of  powerful [[Pandit|Pt.]] Goberdhan JP of [[Siparia]] Old Road in southern [[Trinidad]], [[Trinidad and Tobago#British rule|British Trinidad and Tobago]] (who acted as a representative of the [[List of Governors of Trinidad and Tobago|Governor General of Trinidad and Tobago]] at difficult times)  Bhadase Maraj united the Sanatan Dharma Association and the Sanatan Dharma Board of Control{{cn|date=April 2015}}. In that year Maraj, a self-made millionaire and sugar union leader, merged the two [[Sanātanī]] [[Hindu]] bodies, to create a much more powerful pressure group and public organization. The new organization, the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, was incorporated in 1952. The Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha’s parishad, or council of pundits worked towards a complete coordination of temples activities and the standardization of ritual procedure. Relatively few structured, permanent religious groups existed in Trinidad's [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian]] villages until the advent of the Maha Sabha school building programme. Many [[Hindu temples|mandirs]] were constructed or affiliated in addition. In order to ensure uniform teaching and practices, the Maha Sabha published literature to be used at all schools and temples{{cn|date=April 2015}}.

Yet foremost on the new organization agenda was education, which its members saw as the key to promoting [[Hindu]] unity in all parts of the country, to promulgating the faith among future generations [[Hindu]]s, and to provide Indians with greater opportunities for social advancement. Between 1952 and 1956 the Maha Sabha built no less than 31 schools all over the island. Today the Maha Sabha operates 42 schools in Trinidad and Tobago
], over 150 [[Hindu temples|mandirs]], and affiliated over 200 [[pandit|pundits]].

Under the present Secretary General, [[Satnarayan Maharaj]], the Maha Sabha has modernized all 42 schools and built 5 secondary schools as well as 12 early childhood educational centers. Maharaj was instrumental in the creation of the [[Indian Arrival Day]] holiday and annual celebrations. The Maha Sabha introduced a Children’s Cultural Festival Baal Vikaas Vihar.

The '''see of Tyre''' was one of the most ancient dioceses in [[Christianity]]. The existence of a Christian community there already in the time of [[Saint Paul]] is mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|21:3-7|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seated at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], which was the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenicia Prima]], the bishopric was a [[metropolitan see]]. Its position was briefly challenged by the see of [[Berytus]] in the mid-5th century; but after 480/1 the metropolitan of Tyre established himself as the first (''[[protothronos]]'') of all the metropolitans subject to the [[Patriarch of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Eißfeldt | first = Otto |title = Phoiniker (Phoinike) | encyclopedia = [[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]] | volume = Band XX, Halbband 39, Philon-Pignus  | year = 1941 | page=369 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017 a Greek inscription, five-metres long, naming Irenaeus as bishop of Tyre, was found west of the Sea of Galilee, in an excavation co-directed by historian Jacob Ashkenazi and archaeologist Mordechai Aviam. Since the inscription provides the date of the church’s completion as 445, it gives credence to a date as early as 444 CE for his ordination (Source: The Times of Israel, article '1,600-year-old church mosaic puzzles out key role of women in early Christianity' by Amanda Borschel-Dan, 7 November 2017, published 11:13 am https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-run-the-world-sometimes-women-1600-year-old-church-mosaic-shows/) The Times of Israel article contains a photograph of the inscription which would be an excellent illustration for this page.

==History==
[[Communion (Christianity)|Communion]] with the [[Holy See|see of Rome]] was broken following the [[East–West Schism]]. When the [[Crusade]]rs conquered Tyre, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] archbishop withdrew to [[Constantinople]] and a [[Latin Church|Latin]] named Eudes was appointed archbishop, but he died in 1124, the same year in which the Crusaders succeeded in taking the city.

The most notable of the Latin archbishops of Tyre of this time was the historian [[William of Tyre]], who served from 1175 to 1185.

Tyre then belonged to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], not the more northerly [[Principality of Antioch]]. On the basis of the [[Pentarchy]] system, the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch]] claimed the right to appoint the archbishop, which was exercised by the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]]. [[Pope Innocent II]] adjudicated the dispute in favour of Jerusalem on the basis of a decree of [[Pope Paschal II]] granting King Baldwin the right to make all sees conquered from the Muslims subject to Jerusalem. It was the practice to choose as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem the archbishop of Tyre or of [[Caesarea in Palaestina (diocese)|Caesarea in Palaestina]].

In 1187, after [[Saladin]]'s invasion, Tyre was the only city remaining in Crusader hands and was at one point considered as the new capital of the kingdom. It lost that appellation to [[Acre (city)|Acre]], but it remained the site of the coronation of the king, and the archbishop was given the responsibility of officiating at the coronation.

Starting with [[Sultan]] [[Baibars]] in 1254, the [[Islamic]] chieftains declared [[jihad]] on the Crusaders and slowly started exterminating the remaining Christian communities on the coastlands. The last archbishops, John and Bonacourt, devoted their rule to forestalling the [[Mamluk]] conquest, attempting to obtain the freedom of enslaved Christians, caring for refugees, and preparing for the coming assault. After a long siege, the city was captured by the Mamluks in 1291. The city was mostly evacuated by the time the Mamluks arrived, but the remaining population, including the archbishop, were killed or enslaved. The churches were torn down, and the archdiocese became [[Titular bishop|titular]]; only in the 18th and 19th centuries was a new archbishop appointed to protect the newly restored pilgrim routes.  Due to the ongoing conflict and dislocations in modern Lebanon and the decline of influence of Christianity there, the see has remained vacant again since 1984.

The '''Shailendra dynasty''' ({{IAST3|Śailēndra}} derived from [[Sanskrit]] combined words ''Śaila'' and ''Indra'', meaning "King of the Mountain",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cœdes|first1=G|others=translated by H.M.

The Shailendras are considered to have been a [[thalassocracy]] and ruled vast swathes of maritime Southeast Asia, however they also relied on agricultural pursuits, by way of intensive rice cultivation on the [[Kedu Plain]] of Central Java. The dynasty appeared to be the ruling family of both the [[Medang Kingdom]] of Central Java, for some period, and the [[Srivijaya]] Kingdom in Sumatra.

The inscriptions created by Shailendras use three languages; [[Old Malay]], [[Old Javanese]], and [[Sanskrit]] - written either in the [[Kawi alphabet]], or pre-[[Nāgarī script]]. The use of Old Malay has sparked speculation of a Sumatran origin, or Srivijayan connection of this family. On the other hand, the use of Old Javanese suggests their firm political establishment on Java. The use of Sanskrit usually indicates the official nature, and/or religious significance, of the event described in any given inscription.

== Primary sources ==
{{History of Indonesia}}
The [[Sojomerto inscription]] (c. 725) discovered in [[Batang Regency]], Central Java, mentioned the name ''Dapunta Selendra'' and ''Selendranamah''. The name 'Selendra' was another spelling of Shailendra, suggested that Dapunta Selendra was the progenitor of Shailendra family in Central Java.&lt;ref name="Boechari"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boechari|first=|authorlink=Boechari|title=Preliminary report on the discovery of an Old Malay inscription at Sojomerto |journal =MISI|year=1966|volume=III|issue=|pages=241–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is [[Shaivism|Shaivist]] in nature, which suggests that the family was probably initially Hindu Shaivist before converting to [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]].

The earliest dated inscription in Indonesia in which clearly mentioned the dynastic name of ''{{IAST|Śailēndra}}'' as ''{{IAST|Śailēndravamśatilaka}}'' appears is the [[Kalasan inscription]] (778) of central Java, which mention its ruler [[Panangkaran|Mahārāja dyāḥ Pañcapaṇa kariyāna Paṇaṃkaraṇa]] and commemorates the establishment of a Buddhist shrine, [[Candi of Indonesia|Candi]] [[Kalasan]], dedicated for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="ISEAS-Zakharov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall1985:110"&gt;Hall(1985:110)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name also appears in several other inscriptions like the [[Kelurak inscription]] (782) and the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (824). Outside Indonesia, the name Shailendra is to be found in the [[Ligor inscription]] (775) on the Malay peninsula and [[Nalanda inscription]] (860) in India.&lt;ref name="Hall1985:110"/&gt; It is possible that it was [[Panangkaran|Paṇaṃkaraṇa]] that create the Chaiya, or [[Ligor inscription]] (775), and took control over Srivijayan realm in the Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.&lt;ref name="ISEAS-Zakharov"/&gt;

==Possible origins==

Although the rise of the Shailendras occurred in [[Kedu Plain]] in the Javanese heartland, their origin has been the subject of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Shailendras were not a Javanese dynasty |journal=Indonesia and the Malay World |author=Roy E. Jordaan |volume=34 |issue=98 |pages=3–22 |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/13639810600650711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Java itself; an earlier homeland in Sumatra, India or Cambodia has been suggested. The latest studies apparently favour a native origin of the dynasty. Despite their connections with Srivijaya in Sumatra and Thai-Malay Peninsula, the Shailendras were more likely of Javanese origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===India===
According to [[Ramesh Chandra Majumdar]], an Indian scholar, the Shailendra dynasty that established itself in the Indonesian archipleago originated from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] in Eastern India.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, 1933: 121-141&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion is also shared by [[Nilakanta Sastri]] and J. L. Moens. Moens further describes that the Shailendras originated in India and established themselves in [[Palembang]] before the arrival of Srivijaya's [[Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa]]. In 683, the Shailendras moved to Java because of the pressure exerted by Dapunta Hyang and his troops.&lt;ref&gt;Moens, 1937: 317-487&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sumatra===
Other scholars hold that the expansion of Buddhist kingdom of [[Srivijaya]] was involved in the rise of the dynasty in Java.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Munoz (2006:139)&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of this connection emphasize the shared Mahayana patronage; the intermarriages and the Ligor inscription. Also the fact that some of Shailendra's inscriptions were written in [[old Malay]], which suggested Srivijaya or Sumatran connections. The name 'Selendra' was first mentioned in [[Sojomerto inscription]] (725) as "Dapunta Selendra". Dapunta Selendra is suggested as the ancestor of Shailendras. The title Dapunta is similar to those of Srivijayan King [[Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa]], and the inscription — although discovered in Central Java north coast — was written in old Malay, which suggested the Sumatran origin or Srivijayan connection to this family.

===Java===
{{see also|Sanjaya dynasty}}
Another theory suggests that Shailendra was a native Javanese dynasty and the  [[Sanjaya dynasty]] was actually a branch of the Shailendras since [[Sri Sanjaya]] and his offspring belong to the Shailendra family that were initially the [[Shaivism|Shaivist]] rulers of the [[Medang Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;(Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254-264)&lt;/ref&gt; The association of Shailendra with Mahayana Buddhism began after the conversion of Panaraban or Panangkaran to Buddhism. This theory is based on the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', which tells of the ailing King Sanjaya ordering his son, Rakai Panaraban or Panangkaran, to convert to Buddhism because their faith in [[Shiva]] was feared by the people in favor of the pacifist Buddhist faith. The conversion of Panangkaran to Buddhism also corresponds to the [[Raja Sankhara inscription]], which tells of a king named Sankhara (identified as Panangkaran) converting to Buddhism because his Shaiva faith was feared by the people. Unfortunately, the Raja Sankhara inscription is now missing.

===Discounted proposal===
In 1934, the French scholar [[George Coedès|Coedes]] proposed a relation with the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom in [[Cambodia]]. Coedes believed that the Funanese rulers used similar-sounding 'mountainlord' titles, but several Cambodia specialists have discounted this. They  hold there is no historical evidence for such titles in the Funan period.&lt;ref&gt;(Jacques 1979; Vickery 2003-2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shailendras in Java ==
[[File:Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Borobudur]], the largest Buddhist structure in the world.]]

The Shailendra rulers maintained cordial relations, including marriage alliances with [[Srivijaya]] in [[Sumatra]]. For instance, [[Samaragrawira]] married Dewi Tara, a daughter of Srivijayan Maharaja [[Dharmasetu]]. The mutual alliance between the two kingdoms ensured that Srivijaya had no need to fear the emergence of a Javanese rival and that the Shailendra had access to the international market.

Karangtengah inscription dated 824 mentioned about king Samaratungga. His daughter named [[Pramodhawardhani]] has inaugurated a ''Jinalaya'', a sacred buddhist sanctuary. The inscription also mentioned a sacred Buddhist building called ''Venuvana'' to place the cremated ashes of King Indra. The [[Tri Tepusan inscription]] dated 842 mentioned about the ''sima'' (tax free) lands awarded by Śrī Kahulunan (Pramodhawardhani, daughter of Samaratungga) to ensure the funding and maintenance of a ''Kamūlān'' called ''Bhūmisambhāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono,| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973, 5th reprint edition in 1988 | location =Yogyakarta| page =46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kamūlān'' itself from the word ''mula'' which means 'the place of origin', a sacred building to honor the [[ancestors]]. These findings suggested that either the ancestors of the Shailendras were originated from Central Java, or as the sign that Shailendra have established their holds on Java. Casparis suggested that ''Bhūmi Sambhāra Bhudhāra'' which in [[Sanskrit]] means "The mountain of combined virtues of the ten stages of [[Boddhisattva]]hood", was the original name of Borobudur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walubi|first=|title=Borobudur : Candi Berbukit Kebajikan|publisher=|date=|location=|url=http://www.walubi.or.id/waisak2004/Borobudur%20-%20Candi%20Berbukit%20Kebajikan.shtml|doi= |pages=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The received older version holds that the Shailendra dynasty existed next to the [[Sanjaya dynasty]] in Java. Much of the period was characterized by peaceful co-existence and cooperation but towards the middle of the 9th century relations had deteriorated. Around 852 the Sanjaya ruler Pikatan had defeated Balaputra, the offspring of the Shailendra monarch Samaratunga and princess Tara. This ended the Shailendra presence in Java and Balaputra retreated to the Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra, where he became the paramount ruler.&lt;ref&gt;" De Casparis proposed that in 856 Balaputra was defeated by Pikatan, whereupon Balaputra retreated to Srivijaya, the country of his mother, to become the first Shailendra ruler of Srivijaya. Thus in the late 9th century Srivijaya was ruled by a Buddhist Shailendra ruler, while Java was ruled by Pikatan and his successors who patronized Siva" (cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|108}}

Earlier historians, such as N.J. Krom and Coedes, tend to equate [[Samaragrawira]] and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|108}} However, later historians such as Slamet Muljana equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in [[Mantyasih inscription]] as fifth monarch of [[Mataram Kingdom]]. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira, and [[Balaputradewa]] that is also Samaragrawira's son, is Samaratungga's younger brother and ruled in Suvarnadvipa (Sumatra), and he is not Samaratungga's son. This version holds Balaputra that reign in Sumatra challenged the Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani legitimation in Java, arguing that his niece and her husband has less rights to rule Java compared to his.

==Shailendras in Sumatra==

After 824, there are no more references to the Shailendra house in the Javanese ephigraphic record. Around 860 the name re-appears in the [[Nalanda inscription]] in India. According to the text, the king Devapaladeva of Bengala ([[Pala Empire]]) had granted 'Balaputra, the king of Suvarna-dvipa' (Sumatra) the revenues of 5 villages to a Buddhist monastery near Bodh Gaya. Balaputra was styled a descendant from the Shailendra dynasty and grandson of the king of Java.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|108–109}}&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1985:109)&lt;/ref&gt;

From Sumatra, the Shailendras also maintained overseas relations with the Chola kingdom in Southern India, as shown by several south Indian inscriptions. An 11th-century inscription mentioned the grant of revenues to a local Buddhist sanctuary, built in 1005 by the king of the Srivijaya. In spite the relations were initially fairly cordial, hostilities had broken out in 1025.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1985:200)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajendra Chola I]] the Emperor of the [[Chola dynasty]] conquered some territories of the Shailendra Dynasty in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Civilization and Culture  by Suhas Chatterjee p.499&lt;/ref&gt; The devastation caused by [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]] in 1025, marked the end of Shailendra family as the ruling dynasty in Sumatra. The last king of Shailendra dynasty — the Maharaja [[Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman]] — was imprisoned and taken as hostage. Nevertheless, amity was re-established between the two states, before the end of the 11th century. In 1090 a new charter was granted to the old Buddhist sanctuary, it is the last known inscription with a reference to the Shailendras. With the absence of legitimate successor, Shailendra dynasty seems ceased to rule. Other family within Srivijaya mandala took over the throne, a new Maharaja named [[Sri Deva]] according to Chinese source establishing new dynasty to rule Srivijaya. He sent an embassy to the court of China in 1028 CE.

==Shailendras in Bali==
[[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] was said to be a Buddhist king of the Shailendra Dynasty, leading a military expedition,&lt;ref&gt;''Bali handbook with Lombok and the Eastern Isles by Liz Capaldi, Joshua Eliot p.98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-iPvaB380_8C&amp;pg=PA98]''&lt;/ref&gt; to establishing a [[Mahayana]] Buddhist government in [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JlcL6HeY-uAC&amp;pg=PA156 ''Bali &amp; Lombok'' Lesley Reader, Lucy Ridout p.156]&lt;/ref&gt; In 914, he left a record of his endeavour in the [[Belanjong pillar]] in [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] in Bali. According to this inscription [[Warmadewa dynasty]] was probably the branch of Shailendras that rule Bali.

== List of Shailendran rulers ==
Traditionally, the Shailendra period was viewed to span from the 8th to the 9th century, confined only in Central Java, from the era of Panangkaran to Samaratungga. However the recent interpretation suggests the longer period of Shailendra family might existed, from mid 7th century (edict of Sojomerto inscription) to early 11th century (the fall of Shailendran dynasty of Srivijaya under Chola invasion). For certain period, Shailendras ruled both Central Java and Sumatra. Their alliance and intermarriage with Srivijayan ruling family resulted with the merging of two royal houses, with Shailendran finally emerge as the ruling family of both Srivijaya and Medang Mataram (Central Java).

Some historians tried to reconstruct the order and list of Shailendra rulers, although there is some disagreement on the list. Boechari tried to reconstruct the early stage of Shailendra based on Sojomerto inscription, while other historians such as Slamet Muljana and Poerbatjaraka tried to reconstruct the list of Shailendran king in middle and later period with their connections to [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] and Srivijaya, based on inscriptions and [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript. However, there is some confusion occurred, because the Shailendra seems to rule many kingdoms; Kalingga, Medang and later Srivijaya. As the result name of the same kings often overlapped and seens to rule these kingdoms simultaneously. The questionmark (?) signify doubt or speculation because of the scarcity of available valid sources.

'''[[Sikhism]]''' is a religion originating from [[South Asia]] (predominantly from the [[Punjab]] region of modern-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]) which was introduced into the [[United States]] during the 19th century. In 2007, there were estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000 Sikhs living in the United States, with largest populations living on the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coasts]], together with additional populations in [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8R-Kl2C1C7QC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs in America: A Short History, p. 120|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Racialization of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism in the United States, Khyati Y. Joshi, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also has a number of non-Punjabi converts to Sikhism.&lt;ref name="Bayor2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald H. Bayor|title=Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YN9jC2_7UHYC&amp;pg=PA985|accessdate=6 June 2013|date=31 July 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35787-9|pages=985–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikh men are typically identifiable by their unshorn beards and [[Dastar|turban]]s (head coverings), articles of their faith. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and subsequent other terrorism related activities by Islamic groups, Sikhs have often been mistaken as Muslims or Arabs, and have been subject to several [[Hate crimes in the United States|hate crimes]], including murders. Sikh temples have also been targets of violence due to being mistaken for mosques. A [[Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting|shooting]] at a Sikh temple in [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin]] garnered national and international attention, with then President Obama ordering flags to be half-staffed at all federal buildings.

The ability of observant Sikhs to serve in the American military has, since 1985, been compromised by a discontinuation of exemptions to uniform standards which previously allowed Sikhs to maintain their religiously-mandated beards and turbans while in uniform.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beard Ban Deters Chabad Rabbis From Becoming Chaplains in Army |author= |newspaper= |date=27 August 2005 |url=http://www.crownheights.info/index.php?itemid=479 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, a Sikh doctor, Kamaljeet S.

====Policing====
In 2016, the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) began to allow turbans, subject to standards compatible with unimpeded performance of duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/homepage2/nypd-sikh-officers-turbans-policy-change/|title=NYPD changes policy, will allow officers to wear turbans|author=David Shortell|publisher=CNN|date=December 29, 2016|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Professionals====
Many Sikhs started life in America working in lumber mills, mines, and as farm laborers, with many eventually becoming landowners. Many early Sikh immigrants were restaurant owners. In 1956, [[Dalip Singh Saund]] became the first Asian Indian-born person to be elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]].

===Settlement===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
The most concentrated Sikh community in the United States has traditionally resided in agricultural [[Yuba City, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/pamphlet/2012/06/201206066956.html#axzz3IapughIs | title=American Punjabi Sikhs, Yuba City, California | publisher=US Embassy | work=IIP Digital | accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this agglomeration has since dispersed as Sikhs have gained a greater educational foundation, enabling them to have now spread out to metropolitan areas all over the United States. The largest and most rapidly growing Sikh community in [[New York City]] is based in the [[Richmond Hill, Queens|Richmond Hill]] area of the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]]; the majority consist of more recent emigres from India and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704868604575433532014656688 | title=New Immigrants Put Stamp on Richmond Hill | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=20 August 2010 | accessdate=9 November 2014 | author=Mokha, Kavita}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in the [[Sikh Foundation of Virginia]], most members comprise both recent and more established [[Jatt Sikh]]s, [[Ramgarhia|Ramgarhia Sikhs]], and [[Sikh Rajput]]s. Most Sikhs of [[Española, New Mexico]] are non-Punjabi converts to Sikhism.

==History==

===First immigrants===
[[Sikhs]] have been a part of the [[United States|American]] populace for more than 130 years. Near the end of the 19th century, the state of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] of [[British India]] was hit hard by British practices of [[mercantilism]]. Many Sikhs emigrated to the United States and began arriving to work on farms in California. They traveled via [[Hong Kong]] to [[Angel Island, California]], the western counterpart to [[Ellis Island]] in [[New York Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/h_es/h_es_korit_histical.htm#Pioneers The Pioneers, America, "A historical perspective of Americans of Asian Indian origin 1790-1997"] 31 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some Sikhs worked in lumber mills of [[Oregon]] or in railroad construction and for some Sikhs it was on a railway line, which allowed other Sikhs who were working as migrant laborers to come into the town on festival days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kabira.freeservers.com/sikhsinnorthamerica.html Sikhism in North America, America, "Sikhs in North America"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305203404/http://kabira.freeservers.com/sikhsinnorthamerica.html |date=2007-03-05 }} 31 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A big effect on Sikh migration to the western states occurred during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], where Sikhs were recruited by the [[British Army]] to serve for them. Sikhs fought bravely during these wars and began to live in England after their serving period. Among the Sikhs who already lived in America prior to the wars, many Sikhs joined them, mainly during World Wars I and II. Among those who served in the US military include [[Bhagat Singh Thind]] in World War I.

The first Sikh [[gurdwara]] in the US was the [[Gurdwara Sahib Stockton]], in [[Stockton, California]]; the Gurdwara was created in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stocktongurdwarasahib.com/ Stockton Gurdwara, America, "Stockton California"] 31 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the September 11, 2001 attacks===

As a result of the [[September 11 attacks]], some Sikh Americans have become subject to discrimination, often from individuals who mistakenly believe that they are [[Arab]] or [[Muslim]].

Balbir Singh Sodhi, a gas station owner, [[Murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi|was killed]] on September 15, 2001 due to being mistaken for a Muslim. In a 2011 report to the [[United States Senate]], the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] reported several assaults and incidents of arson at [[Gurdwara|Sikh temples]] after September 11. All were labeled as [[hate crime]]s that resulted from the perpetrators' misconceptions that their targets were Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Muslim Incidents Since Sept. 11, 2001|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-testifies-about-increase-in-anti-muslim-bias/anti-muslim-incidents-since-9-11|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, a Sikh temple in [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin]] was the [[Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting|site of a shooting]], leading to 6 Sikh individuals being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gunman's tattoos lead officials to deem Sikh shooting terrorism|author=Matt Pearce |author2=Brian Bennett |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-sikh-temple-domestic-terrorism-20120805,0,6094643.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 August 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2013, an elderly Sikh man was attacked with an iron bar in Fresno, California in a possible [[hate crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fresno police: Sikh beating a possible hate crime|author=SF Gate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Fresno-police-Sikh-beating-a-possible-hate-crime-4496778.php |newspaper=[[SF Gate]] |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 2013, Prabhjot Singh, a Sikh professor was attacked in [[Harlem]], New York by a group of 20-30 men who branded him as "Osama" and Terrorist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Professor attacked in Columbia after being called Osama|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/indian-professor-attacked-in-columbia-after-being-called-osama/|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey of Sikh students by the [[Sikh Coalition]] found that three out of four male students interviewed "had been teased or harassed on account of their religious identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Civil Rights in Wartime: The Post-9/11 Sikh Experience |last=Sidhu |first= Darwinder S.  |authorlink= |author2=Neha Singh Gohil |year=2009 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |isbn=978-0-7546-7553-2 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Sikh Coalition released a national report on the bullying of Sikh children in American schools. The report found that 55.8% of Sikh students surveyed in [[Indianapolis]] reported being bullied, while 54.5% of Sikh students surveyed in [[Fresno, California]] reported being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Fresno County Sikh students say they're bullied at school|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/03/13/3818923/sikh-community-alarmed-by-bullying.html|newspaper=Fresno Bee|date=March 13, 2014|author=Juan Orozco|author2=Carmen George}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the surveys, Sikh students wearing turbans are twice as likely to be bullied as the average American child.

===Converts===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION COULD USE SOME HELP DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CONVERTS TO 3HO SIKHISM, AND THOSE TO MAINSTREAM SIKHISM --&gt;
In the 1960s, due to increased Indian immigration and rising interest in Indian spirituality in the American counterculture, a number of non-Punjabi Americans began to enter Sikhism. Prominent in this trend was [[Yogi Bhajan]], leader of the Sikh-related movement [[3HO]] (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization), whose Los Angeles temple was the first to initiate non-Punjabi Americans into Sikhism.&lt;ref name="Bayor2011"/&gt;

'''Al-Maharraqa''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المحرقة, DMG: Al-Maḥarraqa, [[Greek language|Greek]]: Hierasykaminos) is a place in [[Lower Nubia]], which was approximately {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Aswan]] on the southern border of the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick, Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few years after the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]] from the kingdom of [[Meroë]] launched a raid on the [[First Cataract]] region of Egypt in 23 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Quirke &amp; Jeffrey Spenser (ed.) The British Museum Book of Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1994. p.212&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman prefect of Egypt, Petronius, retaliated and defeated the invading Meroitic army. He then proceeded to station a Roman garrison of 400 troops at the southern outpost of [[Qasr Ibrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Quirke &amp; Spenser, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; After some negotiations, a permanent frontier between Meroë and Roman Egypt was established at Maharraqa.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke &amp; Spenser, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Maharraqa formed the extreme southern frontier of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]].

==The Serapis Isis Temple of Maharraqa==
[[Image:Stairwell of the temple of Maharraqa by Dennis C. Jarvis.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The spiral stairwell of Maharraqa temple]]
[[Image:Courtyard of Maharraqa temple by Dennis G. Jarvis.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The courtyard of Maharraqa temple]]
The '''Temple of Maharraqa''' was originally situated here before it was subsequently relocated in the mid-1960s due to the [[Aswan Dam]] project. It was dedicated to the ancient Egyptian [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] [[Isis]] and [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, Oxford University Press, 1999. p.244&lt;/ref&gt; This Roman-built [[Egyptian temple]] cannot be securely attributed to any Roman emperor's reign since it was never fully completed nor inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; However, since it is known that temple building declined in Nubia after the rule of [[Augustus]], the temple of Maharraqa might be datable to his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; The only part of the structure that was finished "was a court measuring 13.56 X 15.69 m, which was surrounded on three sides by columns."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick, Gardiner, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The actual temple premises containing the sanctuary was never actually built. The temple, as well, lacks a formal [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]].  

The Temple of Maharraqa features an architectural curiosity with a winding spiral staircase at a corner of the court, which led to its roof.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick, Gardiner, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only Egyptian temple in Nubia with a spiral staircase.

==Relocation of the Temple==
Since its former location was threatened by flooding from the Nile due to the construction of the Aswan dam, this small temple was dismantled in 1961 by the Egyptian Antiquities Service.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick, Gardiner, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently rebuilt along with the [[Temple of Dakka]] in 1966 at the [[New Wadi es-Sebua]] site which lies only {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} west of the original Wadi es-Sebua location.&lt;ref&gt;John Baines &amp; Jaromír Málek, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Facts on File Publications New York, 1982. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; As Christine Hobson notes:

"A little to the north of [[Amada]] now stand the temples of [[Wadi es-Sebua|Wadi es Sebua]] (built by Ramesses II), Dakka and Maharraka."&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tenskwatawa''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|n|s|k|w|ɒ|t|ɒ|w|eɪ}};{{fix|text=stress?}} also called '''Tenskatawa''', '''Tenskwatawah''', '''Tensquatawa''' or '''Lalawethika''') (January 1775&amp;nbsp;– November 1836) was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] religious and political leader of the [[Shawnee]] tribe, known as '''the Prophet''' or '''the Shawnee Prophet'''. He was a younger brother of [[Tecumseh]], a leader of the Shawnee. In his early years Tenskwatawa was given the name Lalawithika ("He Makes a Loud Noise", "The Noise Maker", or "The Rattle"),&lt;ref name=Fowltown&gt;{{cite book

He was once the town drunk, but about 1805, after a stupor so deep that he was believed dead, he awoke and said he had visited the Master of Breath, and been shown a heaven with game and honey for those who lived virtuously and traditionally. He was a [[métis]] ([[mestizo]]), but he transformed himself into an influential spiritual leader. Tenskwatawa denounced the Euro-American settlers, calling them offspring of the Evil Spirit, and led a purification movement that promoted unity among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], rejected acculturation to the settler way of life, including alcohol, and encouraged his followers to pursue traditional ways. He was called a Prophet.&lt;ref name=Fowltown /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

In the early 1800s Tenskwatawa formed a community with his followers near [[Greenville, Ohio|Greenville]] in western [[Ohio]], and in 1808 he and his brother, Tecumseh, established a village that the Americans called [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] north of present-day [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. At Prophetstown the brothers' pan-Indian resistance movement increased to include thousands of followers, with Tenskwatawa providing the spiritual foundation. Together, they mobilized the Native Americans in what was then the western United States, from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the Mississippi, to fight the whites and remain resolute in their rejection of United States authority and acculturation.

On November 7, 1811, while Tecumseh was away, Tenskwatawa ordered the pre-dawn attack on a U.S. military force encamped near Prophetstown that initiated the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. The Indians retreated after a two-hour engagement and abandoned Prophetstown, which the military burned to the ground. The battle did not end the Indians' resistance against the United States, but the Prophet lost his influence, became an outcast, and moved to [[Canada]] during the [[War of 1812]]. After Tecumseh was killed at the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813, the Native American resistance movement did not recover and was eventually defeated. Tenskwatawa remained as an exile in Canada for nearly a decade. He returned to the United States in 1824 to assist the U.S. government with the Shawnee removal to reservation land in present-day [[Kansas]]. The aging Prophet arrived at the Shawnee reservation in 1828 and faded into obscurity. Tenskwatawa died at what is known as the [[Argentine, Kansas|Argentine]] district of present-day [[Kansas City, Kansas]], in 1836.

==Early life and family==
[[Image:Shawnee Prophet, Tenskwatawa.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Charles Bird King]]]]

Lalawethika ("He Makes a Loud Noise" or "Noise Maker"), who as an adult changed his name to Tenskwatawa ("Open Door" or "One With Open Mouth"), was part of a set of triplet brothers born in early 1775 to Puckeshinwa and Methoataske in a Shawnee village along the Mad River in western [[Ohio]]. One of the triplets died within the first year of his birth, but Tenskwatawa and his surviving triplet, Kumskaukau, were members of a family that included at least eight children (three daughters and five sons).&lt;ref name=Prophet29&gt;{{cite book | author=R.

Instead, his sad and isolated youth was marked by numerous failures and alcoholism.&lt;ref name=Madison38&gt;{{cite book | author=James H.

Tenskwatawa's father, Puckenshinwa ("Something That Falls"), was a leader of the Kispokotha division of the Shawnee tribe. He was killed by a British soldier in the Battle of Point Pleasant before Tenskwatawa was born.&lt;ref name=Sugden14&gt;{{cite book |title=Tecumseh: A Life |author=John Sudden |year= 1997|publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location= New York |page=14 |isbn= 0-8050-4138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Methoataske (or Methoataaskee, meaning "[One who] Lays Eggs in the Sand"), is believed to be either [[Muscogee Creek]], [[Cherokee]], or Shawnee, possibly of [[Pekowi]] division and the Turtle Clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Noel Schutz| title =The Family of Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa| work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.fantasy-epublications.com/shawnee-traditions/Genealogy/Tecumseh_Family/Lineage.html | accessdate =May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, ''Tecumseh'', pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Methoataske, who was frightened by the American Revolution and deeply saddened by the death of Puckenshinwa, may have gone to live with her Creek relatives and then moved west with the Kispokothas in 1779, leaving Tenskwatawa and his siblings in the care of their older sister, Tecumpeas, who was married.&lt;ref name=Prophet29/&gt;

Tenskwatawa, who was not as successful or brave as his brothers, was a failure "at almost everything he attempted" during his youth.&lt;ref name=HAS13&gt;{{cite book | author=James H. Madison and Lee Ann Sandweiss | title = Hoosiers and the American Story| publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press | year =2014 | location =Indianapolis | page=13 | url = | isbn =978-0-87195-363-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chiksika, his oldest brother and a leading warrior, took his brothers out to hunt and fight in small battles, Tenskwatawa stayed behind because he lacked competence as a skilled hunter and warrior. Tenskwatawa was never able to distinguish himself as a hunter or fighter as Tecumseh, another of his older brothers, had done.&lt;ref name=Cayton206/&gt; Tecumseh, who was seven years older, was an especially gifted athlete who became the favorite of most of the tribe. In contrast, Tenskwatawa was isolated, unpopular, and depressed by his lack of success.  He began drinking alcohol, which further lowered his self-esteem and increased his problems. He also blinded himself in his right eye with his own arrow when he was younger.&lt;ref name=HAS13/&gt; Lonely and insecure, Tenskwatawa attempted to make up for his deficiencies by boasting and making up stories about how talented and important he was. His depression and alcoholism worsened as he grew older, making him unable to provide for his wife and several children.&lt;ref name=Prophet30-32&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794, nineteen-year-old Tenskwatawa was present at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] with two of his brothers, Tecumseh and Sauwauseekau, but he did not distinguish himself as a warrior. Instead, Tenskwatawa viewed the battle as a chance to re-insert himself into tribal society. In his late twenties, he decided to become a medicine man and apprenticed with a tribal healer, Penagashea ("Changing Feathers"). However, when Tenskawatawa was unable to save his people after they fell seriously ill, probably with influenza, he became humiliated and even more depressed.&lt;ref name=HAS13/&gt; By the early 1800s, Tenskawatawa had developed a reputation as a notorious drunk among the Shawnee living along the White River.&lt;ref name=Cayton206/&gt;

==Purification movement leader==
[[File:Tenskwatawa.jpg|thumb|206x206px|Tenskwatawa sketch]]

Beginning in 1805 Lalawethika had a series of religious visions that transformed his life, caused him to change his name to Tenskwatawa (meaning "Open Door"), and led him to reject his old ways. He experienced his first vision in May 1805, when he fell into unconsciousness during one of his alcoholic stupors and was thought to be dead. Unexpectedly reviving as his body was being prepared for burial, he recounted a powerful vision of two different worlds, one filled with ample blessings for the virtuous ones who lived as the Master of Life intended, while the other world was filled with pain, hardship, and terror for those who refused to follow traditional tribal ways. Tenskwatawa became known as "The Prophet," began preaching and gathered a growing number of followers. He soon emerged as a powerful and influential spiritual leader.&lt;ref name=HAS13/&gt; More visions followed in succeeding months, including revelations that the European invaders from the east were "the children of the Evil Spirit.".&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'' p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard White notes that in the Algonquian tradition the "Great Serpent" came from the sea and stood for evil powers. Similarly, Tenskwatawa explained that white men (American colonists), who came from the eastern seashore, were the spawn of the Great Serpent and intended to harm them. See {{cite book |author=Richard White |title=The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650–1815 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1991 |location=| page=507| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKXgtvYvTRkC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;dq=Tenskwatawa+serpent+inauthor:richard+inauthor:white&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rLBoTsKJI6jliAKJ6sWvBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tenskwatawa%20serpent%20inauthor%3Arichard%20inauthor%3Awhite&amp;f=false |isbn=0-521-42460-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prophet's developing purification movement caused him to urge his followers to reject European habits, such as consumption of alcohol, and to return to their traditional ways. He wanted his people to reject the white man's customs by forbidding marriages between Indians and whites, as well as the use of Euro-American foods, clothing, and manufactured goods. Tenskwatawa also encouraged his people to follow traditional gender roles (women as farmers, men as hunters and warriors).&lt;ref name=Madison38/&gt;&lt;ref name=HAS14&gt;Madison and Sandweiss, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenskwatawa proved to be harsh, even brutal, in his treatment of those who opposed him and his teachings. He accused his detractors, and anyone who associated with settlers, of witchcraft, including Indians who had converted to Christianity. For Tenskwatawa, Indian witches remained the most active agents of the evil spirits on earth, and he sought to identify and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, pp. 207–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'' p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to Tenskawatawa's life, along with his rise as a powerful spiritual leader in the early 1800s, coincided with other situations that threatened Native Americans' traditional way of life and caused rising tensions between natives and settlers. These included significant liquor consumption among natives, ever-increasing land cession treaties that promised annuities to natives in exchange for giving up their lands to the U.S. government, and the steady encroachment of white settlers in areas around Indian-held treaty land.&lt;ref name=Madison38/&gt;

==Greenville and Prophetstown founder==
In 1805 Tenskwatawa, who evolved into an effective speaker and charismatic leader of his religious movement, formed a new community with his followers along the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]], near the present site of [[Greenville, Ohio|Greenville]] in western Ohio.&lt;ref name=GS346&gt;{{cite book | author=Linda C. Gugin and James E. St. Clair, eds. | title =Indiana's 200: The People Who Shaped the Hoosier State | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press| year =2015 | location =Indianapolis | page=346  | url = | isbn =978-0-87195-387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian village's population rapidly increased after Tenskwatawa accurately predicted a [[solar eclipse]] in 1806. The prediction humiliated [[William Henry Harrison]], the governor of the [[Indiana Territory]]. Previously, Harrison had publicly derided Tenskwatawa as a fraud to the tribal leaders, but many tribal members considered the accuracy of Tenskwatawa's prediction as proof of his power.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prophet detested the leaders of the [[United States government]], including President Thomas Jefferson and Harrison, the Indiana territorial governor. Tenskwatawa also opposed some tribal leaders, such as Little Turtle, and their representatives because he felt that they had agreed to the demands of the government.&lt;ref name=HAS15&gt;Madison and Sandweiss, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; When some of the tribal chiefs tried to promote compromise and conciliation with the United States, Tenskwatawa, proclaiming his obedience to the Great Spirit, lashed out against the pro-U.S. sympathizers and castigated them as wicked traitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Timothy D. Willig|title=Restoring the Chain of Friendship: British Policy and the Indians of the Great Lakes, 1783–1815 | publisher = | series = | volume = | edition = |year=2008 |location= |page= 207 |url= |isbn=0803248172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Prophet continued to preach unity among his people, urging them to resist the government and the settlers' way of life, his brother, Tecumseh, began to gather the tribes at Greenville to establish a pan-Indian resistance movement. Officials in Ohio became concerned about the increasing numbers of the Prophet's followers. As the settlers became more hostile and planned to take action, Tenskwatawa was finding it increasingly difficult to feed his expanding village. Although there was opposition from some tribal leaders such as Little Turtle, Tenskwatawa decided to move farther west and establish a village in a more remote location to further distance his followers from the settlers.&lt;ref name=HAS14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1808 Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh founded a new village along the [[Tippecanoe River]], north of present-day [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. The settlers called the Indian village [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]], after the Shawnee spiritual leader. Prophetstown soon expanded into a large, multi-tribal community of the Prophet's followers that became a "powerful Indian city-state" for his spiritual movement.&lt;ref name=HAS14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Willig (1997) argues that Prophetstown became the largest Native American community in the [[Great Lakes]] region, and also served as a major center of Indian culture, a temporary barrier to the encroaching settlers' westward movement, and a base to expel the whites and their culture from the territory.&lt;ref name=Willig115-58&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy D. Willig |title=Prophetstown on the Wabash: The Native Spiritual Defense of the Old Northwest |journal=Michigan Historical Review |date=March 1997 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=115–58 |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/20173677 |doi=10.2307/20173677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located near the juncture of two rivers (the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and Tippecanoe Rivers, Prophetstown gained significance as a central point in the political and military alliance that was forming around Tenskwatawa's brother [[Tecumseh]], as well as the spiritual hub of the purification movement that the Prophet established to preserve tribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, pp. 209–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh, the village attracted thousands of [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]-speaking Indians. Although the village endured hardships, such as food shortages, epidemics, and tribal disagreements, Prophetstown became an intertribal, religious stronghold within the Indiana Territory for three thousand Native Americans.&lt;ref name=Willig115-58/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated fourteen different tribal groups comprised the confederation at Prophetstown, but the majority of its inhabitants came from Shawnee, Delaware, and Potawatomi tribes.&lt;ref name=HAS14/&gt; The growing community also caused settlers in the area to fear that Tecumseh was forming an army of warriors to destroy their settlements.&lt;ref name=GS346/&gt;

One effect of the increasing pan-Indian alliance was steady pressure from Harrison and the U.S. government to establish land-cession treaties, including a pivotal one made in 1809. Under the terms of the Treaty of Fort Wayne, the tribes in the Wabash River area ceded an estimated 2.5 to 3 million acres of land to the U.S. government. While warriors continued to congregate at Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh, who adamantly wanted to retain their independence from the United States, denounced the treaty. They became openly hostile to those who had signed it, including other tribal leaders, and began discussions of a possible alliance with the British.&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, pp. 210–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From [[George Washington]]'s to [[William Henry Harrison]]'s presidential administrations, the [[United States|U.S.]] government's attempts to obtain Indian lands in the Old Northwest Territory from numerous tribes eventually succeeded. Under the terms of multiple treaties, the Indians ceded their territorial land to the U.S. government in exchange for annuity payments and reservation land in the western United States. As a result, the majority of the Indians had moved west, across the Mississippi River, by the 1840s. Large numbers of Euro-American settlers entered the former Indian-held territory to acquire the vacated land. See Willig (March 1997),"Prophetstown on the Wabash," pp. 115–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Prophet's Rock view.jpg|thumb|333x333px|The view from Prophet's Rock, looking toward the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe]]

Although historians have disagreed over whether Tecumseh or Tenskwatawa was the primary leader of the pan-Indian community that grew up around Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa remained its spiritual leader; however, his preaching grew more militant and increasingly political from 1808 to 1811. Some of Prophetstown's inhabitants became nervous about the rising tension between settlers and natives and left the village, but Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa continued to recruit 
young warriors to join their movement. By 1811, white settlers in the region, Harrison, and the Indiana territorial government had become concerned about the large number of Indians gathering at Prophetstown.&lt;ref name=HAS15/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS345&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; After ongoing negotiations between Harrison and Tecumseh proved unproductive in 1811, Harrison decided to strike first and began to assemble his military forces.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1811, when Tecumseh journeyed south to meet with representatives of other tribes in hopes of building a larger alliance, Tenskwatawa was left in command at Prophetstown. Before Tecumseh's departure, the two brothers discussed possible responses to U.S. military action and agreed that Tenskwatawa would try to avoid any confrontation during Tecumseh's absence. However, Tenskwatawa reconsidered the decision after Tecumseh's departure and prepared their warriors to fight the settlers if they approached Prophetstown. In the meantime, Harrison and his men began their march north from [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] toward Prophetstown and constructed a new fort (Fort Harrison) on Indian treaty land at the site of present-day Terre Haute, Indiana, to serve as a staging area for their military forces. As Harrison's army marched toward Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa decided to stand firm and take action.&lt;ref name=GS346/&gt;&lt;ref name=SP105&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1811, while Tecumseh was still in the [[Southern United States|South]], a United States military force of an estimated 1,000 men under Harrison's command approached the village. Hoping to delay a confrontation until additional warriors arrived, Tenskwatawa requested a meeting with Harrison, who agreed to negotiate. With the meeting set for the following day, Harrison and his men set up camp about a mile from Prophetstown.&lt;ref name=SP105/&gt;

Although they were outnumbered and had little ammunition, Tenskwatawa's smaller force of 600 to 700 men were the first to attack before dawn on November 7. During the evening, Tenskwatawa consulted with the spirits and decided that sending a party to murder Harrison in his tent was the best way to avoid a battle. He assured the warriors that he would cast spells that would make them immune to their bullets and any other harm, as well as confuse Harrison's army so they would not resist. The warriors moved out and began to surround Harrison's army, looking for a way to enter the camp undetected.&lt;ref name = o217&gt;Owen, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-hour engagement that became known as the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], Tenskwatawa's forces retreated from the field and abandoned Prophetstown to avoid capture. On November 8, Harrison's army burned the village to the ground. Nearly one-fifth of Harrison's forces either died or were wounded in battle (188 casualties; 63 of them fatalities). Harrison claimed hundreds of Indian casualties; however, the actual number fell between thirty and fifty, with an additional seventy to eighty wounded. Tenskwatawa, who did not take part in the action on the field, remained out of range of U.S. bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, pp. 222–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', p. 106–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle did not end the Indians' resistance to the United States, but their retreat caused The Prophet, who proved to be a poor military leader, to lose his influence. Some of the Indians wanted to kill him for losing, but he survived; others sought revenge by raiding area farms and travelers.&lt;ref name=HAS15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; When Tecumseh returned to the Indiana Territory, he resumed his role as the Indian confederation's military leader, but the loss at Prophetstown ended his efforts to establish a stronger Indian alliance. Tenskwatawa became an outcast, and some of his followers returned to rebuild Prophetstown in July 1812, but settler militia forces eventually forced them away. The Prophet moved to [[Canada]] and became one of Tecumseh's subordinates during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Indians' military resistance to the U.S. occurred in Canada, where Tecumseh and his warriors participated in the defense of the [[Canada|Canadian]] colonies. Tecumseh fought and died at the [[Battle of the Thames]], in October 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenskwatawa, who observed the battle from a position behind the British line, fled on horseback after the initial charge from the American forces. He remained in exile in Canada and did not return to the United States until 1824.&lt;ref name=HAS15/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS347-48&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 347–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After Tecumseh's death in 1813, Tenskwatawa retained a small group of followers, but had no significant leadership position among the American Indians in the subsequent decade. In 1824, at the request of [[Lewis Cass]], the governor of [[Michigan Territory]], the aging Prophet returned to the [[United States]] from [[Canada]] to assist the federal government with its plans for the [[Shawnee]] removal west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Tenskwatawa hoped his involvement would allow him to regain some influence as a leader among the [[Shawnee]].&lt;ref name=GS347-48/&gt;

In 1826 Tenskwatawa traveled through [[Vincennes, Indiana]], with a group of 500 Shawnee from reservation land at [[Wapakoneta, Ohio|Wapaghkonetta]], [[Ohio]], and headed west across the [[Mississippi]] and [[Kansas River|Kansas]] Rivers to the Shawnee reservation in present-day [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| page=3 | title =Shawnee Indians - Wapakoneta Ohio  - Vincennes Indiana| work = Boston Reporter and Telegraph| accessdate=February 18, 2013 | date =December 15, 1826 | url = http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/shawnee-indians-wapakoneta-oh-1826-newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenskwatawa, who arrived in Kansas on May 14, 1828, established a village called Prophetstown on reservation land in the [[Argentine, Kansas|Argentine]]
district of present-day [[Kansas City, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=WhiteFeather&gt;{{cite web | author = | title =Shawnee Prophet's Grave and White Feather Spring, 1836 | work = | publisher =Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas | date = | url =http://www.wycokck.org/assets/6751C170-5D95-45C0-8D14-F4AAB52F6601.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =May 24, 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, as his influence among the Shawnee declined, Tenskwatawa isolated himself from the majority of the tribe. A few years before his death, Tenskwatawa agreed to pose for [[George Catlin]], who painted his portrait as a Shawnee "holy man" in traditional attire.&lt;ref name=SP186&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenskwatawa faded into obscurity and died in 1836, twelve years after he departed to Kansas.&lt;ref name=WhiteFeather/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS348&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Tenskwatawa died in November 1836 at his cabin, a site in present-day Kansas City's Argentine district.
The [[White Feather Spring]] historical marker, erected in 1978, denotes the approximate location of his gravesite in [[Kansas City]], [[Kansas]], which remained unmarked for decades.&lt;ref name=WhiteFeather/&gt;

Tenskwatawa's legacy was a mix of successes and failures. While he became a powerful spiritual leader with hundreds of followers in the first decade of the nineteenth century, his success in that effort only lasted about six years. The Prophet transformed himself from a hapless, alcoholic youth filled with failures into an influential religious leader. Tenskwatawa preached unity and helped to improve the morale of his people by encouraging them to pursue traditional ways. He also remained resolute in his rejection of United States authority and acculturation to the Euro-American way of life. After the defeat of his people at the Battle of Tippecanoe, the Prophet spent the remainder of his life trying to regain some of his previous political power. Tenskwatawa and his brother, Tecumseh, along with their followers were not successful in achieving the long-term results they wanted. They lost a difficult and violent struggle that deprived them of their lands in the Northwest Territory, largely due to the relentlessness and large-scale efforts of the United States, but their defiance was a noble effort and worth the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Cayton, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madison, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most white Americans of his era were unfamiliar with Native American culture, they did not understand the Prophet's religious movement. Since his death in 1836, the Prophet has been relegated to a secondary role. Those who knew Tenskwatawa after 1825, when he no longer had his previous influence as a religious leader, described him as a "shallow opportunist." However, it was Tenskwatawa, not his brother, Tecumseh, who provided the spiritual foundation for the Indian resistance movement in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] in the years immediately preceding the War of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, ''The Shawnee Prophet'', pp. 186, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indiana Territory, the violence that erupted between the U.S. and the pan-Indian alliance that Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh established at Prophetstown led to the relocation of territorial capital from [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] to [[Corydon, Indiana]]. In addition, U.S. efforts to remove Indian inhabitants from the Indiana Territory increased after the War of 1812 and led to their forced removal to reservations in the trans-Mississippi west.&lt;ref name=GS348/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19863">*''"Thekchen Choling" is also the name of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]]'s monastery in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] (in the Kangra district of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]], India).''

'''Thekchen Choling''' is a registered [[Buddhist]] organisation in the Republic of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Studies of global Buddhism tend to focus on traditionally Buddhist countries such as Japan, Myanmar, Thailand, Korea, China, Tibet, and Sri Lanka; or, they look to new developments in the United States and Europe. Less attention is given to countries such as Malaysia and Singapore. See, for example, The Life of Buddhism, edited by Frank E. Reynolds and Jason A. Carbine (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuah, Khun Eng. State, Society and Religious Engineering: Towards a Reformist Buddhism in Singapore. Singapore: Eastern Universities Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was started in 2001 by Namdrol Rinpoche and a group of his initial disciples. The organisation promotes non-sectarian Buddhism, emphasizing understanding of [[Theravada]]&lt;ref&gt;Trainor, Kevin.  Relics, Ritual, and Representation in Buddhism: Rematerializing the Sri Lankan Theravāda Tradition. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mahayana]] teachings.

TCCL is committed to the Rime (non-sectarian) movement within Tibetan Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;See "The Sage's Harmonious Song of Truth: A Prayer for the Flourishing of the Non-Sectarian Teachings of the Buddha," a prayer composed by the XIVth Dalai Lama, for an official expression of the wish that sectarian division will not harm Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is of the [[Gelug]] tradition. The primary practices and teachings of this temple are from [[Guru Rinpoche]] lineage and [[Je Tsongkhapa|Lama Tsongkapa]] lineage.

==History==
The temple was started in accordance with the instructions of [[Geshe Lama Konchog]] of [[Kopan Monastery]], with whom Namdrol Rinpoche studied in the late-1980s and early 1990s. Other teachers from this monastery include [[Lama Zopa]] and [[Lama Yeshe]], who have written many books and founded many Buddhist centers.
Namdrol Rinpoche's other root guru (primary teacher) was [[Geshe Lhundrup Rigsel|Khensur Rinpoche Lama Lhundrup Rigsel]], known to his students as Khen Rinpoche.&lt;ref&gt;TCCL homepage: http://www.thekchencholing.org/Templates/intro_abt.htm. Accessed 9/9/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; TCCL regularly hosts teachers from Kopan Monastery, [[Sera Jey Monastery]], and several other Tibetan Buddhist teaching centers.

==Teachers==
[[File:Spiritual Director Namdrol Rinpoche.jpg|left|thumb|271x271px|Spiritual Director of Thekchen Choling, Namdrol Rinpoche]]

===Spiritual Director===
[[File:With Dagri Rinpoche.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Namdrol Rinpoche with Dagri Rinpoche at Thekchen Choling temple]]
Namdrol Rinpoche (born Felix Lee), was initiated as a Yogi. Rinpoche was advised by his gurus not to take monastic vows, and remain a lay practitioner. Trained as a chef and owner of a restaurant, Rinpoche was advised by his gurus in 1998 to give up the business and instead focus on spreading the Dharma. [[Geshe Lama Konchog]] also entrusted him with the task of setting up a Tibetan temple with the mission to change the existing mindset that one needs to be a monk or nun to practice Buddhism. Rinpoche closed his restaurant, and in 2001 formally registered the temple ‘Thekchen Choling (Singapore)", a name meaning "Mahayana Buddhist Temple," bestowed by Geshe Lama Konchog.

As a lay lama, he offers practical advice to those who seek his counsel for problems they encounter in daily life. Namdrol Rinpoche is the author of the book Direct Expressions.

The Thekchen Choling homepage describes Namdrol Rinpoche's initial meeting of his teachers in Nepal in this way:

In 1989, at the age of fifteen, a Buddhist master appeared in Rinpoche's dreams and instructed him to fulfill the vows of his previous life which was to teach those who did not have teachers. Following the instructions in his dreams, he was brought to Nepal by Venerable Sangye Khandro. Upon his arrival, Namdrol Rinpoche first met Lumbum Rinpoche and made light offerings at a temple. At the time, Rinpoche told him, "We have been waiting for you". It was later revealed that the Buddhist master who had first appeared in Lama's dream was in fact the great Buddhist saint, Guru Rinpoche.

[[File:Withkhenrinpoche-800.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Lama presenting relics to Khen Rinpoche (Khensur Rinpoche Lama Lhundrup Rigsel)]]

===Lineage Gurus===
Within Tibetan Buddhism, teachers study closely with more than one senior teacher. Lama Namdrol Tulku's primary teachers include:

# The 14th [[Dalai Lama]] 
# The Sakya Trizin
# Gyuto Khenpo the 6th Kyabje Jhado Rinpoche
# The 5th Kyabje Dagri Dorje Chang (Dagri Rinpoche is the 5th reincarnation of Pagri Dorje Chang, one of the very great Geshes of Lhasa who was the teacher of many high lamas in Tibet.)
# Kyabje Lama Zopa Rinpoche([[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche]])
# Sera Jey Khenpo Geshe Lobsang Delek Rinpoche
# Kyabje Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche
# Kopan Khenpo Geshe Thubten Chonyi Rinpoche
# [[Geshe Lama Konchog]] (Reincarnated as [[Tenzin Phuntsok Rinpoche]])
# The late Khensur Rinpoche Geshe Lama Lhundrup Rigsel of [[Kopan Monastery]]
# The late Geshe Kechog of Kopan Monastery
# The late Geshe Pema Wangchen of Sera Jey Monastery

==Temple==
[[File:Map of Singapore, showing Thekchen Choling facility.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Location Map of Thekchen Choling (Singapore)]]
Located at 2 Beatty Lane in Singapore, the temple was registered in 2001 by Namdrol Rinpoche, as instructed by his teacher Geshe Lama Konchog and named after the monastery of the 14th Dalai Lama as ‘Thekchen Choling (Singapore)’.

===Architectural history===
The address of Thekchen Choling used to be Ji Gong Temple, a heritage site in Singapore. A statue of [[Ji Gong]] from the previous Ji Gong Temple is still being revered at the main hall of the temple for devotees to make offerings.

===Devotional objects===
The field of Religious Studies involves the analysis of architecture and various material objects, and TCCL has a number of outstanding devotional objects.&lt;ref&gt;The academic journal Material Religion explores "how religion happens in material culture - images, devotional and liturgical objects, architecture and sacred space, works of arts and mass-produced artifacts. No less important than these material forms are the many different practices that put them to work. Ritual, communication, ceremony, instruction, meditation, propaganda, pilgrimage, display, magic, liturgy and interpretation constitute many of the practices whereby religious material culture constructs the worlds of belief."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Altar at Thekchen Choling Main Hall.jpg|thumb|500x500px|Jowa Shakyamuni Buddha (centre), Guru Rinpoche (left) &amp; Green Tara (right)]]

====Buddha Rupas====

Tibetan Buddhist mindfulness training practice include the devotional treatment of statues of the Buddha (and his various forms); these statues are known as [[Buddharūpa]] (literally, 'Form of the Awakened One'), which is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term used in [[Buddhism]] for statues or models of the [[Buddha]]. Devotees treat the statues exactly as if they were the living bodies of fully realized Buddhas. TCCL contains several outstanding examples of Buddharupa in Thai, Chinese, and Nepali styles.

'''Jowa Shakyamuni Buddha'''

Modeled after the Shakyamuni Buddha in Tibet (Jokhang Monastery)

'''Guru Rinpoche'''

Larger than lifesize, this Guru Rinpoche statue is adorned with semi-precious stones and crystals. This figure represents the quintessential teacher (or guru), as Guru Rinpoche (or Padmasambhava)&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, Herbert V. The Teachings of Padmasambhava. New York : E.J. Brill, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have transmitted [[Tantric Buddhism]] to [[Tibet]] in the 8th century.

'''Mother Green Tara'''

This life-sized Mother Green Tara rupa is adorned with semi precious stones and crystals. [[Tārā]] is regarded as a [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion and action. She is the female aspect of [[Avalokitesvara]] (Chenrezig) and in some origin stories she comes from his tears.
[[File:Medicine Buddha.jpg|thumb|175x175px|Medicine Buddha]]
[[File:Mig Chenresig.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Mig Chenresig]]
'''Mig Chenresig and Medicine Buddha'''

[[Mig Chenresig]]'s main activity is healing the eyes and is a unique form of Chenresig. This rupa is the only emanation of Chenresig in Singapore and was specially commissioned in line with the temple's aim to be a healing temple.

[[Medicine Buddha]] is an enlightened being who has unbiased compassion for all living beings. He protects living beings from physical and mental sickness and other dangers and obstacles, and helps them to eradicate the three poisons – attachment, hatred, and ignorance – which are the source of all sickness and danger. He is a Buddha Doctor. Medicine Buddha was also the main practice of Geshe Lama Konchog.
[[File:Maniwheel .jpg|thumb|200x200px|Giant Mani Wheel]]

====Giant Mani Wheel====

A [[prayer wheel]], or mani wheel&lt;ref&gt;Ladner, Lorne (editor and introduction), with translations by Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche [et al.]:  The Wheel of Great Compassion : the Practice of the Prayer Wheel in Tibetan Buddhism. Boston, MA : Wisdom Publications, c2000.&lt;/ref&gt; in Tibetan Buddhism, is a device that spins on an axis containing hundreds, thousands, or even millions of copies of a specific mantra. Instead saying one mantra at a time, a devotee who spins a prayer wheel believes himself to have said the mantra hundreds, thousands, or millions of times, depending on how many copies of the mantra are in the wheel.

Commonly, prayer wheels contains Chenresig's mantras which devotees consider the turning of the wheel to be a manifestation of the Chenrezig's holy speech. Chenrezig, of whom the Dalai Lama is considered by Tibetan Buddhists to be an incarnation, is the protector of Tibet and is also known as Avalokitesvara (Guenther).  Through this practice, one is believed to develop purity of [[body, speech, and mind]]. Buddhist texts teach that spinning the Mani Wheel (or prayer wheel) is equivalent to having recited all the mantras inside the wheel (Ladner). Turning the Mani Wheel is thus considered extremely beneficial.

The Giant Mani wheel in Thekchen Choling (Singapore) was commissioned and installed in 2003. It stands 3m high, is 1.38m in diameter, and contains 213 million of Chenresig's mantras.

[[File:Sacred relics, Thekchen Choling Buddhist Temple, Singapore (2008).jpg|thumb|300px|left|Sacred Relics displayed in Thekchen Choling]]

====Kangyur and Tengyur Text====

Under the recommendation of Dagri Rinpoche, the whole collection of the [[Kangyur]] and [[Tengyur]] Text are now kept in TCCL. Also known as the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, this collection consists of loosely defined list of sacred texts recognised by various schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Practices and events==
The temple has weekly teachings in English and Mandarin, chanting and prayers sessions. It is the only Tibetan Buddhist temple in Singapore to be open twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. The main hall is available to all who seek a place of quiet, for prayers, for meditation at any time of the day.

The temple provides free traditional Chinese Medicine consulting service, acupuncture service and medicine weekly. The temple provides free medicine distribution, free meals and financial support, with emphasis for the poor and elderly.

The devotees chant sutras in Mandarin wearing the traditional Chinese Hai-Ching and chant prayers in English and Tibetan while wearing the layman robes of white and maroon. This temple is unusual for the youth of its devotees; most are below the age of thirty five.
The temple was granted permission by the Office of the 14th Dalai Lama to publish thirteen of his books in simplified Mandarin for free distribution.

[[File:BESAR Project - food ration distribution.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Food Ration Distribution to the Elderly and the Needy]]
With the vision of "Connecting All with Divine Hearts", Thekchen Choling hopes to complement the spiritual healing of the temple with a focus on giving aid to those in need.

Thekchen Choling Community Outreach offers the following community services:

'''Healing Services'''

TCCL is developing ways to provide effective health care to the needy. The healing services consist of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture and Reiki Healing sessions held weekly at the temple. Future plans include a western medical health clinic. The temple regularly hosts Healing oracles from Ladakh providing their unique form of healing.

'''Education Services'''

The temple grants annual education bursaries to needy students each year regardless of religious backgrounds.

'''Youth Development Services'''

The objective of Thekchen Choling Youth Development Services is to groom youths to be courageous, caring and socially responsible adults. Programmes are planned to help in the overall development of youths. These programmes include self-awareness and social skills and community outreach opportunities.

'''Elderly and Needy Support Services'''

Given the rising prices of food recently, TCCL hopes to lend a helping hand to the needy by distributing food rations to them. Started in 2007 as Project Maude, this free ration distribution project held 3 times a year during Chinese New Year, Vesak Day, and [[Mid Autumn Festival]] has grown now to BESAR Project, a collaborative effort with the Jalan Besar Citizens Consultative Committee, supporting more than 1000 needy families and elderly on each occasion.

=== Thekchen Choling (Malaysia) ===

==== The Beginning of Thekchen Choling (Malaysia) ====
For many years, Malaysian students of Rinpoche have persistently requested him to start similar temples in Malaysia so that people in Malaysia can benefit from Dharma as well as community outreach programmes.

After numerous location searches of three months since June 2012, we found Melaka to be suitable and ripe for us to start our first overseas centre. Thekchen Choling (Malaysia) was officially approved by the Malaysian Federal Government on 15 October 2012 as a society to operate Buddhist temples.

Thus begins the chapter of Thekchen Choling (Malaysia) Melaka Centre, operating on a rented premise at 8 and 8A, Jalan Laksamana Cheng Ho. It started operations from 10 November 2012.

=== Thekchen Choling Kota Tinggi Meditation Centre ===
[[File:Kota Tinggi Meditation Center at Tai Hong Village.jpg|left|thumb|Kota Tinggi Meditation Center at Tai Hong Village]]
[[File:Largest 1000-Armed Chenrezig (Avalokitesvara) in Southeast Asia.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Largest 1000-Armed Chenrezig (Avalokitesvara) in Southeast Asia at 36ft tall]]
In late 2013, a 2-acre piece of land in Kota Tinggi was offered to Rinpoche. This marks the birth of Thekchen Choling Kota Tinggi Meditation Centre.

The Palace of 1000-Armed Chenrezig is near completion. Specially commissioned by Namdrol Rinpoche, this magnificent statue of 1000-Armed Chenrezig stands at 36 feet tall and is beautifully adorned with pearls, corals, turquoises and dzi-beads. This statue is the largest representation of Chenresig (or Avalokitesvara) in Tibetan style outside of Tibet and China that has been accurately represented and traditionally filled with tsung under the personal guidance of Kyabje Jhado Rinpoche in the Vajrayana tradition.

The Meditation center is open to devotees for retreats and practices purpose.

=== Thekchen Choling Syracuse ===
[[File:Dharma teaching at Syracuse USA.jpg|thumb|Dharma teaching at Syracuse USA|left]]

On the auspicious day of the 29th day of the eighth lunar month of the Wooden Horse year (22 October 2014), Thekchen Choling USA (Syracuse) - a new temple for the cultivation and practice of Buddhadarma located at 128 N. Warren Street, Syracuse, New York 13202, USA, was officially established.

'''Vishtaspa''' (Avestan: ''𐬬𐬌𐬱𐬙𐬁𐬯𐬞𐬀‎ {{lang|ae-Latn|Vištāspa}}'', [[Old Persian]]:𐎻𐏁𐎫𐎠𐎿𐎱 whence [[Ancient Greek]] Ὑστάσπης) is the [[Avestan language|Avestan-language]] name of a figure of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] scripture and tradition, portrayed as an early follower of [[Zoroaster]], and his patron, and instrumental in the diffusion of the prophet's message. Although Vishtaspa is not epigraphically attested, he is – like Zoroaster also – traditionally assumed to have been a historical figure, and &amp;ndash; again, like Zoroaster &amp;ndash; that figure is obscured by accretions from legend and myth.

In Zoroastrian tradition, which builds on allusions found in the [[Avesta]], Vishtaspa is a righteous king who helped propagate and defend the faith. In the non-Zoroastrian [[Sistan]] cycle texts, Vishtaspa is a loathsome ruler of [[Kayanian dynasty]]{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}} who intentionally sends his eldest son to a certain death. In [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] literature, Zoroaster's patron was the [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudo-anonymous author]] of a set of prophecies written under his name.

== In scripture ==

Vishtaspa is referred to in the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism which were considered to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. In these hymns, the poet speaks of Vishtaspa as his ally (''[[Yasna]]'' 46. 14), follower of the path of [[Vohu Manah]] (''Y''. 51. 16), and committed to spreading the prophet's message (''Y''. 51. 16, 46. 15, 53. 2). In ''Yasna'' 28. 1–28. 7, Zoroaster appeals to Mazda for several boons, including the power to vanquish their foes for Vishtaspa and himself. Considered collectively, the Gathas celebrate Vishtaspa as the "patron of Zoroaster and the establisher of the first Zoroastrian community. "&lt;ref name="Shabazi_2003_171"&gt;{{harvnb|Shabazi|2003|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gathic allusions recur in the ''[[Yasht]]s'' of the [[Younger Avesta]]. The appeal to Mazda for a boon reappears in ''Yasht'' 5. 98, where the boon is asked for the Haugvan{{#tag:ref|YAv. Haugvan is Gathic Hvogva. Named members of this clan are Jamaspa and Frashaoshtra (''Y'' 51. 17-18, Gatha 3), two members of Vishtaspa's court. In ''Yasna'' 53 (Gatha 5), Zoroaster is the celebrant priest at the marriage of his daughter, Pouruchista, to Jamaspa Hvogva. In Zoroastrian tradition (e.g. ''Denkard'' 21. 17), one of Zoroaster's wives, Hvovi, is the daughter of the other named Hvogva, Frashaoshtra.|group="n"}} and Naotara families, and in which Vishtaspa is said to be a member of the latter. {{#tag:ref| In ''Yasht'' 15. 95–96, Vishtaspa's wife Hutaosa is also said to be a member of the Naotara clan. In ''Yasht'' 17, [[Ashi]] (Fortune) is said to have fled from the "swift-horsed" Naotaras. The meaning of this myth is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} Later in the same hymn, Zoroaster is described as appealing to Mazda to "bring Vishtaspa, son of Aurvataspa, to think according to [[Daena]] (Religion), to speak according to the Religion&lt;!-- caps: Daena --&gt;, to act according to the Religion&lt;!-- caps: Daena --&gt;." (''Yt''. 5. 104–105). In ''Yasht'' 9. 25–26, the last part of which is an adaptation of the Gathic ''Yasna'' 49. 7,&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_187_n35"/&gt; the prophet makes the same appeal with regard to Hutaosa, wife of Vishtaspa.{{sfn|Boyce|1975|p=187}}

In ''Yasht'' 9. 130, Vishtaspa himself appeals for the ability to drive off the attacks of the ''[[daeva]]''-worshipping Arejat.aspa and other members of ''drujvant'' Hyaona family. Similarly in ''Yasht'' 5. 109, Vishtaspa pleads for strength that he may "crush Tathryavant of the bad religion, the ''daeva''-worshipper Peshana, and the wicked Arejat.aspa."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_188"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere (''Yt''. 5. 112–113), Vishtaspa also pleads for strength on behalf of Zairivairi (Pahl. Zarēr), who in later tradition is said to be Vishtaspa's younger brother.{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}} The allusions to conflicts (perhaps battles, see [[#battles|below]]) are again obliquely referred to in ''Yasht'' 13. 99–100, in which the [[fravashi]]s of Zoroaster and Vishtaspa are described as victorious combatants for [[Asha]], and the rescuers and furtherers of the religion. This description is repeated in ''Yasht'' 19. 84–87, where Zoroaster, Vishtaspa and Vishtaspa's ancestors are additionally said to possess ''[[khvarenah]]''.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_67"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the chief hero of the conflicts is said to be Vishtaspa's son, Spentodhata, (''Yt. '' 13. 103)&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_188"/&gt; in ''Yasht'' 13. 100, Vishtaspa is proclaimed to have set his adopted faith "in the place of honor" amongst peoples.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_187"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_249"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=249}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passages in the ''Frawardin Yasht'' (''Yt. '' 13. 99–103) and elsewhere have enabled commentators to infer family connections between Vishtaspa and several other figures named in the Avesta.&lt;ref name="cf_Christensen_1931_24-25"&gt;''cf. '' {{harvnb|Christensen|1931|pp=24–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The summaries of several lost Avestan texts (''Wishtasp sast nask'', ''Spand nask'', ''Chihrdad nask'', and ''Varshtmansar nask''), as reported in the ''[[Denkard]]'' (respectively 8. 11, 8. 13, 8. 14, and 9. 33. 5), suggest that there once existed a detailed "history" of Vishtaspa and his ancestors in scripture.&lt;ref name="Shabazi_2003_175"&gt;{{harvnb|Shabazi|2003|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yasht'' 13 mentions Zairiuuairi, Piší šiiaoθna (Vishtaspa's eschatological son Pišišōtan), Spəṇtōδāta (Spandyād), Bastauuairi (Bastwar), Kauuarazman, Frašaoštra and Jāmāspa (the Huuōguua brothers in the Gathas), all of whom are featured in the Pahlavi narrative about the war between Vishtaspa and Arzāsp (Arjāsp, king of the [[Xionites|Xiiaonas]]). In ''Yasht'' 9.31, Vishtaspa prays to Druuāspā that he may successfully fight and kill various opponents and, apparently, turn Humaiiā and Varəδakanā away from the lands of the Xiiaonas.{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}}

In ''Yasna'' 12, the Zarathustra, Vishtaspa, Frašaoštra and Jāmāspa, and the three Saošiiaṇts, Zarathustra’s eschatological sons, and in ''Yasna'' 23.2 and 26.5, the fravashi of Gaiia Marətān, Zarathustra, Vishtaspa, and Isaṯ.vāstra (another of Zarathustra’s eschatological sons) are listed as the principal fighters for Asha.{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}}

The meaning of Vishtaspa's name is uncertain. Interpretations include "'he whose horses have (''or''&lt;!-- italics per source --&gt; horse has) come in ready (for riding, etc.)'";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kent|1945|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "'he who has trained horses'";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=187, n. 36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "'whose horses are released (for the race)&lt;!-- "dessen Pferde (für das Wettrennen) losgebunden sind" --&gt;'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayrhofer|1977|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;For a review of older (early 20th century) interpretations, see {{harvnb|Kent|1945|pp=55–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It agrees with the description from Yasht 5.132 in which was a prototypical winner of the chariot race.{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}}

== In tradition and folklore ==

=== In Zoroastrian tradition ===

In the Gathas, Vishtaspa is repeatedly (''Y. '' 46. 14, 51. 16, 53. 2) referred to as a ''kavi'', which is etymologically a term for a mantic seer, or poet-priest, and in ''Yasna'' 28. 11 is also used of Zoroaster's enemies.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_11"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Younger Avesta the term is also applied to wise men generally, to include Vishtaspa and his ancestors. In tradition however, the kavis are kings, "evidently because Vīštāspa and his forebears, the 'kavis' ''par excellence'', were princely rulers. Presumably the gift of prophecy, of mantic poetry, was hereditary in their family. "&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_11"/&gt; Both scripture and tradition refer to Vishtaspa's ancestors but do not mention Vishtaspa's successors; Vishtaspa was apparently&lt;!-- "apparently" per verbatim Boyce 1975: 345 --&gt; the last of his line, and the last of the kavis.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_249" /&gt;&lt;!-- the "thus also kavis" is not directly evident from the sentence (the last) on page 249, but see register, p. 345 "apparently the last of his line to rule" --&gt; In Zoroastrian apocalyptic chronology, the dynasties of the world are divided into seven ages, each named after a metal. According to this chronology (''[[Zand-i Wahman yasn]]'' 2. 16&lt;!-- EIr says: 2. 16, Boyce says III. 20. 29 --&gt;, ''Dabistan'' 140), Vishtaspa (in Zoroastrian [[Middle Persian]] ''Wishtasp''&lt;!-- ''Wištāsp'' --&gt;) ascent to the throne ended the reign of silver, and his reign was over the age of gold.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_288"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In tradition, the works of Zoroaster were said to have been kept in a royal library that was then destroyed by Alexander the Great. In ''Denkard'' 3. 420, it is Vishtaspa who is said to have been the king who had those texts made and placed in the royal library.&lt;!-- As the sentence says, "In Denkard 3. 420 ..." --&gt;

{{anchor|battles}} The ''Yasht''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s allusions to conflicts are amplified in the 9th–11th century books of Zoroastrian tradition, where the conflicts are portrayed as outright battles of the faith. So for example the surviving fragments of a fragmentary text that celebrates the deeds of Zairivairi, Vishtaspa's brother and captain of his forces against Arejat.aspa, chief of the Hyonas. According to that text (''Ayadgar i Zareran'', 10–11), upon hearing of Vishtaspa's conversion, Arejat.aspa sent messengers to demand that Vishtaspa "abandon 'the pure Mazda-worshipping religion which he had received from Ohrmazd', and should become once more 'of the same religion'" as himself. The battle that following Vishtaspa's refusal left Vishtaspa victorious.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_249"/&gt;

The conversion of Vishtaspa is likewise a theme of the 9th–11th century books, and these legends remain the "best known and most current" among Zoroastrians today.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_279"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''cf. '' {{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this tradition, when Zoroaster arrived at Vishtaspa's court, the prophet was "met with hostility from the ''kayag''s and ''karab''s (''kavi''s and ''karapan''s), with whom he disputed at a great assembly–a tradition which may well be based on reality, for [Vishtaspa] must have had his own priests and seers, who would hardly have welcomed a new prophet claiming divine authority. "&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_280"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition goes on to relate that Zoroaster triumphed after three days of debate, only to be maligned by his enemies to Vishtaspa, who then had the prophet imprisoned. But, from prison, Zoroaster cured one of Vishtaspa's favourite horses (which had suddenly become paralyzed), for which the prophet then gained Vishtaspa's support and admiration.&lt;!-- Boyce, 1975: 280 --&gt; The tale is obliquely referred to in the ''Anthology of Zadspram'' (24. 6), which seems to presume that the reader already knows it,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is summarized in the ''Denkard'' (7. 4. 64–86), and – as "workings of popular fancy"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_280" /&gt; – described in detail in the later ''Book of Zoroaster'' (942–1094). {{#tag:ref|&lt;!-- this is a block quotation --&gt;"On theological issues, the ''Book of Zoroaster'' does not demonstrate significant differences to the older Middle Persian tractates. However, the untypical focus on the figure of Zoroaster on the one hand, and the assimilation of the figure of Zoroaster with the prophetic "type" intrinsic to Mohammed on the other hand, are unmistakable. Without losing its Zoroastrian character, the text portrays Zoroaster as the bearer of the perfect book, as the figure of a prophet in the Islamic sense. The perhaps most obvious example of the Islamization of Zoroaster's functions is in the scene in which, according to the ''Book of Zoroaster'', Zoroaster presents himself to Vishtaspa with 'I am the prophet that God has sent to you' [ZN 281], in which the originally Arabic word ''rasul'' – in Islam used for the 'Prophet of God' – is used. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} In the myth, Zoroaster cures each of the horse's four legs in exchange for four concessions: first, that Vishtaspa himself accept Zoroaster's message; secondly, that Vishtaspa's son Spentodata (MP: Esfandiar) do the same; third, that Vishtaspa's wife Hutaosa (MP: Hutos) also convert; {{#tag:ref|In an alternate tradition based on ''Yasht'' 9. 25–26, Hutaosa is said to have been the first to listen to Zoroaster's teachings.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_187_n35"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=187, n. 35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} and finally that the men who maligned Zoroaster be put to death.&lt;!-- 280 --&gt; When these four wishes are granted, the horse stands up rejuvenated.&lt;span class="citation" id="trance"&gt; Vishtaspa, having accepted the faith from Zoroaster, then asks for four favours in return:&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_281"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; first, that he, Vishtaspa, should know his place in the next world; secondly, that he should become invulnerable; third, that he should know the future; and fourth that his body should not leave his soul until the resurrection. Zoroaster replies that these are too great to all be given to one man, and that he should choose one. Vishtaspa agrees, and chooses the first. Zoroaster then gives him consecrated wine to drink, which puts Vishtaspa in a trance in which he has an epiphany; he sees his spirit ascend to heaven where it beholds the glories of God.&lt;/span&gt;{{#tag:ref|In the ''Book of Zoroaster'', Zoroaster performs the ''dron yasht'', a lesser service at which he consecrates wine, milk, incense and a pomegranate. The wine he gives to Vistaspa, who then falls into a dream in which he learns of his soul's ascent to heaven. The remaining three favors are distributed among Vishtaspa's son [[Peshotanu]] (MP: Peshotan), who becomes undying by drinking the milk: Vishtaspa's minister Jamasp, who gains all knowledge by inhaling the incense; and Spentodata, who attains invincibility by eating the pomegranate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1984|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}} Vishtaspa's conversion is traditionally said to have taken place during Zoroaster's forty-second year, "a figure undoubtedly reached by later calculation".&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_187" /&gt;

&lt;span class="citation" id="zt_ident"&gt;In medieval Zoroastrian chronology, Vishtaspa is identified as a grandfather of "Ardashir", i.e. the 5th century BCE [[Artaxerxes I]] (or [[Artaxerxes II|II]]).&lt;ref&gt;''cf. '' {{harvnb|Williams Jackson|1899|pp=158–160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This myth is tied to the [[Sassanid]] (early 3rd–early 7th century) claim of descent from Artaxerxes, and the claim of relationship to the Kayanids, that is, with Vishtaspa and his ancestors. The full adoption of Kayanid names, titles and myths from the Avesta by the Sassanids was a "main component of [Sassanid]&lt;!-- original word in source: "Sasanid", with one 's' --&gt; ideology. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daryaee|1995|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of Artaxerxes with the Kayanids occurred through the identification of Artaxerxes II's title ('Mnemon' in Greek) with the name of Vishtaspa's legendary grandson and successor, [[Kai Bahman|Wahman]]: both are theophorics of Avestan [[Vohu Manah]] "Good Mind(ed)"; Middle Persian 'Wahman' is a contraction of the Avestan name, while Greek 'Mnemon' is a calque of it. The Sassanid association of their dynasty with Vishtaspa's is a development dated to the end of the 4th century, and which "arose to some extent because this was when the Sasanians conquered [[Balkh]], the birthplace of Vishtasp and the 'holy land' of Zoroastrianism. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lukonin|1983|pp=697–698}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In "a legend [that] persisted down to [[Sasanian]] times and beyond, [...] both Zoroaster and his patron Vishtaspa [were associated] with the [[Bactria]]n capital of [[Balkh]]",&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_275-276"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|pp=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "... and a legend persisted, down into Sasanian times and beyond, which associated both Zoroaster and his patron Vīštāspa with the Bactrian capital of Balkh. " --&gt; Bactria was not the only region that claimed Vishtaspa for its own; as recorded in post-Sassanid sources (but apparently older), at least four other Iranian provinces – [[Parthia]], [[Drangiana]]&lt;!-- Boyce 1975, p. 293 --&gt; ([[Sistan]])&lt;!-- - Boyce 1975, p. 274 --&gt;, [[Atropatene]]&lt;!-- Boyce/Grenet 1991, p. 73 --&gt; and [[Persis|Persia]] – also attributed events in their local history to Vishtaspa.&lt;ref name="Shabazi_2003_174"&gt;{{harvnb|Shabazi|2003|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}}

As was also the case for the fourth century Roman identification of Zoroaster's patron with the late-6th century BCE father of [[Darius I]] (see [[#am ident|below]]) – the identification of Vishtaspa as a grandfather of "Ardashir" (Artaxerxes I/II) was once perceived to substantiate the "traditional date" of Zoroaster, which places the prophet in the 6th century BCE. The traditional descriptions of Vishtaspa's ancestors as having chariots (a description that puts them fully in the Bronze Age) also contribute to the academic debate on the dating of Zoroaster; for a summary of the role of Vishtaspa's ancestors in this issue, see {{harvnb|Boyce|1984|p=62, n. 38}}.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Additionally, and within the framework of the arguments that [[Cyrus the Great]] was a Zoroastrian, {{harvnb|Boyce|1982|pp=68–69}} speculates&lt;!-- NB: there is a question mark in the register "68–69 (identification with Kavi Vistaspa?)" on page 299 --&gt; that the reason why "[Cyrus'] name is never mentioned in the [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi books]] or in the later royal genealogies" was because tradition identified Cyrus with Vishtaspa, with the use of Vishtaspa's name instead of Cyrus', thus leading to "complete oblivion for Cyrus in Zoroastrian tradition".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Sistan heroic cycle {{anchor|Sistan_cycle}} ===
[[File:Gushtasp (The Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp).png|thumb|Gushtasp in a section of folio 402 of the ''[[Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp|Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp]]''. The illustration, dated ca. 1520 and now in the Aga Khan Museum, Toronto (accession # AKM 00163), is one of six miniatures in the Houghton manuscript that are attributed to [[Abd al-Samad|Mirza Ali]], the early 16th-century court artist of the [[Moghul Empire|Moghuls]].]]

Non-Zoroastrian literature in [[New Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] uniformly reflects the regular development of Middle Persian ''wi-'' into ''gu-'', with Middle Persian ''Wishtasp'' thus becoming ''Goshtasb'' in Sistan national history (''Tarikh-e Sistan''), ''Goshtasp'' in Firdausi's ''Book of Kings'' (''[[Shahnameh]]''), ''Goshtasf'' in the ''Mojmal al-tawarikh'',&lt;ref name="Shabazi_2003_171" /&gt; ''Beshtashb'' by [[Al-Tabari]]. 

In several respects, for instance in Goshtasb's/Goshtasf's (etc) mythological genealogy, the Sistan cycle texts continue the Zoroastrian tradition. So, for example, Goshtasp is identified as a member of the [[Kayanian dynasty]], is the son of [[Kai Lohrasp|Lohrasp]]/Lohrasb (etc), is the brother of [[Zareh]]/Zarer (etc), is the father of [[Esfandiar]]/Isfandiar (etc) and Bashutan/[[Peshotanu|Beshotan]] (etc), and so on. However, in the Sistan legends, Goshtasb/Goshtasf (etc.) is an abominable figure, altogether unlike the hero of Zoroastrian tradition. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. According to the Sistan tradition, Goshtasb demands the throne from his father [[Kai Lohrasp|Lohrasp]], but storms off to India ("Hind") when the king declines. Goshtasb's brother [[Zareh]] (Zareh/Zarer etc., Avestan Zairivairi) is sent to fetch him, but Goshtasb flees to "[[Rûm|Rome]]" where he marries [[Katayoun]] (Katayun/Katayoun etc), the daughter of the '[[Caesar (title)|qaysar]]'. Goshtasb subsequently becomes a military commander for the Roman emperor, and encourages the emperor to demand tribute from Iran. Again Zareh is sent to fetch Goshtasb, who is then promised the throne, and is thus persuaded to return. 

Back in Sistan, Goshtasb imprisons his own son [[Esfandiar]] (Esfandiar/Isfandiar etc., Avestan Spentodata), but then has to seek Esfandiar's help in defeating Arjasp (Avestan Aurvataspa) who is threatening [[Balkh]]. Goshtasb promises Esfandiar the throne in return for his help, but when Esfandiar is successful, his father stalls and instead sends him off on another mission to suppress a rebellion in [[Turan]]. Esfandiar is again successful, and upon his return Goshtasb hedges once again and – aware of a prediction that foretells the death of Esfandiar at the hand of Rostam – sends him off on a mission in which Esfandiar is destined to die. In the ''Shahnameh'', the nobles upbraid Goshtasb as a disgrace to the throne; his daughters denounce him as a heinous criminal; and his younger son Bashutan (Avestan [[Peshotanu]]) condemns him as a wanton destroyer of Iran.&lt;ref name="Shabazi_2003_175" /&gt;{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}} 

As in Zoroastrian tradition, in the Sistan cycle texts Goshtasp is succeeded by Esfandiar's son, [[Kay Bahman|Bahman]] (&lt; [[Middle Persian|MP]] Wahman).{{sfn|Skjaervo|2013}} The identification of Bahman with 'Ardashir' (see [[#zt_ident|above]]) reappears in the Sistan cycle texts as well.

== In Greek and Roman thought {{anchor|Pseudo-Hystaspes|Oracles_of_Hystaspes}} ==

The name "Visthaspa" is "[[Hystaspes (disambiguation)|Hystaspes]]" in the Greek and Latin texts of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]]. Besides referring to historically attested persons named Vishtaspa, it was also applied to Zoroaster's patron, who the Greeks and Romans imagined to be a sage of great antiquity, and the [[pseudepigrapha|putative author]] of a set of prophecies written under his name.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;For the primary sources, see {{harvnb|Bidez|Cumont|1938|loc=vol. I: pp. 215–223; vol. II: pp. 359–377}}&lt;!-- (on the ''Oracle of Hystaspes'', II: 366–376; on Ammianus Marcellinus, II: 359) --&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the works attributed to Pseudo-Hystaspes draw on real Zoroastrian sources, the Greek and Roman portraits of his person are just as fanciful as those of the other two ''les Mages hellénisés'', [[Pseudo-Zoroaster]] and [[Ostanes|Pseudo-Ostanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|pp=491ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Pseudo-Zoroaster was identified as the "inventor" of astrology, and Pseudo-Ostanes was imagined to be a master sorcerer, Pseudo-Hystaspes seems to have been stereotyped as an apocalyptic prophet.&lt;!-- same Beck 1991 491ff --&gt;

None of the works attributed to him are still extant, but quotations and references have survived in the works of others, especially in those of two early Christian writers – [[Justin Martyr]] (ca. 100 CE) in Samaria and the mid-3rd century [[Lactantius]] in North Africa – who drew on them by way of confirmation that what themselves held to be revealed truth had already been uttered.&lt;ref name="BoyceGrenet_1991_376-377"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|Grenet|1991|pp=376–377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of these [[pseudepigraphic]] works – referred to as the ''Book of Hystaspes'' or the ''Oracles of Hystaspes'' or just ''Hystaspes'' – is known by name. This work (or set of works) of the first century BCE is referred to by Lactantius, Justin Martyr, [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Joannes Laurentius Lydus|Lydus]], and Aristokritos, all of whom describe it as foretelling the downfall of the [[Roman empire]], the return of rule to the east, and of the coming of the saviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinnels|1973|pp=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Hinnels 1973: 144–145 identifies the saviour as the [[Saoshyant]]. --&gt;

Lactantius provides a detailed summary of the ''Oracles of Hystaspes'' in his ''Divinae Institutiones'' (Book VII, from the end of chapter 15 through chapter 19). It begins with Hystaspes awaking from a dream, and needing to have it interpreted for him. This is duly accomplished by a young boy, "here representing, according to convention, the openness of youth and innocent to divine visitations. "&lt;ref name="BoyceGrenet_1991_378"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|Grenet|1991|p=378}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As interpreted by the boy, the dream "predicts" the iniquity of the last age, and the impending destruction of the wicked by fire. The divine fire will burn both the righteous and the wicked, but only the wicked will be hurt and neither will be destroyed. During the eschatological inferno, the "followers of truth" will separate themselves from the wicked and ascend a mountain. The evil king who dominates the world will be angered on hearing this, and he will resolve to encircle the mountain with his army. The righteous implore to "Jupiter", who sends them a saviour, who will descend from heaven accompanied by angels and before him a flaming sword. Hystaspes "prophesies" that the wicked king (i.e. the Roman emperor) will survive the destruction of his armies, but will lose power.  It was "presumably"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|Grenet|1991|pp=378–379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the prophecy of the destruction of a victorious power (i.e. the Roman empire) that caused the work to be proscribed by Rome; according to Justin Martyr (''Apologia'', I. 44. 12), reading the work was punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|Grenet|1991|p=379, n. 68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''cf. '' {{harvnb|Hinnels|1973|pp=127–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the works attributed to the other two ''les Mages hellénisés'', the ''Oracles of Hystaspes'' was apparently based on the genuine Zoroastrian myths,&lt;!-- &lt;ref group="n"&gt;Elements of the tale can also be found in Jewish and Judeo-Christian apocaleptica (notably 1 ''Enoch'': Astronomical Book 80: 2–8, and 4 ''Ezra'' 4: 1–12 and 6: 20–25) For a review, see {{harvnb|Hinnels|1973|pp=133ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; and "the argument for ultimate magian composition is a strong one. [...] As prophecies they have a political context, a function, and a focus which radically distinguish them from the philosophical and encyclopedic wisdom of the other pseudepigrapha. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=493, n. 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although "[p]rophecies of woes and iniquities in the last age are alien to orthodox Zoroastrianism", there was probably a growth of Zoroastrian literature in the late fourth-early third centuries denouncing the evils of the Hellenistic age, and offering hope of the coming kingdom of Ahura Mazda.&lt;ref name="BoyceGrenet_1991_382"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|Grenet|1991|p=382}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greco-Roman obsession with Zoroaster as the "inventor" of astrology also influenced the image of Hystaspes. So for example in [[Joannes Laurentius Lydus|Lydus]]' ''On the months'' (''de Mensibus'' II. 4), which credits "the [[Chaldea]]ns in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes and the Egyptians" for the creation of the seven-day week after the number of planets.&lt;ref&gt;''cf. '' {{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=524, n. 83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span class="citation" id="am_ident"&gt;The fourth century [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (xxiii. 6. 32) identifies Zoroaster's patron with another Vishtaspa, better known as [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] in English, the (late-6th century BCE) father of [[Darius I]].&lt;!-- Hystaspes rex prudentissimus Darii pater --&gt; &lt;!-- In indigenous Iranian sources, this father of Darius is known only from Darius's claim of descent from Arsames, and in which (DB 2. 65) that Vishtaspa is identified as governor or Parthia. --&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The sixth century Agathias was more ambivalent, observing that it wasn't clear to him whether the name of Zoroaster's patron referred to the father of Darius or to another Hystaspes (ii. 24).&lt;!-- &lt;ref group="n"&gt;For the Latin and Greek texts on the identification with Zoroaster's patron, see {{harvnb|Jackson|1893|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; As with the medieval Zoroastrian chronology that identifies Vishtaspa with "Ardashir" (see [[#zt ident|above]]), Ammianus' identification was once considered to substantiate the "traditional date" of Zoroaster. {{sfn|Williams Jackson|1899|pp=158–160}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">A '''votive column''' (also '''votive pillar''') is the combination of a [[column]] (pillar) and a [[votive image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|first=Georg M. |last=Herdt|title=Votive columns in Greek sanctuaries of the Archaic period|publisher=University of Bath|year=2013|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.607478}}|degree=PhD|oclc=890147571|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.607478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of columns supporting votive sculptures in [[Ancient Greek temple]]s is well attested since at least the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]].
The oldest known example of a [[Corinthian column]] is in the Temple of [[Apollo Epicurius]] at [[Bassae]] in Arcadia, c. 450–420 BC. It is not part of the order of the temple itself, which has a Doric colonnade surrounding the temple and an Ionic order within the [[cella]] enclosure. A single Corinthian column stands free, centered within the cella. It is often interpreted as a votive column.&lt;ref&gt;The Frederick A. Cooper, ''Temple of Apollo Bassitas: The architecture'' (1992),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=DSf3_deQfJkC&amp;pg=PA305  p. 305].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]], it was the practice to erect a statue of the Emperor atop a column. The last such a column was the [[Column of Phocas]], erected in the [[Roman Forum]] and dedicated or rededicated in 608. 
The Christian adaptation is the [[Marian column]], attested from at least the 10th century (in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] in France).
The image of [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] in [[Zaragoza]] dates to the 15th century.
Marian columns became  popular especially in the [[Counter-Reformation]], beginning with the column in [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Rome]]. The column itself was ancient, a leftover of the [[Basilica of Maxentius|Basilica of Constantine]], which had been destroyed by an earthquake in the 9th century. In [[1610s in architecture|1614]] it was transported to [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore]] and crowned with a bronze statue of [[Madonna and Child|the Virgin and Child]]. Within decades it served as a model for many columns in [[Italy]] and other European countries, such as the ''[[Mariensäule]]''  in [[Munich]]  (1638).
