'''Amy Gilbert''' (23 February 1895 – 27 August 1980) was an American [[historian]] of the United States.

==Life==
Amy Margaret Gilbert was born in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]] on 23 February 1895. She briefly attended [[Cornell University]] in 1914, but graduated from [[Wilson College (Pennsylvania)|Wilson College]] in 1915. She taught high school for a year before she was appointed as an instructor at [[Elmira College]]. Gilbert was awarded her [[M.A.]] in 1919 and her [[Ph.D]] in 1922 from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and her [[LL.D.]] from Wilson College in 1939. Upon completion of her Ph.D. in 1922, Gilbert became professor of history and chair of the department. She was the [[academic dean]] at [[Milwaukee-Downer College]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], from 1936 to 1941 and then dean at [[Rhode Island State College]] in [[Kingston, Rhode Island]], from 1941 to 1945, and head of the history and [[political science]] departments of the four units of Associated College of Upper New York (Champlain College, Mohawk College, Sampson College, and Middletown Collegiate Center) from 1946 to 1950. Gilbert was then appointed dean of academic administration at Champlain College of [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]] in 1950–52 and then became head of the college from 1952 to 1953. She was professor of history at Harpur College of Arts and Sciences of [[Binghamton University]] from 1953 until her retirement in 1965 and remained [[emeritus|emerati]] until her death on 27 February 1980.&lt;ref name=sc1&gt;Scanlon &amp; Cosner, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anita Shapira''' ({{lang-he|אניטה שפירא}}, born 1940) is an [[Israel]]i historian. She is the founder of the [[Yitzhak Rabin]] Center for [[Israel]] Studies, Emerita Professor of Jewish History at Tel Aviv University and former head of the [[Chaim Weizmann|Weizmann]] Institute for the Study of Zionism at [[Tel Aviv University]]. She received the [[Israel Prize]] for History in 2008.

==Biography==
Shapira was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] in 1940, [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1947 and grew up in [[Tel Aviv]]. The family lived on Yavneh Street sharing a kitchen and bathroom with other families. Later, they moved to [[Yad Eliyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020625.html The Case of Y.H. Brenner]&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied general and [[Jewish history]] at [[Tel Aviv University]], completing her [[Ph.D]] in 1974 under Professor Daniel Carpi. Her dissertation, "The Struggle for [[Hebrew labor|Hebrew Labor]], 1929-1939," indicated her interest in the history of the [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] movement, which was to be a continuing focus of her research. In 1985 she was appointed full professor at Tel Aviv University, serving in 1990-95 as dean of the Faculty of Humanities. From 1995 until 2009 she held the Ruben Merenfeld Chair for the Study of Zionism. From 2000 to 2012, she was head of the [[Chaim Weizmann]] Institute for the Study of Zionism and Israel at Tel Aviv University. From 2008 to 2013 she was a director in the [[Israel Democracy Institute]].

From 1985 to 1989, she was a member of the Planning and Budgeting Commission of the Council for Higher Education in Israel; in 1987-90 she was chair of the board of [[Am Oved]] publishing house; since 1988 she has been a board member of the [[Zalman Shazar]]  Institute. In 2002-2008, she was president of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture. She founded the [[Yitzhak Rabin]] Center for Israel Studies and was its first director in 1996-99.
  
She is a member of the Editorial Board of the ''[[Jewish Review of Books]]'', academic co-editor with Prof. Steven J. Zipperstein of the biography series "Jewish Lives" published by Yale University Press, and academic co-editor with Prof. Derek J. Penslar of the ''[[Journal of Israeli History]]''.

==Research==
Shapira's research focuses on the [[Political history|political]], [[Cultural history|cultural]], [[Social history|social]], [[Intellectual history|intellectual]] and [[military history]] of the Jewish community in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (the Yishuv) and [[Israel]].

Shapira's last book, ''Ben-Gurion: Father of Modern Israel'', strives to get to the core of the complex man who would become the face of the new Jewish nation. Shapira tells the Ben-Gurion story anew, focusing especially on the period after 1948, during the first years of statehood. She provides fascinating and original insights into Ben-Gurion personal qualities and those that defined his political leadership.
 
Her first book, based on her doctoral dissertation, Hama’avak Hanihzav: Avoda Ivrit 1929-1939 (''The Futile Struggle: Hebrew Work 1929-1939''), deals with the social and political history of the [[Yishuv]] in the 1920s and 1930s, including the controversies on policy towards the [[Arab]] population and the conflicts between left and right on the means for achieving Zionist goals.

Her second book, ''Berl: The Biography of a Socialist Zionist, [[Berl Katznelson]], 1887-1944'', was widely acclaimed by the general reading public as well as in academia and was published in [[Hebrew]] in eight editions. Focusing on a major figure in the [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] movement, this book portrays the history, society and culture of the [[Yishuv]] from the [[Second Aliyah]] to the end of [[World War II]].

During work on a biography of Yigal Allon, Shapira became interested in the role of force in the [[Zionism|Zionist]]  movement, initially inspired by an article by [[Menachem Begin]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] on “A War of Choice.”  This resulted in a book, Herev Hayona: Hatziyonut vehakoah, 1881-1948 (''Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881-1948''). In her biography of [[Yigal Allon]], ''Yigal Allon, Native Son: A Biography'', Shapira in fact portrays the development of the entire [[Palmach]] generation in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], the first native-born [[Sabra (person)|Sabra]] generation.

In this period she also started investigating issues connected to culture and collective memory, as in articles on [[Latrun]] and [[S. Yizhar]]’s short story “Hirbet Hize,” and on the attitudes of Israeli society to the [[Holocaust]] and [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivors]]. Her book ''Hatanakh vehazehut hayisraelit'' (The Bible and Israeli identity) seeks to explain why the status of the [[Bible]] has declined in Israeli identity. Issues of identity, culture and memory are also the focus of two collection of essays, Yehudim Hadashim, Yehudim Yeshanim (New Jews, Old Jews), and ''Yehudim, Tziyonim Umah shebeinehem'' (Jews, Zionists and Between).

Many of her books have been translated into [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[French language|French]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Archaeological science''', also known as '''archaeometry''', consists of the application of [[scientific technique]]s to the analysis of archaeological materials, to assist in dating the materials. It is related to [[Scientific methodology|methodologies]] of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcos Martinón-Torres and David Killick|title=Archaeological Theories and Archaeological Sciences in "The Oxford Handbook of Archaeological Theory"|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Social science and archaeological enquiry|journal=Antiquity|date=4 April 2017|volume=91|issue=356|pages=520–528|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Natural Environment Research Council|Natural and Environmental Research Council]] provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | title = Archaeology and Archaeometry: From Casual Dating to a Meaningful Relationship?
 | publisher = Antiquity
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in almost all cases of archeometric research, scientists from the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] assist in the scientific analysis of archeological artifacts. Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for [[Archaeology|archeology]] students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. ''Archaeometry'' '''31''' 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating|relative]] [[chronology|chronologies]]
* [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and [[pathology]] of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] and [[geophysical survey|geophysical-survey]] techniques for buried features
* [[conservation sciences]], involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as [[lithic analysis]], [[archaeometallurgy]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[zooarchaeology]] also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological [[stratum|strata]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Some of the most important [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] techniques include:
* [[radiocarbon dating]] — especially for dating organic materials
* [[dendrochronology]] — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* [[thermoluminescence dating]] — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of [[quartz]] within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure [[potassium feldspar]]s, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* [[electron spin resonance]], as used (for example) in dating teeth
* [[potassium-argon dating]] — for dating (for example) fossilized [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF)
* [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS)
* [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA)
* [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS)

[[Lead]], [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope analysis]] can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.

[[Provenance analysis]] has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of [[trade|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Influence of archaeometry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the "second [[radiocarbon revolution]]" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the "first radiocarbon revolution" from 1949.

Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites.  The use of [[remote sensing]] has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of [[aerial photography]] (including [[satellite imagery]] and [[Lidar]]) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]s often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">'''Buleliana''' was a ''[[civitas]]'' (town) and bishopric in [[Roman North Africa]] and remains a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].
 
== History ==
The exact location of the town is not known but it was in the [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]] region of northern, [[Tunisia]].
 
Buleliana was among the municipalities of sufficient importance in the [[Roman province]] of [[Africa proconsularis]] and latter [[Byzacena]] to become a [[suffragan diocese]] in the papal sway. The town remained the [[cathedra|seat]] of a Christian bishopric through the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era &lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2b98.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhgIT4iVT0x8h_lndwgjknlYMPKJMQ Titular Episcopal See of Buleliana, Tunisia] at catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt; but faded like most after the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|7th century advent of Islam]].

While Mesnage assigns three bishops to the see, other authors dispute two assignations :
* Pancratius, [[Donatist]] (heretical) dissident in (393), alternatively assigned to the diocese of [[Baliana]]
* Flavianus, participant at the [[Council of Carthage (484)|synod called in Carthage in 484]] by king Huneric of the [[Vandal Kingdom]] on the Donatist schism
* Bonifacius, alternatively assigned to the diocese of [[Bavagaliana]].

== Titular see ==
The diocese was nominally restored in 1989 as [[titular bishopric]] of Buleliana (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Bulelianen(sis) (Latin adjective) as a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. 

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0352.htm Titular Episcopal See of Buleliana Tunisia] at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bishop-elect]] John Đỗ Văn Ngân (2017.05.02 – ...), as [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Xuân Lộc|Diocese of Xuân Lộc]] ([[Vietnam]]) (2017.05.02 – ...).

'''Capcir''' ({{IPA-ca|kəpˈsiɾ|lang}}; {{IPA-fr|kapsiʁ|lang}}) is a [[Comarques of Catalonia|historical Catalan comarca]] of [[Northern Catalonia]], now part of the French [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]. The capital of the comarca was [[Formiguera]], and it borders the historical comarques of [[Conflent]] and [[Alta Cerdanya]]. Capcir is on a plateau, averaging 1500 metres above sea level, and allows passage between the high valleys of [[Aude]] and both the Spanish [[Cerdanya (comarca)|Cerdanya]] and [[French Cerdagne]]. It has traditionally been rural, but has developed considerably in last the forty years thanks to its tourist attractions. Capcir has two nicknames: little [[Siberia]] or little [[Canada]]. This gives an idea of the climate which can prevail during the winter. It is one the last places in Western Europe where the artic plant [[Ligularia sibirica]] can be found .

The '''Cuban Revolution''' ({{lang-es|Revolución cubana}}) was an armed revolt conducted by [[Fidel Castro]]'s revolutionary [[26th of July Movement]] and its allies against the authoritarian government of Cuban [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fulgencio Batista]]. The revolution began in July 1953,&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt; and continued sporadically until the rebels finally ousted Batista on 31 December 1959, replacing his government with a revolutionary [[socialist state]]. 26 July 1959 is celebrated in Cuba as the ''Day of the Revolution''. The 26th of July Movement later reformed along [[communist]] lines, becoming the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]] in October 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98937598 "Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'"]. Jason Beaubien. NPR. 1 January 2009. Retrieved 9 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it transformed [[Cuba–United States relations|Cuba's relationship]] with the [[United States]], although efforts to improve diplomatic relations have gained momentum in recent years.&lt;ref name=FirstShipCuba2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/on-cuba-embargo-its-the-u-s-and-israel-against-the-world-again/?_r=0|title=On Cuba Embargo, It's the U.S. and Israel Against the World – Again|work=New York Times|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TerrorList&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-cuba-20150417-story.html|title=Cuba off the U.S. terrorism list: Goodbye to a Cold War relic|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReOpen2015/&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of [[nationalization]] and political consolidation that transformed [[Cuba's economy]] and civil society.&lt;ref name=Daggerheart/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAmCon/&gt; The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban intervention in foreign military conflicts, including the [[Angolan Civil War]] and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]].&lt;ref name=HistoryToday1981/&gt;

==History==
In the decades following [[Spanish–American War|United States' invasion of Cuba]] in 1898, and [[Platt Amendment|formal independence]] from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, Cuba experienced a period of significant instability, enduring a number of revolts, [[military coup|coups]] and a period of [[Second Occupation of Cuba|U.S. military occupation]]. [[Fulgencio Batista]], a former soldier who had served as the elected president of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, became president for the second time in 1952, after seizing power in a military coup and canceling the 1952 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/11/cuba-batista-fifth-revolution-1952|title=From the archive, 11 March 1962: Batista's revolution|work=The Guardian|date=11 March 2013|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Batista had been relatively [[progressivism|progressive]] during his first term,&lt;ref name="Sweig-Inside"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Cuban Revolution|author=Julia E. Sweig|isbn=978-0-674-01612-5|year=2004|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s he proved far more dictatorial and indifferent to popular concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]] |year=1973|title=The Dynamics of World Power: A Documentary History of the United States Foreign Policy 1985–1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-079729-3|page=512}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cuba remained plagued by high unemployment and limited water infrastructure,&lt;ref name="JFK1960"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25660 |title=Remarks of Senator John F.

Kennedy]] said: "I approved the proclamation which Fidel Castro made in the [[Sierra Maestra]], when he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to rid Cuba of corruption. I will even go further: to some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States. Now we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the Batista regime, I am in agreement with the first Cuban revolutionaries."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During his first term as President, Batista had not been supported by the [[Communist Party of Cuba]],&lt;ref name="Sweig-Inside" /&gt; but during his second term he became strongly [[anti-communist]].&lt;ref name="JFK1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James S. Olson|James Stuart Olson]] |year=2000|title=Historical Dictionary of the 1950s|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-30619-2|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batista developed a rather weak security bridge as an attempt to silence political opponents. In the months following the March 1952 coup, [[Fidel Castro]], then a young lawyer and activist, petitioned for the overthrow of Batista, whom he accused of corruption and tyranny. However, Castro's constitutional arguments were rejected by the Cuban courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/historyofthecaribbean/p/08fidelcastro.htm|title=Biography of Fidel Castro|publisher=About.com|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deciding that the Cuban regime could not be replaced through legal means, Castro resolved to launch an armed revolution. To this end, he and his brother [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]] founded a paramilitary organization known as "The Movement", stockpiling weapons and recruiting around 1,200 followers from Havana's disgruntled working class by the end of 1952. Batista was known as a corrupt leader as he constantly pampered himself with elegant foods and exotic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fidel: A Biography of Fidel Castro |last=Bourne |first= Peter G. |authorlink=Peter Bourne |year=1986 |publisher=[[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-396-08518-8 |ref=harv|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early stages==
{{Main|Moncada Barracks}}
Striking their first blow against the Batista government, Fidel and Raúl Castro gathered 69 Movement fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on several military installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubatravelinfo.com/historical-sites/moncada-army-barracks.html|title=Historical sites: Moncada Army Barracks and |publisher=CubaTravelInfo|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 1953, the rebels attacked the [[Moncada Barracks]] in [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and the barracks in [[Bayamo]], only to be decisively defeated by government soldiers.&lt;ref name=Faria&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria|first1=Miguel A., Jr.|authorlink1=Miguel A.

He had around 150 factory and farm workers. After an hour of fighting the rebel leader fled to the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York, New York|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of rebels killed in the battle is debatable; however, in his autobiography, Fidel Castro claimed that nine were killed in the fighting, and an additional 56 were executed after being captured by the Batista government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|2007|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the government's large number of men, Hunt revised the number to be around 60 members taking the opportunity to flee to the mountains along with Castro.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead was [[Abel Santamaría]], Castro's second-in-command, who was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the same day as the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|2007|p=672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous key Movement revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured shortly afterwards. In a highly political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his defense, ending with the words "Condemn me, it does not matter. [[History will absolve me]]." Castro's defense was based on nationalism, the representation and beneficial programs for the non-elite Cubans, and his patriotism and justice for the Cuban community.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the [[Presidio Modelo]] prison, located on [[Isla de Pinos]], while Raúl was sentenced to 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~fcf/estoria.presidio.html|title=Chronicle of an Unforgettable Agony: Cuba's Political Prisons|work=Contacto Magazine|date=September 1996|accessdate=10 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128090116/http://www2.fiu.edu/~fcf/estoria.presidio.html|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1955, under broad political pressure, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers. Fidel's [[Jesuit]] childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Raúl in the release.&lt;ref name="Castro_174"&gt;{{harvp|Castro|2007|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, the Castro brothers joined with other exiles in [[Mexico]] to prepare for the overthrow of Batista, receiving training from [[Alberto Bayo]], a leader of [[Spanish Civil War#Republicans|Republican]] forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In June 1955, Fidel met the [[Argentina|Argentine]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], who joined his cause.&lt;ref name="Castro_174"/&gt; Raul and Castro's chief advisor Ernesto aided the initiation of Batista's amnesty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The revolutionaries named themselves the "26th of July Movement", in reference to the date of their attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt;

==Guerrilla warfare==
The yacht ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' departed from [[Tuxpan]], [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], on 25 November 1956, carrying the Castro brothers and 80 others including [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]] and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]], even though the yacht was only designed to accommodate 12 people with a maximum of 25. The yacht arrived in Cuba on 2 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuban Revolution: The Voyage of the Granma|url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/thehistoryofcuba/p/09granma.htm|quote=The yacht, designed for only 12 passengers and supposedly with a maximum capacity of 25, also had to carry fuel for a week as well as food and weapons for the soldiers.|publisher=Latin American History|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat landed in [[Playa Las Coloradas]], in the municipality of [[Niquero]], arriving two days later than planned because the boat was heavily loaded, unlike during the practice sailing runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|2007|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dashed any hopes for a coordinated attack with the ''llano'' wing of the Movement. After arriving and exiting the ship, the band of rebels began to make their way into the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, a range in southeastern Cuba. Three days after the trek began, Batista's army attacked and killed most of the ''Granma'' participants&amp;nbsp;– while the exact number is disputed, no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the initial encounters with the Cuban army and escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thomas|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of survivors included Fidel and Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]]. The dispersed survivors, alone or in small groups, wandered through the mountains, looking for each other. Eventually, the men would link up again – with the help of peasant sympathizers – and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. A number of female revolutionaries, including [[Celia Sanchez]] and [[Haydée Santamaría]] (the sister of [[Abel Santamaria]]), also assisted Fidel Castro's operations in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laventana.casa.cult.cu/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2014|title=Opiniones: Haydee Santamaría, una mujer revolucionaria|publisher=La Ventana|date=2 July 2004|accessdate=14 June 2013|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517164246/http://laventana.casa.cult.cu/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2014|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 13 March 1957, a separate group of revolutionaries&amp;nbsp;– the [[anticommunist]] Student Revolutionary Directorate (RD) ([[Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil|''Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil'']], DRE), composed mostly of students&amp;nbsp;– stormed the Presidential Palace in Havana, attempting to assassinate Batista and decapitate the government. The attack ended in utter failure. The RD's leader, student [[José Antonio Echeverría]], died in a shootout with Batista's forces at the Havana radio station he had seized to spread the news of Batista's anticipated death. The handful of survivors included Dr. Humberto Castello (who later became the Inspector General in the Escambray), Rolando Cubela and Faure Chomon (both later Commandantes of the 13 March Movement, centered in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Faria|2002|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, the [[United States]] imposed an economic [[embargo]] on the Cuban government and recalled its ambassador, weakening the government's mandate further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cuba and the United States|author=Louis A. Pérez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batista's support among Cubans began to fade, with former supporters either joining the revolutionaries or distancing themselves from Batista. Once Batista started making drastic decisions concerning Cuba's economy, he began to nationalize U.S oil refineries and other U.S properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Mafia and U.S. businessmen maintained their support for the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|English|2008}}{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/The-Batista-Lansky-Alliance_7197|title=The Batista-Lansky Alliance: How the mafia and a Cuban dictator built Havana's casinos|work=[[Cigar Aficionado]]|date=May 2001|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raulche2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Raúl Castro]] (left), with his arm around his second-in-command, [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], in their Sierra de Cristal mountain stronghold in [[Oriente Province]], Cuba, in 1958]]

Batista's government often resorted to brutal methods to keep Cuba's cities under control. However, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, Castro, aided by [[Frank País]], Ramos Latour, [[Huber Matos]], and many others, staged successful attacks on small garrisons of Batista's troops. In addition, poorly armed irregulars known as ''[[escopeteros]]'' harassed Batista's forces in the foothills and plains of [[Oriente Province]]. The ''escopeteros'' also provided direct military support to Castro's main forces by protecting supply lines and by sharing intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Don A.|last=Dewitt|title=U.S. Marines at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba|publisher=iUniverse via Google Books|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f36zpcqLxQ4C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=batista+escopeteros&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mkBKLPMHjc&amp;sig=Q4XXGa4rO20ZxI1tUl904H4T6O4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=un26UenZA8W00QWQ-YHwCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=batista%20escopeteros&amp;f=false|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the mountains came under Castro's control.&lt;ref name="Mallin2018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallin|first=Jay|title=Covering Castro: Rise and Decline of Cuba's Communist Dictator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vZKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19|year=2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York|isbn=978-1-351-29418-8|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to armed resistance, the rebels sought to use [[Cuban revolutionary propaganda|propaganda]] to their advantage. A [[pirate radio station]] called ''[[Radio Rebelde]]'' ("Rebel Radio") was set up in February 1958, allowing Castro and his forces to broadcast their message nationwide within enemy territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorebelde.cu/english/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=[[Radio Rebelde]]|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro's affiliation with the ''New York Times'' journalist [[Herbert Matthews]] created a front page-worthy report on anti-communist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio broadcasts were made possible by [[Carlos Franqui]], a previous acquaintance of Castro who subsequently became a [[Cuban exile]] in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/7760752/Carlos-Franqui.html|title=Carlos Franqui|work=Daily Telegraph|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Castro's forces remained quite small in numbers, sometimes fewer than 200 men, while the Cuban army and police force had a manpower of around 37,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&amp;dat=19590101&amp;id=FsEaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0EUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5002,96492|title=Batista Says Manpower Edge Lacking|work=Park City Daily News|date=1 January 1959|publisher=Google News Archive|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, nearly every time the Cuban military fought against the revolutionaries, the army was forced to retreat. An arms embargo – imposed on the Cuban government by the United States on the 14 March 1958 – contributed significantly to the weakness of Batista's forces. The Cuban air force rapidly deteriorated: it could not repair its airplanes without importing parts from the United States.&lt;ref name=Verano&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=259&amp;Itemid=47|title= Air war over Cuba 1956–1959|publisher=ACIG.org|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batista finally responded to Castro's efforts with an attack on the mountains called [[Operation Verano]], known to the rebels as ''la Ofensiva''. The army sent some 12,000 soldiers, half of them untrained recruits, into the mountains, along with his own brother Raul. In a series of small skirmishes, Castro's determined guerrillas defeated the Cuban army.&lt;ref name=Verano/&gt; In the [[Battle of La Plata]], which lasted from 11 to 21 July 1958, Castro's forces defeated a 500-man battalion, capturing 240 men while losing just three of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuba1952-1959.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/1958-battle-of-la-plata-el-jigue.html|title=1958: Battle of La Plata (El Jigüe)|publisher=Cuba 1952–1959|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the tide nearly turned on the 29 July 1958, when Batista's troops almost destroyed Castro's small army of some 300 men at the [[Battle of Las Mercedes]]. With his forces pinned down by superior numbers, Castro asked for, and received, a temporary cease-fire on 1 August. Over the next seven days, while fruitless negotiations took place, Castro's forces gradually escaped from the trap. By the 8 August, Castro's entire army had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure for the Batista government.&lt;ref name=Verano/&gt;

[[File:Sierra Maestra -mapa rev cubana-.png|Cuban Revolution 1959|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing key locations in the [[Sierra Maestra]] during the 1958 stage of the Cuban Revolution]]

On 21 August 1958, after the defeat of Batista's ''Ofensiva'', Castro's forces began their own offensive. In the Oriente province (in the area of the present-day provinces of [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Granma Province|Granma]], [[Guantánamo]] and [[Holguín]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brown|Tucker|2013|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro and [[Juan Almeida Bosque]] directed attacks on four fronts. Descending from the mountains with new weapons captured during the ''Ofensiva'' and smuggled in by plane, Castro's forces won a series of initial victories. Castro's major victory at [[Guisa]], and the successful capture of several towns including Maffo, Contramaestre, and Central Oriente, brought the [[Cauto River|Cauto]] plains under his control.

Meanwhile, three rebel columns, under the command of Che Guevara, [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] and Jaime Vega, proceeded westward toward [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], the capital of [[Villa Clara Province]]. Batista's forces ambushed and destroyed Jaime Vega's column, but the surviving two columns reached the central provinces, where they joined forces with several other resistance groups not under the command of Castro. When Che Guevara's column passed through the province of [[Las Villas Province|Las Villas]], and specifically through the [[Escambray Mountains]] – where the anticommunist Revolutionary Directorate forces (who became known as the 13 March Movement) had been fighting Batista's army for many months – friction developed between the two groups of rebels. Nonetheless, the combined rebel army continued the offensive, and Cienfuegos won a key victory in the [[Battle of Yaguajay]] on 30 December 1958, earning him the nickname "The Hero of Yaguajay".

On 31 December 1958, the [[Battle of Santa Clara]] took place in a scene of great confusion. The city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] fell to the combined forces of Che Guevara, Cienfuegos, and Revolutionary Directorate (RD) rebels led by Comandantes Rolando Cubela, Juan ("El Mejicano") Abrahantes, and [[William Alexander Morgan]]. News of these defeats caused Batista to panic. He fled Cuba by air for the [[Dominican Republic]] just hours later on 1 January 1959. Comandante William Alexander Morgan, leading RD rebel forces, continued fighting as Batista departed, and had captured the city of [[Cienfuegos]] by 2 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Faria|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro learned of Batista's flight in the morning and immediately started negotiations to take over [[Santiago de Cuba]]. On the 2nd of January, the military commander in the city, Colonel Rubido, ordered his soldiers not to fight, and Castro's forces took over the city. The forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos entered Havana at about the same time. They had met no opposition on their journey from Santa Clara to Cuba's capital. Castro himself arrived in Havana on 8 January after a long victory march. His initial choice of president, [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]], took office on 3 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thomas|1998|pp=691–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's roles in the revolution==
The importance of women's contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the [[Moncada Barracks]], to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail. [[Tete Puebla]], second in command of the [[Mariana Grajales Platoon]], has said:

{{quotation|Women in Cuba have always been on the front line of the struggle. At Moncada we had Yeye ([[Haydee Santamaria]]) and Melba (Hernandez). With the [[Granma (yacht)]] and November 30, we had Celia, Vilma, and many other compañeras. There were many women comrades who were tortured and murdered. From the beginning there were women in the Revolutionary Armed Forces. First they were simple soldiers, later sergeants. Those of us in the Mariana Grajales Platoon were the first officers. The ones who ended the war with officers' ranks stayed in the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Puebla, Teté 2003"&gt;Puebla, Teté, and Mary-Alice Waters.

Before the Mariana Grajales Platoon was established, the revolutionary women of the Sierra Maestra were not organized for combat and primarily helped with cooking, mending clothes, and tending to the sick, frequently acting as couriers, as well as teaching guerillas to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Puebla, Teté, and Mary-Alice Waters.

Haydée Santamaría and [[Melba Hernandez]] were the only women who participated in the attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]], afterward acting alongside [[Natalia Revuelta]], and Lidia Castro (Fidel Castro's sister) to form alliances with anti-Batista organizations, as well as the assembly and distribution of "History Will Absolve Me".&lt;ref&gt;Shayne, Julie D. The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba. Rutgers University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Celia Sanchez]] and [[Vilma Espin]] were leading strategists and highly skilled combatants who held essential roles throughout the revolution. Tete Puebla, founding member and second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, said of [[Celia Sanchez]], "When you speak of Celia, you've got to speak of Fidel, and vice versa. Celia's ideas touched almost everything in the Sierra.&lt;ref name="Puebla, Teté 2003"/&gt;

On 15 April 1954, Castro began an 11-day visit to the United States, at the invitation of the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glass|first1=Andrew|title=Fidel Castro visits the U.S., April 15, 1959|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/this-day-in-politics-april-15-1959-90037.html|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=[[Politico]]|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said during his visit: "I know the world thinks of us, we are Communists, and of course I have said very clear that we are not Communists; very clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuban Revolution|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1959/Cuban-Revolution/|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=1959 Year in Review|agency=United Press International|date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of Batista-era agents, policemen and soldiers were put on public trial, accused of [[human rights]] abuses, [[war crime]]s, [[murder]], and [[torture]]. About 200 of the accused people  were convicted of political crimes by revolutionary tribunals and then executed by [[firing squad]]; others received long sentences of imprisonment. A notable example of revolutionary justice occurred after the capture of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]], where Raúl Castro directed the execution of more than seventy Batista [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].&lt;ref name="Juan Clark Cuba 1992 pp. 53"&gt;{{harvp|Clark|1992|pp=53–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in taking Havana, Che Guevara was appointed supreme prosecutor in [[La Cabaña Fortress]]. This was part of a large-scale attempt by Fidel Castro to cleanse the security forces of Batista loyalists and potential opponents of the new revolutionary government.

===Reforms and nationalization===
During its first decade in power, the Castro government introduced a wide range of progressive social reforms. Laws were introduced to provide equality for black Cubans and greater rights for women, while there were attempts to improve communications, medical facilities, health, housing, and education. In addition, there were touring cinemas, art exhibitions, concerts, and theatres. By the end of the 1960s, all Cuban children were receiving some education (compared with less than half before 1959), unemployment and corruption were reduced, and great improvements were made in hygiene and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mastering Modern World History'' by Norman Lowe, second edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Fidel dedicated many of his years to the equality among Afro-Cubans and the wealthy white people of Cuba. His anti-discrimination legislation was his first and major attempt to give equality to the people of Cuba. His many reforms (healthcare, education, and equality) gave opportunities to those Afro-Cubans who lived in poverty because of the racial discrimination in Cuba.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afrocubaweb.com/News/Cuba/RazaDesigualdad_Rodrigo.pdf|title=Raza y desigualdad en Cuba actual|last=Espina|first=Rodrigo|date=March 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The equal right of all citizens to health, education, work, food, security, culture, science, and wellbeing - that is, the same rights we proclaimed when we began our struggle, in addition to those which emerge from our dreams of justice and equality for all inhabitants of our world - is what I wish for all.| Fidel Castro&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/fidel_castro_79385|title=Fidel Castro Quotes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Castro's government was entirely based on his ideologies of equality and fair measures for the people of Cuba. After he considered to have done everything in his power toward equality, he passed a legislation that counter-attacked his past anti-discrimination legislation. This law made it illegal to even mention discrimination or the topic of equality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to geographer and Cuban Comandante [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], 75% of Cuba's best arable land was owned by foreign individuals or foreign (mostly American) companies at the time of the revolution. One of the first policies of the newly formed Cuban government was eliminating illiteracy and implementing land reforms. Land reform efforts helped to raise living standards by subdividing larger holdings into [[cooperative]]s. Comandante [[Humberto Sorí Marin|Sori Marin]], who was nominally in charge of land reform, objected and fled, but was eventually executed when he returned to Cuba with arms and explosives, intending to overthrow the Castro government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Font|1995|pp=80-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lazo|1968|pp=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after taking power, Castro also created a revolutionary militia to expand his power base among the former rebels and the supportive population. Castro also created the [[informant]] [[Comités de Defensa de la Revolución|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDRs) in late September 1960. Local CDRs were tasked with keeping "vigilance against counter-revolutionary activity", keeping a detailed record of each neighborhood's inhabitants' spending habits, level of contact with foreigners, work and education history, and any "suspicious" behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clark|1992|pp=131–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the increasingly persecuted groups were [[homosexual]] men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Allen|title=Gays under the Cuban revolution|year=1982|publisher=Grey Fox Press|isbn=0-912516-61-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1959, the Ministry for the Recovery of Misappropriated Assets (''Ministerio de Recuperación de Bienes Malversados'') was created. Cuba began expropriating land and private property under the auspices of the Agrarian Reform Law of 17 May 1959. Farms of any size could be and were seized by the government, while land, businesses, and companies owned by upper- and middle-class Cubans were nationalized (notably, including the plantations owned by Fidel Castro's family). By the end of 1960, the revolutionary government had nationalized more than $25&amp;nbsp;billion worth of private property owned by Cubans.&lt;ref name=Daggerheart&gt;Lazo, Mario (1970). ''American Policy Failures in Cuba&amp;nbsp;– Dagger in the Heart''. Twin Circle Publishing Co.: New York. pp. 198–200, 204. Library of Congress Card Catalog Number: 68-31632.&lt;/ref&gt; The Castro government formally nationalized all foreign-owned property, particularly American holdings, in the nation on 6 August 1960.&lt;ref name=TheAmCon/&gt;

In 1961, the Cuban government nationalized all property held by religious organizations, including the dominant [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Hundreds of members of the church, including a bishop, were permanently expelled from the nation, as the new Cuban government declared itself [[state atheism|officially atheist]]. Education also saw significant changes – private schools were banned and the progressively socialist state assumed greater responsibility for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Faria|2002|pp=215–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government also began to expropriate from mafia leaders and taking millions in cash. Before [[Meyer Lansky]] fled Cuba, he was said to be worth an estimated $20M, that would be $163,685,121 in 2016. When he died in 1983, his family was shocked that his estate was worth less than $10K. Before he died Lansky said Cuba "ruined" him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollingout.com/2016/11/26/fidel-castro-mixed-legacy-includes-fighting-mafia/|title=Fidel Castro a mixed legacy that includes fighting the mafia|date=26 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (IRO) was formed by the merger of Fidel Castro's [[26th of July Movement]], the [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|People's Socialist Party]] led by Blas Roca, and the Revolutionary Directorate of 13 March led by Faure Chomón.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Kantor| first =Myles B.| title =Interview With Dr. Miguel Faria (Part I)| publisher =[[Newsmax Media]]| date =14 June 2002| url =http://haciendapublishing.com/articles/interview-dr-miguel-faria-part-i-myles-b-kantor| accessdate =14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 26 March 1962, the IRO became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) which, in turn, became the modern [[Communist Party of Cuba]] on 3 October 1965, with Castro as [[General Secretary|First Secretary]]. Castro remained the ruler of Cuba, first as [[Prime Minister of Cuba|Prime Minister]] and, from 1976, as [[President of Cuba|President]], until his retirement in February 20, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/world/americas/20castro.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Fidel Castro Resigns as Cuba's President|work=New York Times|date=20 February 2008|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Raúl officially replaced him as President later that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/americas/24iht-cuba.5.10342397.html|title=Raúl Castro becomes Cuban president|work=New York Times|date=24 February 2008|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I approved the proclamation which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to rid Cuba of corruption.

The Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations.

''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington and Africa, 1959–1976''.

Castro's victory and post-revolutionary foreign policy had global repercussions. Influenced by the expansion of the [[Soviet Union]] into Europe after the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], Castro immediately sought to "export" his revolution to other countries in the Caribbean and beyond, sending weapons to [[Algeria]]n rebels as early as 1960.&lt;ref name=HistoryToday1981&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alfred-stepan/makers-twentieth-century-castro|title=Makers of the Twentieth Century: Castro|work=History Today|year=1981|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades, Cuba became heavily involved in supporting Communist insurgencies and independence movements in many developing countries, sending military aid to insurgents in [[Ghana]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Yemen]] and [[Angola]], among others.&lt;ref name=HistoryToday1981/&gt; Castro's intervention in the [[Angolan Civil War]] in the 1970s and 1980s was particularly significant, involving as many as 60,000 Cuban soldiers.&lt;ref name=HistoryToday1981/&gt;&lt;ref name="cubamatinal"&gt;[http://www.cubamatinal.com/Noticia.cfm?NoticiaID=7964 "La Guerras Secretas de Fidel Castro"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118152048/http://www.cubamatinal.com/Noticia.cfm?NoticiaID=7964 |date=18 January 2012 }} (in Spanish).

Following the American embargo, the Soviet Union became Cuba's main ally.&lt;ref name=TheAmCon/&gt; The two Communist countries quickly developed close military and intelligence ties, culminating in the stationing of Soviet [[nuclear weapon]]s in Cuba in 1962, an act which triggered the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Cuba maintained close links to the Soviets until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's collapse]] in 1991. The end of Soviet economic aid led to an economic crisis and famine known as the [[Special Period]] in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|work=The Economist|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exiles and counterrevolutionary rebels===
{{Main|Escambray rebellion|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}{{See Also|Cuban exiles}}
In the wake of the revolution, thousands of disaffected anti-Batista rebels, former Batista supporters, and ''campesinos'' (peasants) fled to Cuba's Las Villas province, where an anticommunist underground had been forming since early 1960. Operating out of the [[Escambray Mountains]], these counterrevolutionary rebels, also known as Alzados, made a number of unsuccessful attempts to overthrow the Cuban government, including the abortive, United States-backed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961.&lt;ref name=AheadFearNPR/&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, the United States promised not to invade Cuba in the future; in compliance with this agreement, the U.S. withdrew all support from the Alzados, effectively crippling the resource-starved resistance.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; The counterrevolutionary conflict, known abroad as the [[Escambray Rebellion]], lasted until about 1965, and has since been branded the [[War Against the Bandits]] by the Cuban government.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/Cuba/cuba_intelligenceandbayofpigs92602.html|title=Cuba: Intelligence and the Bay of Pigs|publisher=Stanford University|date=26 September 2002|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1959 and 1980, an estimated 500,000 Cubans left the island for the United States, for both political and economic reasons; 125,000 left in 1980 alone, when the Cuban government [[Mariel boatlift|briefly permitted]] any Cubans who wished to leave to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/exile-community-statistics.htm|title=Cuban Exile Community|publisher=LatinAmericanStudies.org|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the [[Cuban American]] community numbered over 1.9 million, 67% of whom lived in the state of [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/06/27/hispanics-of-cuban-origin-in-the-united-states-2010/|title=Hispanics of Cuban Origin in the United States, 2010|publisher=Pew Research|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[voting bloc]], Cuban Americans have traditionally been strongly opposed to ending the U.S. embargo of Cuba, but in recent years there has been growing support for diplomatic engagement among the younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/24/politics/cuban-american-embargo/|title=Latino millennials want to end Cuba embargo|publisher=CNN|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evelyn Frederick Charles Ludowyk''' (1906–1985), a [[Sri Lanka]]n [[Burgher people|Burgher]] [[Shakespeare]]an scholar, [[author]], [[playwright]] and [[critic]], was the first [[Professor]] of English of the [[University of Ceylon]].

A member of a prominent Dutch Burgher family, Ludowyk studied at [[Wesley College, Colombo]] and [[Richmond College (Sri Lanka)|Richmond College]], [[Galle]] and went up to [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].

He joined the staff of [[University College, Colombo]] in 1932, becoming professor in 1936.

In 1940 he met and married [[Edith Gyömrői Ludowyk|Edith Gyömröi]].

When the University College was converted into the University of Ceylon, Ludowyk was appointed its first Professor of English in 1942. He was made the first Dean of Arts in the newly established [[University of Peradeniya|University in Peradeniya]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.pdn.ac.lk/english/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011004256/http://www.arts.pdn.ac.lk/english/ |archivedate=2010-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, because the island's humid climate caused Edith problems, the couple moved to [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfs.island.lk/2008/07/16/m4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Later they settled in [[Colchester]].

Ludowyk died in Colchester in 1985.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13593">'''Engaged theory''' is a methodological framework for understanding [[social complexity]]. It takes social life or [[social relations]] as its base category, with 'the social' always understood as grounded in 'the natural', including humans as embodied beings. Engaged theory provides a framework that moves from detailed empirical analysis about things, people and processes in the world&lt;ref&gt;See for example the engaged research associated with Circles of Sustainability. [http://www.CirclesofSustainability.org www.CirclesofSustainability.org]&lt;/ref&gt; to abstract theory about the constitution and social framing of those things, people and processes.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul James, ''Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In'', Sage Publications, London, 2006 [https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged theory is one approach within the broader tradition of [[critical theory]]. Engaged theory crosses the fields of [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[political studies]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and [[global studies]]. At its most general, the term ''engaged theory'' is used to describe theories that provide a tool box for engaging with the world while seeking to change it.&lt;ref&gt;James Clifford, 'On Ethnographic Authority', Representations, vol. 1, no. 2, 1983, pp. 118–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

One lineage of engaged theory is called the 'constitutive abstraction' approach associated with a group of writers publishing in [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena Journal'']] such as John Hinkson, Geoff Sharp (1926–2015), and Simon Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;For a book that uses this approach see Simon Cooper, ''Techno-Culture and Critical Theory'', Routledge, London, 2002. One of the most important early pieces of writing in this approach was Geoff Sharp, 'Constitutive Abstraction and Social Practice', ''Arena'', 70, 1985, pp. 48–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related lineage of engaged theory has been developed by researchers who began their association through the Centre for Global Research at [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] in Australia – scholars such as [[Manfred Steger]], [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and Damian Grenfell – drawing upon a range of writers from [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to [[Benedict Anderson]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. A group of researchers at Western Sydney University describe their work as 'Engaged Research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uws.edu.au/ics/about | title=About ICS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The politics of engagement==

For all of its concern for epistemological grounding (see below), Engaged theory is an approach that is 'in the world'. All theory in some way affects what happens in the world, but it does not always theorize its own place in the constitution of ideas and practices. [[Anthony Giddens]] calls this movement a [[double hermeneutic]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens (1987), ''Social Theory and Modern Sociology'', Cambridge, Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged theory is more explicit than most about its political standpoint. [[Carol J. Adams]] expresses one dimension of this when she writes: 
{{cquote| It is engaged theory, theory that arises from anger about what is, theory that envisions what is possible. Engaged theory makes change possible.&lt;ref&gt;Carol J. Adams in ''Species Matters: Human Advocacy and Cultural Theory'', New York, Columbia University Press, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, the other important dimension is that any theory needs to be aware of its own tendencies to be ideologically driven by dominant concerns of its day. [[Liberalism]], for example, with its reductive advocacy of the ideology of 'freedom', fails to be reflexive about this dimension. Similarly, critical theory sometimes fails to be reflexive of what it means to be critical or advocate social change.

== The grounding of analysis ==
All social theories are dependent upon a process of [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hartle (1997), ''Self-knowledge in the Age of Theory'', Lanham Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; This is what philosophers call [[Epistemology|epistemological]] abstraction. However, they do not characteristically theorize their own bases for establishing their standpoint. Engaged theory does. By comparison, [[Grounded theory]], a very different approach, suggests that empirical data collection is a neutral process that gives rise to theoretical claims out of that data. Engaged theory, to the contrary, treats such a claim to ''value neutrality'' as naively unsustainable. Engaged theory is thus reflexive in a number of ways: 
* Firstly, it recognises that doing something as basic as collecting data already entails making theoretical presuppositions. 
* Secondly, it names the levels of analysis from which theoretical claims are made. Engaged theory works across four levels of theoretical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See below: ''Modes of Analysis''.) 
* Thirdly, it makes a clear distinction between theory and method, suggesting that a social theory is an argument about a social phenomenon, while an analytical method or set of methods is defined a means of substantiating that theory. Engaged theory in these terms works as a 'Grand method', but not a '[[Grand theory]]'. It provides an integrated set of methodological tools for developing different theories of things and processes in the world.
* Fourthly, it seeks to understand both its own epistemological basis, while treating knowledge formation as one of the basic [[ontology|ontological]] categories of human practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter Abel and James Conant, eds (2012) ''Rethinking Epistemology'', Berlin, De Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifthly, it treats ''history'' as a ''modern'' way of understanding temporal change; and therefore different ontologically from a tribal [[saga]] or cosmological [[narrative]]. In other words, it provides meta-standpoint on its own capacity to historicize.

==The modes of analysis==
In the version of Engaged theory developed by an Australian-based group of writers, analysis moves from the most concrete form of analysis – empirical generalization – to more abstract modes of analysis. Each subsequent mode of analysis is more abstract than the previous one moving across the following themes: 1. doing, 2. acting, 3. relating, 4. being.

This leads to the 'levels' approach as set out below:

===1. Empirical analysis (ways of doing)===
The method begins by emphasizing the importance of a first-order abstraction, here called ''empirical analysis''. It entails drawing out and generalizing from on-the-ground detailed descriptions of history and place. This first level either involves generating empirical description based on observation, experience, recording or experiment—in other words, abstracting evidence from that which exists or occurs in the world—or it involves drawing upon the empirical research of others. The first level of analytical abstraction is an ordering of ‘things in the world’, in a way that does not depend upon any kind of further analysis being applied to those ‘things’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach is a form of engaged theory distinguishing (at the level of empirical generalization) between different domains of social life. It can be used for understanding and assessing [[quality of life]]. Although that approach is also analytically defended through more abstract theory, the claim that economics, ecology, politics and culture can be distinguished as central domains of [[Social Practice|social practice]] has to be defensible at an empirical level. It needs to be useful in analyzing situations on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A. Thom |author5=Lin Padgham |author6=Sarah Hickmott |author7=Hepu Deng |author8=Felicity Cahill | title= Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach | url= https://www.academia.edu/4362669 | journal= Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume= 15 | issue= 1 |pages=225–43
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success or otherwise of the method can be assessed by examining how it is used. One example of use of the method was a project on Papua New Guinea called ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul James, Yaso Nadarajah, Karen Haive, and Victoria Stead, ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea'', Honolulu, University of Hawaii Press, 2012 ({{ISBN|978-0-8248-3588-0}} hb 978-0-8248-3640-5 pb).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. Conjunctural analysis (ways of acting)===
This second level of analysis, conjunctural analysis, involves identifying and, more importantly, examining the intersection (the conjunctures) of various patterns of action (practice and meaning). Here the method draws upon established sociological, anthropological and political categories of analysis such as production, exchange, communication, organization and inquiry.

===3. Integrational analysis (ways of relating)===
This third level of entry into discussing the complexity of social relations examines the intersecting modes of social integration and differentiation. These different modes of integration are expressed here in terms of different ways of relating to and distinguishing oneself from others—from the face-to-face to the disembodied. Here we see a break with the dominant emphases of classical social theory and a movement towards a post-classical sensibility. In relation to the nation-state, for example, we can ask how it is possible to explain a phenomenon that, at least in its modern variant, subjectively explains itself by reference to face-to-face metaphors of blood and place—ties of genealogy, kinship and ethnicity—when the objective ‘reality’ of all nation-states is that they are disembodied communities of abstracted strangers who will never meet. This accords with [[Benedict Anderson]]'s conception of 'imagined communities', but recognizes the contradictory formation of that kind of community.&lt;ref&gt;B. Anderson, ''Imagined Communities'', Verso, London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===4. Categorical analysis (ways of being)===
This level of enquiry is based upon an exploration of the ontological categories (categories of being such as time and space). If the previous form of analysis emphasizes the different modes through which people live their commonalities with or differences from others, those same themes are examined through more abstract analytical lenses of different grounding forms of life: respectively, embodiment, spatiality, temporality, performativity and [[epistemology]]. At this level, generalizations can be made about the dominant modes of categorization in a social formation or in its fields of practice and discourse. It is only at this level that it makes sense to generalize across modes of being and to talk of ontological formations, societies as formed in the uneven dominance of formations of [[tribalism]], traditionalism, [[modernism]] or [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest formulations of the notion of a postmodern level of the economy was John Hinkson, ‘Postmodern Economy: Value, Self-Formation and Intellectual Practice’, ''Arena Journal'', New Series, no. 1, 1993, pp. 23–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Engineering Heritage Awards''', formally known as the ''Engineering Heritage Hallmark Scheme'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imeche.org/about-us/scholarships-and-awards/engineering-heritage-award |title=Engineering Heritage Awards |publisher=Imeche.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; were established by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (IMechE) in 1984 to identify and promote artefacts, locations, collections and landmarks of significant engineering importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reisz |first=Matthew |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=404541&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Beyond the league of gentlemen &amp;#124; General |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the Awards ==
=== Engineering Heritage Hallmark Scheme (EHHS) ===
In 1984, IMechE launched its Engineering Heritage Hallmark Scheme. For an object or artefact etc. to be considered for an award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topforge.co.uk/Magazines/Award.htm |title=Award |publisher=Topforge.co.uk |date=1994-03-25 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; an IMechE member would be required to complete a nomination form and submit it to the Institution. Upon submission, two referees would be appointed, one nominated by the Regional Committee where the object is located and a second independent referee. The submissions from both referees would then be reviewed by the Institution's Technical Support department before a decision was taken on the application.

=== Engineering Heritage Awards (EHA) ===
In 2007, the Institution established the Heritage Committee to relaunch and promote the now renamed Engineering Heritage Awards. It simplified the application process, making it more transparent and with a quicker decision-making process. Furthermore, the criteria were changed, and the Institution's own library and information service became involved in the verification of details being submitted. The Award plaque was also redesigned (see below).

== EHHA and EHA plaques ==
Since 1984, the plaques presented to EHHS and EHA recipients have changed four times. The original plaque was a blue ceramic disc approximately 40&amp;nbsp;cm in wide. This was replaced in the 1990s by a rectangular steel plate mounted on a wooden base.

With the launch of the Engineering Heritage Awards in 2008, a new cast plaque was created. This was slightly modified in 2009 to reflect the rebranding of the Institution.

X Alpha Rigid Inflatable Boat

The [[Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Boat]] (RIB) design developed at [[Atlantic College| UWC Atlantic College]] in South Wales is in service with numerous maritime rescue organisations and navies worldwide. The unique design combines a rigid hull with an inflatable tube, enabling both speed and stability at sea and safety alongside other vessels or those in the water. In 1963 Atlantic College became an Inshore Lifeboat Station for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnli.org.uk/rnli_near_you/west/stations/AtlanticCollege/history|title=The RNLI Saves Lives At Sea – Atlantic College History|publisher=rnli.org.uk|date=2007-08-24|accessdate=2017-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824215105/http://www.rnli.org.uk/rnli_near_you/west/stations/AtlanticCollege/history|archivedate=2007-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIB was developed by [[Atlantic College]] staff and students starting in 1964 led by its Headmaster Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare.  Its RIB's provided rescue coverage for the college's sailing craft and for its [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution| RNLI]] Inshore Lifeboat Station. The [[Atlantic College]] RIB designs were rapidly adopted by the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution| RNLI]] from which it developed its highly successful [[Atlantic 21-class lifeboat|Atlantic 21]] and other inshore lifeboat designs responsible for saving many thousands of lives.  Numerous rescue services and navies around the world have adopted the [[Atlantic College| UWC Atlantic College]] RIB design.

Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are [[androgynous]].&lt;ref&gt;Undressing Cinema: Clothing and identity in the movies – Page 196, [[Stella Bruzzi]] – 2012

High-flying [[trendsetter]]s in fashion can aspire to the label ''[[haute couture]]''. But if one disapproves of a fashion, one can attempt to dismiss it as a mere [[fad]].

==Clothing fashions==
{{Main|History of Western fashion}}

Early Western travelers, traveling whether to  India, Persia, Turkey or China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion in those countries. The Japanese ''[[shōgun]]''{{'}}s secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that [[Japanese clothing]] had not changed in over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is considerable evidence in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] of rapidly changing fashions in [[Han Chinese clothing|Chinese clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]]: "[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]" (University of California Press 1999); this has a whole section on fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval [[Caliphate]], followed by a long period without major changes. In 8th-century [[Moorish Spain]], the musician [[Ziryab]] introduced to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Salim al-Hassani|al-Hassani]], Woodcok and Saoud (2004), ''Muslim Heritage in Our World'', FSTC publishing, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|Bias source per discussions at RS noticeboard|failed=y|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Terrasse, H.

Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], who introduced clothing styles from [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: A–K|author=Josef W. Meri &amp; Jere L. Bacharach|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2006|isbn=0415966914|page=162}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. Historians, including [[James Laver]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the [[1300–1400 in fashion|14th century]],&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="braudel"&gt;Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life", p317, William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981''&lt;/ref&gt; though they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion in Medieval France|last=Heller|first=Sarah-Grace|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|year=2007|isbn=9781843841104|location=Cambridge; Rochester, N.Y.|pages=49–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illuminated manuscripts were not common before the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=CMvTkgVRYvMC&amp;pg=PA28|title=English Medieval Narrative in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries|last=Boitani|first=Piero|date=1986-07-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521311496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks,&lt;ref name="conceitom.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|title=Jeans Calças Modelos Ideais|date=19 November 2014|work=Conceito M.|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419063504/http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers and one of the popular historical fashion was Often referred to as the "Plume Boom," the popularity of wearing real feathers in hats reached its peak in the early 20th century. According to The Smithsonian, women adorned their hats with feathers, wings, and even full taxidermied birds. This caused a huge decline in the bird population, and even led to the exinction of some. Often referred to as the "Plume Boom," the popularity of wearing real feathers in hats reached its peak in the early 20th century. According to The Smithsonian, women adorned their hats with feathers, wings, and even full taxidermied birds. This caused a huge decline in the bird population, and even led to the exinction of some. 

The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien Régime]] [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–324&lt;/ref&gt; Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 313–315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice. The Venetian lady's high [[chopine]]s make her look taller.]]&lt;!-- This image is referenced in the article. Please don't remove.--&gt;

In the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced.  Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. [[Albrecht Dürer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The "Spanish style" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Though different  textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.&lt;/ref&gt; the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were largely derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the "Steinkirk" [[cravat]] or necktie.

[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion. Her choices, such as this 1783 white [[muslin]] dress called a ''chemise a la Reine'', were highly influential and widely worn.&lt;ref name=dam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Dress and Morality |year=2003 |publisher=Berg |isbn=9781859737828 |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and [[Abraham Bosse]] had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry certainly led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is normally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first true ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers and also old fashion is becoming trendy nowadays but with a trendy taste .&lt;ref&gt;Claire B. Shaeffer (2001).

Taunton Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the idea of the [[fashion designer]] as a celebrity in his or her own right has become increasingly dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkins|first1=Ilya|title=Poiret, Dior and Schiaparelli: Fashion, Femininity and Modernity.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=9780857853288|page=10|edition=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT-Xcu-aWxQC&amp;pg=PA10|chapter=Introduction: Reputation, Celebrity and the "Professional" Designer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of unisex dressing originated in the 1960s when designers such as [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Rudi Gernreich]] created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex expands more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jennifer. "Unisex Clothing".

Some men's styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness despite the conservative trend, the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style, fabrics such as wool crepe, which had previously been associated with women's attire was used by designers when creating male clothing.&lt;ref&gt;"Clothing for Men".

The four major current [[fashion capital]]s are acknowledged to be Paris, Milan, New York City, and London, which are all headquarters to the greatest fashion companies and are renowned for their major influence on global fashion. [[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.

Modern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a wide number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their personal style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.

One can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)

In recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lemire, B., &amp; Riello, G (2008).

==Fashion industry==

The notion of global fashion industry is a product of the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the mid-19th century, most clothing was [[Made to measure|custom-made]]. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century—with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores—clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.

Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fashion industry consists of four levels:

# the production of raw materials, principally fibers and textiles but also leather and fur.
# the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.
# retail sales
# various forms of advertising and promotion

These levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, [[Fashion Design]] and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, [[Fashion Show]]s, and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion trend ==
{{main|Fashion trend|2010s in fashion}}
Fashion trends are influenced by several factors including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, political, economical, social and technological. Examining these factors is called a [[PEST analysis]]. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine growth or decline of a particular trend. Fashion trends change daily, it can not stay unchanged

=== Political influences ===
[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to US President and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]

Not only did political events make a huge impact on fashion trends but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress or a soft color Cassini coat with huge buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s the economy had become wealthier, divorce rate was increasing and government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring miniskirt has become a major fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.

Moreover, political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trend. For instance, during Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie and it is still affecting current fashion trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political &amp; Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology influences ===

Technology plays a large role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.

Developments such as wearable technology have become an important trend in fashion and will continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and [[E-textiles|smart fabrics]] that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apparel.edgl.com/news/Top-6-Tech-Trends-in-the-Fashion-Industry94135|title=Top 6 Tech Trends in the Fashion Industry|last=Communications|first=Edgell|website=apparel.edgl.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion industry is seeing how [[3D printing]] technology has influenced designers such as [[Iris van Herpen|Iris Van Herpen]] and [[Kimberly Ovitz]]. These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely.

Internet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed and sold immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract the trendsetters. Posts on Instagram or Facebook can easily increase awareness about new trends in fashion, which subsequently may create high demand for specific items or brands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinkrunway.com/2013/09/the-impact-of-technology-on-fashion.html|title=The Impact of Technology on Fashion Today|website=Site Name|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310132948/http://www.thinkrunway.com/2013/09/the-impact-of-technology-on-fashion.html|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; new "buy now button" technology can link these styles with direct sales.

[[Machine vision]] technology has been developed to track how fashions spread through society. The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. The effects can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers and consumers regarding trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541091/how-machine-vision-is-about-to-change-the-fashion-world/|title=How Machine Vision Is About to Change the Fashion World|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military technology has played an important role in the fashion industry. The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s and camouflage fabric was introduced to street wear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com|title=Home : Berg Fashion Library|website=www.bergfashionlibrary.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers such as Valentino, Dior and Dolce &amp; Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections.

=== Social influences ===
[[File:Britney Europe.jpg|thumb|upright|Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have popularised the concept of wearing [[underwear as outerwear]].]]
[[File:Gabriel Garko and Laura Torrisi - nicogenin - 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) - The Road (3).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Red carpet fashion]]: Italian actors [[Gabriel Garko]] and [[Laura Torrisi]] wearing designer [[formal wear]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], 2009]]

Clothing is much more than fashion, it is a style of life an expression of ones self. Social media is one of the biggest platforms to exhibit and connect fashion trends with millions of people all at once worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/social-media-influences-fashion|title=Social Media Influences on Fashion|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion trend goes beyond the aesthetic values, it emerges as an expressive tool for designers to deliver their message about the society. With the influence of social media, celebrities and bloggers, their voice are easily being heard and have impact on fashion and trend at any time.
Fashion and music are inseparable. [[Prabal Gurung]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/music-and-fashion|title=Music and Fashion|website=www.notjustalabel.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the importance of music to his shows, saying "each season we want to tell a story for 10 minutes…. the perfect harmony between cloths and music allows this". Music is a representation of fashion that expresses the abstract design concept into relatable harmony for viewers.

Fashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music…like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives." Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video ‘Formation’ by Beyoncé, according to Carlos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyoncé's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyoncé catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day."

Runway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway show is a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,&lt;ref name="Dazed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet." Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like "Feminist but feminine" and "Ladies first." According to Water,&lt;ref name="Dazed" /&gt; "The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour."

=== Economic influences ===

==== Circular economy ====
As we undergo a global economic downturn{{when|date=May 2018}}, the "Spend now, think later" belief is getting less relevant in our society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&amp;q=economy+trend+fashion&amp;CID=A105052&amp;PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society. They're looking for ways to mediate their material desires with an aim to do more good in the world. A linear economy is slowly shifting to a circular one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company "represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning," according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay €7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's "Used Gear" section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== China's domestic spending ====
Consumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes — easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.

=== Consumers' needs ===

Consumers all have different needs and demands that have to be suited. A person's needs change frequently.  An important factor to take into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs is the key demographics of the customer. Gender, age, income, and even profession can help a company better understand the needs of their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs &amp; Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a woman who is pregnant could be looking for diapers, baby strollers, and maternity clothes. Her needs would differ greatly from a woman with children that just went off to college or a teen entering high school.

Often consumers need to be told what they want. Fashion companies have to do their research to ensure they know their customers' needs before developing solutions. Steve Jobs said, "You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You cannot start with the technology and try to figure out where you are going to sell it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best way to understand the consumers' needs and therefore predict fashion trends is through [[market research]]. There are two research methods: primary and secondary.&lt;ref name="Consumer Research Methods"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups.

Benefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.&lt;ref name="Consumer Research Methods"/&gt; Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.

Knowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.

==Media==

Fashion breathes on media and medium .
The media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by [[Lucien Vogel]] and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the "fashionista on a budget". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as "blogger of the moment" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Fateh, Azhar. “How Social Media Is Changing Fashion?” The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. "Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January", she writes. "Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying."&lt;ref&gt;Tax, Genevieve.

The fashion industry has been the subject of numerous films and television shows, including the reality show ''[[Project Runway]]'' and the drama series ''[[Ugly Betty]]''. Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

Videos in general have been very useful in promoting the fashion industry. This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.

==Public relations and social media==
[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]

Fashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, G., &amp; Perlman, S.

Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, great hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Westfield, A. M.

==Anthropological perspective==
Anthropology, the study of culture and human societies, studies fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially appropriate and others are not. A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–55 [42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
In the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that "Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.

Since fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.

In 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 IPFrontline.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510220626/http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 |date=2007-05-10 }}: Intellectual Property in Fashion Industry, WIPO press release, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio INSME announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090258/http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio |date=2007-09-29 }}: WIPO-Italy International Symposium, 30 November – 2 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Foxfire''''' magazine began in 1966, written and published as a quarterly [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] by students at [[Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School]], a private secondary education school located in the U.S. [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  At the time Foxfire began, Rabun Gap Nacoochee School was also operating as a public secondary education school for students who were residents of northern Rabun County, Georgia.  An example of [[experiential education]], the magazine had articles based on the students' interviews with local people about aspects and practices in [[Appalachia]]n culture. They captured oral history, craft traditions, and other material about the culture. When the articles were collected and published in book form in 1972, it became a [[bestseller]] nationally and gained attention for the Foxfire project.

The magazine was named for [[foxfire (bioluminescence)|foxfire]], a term for a naturally occurring [[bioluminescence]] in fungi in the forests of [[North Georgia]]. In 1977, the Foxfire project moved from the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School to the newly built and consolidated public [[Rabun County High School]]. Additional books were published, and with profits from magazine and book sales, the students created a not-for-profit educational and literary organization and a museum. The Foxfire program has been shifted from the English to the business curriculum. Nationally, the Foxfire model has inspired numerous school systems to develop their own experiential education programs.

==History==
In 1966, [[Eliot Wigginton]] and his students in an English class at the [[Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School]] initiated a project to engage students in writing.&lt;ref name="New GA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2424&amp;hl=y |title=Foxfire |accessdate=2010-01-23 |last=Mendonca |first=Adrienn |date=2005-09-16 |work=New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=University of Georgia Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='RGNS'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabungap.org/page.cfm?p=10 |title=History of RGNS |accessdate=2010-01-23 |publisher=RGNS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class decided to publish a magazine over the course of the semester. Its articles were the product of the students' interviewing their relatives and local citizens about how lifestyles had changed over the course of their lives and dealt with traditions in the rural area. First published in 1966, the magazine covers topics of the lifestyle, culture, crafts, and skills of people in southern [[Appalachia]]. The content is written as a mixture of [[how-to]] information, [[first-person narrative]]s, [[oral history]], and [[folklore]].

The Foxfire project has published ''Foxfire'' magazine continuously since 1966.  In 1972, the first of the highly popular [[Foxfire books|''Foxfire'' books]] was published, which collected published articles as well as new material. Both the magazine and books are based on the stories and life of elders and students, featuring advice and personal stories about subjects as wide-ranging as hog [[butcher|dressing]], faith healing, blacksmithing, and [[Appalachia]]n local and regional history. Foxfire moved from [[Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School]] to Rabun County High School in 1977.

One of the most famous contacts in the Foxfire books was a woman named [[Arie Carpenter]], also known as "Aunt Arie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Sonia|title=Homespun life sparkled with humor; Aunt Arie - A Foxfire Portrait|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0713/071303.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=13 July 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
The '''Foxfire books''' are a series of [[copyrighted]] [[anthology|anthologies]] of articles originally written for ''Foxfire'' magazine, along with additional content not suitable for the magazine format. Though first conceived primarily as a [[sociological]] work, recounting [[oral tradition]]s, the books, particularly the early ones, were a commercial success as [[handbook|instructional works]].

Members of the 1970s [[back-to-the-land movement]] used the books as a basis to return to [[Simple living|lives of simplicity]]. The first book was published in 1972 as ''The Foxfire Book''. This was followed by an additional 11 books, titled in sequence ''Foxfire 2'' through ''Foxfire 12''. The students have published several additional specialty books under the Foxfire name, some of which have been published by the University of North Carolina Press.

Published by [[Random House]]-[[Anchor Press|Anchor]], the magazine and [[anthology|anthologies]] have become a continuing project of The Foxfire Fund, Inc.

==Foxfire Fund==
The students used some of their revenues to set up the Foxfire Fund, a not-for-profit educational and literary organization in [[Rabun County, Georgia]].  It encourages use of the stories and practical instructions from the local people of [[Appalachia]] to teach and promote a self-sufficient, self-reflective way of life.

Rabun County students, who saw their project revenues increasing as a result of the Foxfire books' best-seller status, also decided to create a museum.  They purchased a tract of land on [[Black Rock Mountain]], in [[Mountain City, Georgia]].  They founded a [[museum]] of [[Appalachian culture]] there.  Students helped move and reconstruct a variety of log homes, a grist mill, and more, to preserve aspects of the traditional Appalachian way of life. The Foxfire Fund headquarters are also located at 200 Foxfire Lane, Mountain City, Georgia.

==Educational philosophy==
In 1989, Eliot Wigginton was awarded a [[MacArthur Foundation]] fellowship for his work with the Foxfire project. Wigginton had developed the Foxfire educational philosophy based on experiential education.&lt;ref name="Foxfire approach"/&gt;

Wigginton originally thought of the student-produced magazine as a way to help his high school freshmen see the relevance of good English skills.  As he and they developed the journals, over several years he began to develop a full teaching approach (a.k.a. the Foxfire approach), which features 11 core principles, related to the philosopher [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] concepts of [[experiential education]]. The Foxfire Fund contributed to such development.&lt;ref name="Foxfire approach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/1999-3/foxfire.htm|title=The Foxfire Approach to Teaching and Learning: John Dewey, Experiential Learning, and the Core Practices. |accessdate=2010-01-23 |last=Starnes |first=Bobby Ann |date=1999-01-00 |work=ERIC Clearinghouse on Rural Education and Small Schools Charleston WV.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "SlideShow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabun.k12.ga.us/foxfire/foxfire.htm |title=Foxfire Classroom |accessdate=2010-01-23 |publisher=Rabun County Schools }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s through the 1980s, the success of Foxfire inspired many United States schools to develop similar programs. By 1998, it had been adopted by 37 school systems.&lt;ref name="UGA"/&gt; The Foxfire Fund started offering teacher training programs to support such efforts.

Foxfire continues to train educators in its [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] methods, which begins with the assertion that students must construct meaning for themselves, rather than memorizing information a teacher deems important.  Foxfire and other constructivist approaches to teaching propose that by constructing their own meaning, establishing relationships, and seeing the connection of what they do in the classroom to "the real world," students are better able to learn.

As a result of changing ideas in education, Rabun County High School has moved the Foxfire magazine/book class from English to the business curriculum.  In addition, students are no longer as involved in operations of the museum as they once were.

The museum is being assisted by the University of Georgia to archive and preserve its extensive materials from more than 30 years of research. In 1998, the [[University of Georgia]] [[anthropology]] department started to work with the Foxfire project. The collection is held at one of the cabins of the museum complex and includes "2,000 hours of interviews on audio tape, 30,000 black and white pictures and hundreds of hours of videotape." By improving how the material is archived and establishing a [[database]], the university believes the materials can be made more easily available for scholars.&lt;ref name="UGA"&gt;[http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/1998/D/199803180.html "University of Georgia To Help Archive, Preserve Thirty Years Of Materials From Foxfire Project"], University of Georgia Archives, 1998, accessed 12 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==
The books cover a wide range of topics, many to do with crafts, tools, music and other aspects of traditional life skills and culture in Appalachia. These include making [[apple butter]], [[banjo]]s, [[basket weaving]], [[beekeeping]], [[butter]] [[churning (butter)|churning]], [[maize|corn]] shucking, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[faith healing]], [[Appalachian Granny Magic|Appalachian folk magic]], [[violin|fiddle]] making, [[ghost|haints]], [[American ginseng]] cultivation, [[long rifle]] and [[flintlock]] making, [[Tanning (leather)|hide tanning]], hog dressing, [[hunting]] tales, [[log cabin]] building, [[moonshine|moonshining]], [[midwife|midwives]], old-time [[burial]] customs, [[Agricultural astrology|planting "by the signs"]], [[Food preservation|preserving foods]], [[sassafras]] [[tea]], [[snake handling]] and lore, [[soap]] making, [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[square dancing]], [[wagon]] making, [[weaving]], [[wild food]] gathering, [[witch]]es, and [[woodworking|wood carving]].

The '''Gala''' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: {{script|Xsux|𒍑𒆪}} ''gala'', [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''kalû'') were [[priest]]s of the [[Sumerian goddess]] [[Inanna]], significant numbers of the personnel of both temples and palaces, the central institutions of [[Mesopotamia]]n city states, individuals with neither male nor female gender identities.

Originally a specialist in singing [[lament]]ations, gala appear in temple records dating back from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann 1960:129–46; Gelb 1975; Renger 1969:187–95; Krecher 1966:27–42; Henshaw 1994:84–96&lt;/ref&gt; According to an old Babylonian text, [[Enki]] created the gala specifically to sing "heart-soothing laments" for the goddess Inanna.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1982a:2&lt;/ref&gt; Cuneiform references indicate the gendered character of the role.&lt;ref&gt;Gelb 1975:73; Lambert 1992:150–51&lt;/ref&gt; Lamentation and wailing originally may have been female professions, so that men who entered the role adopted its forms. Their hymns were sung in a Sumerian dialect known as ''[[emesal|eme-sal]]'', normally used to render the speech of female gods,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann 1960:138; Krecher 1966; Cohen 1974:11, 32&lt;/ref&gt; and some gala took female names.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro and Petschow 1975:465&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual proclivities are clearly implied by the Sumerian proverb that reads, "When the gala wiped off his anus [he said], ‘I must not arouse that which belongs to my mistress [i.e., Inanna]’ ".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1959, no. 2.100&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the word ''gala'' was written using the sign sequence UŠ.KU, the first sign having also the reading giš&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ("penis"), and the second one dur&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ("anus"), so perhaps there is some pun involved.&lt;ref&gt;Steinkeller 1992:37&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gala is homophonous with gal&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-la "vulva". However, in spite of all their references of their effeminate character (especially in the [[Sumerian religion#Parallels|Sumerian proverbs]]), many administrative texts mention gala priests who had children, wives, and large families.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 2001:270; Michalowski 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some gala priests were actually women.&lt;ref&gt;al-Rawi 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[marquess]] '''Giacomo Arditi''' of Castelvetere ([[Presicce]], March 21, 1815 – July 1891) was an [[Italians|Italian]] historian, economist and writer, nephew of the archaeologist [[Michele Arditi]].

Giacomo Arditi is best known for his work ''La Corografia fisica et storica della provincia di Terra d'Otranto'', the most ponderous encyclopedic work that has ever succeeded to provide a complete portrait of the province of [[Salento]], the [[unification of Italy]], and the proclamation of Rome as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Arditi was the member of numerous academies, member of the Archaeological Commission of the province of [[Lecce]], being royal inspector of antiquities and monuments, President of the Provincial Deputation and Vice-intendent of the [[Gallipoli, Apulia|District of Gallipoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personaggi illustri: Giacomo Arditi |url=http://www.comune.presicce.le.it/citta_territorio/personaggi_illustri.php |publisher=Comune di Presicce |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203030708/http://www.comune.presicce.le.it/citta_territorio/personaggi_illustri.php |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gold Star Wives of America''' is a private [[nonprofit organization]] formed before the end of World War II to provide support for the spouses and children of those who lost their lives while serving in the [[Armed Forces of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Gold Star Wives of America |url=http://www.goldstarwives.org/about-wives.htm |publisher=Gold Star Wives of America, Inc. |accessdate=7 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216024706/http://www.goldstarwives.org/about-wives.htm |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first meeting was on April 5, 1945, when four young widows met in Marie Jordan's apartment on West 20th Street in New York City.  One week later, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] died.  Shortly thereafter, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the widow of the Commander-in-Chief, joined the organization.  Mrs. Roosevelt was most helpful in the early days of the organization.  She attended meetings, wrote about the organization in her "[[My Day]]" column, entertained children of Gold Star Wives at a picnic at her home in [[Hyde Park, New York]], served on the first board of directors, and was one of the original 15 signers when the organization was chartered as a non-profit organization in the State of New York in December 1945.  The group holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]] under Public Law 96-497.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=April 2014}}
From the outset, the organization sponsored a variety of activities for the children, and guided them as they formed their own auxiliary of the organization called the [[Gold Star Sons and Daughters]].

Gold Star Wives groups were soon organized in other cities throughout the country, and were chartered as chapters of the Gold Star Wives of America, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regions and Chapters 2012-2013 |url=http://www.goldstarwives.org/regions-chapters.htm |publisher=Gold Star Wives of America, Inc. |accessdate=7 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216024614/http://www.goldstarwives.org/regions-chapters.htm |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Korean War, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq brought in new groups of widows (widowers).  Added to the survivors of service personnel killed in action are thousands who die each year from service connected causes.  Remarried widows are eligible for membership.

Currently there are members, and local chapters, in all parts of the United States.  The country is divided into eight regions.  Region conferences are held in the spring where recommendations originate for presentation to the national convention held each year, usually in July.  In addition, an Appreciation Award Reception is held in Washington, D.C. in late May honoring those who have shown that they have gratefully remembered those who gave their lives in the service of our country, and their survivors.

'''J. F. Normano ''' (also known as John F. Normano, João Frederico Normano; true name: Isaac Ilyich Levin, Russian: Исаак Ильич Левин) (12 July 1887 – 25 April 1945) was a Russian-American economic historian and banker.

==Early life==
Isaac Levin was born in Kiev and grew up in the Russian/Ukrainian Jewish community. He studied at the [[Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University]], where his main teacher was [[Peter Berngardovich Struve]].

== Career ==
Levin began in banking. Politically, he was close to the liberal [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]]. For the newspaper ''Nash Vek'', he wrote a critical article on [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]’s economic thinking.

He left Russia for Finland and moved to “Russian Berlin” in 1921. There, by 1926, he had accumulated sufficient capital to buy a [[private bank]]. Levin’s bank become insolvent in 1929.

After moving to Paris, he left for Brazil, called himself João Frederico Normano (i.e. John Frederic Normano) and claimed to be 40 years old. This double passport-forgery was tailored to help him become a junior scientist at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He became the associate director of the Harvard Bureau of Economic Research in Latin America and published a book that some consider essential to the theory of Brazilian economic development. In December 1932, his real identity was discovered. After the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] rise to power, the “Normano Case” led to foreign political conflict. The [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Office]] demanded his extradition, but the US government was pressured by the Jewish Community. Levin was not forced to leave the United States. He was expelled from Harvard. As of 1941 he focused on lecturing and research with a Pacific emphasis. However, before he could become really influential in this area, he died in April 1945. In the literature of the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] era, he was only briefly mentioned in a systemic ideological classification. In 2010 a book about him was published in Moscow, with reprints of his works.

'''John Davidson McCraw''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MBE|size=85%}} (13 March 1925 – 14 December 2014) was a New Zealand [[Pedology (soil study)|pedologist]], academic, and local historian, particularly of the [[Central Otago]] area. The [[McCraw Glacier]] in Antarctica is named for him.

==Biography==
Born in [[Dunedin]] in 1925,&lt;ref name="Central Stories"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralstories.com/research.html |title=Central Stories research and collections |year=2013 |website= |publisher=Central Stories |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCraw was interested in science from an early age, becoming a member the junior group of the Otago branch of the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] when he was 10 years old.&lt;ref name="NZ Soil News"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=Cam |date=August 2005 |title=John McCraw awarded Companion of the Royal Society of New Zealand (CRSNZ) |url=http://nzsss.science.org.nz/documents/soil_news/August%202005%20Soil%20News.pdf |journal=New Zealand Soil News |publisher=New Zealand Society of Soil Science |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=101–102 |accessdate=10 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113142520/http://nzsss.science.org.nz/documents/soil_news/August%202005%20Soil%20News.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Otago]], from where he graduated with a [[Master of Science]] with second-class honours in geology in 1948.&lt;ref name="NZ Soil News"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shadowsoftime.co.nz/university16.html |title=NZ university graduates 1870–1961: Mc |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCraw then had a 20-year career as a pedologist with the [[Soil Bureau]] of the [[New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]], based first in [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] in Central Otago from 1949 to 1963 and then in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="NZ Soil News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODT 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.odt.co.nz/your-town/alexandra/84799/innovator-039prolonged-life-otago-goldfields039 | title=Innovator 'prolonged life of Otago goldfields' | date=7 December 2009 | work=Otago Daily Times | accessdate=10 January 2015 | first=Lynda | last=van Kempen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scoop"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://community.scoop.co.nz/2011/11/river-fertile-ground-for-former-waikato-academic/ | title=River fertile ground for former Waikato academic | date=23 November 2011 | work=Community Scoop | accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the Soil Bureau's first Antarctic expedition in 1959–60, undertaking soil surveys in the [[Taylor Valley]] and on the [[Ross Sea]] coast.&lt;ref name="Scoop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://livenews.co.nz/2014/04/08/painting-to-commemorate-antarctic-soil-research/ | title=Painting to commemorate Antarctic soil research | date=8 April 2014 | work=LiveNews | accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 McCraw earned a [[Doctor of Science]] degree from [[Victoria University of Wellington]] on the basis of 13 papers on soils in New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://victoria.lconz.ac.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=428867 |title=Papers on soils in New Zealand and Antarctica |date= |website= |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington |accessdate=10 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150115054102/http://victoria.lconz.ac.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=428867 |archivedate=15 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCraw was appointed as the foundation professor in the newly established Department of Earth Sciences at the [[University of Waikato]] in 1970, and served as the university's dean of science between 1975 and 1984.&lt;ref name="NZ Soil News"/&gt; On his retirement from Waikato in 1988, McCraw was granted the title of emeritus professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calendar.waikato.ac.nz/archive/2013/officershonoursstaff/emeritusprofessors.html |title=Emeritus professors |year=2013 |website= |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement, McCraw found the time to devote to researching the history of Central Otago, in which he had become interested during his time at the Soil Bureau in Alexandra.&lt;ref name="ODT 2009"/&gt; He went on to publish about a dozen books on the history of the area and the wider Otago region, and was acknowledged as the leading authority on the Alexandra district.&lt;ref name="Central Stories"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WT 2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/6017451/Ebbs-and-flows-of-rivers-history-recorded | title=Ebbs and flows of river's history recorded | date=23 November 2011 | work=Waikato Times | accessdate=10 January 2015 | first=Annette | last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''The wandering river: landforms and geological history of the Hamilton basin'', published in 2011.&lt;ref name="WT 2011"/&gt;

Throughout his life, McCraw served on a range of community, professional and public committees, organizations and inquiries. In 1957 he was a member of the organizing committee for the inaugural Alexandra Blossom Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.soundarchives.co.nz/search.do?view=detail&amp;page=1&amp;id=146999&amp;db=object |title=In touch with New Zealand |date=24 September 2004 |website= |publisher=Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision |accessdate=10 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110032623/http://collections.soundarchives.co.nz/search.do?view=detail&amp;page=1&amp;id=146999&amp;db=object |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the Waikato branch of the Royal Society of New Zealand between 1965 and 1966 and was a member of the society's geology and quaternary national committees from 1975 to 1982.  In 1968 he chaired the Waikato branch of the Geological Society of New Zealand. He also served on the National Water and Soil Authority from 1976 to 1985, and the [[commission of inquiry]] into the [[1979 Abbotsford landslip|Abbotsford landslip disaster]] between 1979 and 1980. He chaired the government's 1988 Rabbit and Land Management Task Force and the public consultation committee for the Hamilton City Council pollution control scheme from 1994 to 1996.  He was patron of the Waikato Geological and Lapidary Society.&lt;ref name="NZ Soil News"/&gt;

McCraw died in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in 2014 and was buried at Hamilton Park Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://deaths.waikatotimes.co.nz/obituaries/waikato-times-nz/obituary.aspx?pid=173476265 | title=John Davidson McCraw obituary | date=16 December 2014 | work=Waikato Times | accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-services/do-it-online/cemetery-search/Pages/default.aspx?surname=mccraw&amp;forename=john+davidson |title=Cemetery search |date= |website= |publisher=Hamilton City Council |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and honorific eponyms==
In the [[1992 Birthday Honours|1992 Queen's Birthday Honours]], McCraw was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52953 |date=13 June 1992 |page=30 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a Fellow of the New Zealand Society of Soil Science in 1995, and in 2005 he was elected as a Companion of the Royal Society of New Zealand in recognition of his promotion and encouragement of science and technology.&lt;ref name="NZ Soil News"/&gt;  In 2008, he received a special award at the Central Otago Community Awards for his vital role in the preservation of knowledge and understanding of the history of Alexandra and the surrounding districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aworldofdifference.co.nz/2008_award_winners |title=2008 award winners |date= |website= |publisher=Central Otago – a world of difference |accessdate=10 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110032153/http://www.aworldofdifference.co.nz/2008_award_winners |archivedate=10 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.odt.co.nz/the-regions/central-otago/24068/historian-gets-special-award | title=Historian gets special award | date=26 September 2008 | work=Otago Daily Times | accessdate=10 January 2015 | first=Diane | last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, a glacier in the [[Britannia Range (Antarctica)|Britannia Range]] in Antarctica was named [[McCraw Glacier]], in honour of McCraw, by a geological field party from the University of Waikato led by [[Michael Selby]].&lt;ref name="GNIS"&gt;{{cite gnis | type = antarid | id = 9662| name = McCraw Glacier | accessdate = 10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The John McCraw Research Room at the Central Stories Museum and Art Gallery in Alexandra is also named for him.&lt;ref name="Central Stories"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kōan'''|康安|}} was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) of the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Court]] during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after ''[[Enbun]]'' and before ''[[Jōji]]''. This period spanned the years from March 1361 through September  1362.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kōan''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA535&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 535;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor in Kyoto was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Kōgon|Go-Kōgon]]''-tennō''|後光厳天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP302&amp;dq= ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 302-305;] Nussbaum, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Go-Kōgon's [[Southern Court]] rival in Yoshino during this time-frame was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Murakami|Go-Murakami]]''-tennō''|後村上天皇}}

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[File:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]  
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Re4djF3oaTMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA199&amp;dq=1911+texbook+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology'', p. 199 n57], citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1361''', also called {{nihongo|''Kōan gannen''|康安元年}}: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Embun'' 6.

In this time frame, [[Shōhei]] (1346–1370) was a Southern Court equivalent ''nengō,''

==Events of the Kōan era==
* '''1361''' (''Kōan 1, 6th month''): Snowfall was unusually heavy; and there was also a disastrous fire in Kyoto as well as a violent earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1361''' (''Kōan 1''): [[Eigen-ji]], a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] temple located in modern-day [[Shiga prefecture]], was founded [[Sasaki Ujiyori]]; and its first Abbot was [[Jakushitsu Genko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/head_temples/09eigen.html Eigen-ji], [http://zen.rinnou.net/head_temples/index.html  Joint Council for Japanese Rinzai and Obaku Zen, "head temples;"] Dumoulin, Heinrich. (2005). ''Zen Buddhism: A History'', p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1362''' (''Kōan 2''): [[Hosokawa Kiyouji]] and [[Kusunoki Masanori]] attack Kyoto, [[Ashikaga Yoshiakira]] flees, but regains the capital in twenty days.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Joyce. (1982) ''Lessons from History: The Tokushi Yoron'', p.329.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life of Sethos, Taken from Private Memoirs of the Ancient Egyptians''''' ({{lang-fr|Séthos, histoire, ou Vie tirée des monumens, anecdotes de l'ancienne Égypte, traduite d'un manuscrit grec}}) is an influential [[fantasy novel]] originally published in six volumes at Paris in 1731 by the French ''[[abbé]]'' [[Jean Terrasson]]. An English translation by [[Thomas Lediard]] published at London by J. Walthoe appeared in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lediard, Thomas|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to classicist [[Mary Lefkowitz]], Sethos:
{{quotation|''purports to be a translation of an ancient manuscript found in the library of an unnamed foreign nation that is "extremely jealous of this sort of treasure." The author is said to have been an anonymous Greek in the second century A.D. Here Terrasson is following the conventions of ancient writers of historical fictions, such as the author of the Hermetica, who pretend that their works are translations of ancient writings that no one but themselves has seen. But Terrasson is careful not to deceive his readers completely: he assures them that the work he has "translated" for them is a fiction; .... He assures them that although fictional, the story keeps close to ancient sources, which, for the reader's convenience, he cites throughout the text. But he also says that "it is natural to suppose" that his author had access to original sources (now lost), such as memoirs available in the sacred archives of Egypt, written by unknown priests who accompanied Sethos on his travels. The sophisticated reader would be amused by the notion that the anonymous author had consulted these otherwise unknown documents, but Terrasson gives no warning to less well-educated readers that there is in fact no reason to "suppose" that these documents ever existed.''&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, Mary, ''Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrist Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History,'' New York, BasicBooks, 1996, pp. 111-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This eighteenth century work of fiction is a primary source of [[Afrocentrism]] and of the kind of black history found in such popular books as [[Martin Bernal]]'s ''[[Black Athena|Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers (eds.), ''Black Athena Revisited'', UNC Press Books, 1996, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s ''Stolen Legacy: Greek Philosophy Is Stolen Egyptian Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984143,00.html?iid=digg_share BOOKS ATTACKING AFROCENTRISM], [[John Elson]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Feb. 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a key source of a popular web of conspiracy theories positing a secret pagan subculture of [[Freemasons]], devotees of Satan, and environmentalists dedicated to the overthrow of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/3122/ Great Awful Books], Charles Paul Freund,  Oct. 17, 1996, Slate&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (book II, chapter 141) writes of a [[High Priest of Ptah]] named Sethos ({{lang-grc-gre|Σεθῶν}} ''Sethon'') who became pharaoh and defeated the Assyrians with divine intervention. This name is probably a corruption of [[Shebitku]] (or Shabataka), the actual pharaoh at the time, who was a [[Kushite]] of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Strassler (ed.), ''The Landmark Herodotus: The Histories'' (Anchor, 2007), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd, Commentary on Book II, in ''A Commentary on Herodotus, Books I–IV'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus:
{{quotation|''After him there came to the throne the priest of [[Hephaistos]], whose name was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also took from them the yokes of corn-land 125 which had been given to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple 126 and bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians; for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came, there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields, so that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of arms great numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by letters inscribed he says these words: "Let him who looks upon me learn to fear the gods".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2707/2707-8.txt ''The Histories of Herodotus], II:141 (Euterpe) by Herodotus (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

'''Lindsey Davis''' (born 1949) is an English [[historical novel]]ist, best known as the author of the [[Marcus Didius Falco|Falco]] series of [[historical mystery|historical crime stories]] set in [[ancient Rome]] and its empire.

==Biography==
Davis was born in [[Birmingham]] and after taking a degree in [[English literature]] at [[Oxford University]] ([[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford - Prominent Alumni|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she became a [[Civil service|civil servant]]. She left the civil service after 13 years, and when a [[romantic novel]] she had written was runner up for the 1985 ''[[Georgette Heyer]] Historical Novel Prize'', she decided to become a writer, writing at first romantic serials for the UK women's magazine ''[[Woman's Realm]]''.

Her dedication of the book ''[[Rebels and Traitors]]'' (2009) reads:  "For Richard / dearest and closest of friends / your favourite book / in memory", and the author's website relates: "I am still getting used to life without my dear Richard. For those of you who haven't seen this before, he died in October [2008]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |title=Lindsey's page |work=The Official Lindsey Davis Website |accessdate=2009-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429084212/http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author says in her publisher's newsletter: "The greatest recommendation I can
give is that Richard, its first reader, thought it wonderful. He devoured chunks, demanding ‘Bring
more story!’ even when he was in hospital. One of the last things I was ever able to tell him was that ''Rebels and Traitors'' was to be published by Random House, so I would be working with dear friends for his favourite book."&lt;ref name=news09&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/lindsey_davis/issue9/Lindsey%20Newsletter.pdf|title=The Lindsey Davis Newsletter, no. 9|date=January 2009|work=Random House Publishing|accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis suffered from the eye condition [[keratoconus]] from childhood, and in adulthood had a [[Corneal transplantation|corneal transplant]], about which she has said: "A stranger's generosity freed me from years of pain and anxiety", and urges her readers to carry a [[donor card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Lindsey|title=Five-minute memoir: Lindsey Davis on life with her brand new eye|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/fiveminute-memoir-lindsey-davis-on-life-with-her-brand-new-eye-7618940.html|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindsey's Page: Organ Donor Card Appeal |url=http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |publisher=The Official Website of Lindsey Davis |accessdate=17 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911103325/http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Davis's interest in [[history]] and [[archaeology]] led to her writing an historical novel about [[Vespasian]] and his lover [[Antonia Caenis]] (''[[The Course of Honour]]''), for which she could not find a publisher. She tried again, and her first novel featuring the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] "[[detective]]", [[Marcus Didius Falco]], ''The Silver Pigs'' (1989), set in the same time period, was the start of her runaway success as a writer of [[historical whodunnit]]s.  A further 19 Falco novels have followed, as well as ''The Course of Honour'', which was finally published in 1997. ''[[Rebels and Traitors]]'', set in the period of the [[English Civil War]], was published in September 2009, and ''[[Falco: The Official Companion]]'' in June 2010. ''[[Master and God]]'', published in March 2012, is set in ancient Rome and concerning the emperor [[Domitian]].
In 2012, Davis and her publishers, [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] in the UK and [[St. Martin's Press]] in the US, announced that she was writing a new series of books centred on [[Marcus Didius Falco#Flavia Albia|Flavia Albia]], Falco's British-born adopted daughter and "an established female investigator". The first title, ''[[The Ides of April]]'' was published on 11 April 2013 in the UK,&lt;ref name=flavia&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindsey's page: Next Book |url=http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |publisher=The Official Website of Lindsey Davis |accessdate=17 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911103325/http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df= }} ''(Copy of publishers' press release)''&lt;/ref&gt; and its sequel, ''[[Enemies at Home]]'', was published in 2014.&lt;ref name=ld-enemies&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/publications/enemies-at-home/|title = Enemies at Home|website = Lindsey Davis official website|accessdate = 1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis has won many literary awards, and was honorary president of the [[Classical Association]] from 1997 to 1998.

== Confucianism ==
The grave of [[Confucius]], founder of [[Confucianism]], is in his hometown of [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]] Province, [[China]]. The grave of Confucius is located in a large cemetery where more than 100,000 of his descendants are also buried.

== Islam ==
According to early Muslim sources, [[Muhammad]] is buried in the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] ("Mosque of the Prophet") in the city of [[Medina]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The tomb of Muhammad lies within the confines of what used to be his wife [[Aisha]]'s and his house. During his lifetime it adjoined the mosque, which was expanded during the reign of Caliph [[al-Walid I]] to include his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Judaism ==
The exact location of the grave of [[Moses]] is unknown, but according to [[Deuteronomy]] 34:6 it is on or near [[Mount Nebo]] just east of the [[Jordan river]], now in the kingdom of [[Jordan]].

The [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] is located in the ancient city of [[Hebron]] (which lies in the southwest part of the [[West Bank]], in the heart of ancient [[Judea]]), and is generally considered by [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s to be its spiritual center. Jewish, Christian, and Islamic tradition holds that the compound encloses the burial place of four Biblical couples: [[Adam and Eve]]; [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]]; [[Isaac]] and [[Rebekah]]; [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]]. According to [[Midrash]]ic sources, it also contains the head of [[Esau]], the brother of [[Jacob]].

== Sikhism ==
[[Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartar Pur|Gurdwara Kartarpur]] (meaning "The Abode of God") was established by [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of Sikhism in 1522. When Guru Nanak died in 1539, [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] disagreed on how to perform his last rites. A ''[[samadhi]]'' (according to Hindu tradition) lies in the ''[[gurdwara]]'' and a [[grave]] (according to Muslim traditions) lies on the premises as a reminder of this discord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gurdwara'' is located in a small village named Kartarpur on the West bank of the [[Ravi River]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].

When it became clear that the death of Guru Nanak was near, a dispute arose among his followers. His Hindu followers wanted to cremate the remains while his Muslim followers wanted to bury the body following Islamic tradition. Nanak brokered a compromise by suggesting that each group should place a garland of flowers beside his body, and those whose garland remained unwilted after three days could dispose of his body according to their tradition. However, the next morning, upon raising the cloth under which the Guru’s body lay, only the flowers shared between his followers were found. The Hindus cremated their flowers whereas the Muslims buried theirs. The Guru had departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''gurdwara'' at Kartarpur can be seen from another ''gurdwara'' located across the border at the historical town of [[Dera Baba Nanak]] in [[India]], another important preaching centre of the Guru. Both sites are one of the most significant places in Sikhism located along Indo-Pak border. Recently, there has been lobbying to open a corridor for Sikhs from India to visit the shrine without any hindrance or visa. It lies only 2&amp;nbsp;km from the international border.

== Taoism ==
[[Taoism]] was founded by [[Laozi]], the author of the [[Tao Te Ching]]. According to Taoist legend, Laozi transmitted the ''Tao Te Ching'' at the request of a border guard before departing from China (i.e. from known civilization). He is believed to have lived out the rest of his days in communion with Nature, and some Taoist traditions hold that he achieved immortality. Whether he underwent death or not is not made clear by all parts of the tradition, and if he did, it was in some remote area, far from civilization at that time.

== Tenrikyo ==
[[Tenrikyo]] considers the Foundress's Sanctuary in [[Tenri, Nara]], Japan to be the site where [[Nakayama Miki|their faith's founder]] "lives and works";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/en/teaching/teachings/f_sanc.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014408/http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/en/teaching/teachings/f_sanc.html |date=July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she died in 1887.

== Zoroastrianism ==
[[Zoroastrianism]] was founded by [[Zoroaster]]. There is no consensus as to where Zoroaster lived, much less where he died or what became of his remains. Most believe that he died in [[Balkh]] while he was praying. When he died, his entire body became a flame, as [[Atar|fire in Zoroastrianism]] is very important.

      <comment>/* A Mosaic of Theatrical Forms */ -- removed link to Terence McNally's play, which is not exactly relevant in the context of this article</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6189">This article focuses on the technical term ''liturgical drama''; for general aspects of medieval performance, see the article on [[Medieval theatre]].

==A Mosaic of Theatrical Forms==
Premodern performance took place on a flowing border between more or less institutionalized forms; [[rite|rites]] and plays existed among other public ceremonies such as royal publicity, religious penance, or legal punishment. It is therefore necessary to speak of a [[mosaic]] of medieval theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Ann Cremona, Theatrical Events. Borders, Dynamics, Frames (Amsterdam 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 10th Century, Easter liturgies have contained early forms of performance and role play. Some are short text passages, others are quite long and developed. In the 15th and 16th Centuries, [[Passion Plays]] and Corpus Christi plays grew into highly developed performances, which in some localities existed until the 17th Century. 

The premodern combination of liturgy, ritual and performance makes it especially difficult to apply the term "[[Drama]]". It is not always possible to unterstand the relationship between written text, staging and performance. The texts themselves are often part of a liturgical rite, making it difficult to locate a beginning or an end of the play within the liturgical or paraliturgical context.   

The ''[[Quem Quaeritis?]]'' ("Whom do you seek?" ) segment of the Easter liturgy was an exchange of one question, one answer, and one command between the Angels at Christ's tomb and the three Marys (Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the sister of Lazarus). Yet the concept of drama cannot adequately be used to describe the Quem Queritis, since drama as a concept is not found in the medieval sources themselves; using the term drama opens up a vast field of anachronistic misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Holger Petersen, The Representational Liturgy of the Regularis Concordi, in: The white mantle of churches, ed. Nigel Hiscock (International medieval research 10, Turnhout 2003), pp. 107-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easter Plays were the core of medieval performance within the liturgy, but there were additional forms such as [[Saint's play|saints' plays]], [[Miracle Plays|miracle stories]], [[Legend|legends]], and [[Apocalypse (disambiguation)|apocalyptic plays]]. The largest part of plot material is taken from the Bible or Christian legend. 

Contrary to earlier theories tracing the development of European theatre from the Catholic liturgy, there is no logical or chronological development in the various play texts from the Middle Ages; the scope of the text, its complexity, and its dramatic structure of the many sources known today &lt;ref&gt;Clifford Flanigan, Liturgical Drama and Its Tradition: A Review of Scholarship 1965–1975, in: Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama 18 (1975) 81–102 und 19 (1976) 109–136.&lt;/ref&gt; do not develop in a systematic manner. Another widespread misunderstanding of medieval performance forgets that music always played an important part in liturgical rites and plays.

==Forms of Performance==
The rites in Latin were always performed in a church, in the context of a liturgical ceremony. Since they are so strongly integrated into the liturgy ([[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] or [[Liturgy of the Hours]]), it is questionable whether or not they count as performance. Latin-language plays were also performed in churches without a liturgical context. Vernacular plays were most often performed in public spaces outside of the church, usually on mansion stages on the public square. Stage sets representing heaven, hell, [[Pontius Pilate]]'s house or the [[Holy Sepulcher]] were erected on the stages. 

To speak of [[Actor|actors]] is only pertinent to the plays; in the church, the rites were performed by clerics and monks who did not consider themselves to be acting in any amateur or professional sense. A director of sorts arbitrated between the stage and the audience; he commented upon the scene, narrated passages and kept order. 

While most performances were limited to a few hours, some plays could reach monumental proportions: The Passion-Play of [[Bolzano]] took seven days in 1514, and the one staged at [[Valenciennes]] in 1547, a total of 25.  

==Social Context==
While liturgical rites are a constant in Christian life, plays are not. There are passages of European history in which plays are all but unknown. The medieval city was a performance-friendly culture. Clerics and trade [[Fraternity|fraternities]] encouraged stage performance in the church and outside of it. Amateur actors were recruited among the ranks of schoolboys and trade apprentices. Topics performed were predominantly taken from Christian sources, yet comic and contemporary topics were omnipresent in almost all performance, in a more or less discreet manner. Improvisation was a crowd-pleaser. 

Since Christian liturgy is the re-enactment of crucial moments in Christ's life, it comes as no surprise that medieval performance blurs the distinction between reality and the fiction being presented to the audience. Antisemitic violence could occur after the crowds had witnessed a Passion-Play; sometimes members of the audience would interrupt the performance by jumping into the scene in order to "save" the suffering Christ.&lt;ref&gt;John Harris, Medieval Theatre in Context: An Introduction (Routledge 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mesopotamia'''  is a [[historical region]] in [[Western Asia]] situated within the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system]], in modern days roughly corresponding to most of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], parts of Northern [[Saudi Arabia]], the eastern parts of [[Syria]], Southeastern [[Turkey]], and regions along the [[Syria–Turkey border|Turkish–Syrian]] and [[Iran–Iraq border]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery.shtml|title=Ancient History in depth: Mesopotamia|publisher=BBC History|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sumer]]ians and [[Akkadians]] (including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of [[recorded history|written history]] (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. It fell to [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]].

Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]]. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control. In AD 226, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians. The division of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from AD 395) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] from Byzantines. A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], and [[Hatra]].

Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the [[Neolithic Revolution]] from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the [[wheel]], the planting of the first cereal [[crop]]s and the development of [[cursive]] script, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[agriculture]]".&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html|title=Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate?|last=Milton-Edwards|first=Beverley|date=May 2003|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Tigr-euph.png|thumb|Map showing the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system]], which surrounds Mesopotamia]]
The regional toponym ''Mesopotamia'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|s|ə|p|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|i|ə}}, {{lang-grc|Μεσοποταμία}} "[land] between rivers"; {{lang-ar|بلاد الرافدين، بین النهرین}} ''bilād ar-rāfidayn''; {{lang-ku|میزۆپۆتامیا}}; {{lang-fa|میان‌رودان}} ''miyān rudān''; {{lang-syr|ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ}} ''[[Beth Nahrain]]'' "land of rivers")  comes from the [[ancient Greek]] root words μέσος (''meso'') "middle" and ποταμός (''potamos'') "river" and translates to  "(Land) between two/the rivers". It is used throughout the Greek [[Septuagint]] (c. 250 BC) to translate the Hebrew and Aramaic equivalent ''Naharaim''. An even earlier Greek usage of the name ''Mesopotamia'' is evident from ''[[The Anabasis of Alexander]]'', which was written in the late 2nd century AD, but specifically refers to sources from the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. In the ''Anabasis'', Mesopotamia was used to designate the land east of the [[Euphrates]] in north [[Syria]].

The [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] term ''biritum/birit narim'' corresponded to a similar geographical concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Finkelstein |first1=J.J. |year=1962 |title=Mesopotamia |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=73–92 |jstor=543884 |doi=10.1086/371676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the [[Tigris]], thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of [[Iraq]] and southeastern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=fosterpolingerfoster&gt;{{citation |title=Civilizations of ancient Iraq |last1=Foster |first1=Benjamin R. |last2=Polinger Foster |first2=Karen |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0691137223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring steppes to the west of the Euphrates and the western part of the [[Zagros Mountains]] are also often included under the wider term Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=canard&gt;{{citation |last1=Canard |first1=M. |editor1-first=P. |editor1-last=Bearman |editor2-first=Th. |editor2-last=Bianquis |editor3-first=C.E. |editor3-last=Bosworth |editor4-first=E. |editor4-last=van Donzel |editor5-first=W.P. |editor5-last=Heinrichs |editor3-link=Clifford Edmund Bosworth |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition |year=2011 |publisher=Brill Online |location=Leiden |chapter=al-ḎJazīra, Ḏjazīrat Aḳūr or Iḳlīm Aḳūr |oclc=624382576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilkinson2000&gt;{{citation |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Tony J. |year=2000 |title=Regional approaches to Mesopotamian archaeology: the contribution of archaeological surveys |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=219–267 |issn=1573-7756 |doi=10.1023/A:1009487620969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=matthews2003&gt;{{citation |last=Matthews |first=Roger |title=The archaeology of Mesopotamia.

==Geography==
{{Main article|Geography of Mesopotamia}}
[[File:Spread of Oecumene Mesopotamia.jpg|thumb|Known world of the Mesopotamian, Babylonian, and Assyrian cultures from documentary sources]]
Mesopotamia encompasses the land between the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers, both of which have their headwaters in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. Both rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region. Overland routes in Mesopotamia usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult. The climate of the region is semi-arid with a vast desert expanse in the north which gives way to a {{convert|15000|km2|sqmi}} region of marshes, lagoons, mud flats, and reed banks in the south. In the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into the [[Persian Gulf]].

The arid environment which ranges from the northern areas of rain-fed agriculture to the south where irrigation of agriculture is essential if a surplus [[energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) is to be obtained. This irrigation is aided by a high water table and by melting snows from the high peaks of the northern [[Zagros Mountains]] and from the Armenian Highlands, the source of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that give the region its name. The usefulness of irrigation depends upon the ability to mobilize sufficient labor for the construction and maintenance of canals, and this, from the earliest period, has assisted the development of urban settlements and centralized systems of political authority.

Agriculture throughout the region has been supplemented by nomadic pastoralism, where tent-dwelling nomads herded sheep and goats (and later camels) from the river pastures in the dry summer months, out into seasonal grazing lands on the desert fringe in the wet winter season. The area is generally lacking in building stone, precious metals and timber, and so historically has relied upon long-distance trade of agricultural products to secure these items from outlying areas. In the marshlands to the south of the area, a complex water-borne fishing culture has existed since prehistoric times, and has added to the cultural mix.

Periodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons. The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur. Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems. Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city states has meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, William R. (2004) "Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns, and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation" (Vol 3, Journal of World Systems Research)&lt;/ref&gt; These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.

==History==
[[File:Statue Gudea Met 59.2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|One of 18 [[Statues of Gudea]], a ruler around 2090 BC]]
{{Main article|History of Mesopotamia}}
{{Further information|History of Iraq|History of the Middle East|Chronology of the ancient Near East}}

The pre-history of the [[Ancient Near East]] begins in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period. Therein, writing emerged with a pictographic script in the Uruk IV period (c. 4th millennium BC), and the documented record of actual historical events — and the ancient history of lower Mesopotamia — commenced in the mid-third millennium BC with cuneiform records of early dynastic kings. This entire prehistory ends with either the arrival of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the late 6th century BC, or with the Muslim conquest and the establishment of the [[Caliphate]] in the late 7th century AD, from which point the region came to be known as [[History of Iraq|Iraq]]. In the long span of this period, Mesopotamia housed some of the world's most ancient highly-developed and socially complex states.

The region was one of the [[River valley civilization|four riverine civilizations]] where [[writing]] was invented, along with the [[Nile]] valley in [[Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]]. Mesopotamia housed historically important cities such as [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]], [[Nineveh]], [[Assur]] and [[Babylon]], as well as major territorial states such as the city of [[Eridu]], the Akkadian kingdoms, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and the various [[Assyria]]n empires. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were [[Ur-Nammu]] (king of Ur), [[Sargon of Akkad]] (who established the Akkadian Empire), [[Hammurabi]] (who established the Old Babylonian state), [[Ashur-uballit II]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (who established the Assyrian Empire).

Scientists analysed [[DNA]] from the 8,000-year-old remains of early farmers found at an ancient graveyard in [[Germany]]. They compared the genetic signatures to those of modern populations and found similarities with the DNA of people living in today's [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11729813|title=Migrants from the Near East 'brought farming to Europe'|accessdate=2010-12-10|publisher=BBC|date=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and writing==
[[File:Nimrud ivory lion eating a man.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Square, yellow plaque showing a lion biting in the neck of a man lying on his back|One of the [[Nimrud ivories]] shows a [[Mesopotamian lion|lion]] eating a man. Neo-Assyrian period, 9th to 7th centuries BC.]]
The earliest language written in Mesopotamia was [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[language isolate]]. Along with Sumerian, [[Semitic languages]] were also spoken in early Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery_03.shtml|title= Ancient History in depth: Mesopotamia|publisher = BBC History|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subartu]]an&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, J.J. (1955), "Subartu and Subarian in Old Babylonian Sources", (Journal of Cuneiform Studies Vol 9, No. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; a language of the Zagros, perhaps related to the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartuan language family]] is attested in personal names, rivers and mountains and in various crafts. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] came to be the dominant language during the [[Akkadian Empire]] and the [[Assyria]]n empires, but Sumerian was retained for administrative, religious, literary and scientific purposes. Different varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] period. [[Old Aramaic language|Old Aramaic]], which had already become common in Mesopotamia, then became the official provincial administration language of first the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], and then the [[Achaemenid Empire]]: the official [[variety (linguistics)|lect]] is called [[Imperial Aramaic]]. Akkadian fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in temples for some centuries. The last Akkadian texts date from the late 1st century AD.

Early in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BC) [[cuneiform]] was invented for the Sumerian language. Cuneiform literally means "wedge-shaped", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay. The standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from [[pictogram]]s. The earliest texts (7 archaic tablets) come from the [[É (temple)|É]], a temple dedicated to the goddess Inanna at Uruk, from a building labeled as Temple C by its excavators.

The early [[logogram|logographic]] system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus, only a limited number of individuals were hired as [[scribe]]s to be trained in its use. It was not until the widespread use of a [[syllabary|syllabic]] script was adopted under Sargon's rule{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} that significant portions of Mesopotamian population became literate. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated.

During the third millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerian and the Akkadian language users, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{Citation|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0199532223|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a [[sprachbund]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name="woods"&gt;Woods C. 2006 “Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian”. In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91–120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

===Literature===
{{Main article|Akkadian literature}}
Libraries were extant in towns and temples during the Babylonian Empire. An old Sumerian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn." Women as well as men learned to read and write,&lt;ref&gt;Tatlow, Elisabeth Meier [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=women+men+literate+babylonia&amp;as_brr=3#PPA75,M1 ''Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: The ancient Near East''] Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. (31 March 2005) {{ISBN|978-0826416285}} p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and for the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary.

A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Sumer. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists were drawn up.

Many Babylonian literary works are still studied today. One of the most famous of these was the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain [[Sîn-lēqi-unninni]], and arranged upon an astronomical principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of [[Gilgamesh]]. The whole story is a composite product, although it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure.

==Science and technology==

===Mathematics===
{{Main article|Babylonian mathematics}}
Mesopotamian mathematics and science was based on a [[sexagesimal]] (base 60) [[numeral system]]. This is the source of the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day, and the 360-[[degree (angle)|degree]] circle. The [[Sumerian calendar]] was based on the seven-day week. This form of mathematics was instrumental in early [[History of cartography|map-making]]. The Babylonians also had theorems on how to measure the area of several shapes and solids. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if &lt;span style="font-family:symbol;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; were fixed at 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the area of the base and the height; however, the volume of the [[frustum]] of a cone or a [[square pyramid]] was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used &lt;span style="font-family:symbol;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; as 25/8 (3.125 instead of 3.14159~). The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven modern miles (11&amp;nbsp;km). This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard [https://books.google.com/books?id=LIsuAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Eves+An+introduction+to+the+history+of+mathematics&amp;q=time-mile&amp;pgis=1#search ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics''] Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1969 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
{{Main article|Babylonian astronomy}}
From [[Sumer]]ian times, temple priesthoods had attempted to associate current events with certain positions of the planets and stars. This continued to Assyrian times, when [[Limmu]] lists were created as a year by year association of events with planetary positions, which, when they have survived to the present day, allow accurate associations of relative with absolute dating for establishing the history of Mesopotamia.

The Babylonian astronomers were very adept at mathematics and could predict [[Eclipse cycle|eclipses]] and [[Solstice#Solstice determination|solstices]]. Scholars thought that everything had some purpose in astronomy. Most of these related to religion and omens. Mesopotamian astronomers worked out a 12-month calendar based on the cycles of the moon. They divided the year into two seasons: summer and winter. The origins of astronomy as well as astrology date from this time.

During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy. They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early [[universe]] and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the [[philosophy of science]] and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;D. Brown (2000), ''Mesopotamian Planetary Astronomy-Astrology'', Styx Publications, {{ISBN|9056930362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.

In [[Seleucid]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times, the astronomical reports were thoroughly scientific; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain. The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the [[Assyrian astronomy|history of astronomy]].

The only Greek-Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of planetary motion was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. 190 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto E. Neugebauer]] (1945). "The History of Ancient Astronomy Problems and Methods", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''4''' (1), p. 1–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]] (1955). "Chaldaean Astronomy of the Last Three Centuries B.C.", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''75''' (3), p. 166–173 [169].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William P.D. Wightman (1951, 1953), ''The Growth of Scientific Ideas'', Yale University Press p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus is known from the writings of [[Plutarch]]. He supported Aristarchus of Samos' heliocentric theory where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotated]] around its own axis which in turn revolved around the [[Sun]]. According to [[Plutarch]], Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used (except that he correctly theorized on tides as a result of Moon's attraction).

Babylonian astronomy served as the basis for much of [[Ancient Greek astronomy|Greek]], [[Indian astronomy|classical Indian]], Sassanian, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Syria]]n, [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic]], [[Central Asia]]n, and [[Western Europe]]an astronomy.&lt;ref name=dp1998&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pingree|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The oldest Babylonian texts on [[medicine]] date back to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period in the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]]. The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by the ''ummânū'', or chief scholar, [[Esagil-kin-apli]] of [[Borsippa]],&lt;ref name=Stol-99/&gt; during the reign of the Babylonian king [[Adad-apla-iddina]] (1069-1046 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 55, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|9072371631}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with contemporary [[ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian medicine]], the Babylonians introduced the concepts of [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], [[physical examination]], and [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]]. In addition, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' introduced the methods of [[therapy]] and [[aetiology]] and the use of [[empiricism]], [[logic]], and [[rationality]] in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical [[symptom]]s and often detailed empirical [[observation]]s along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a [[patient]] with its diagnosis and prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;H.F.J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', pp. 97–98, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|9004136665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as [[bandage]]s, [[cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]] and [[pill (pharmacy)|pills]]. If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on [[exorcism]] to cleanse the patient from any [[curse]]s. Esagil-kin-apli's ''Diagnostic Handbook'' was based on a logical set of [[axiom]]s and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and [[inspection]] of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's [[disease]], its aetiology, its future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery.&lt;ref name=Stol-99&gt;H.F.J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 99, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|9004136665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Esagil-kin-apli discovered a variety of [[illness]]es and diseases and described their symptoms in his ''Diagnostic Handbook''. These include the symptoms for many varieties of [[epilepsy]] and related [[ailment]]s along with their diagnosis and prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 5, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|9072371631}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Mesopotamian people invented many technologies including metal and copper-working, glass and lamp making, textile weaving, flood control, water storage, and irrigation. They were also one of the first [[Bronze Age]] societies in the world. They developed from copper, bronze, and gold on to iron. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for armor as well as for different weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]].

According to a recent hypothesis, the [[Archimedes' screw]] may have been used by Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and [[Nineveh]] in the 7th century BC, although mainstream scholarship holds it to be a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] invention of later times.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003). "Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World", ''Technology and Culture'' '''44''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the Parthian or Sasanian periods, the [[Baghdad Battery]], which may have been the world's first battery, was created in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4450052.stm |last=Twist |first=Jo |title=Open media to connect communities |publisher=BBC News |date=20 November 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2007|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and philosophy==
{{Main article|Ancient Mesopotamian religion}}
[[File:Lilith Periodo de Isin Larsa y Babilonia.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The [[Burney Relief]], [[First Babylonian Dynasty]], around 1800 BC]]
[[Ancient Mesopotamian religion]] was the first recorded. Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat disc,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, [[heaven]]. They also believed that water was everywhere, the top, bottom and sides, and that the [[universe]] was born from this enormous sea. In addition, Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]]. Although the [[belief]]s described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations. The Sumerian word for universe is '''an-ki''', which refers to the god [[Anu|An]] and the goddess [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;!--stating that the word "an-ki" for "[[universe]]" derives from the two god words for [[Anu]] and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] is debatable. There was also a god called "[[Enki#Confuser of languages]]".--&gt; Their son was Enlil, the air god. They believed that Enlil was the most powerful god. He was the chief god of the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]. The Sumerians also posed philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} They attributed answers to these questions to explanations provided by their gods.

===Philosophy===

The numerous civilizations of the area influenced the [[Abrahamic religions]], especially the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its cultural values and literary influence are especially evident in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bertman|first1=Stephen|title=Handbook to life in ancient Mesopotamia|date=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195183641|page=312|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Buccellati]] believes that the origins of [[philosophy]] can be traced back to early Mesopotamian [[wisdom]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialogue]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]] works, and [[proverb]]s. Babylonian [[reason]] and [[rationality]] developed beyond [[empiricism|empirical]] observation.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), pp. 35–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest form of [[logic]] was developed by the Babylonians, notably in the rigorous [[ergodicity|nonergodic]] nature of their [[social structure|social systems]]. Babylonian thought was [[axiom]]atic and is comparable to the "ordinary logic" described by [[John Maynard Keynes]]. Babylonian thought was also based on an [[Open system (systems theory)|open-systems]] [[ontology]] which is compatible with [[ergodic]] axioms.&lt;ref name=Sheila/&gt; Logic was employed to some extent in [[Babylonian astronomy]] and medicine.

Babylonian thought had a considerable influence on early [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]]. In particular, the Babylonian text ''[[Dialogue of Pessimism]]'' contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the [[Sophist]]s, the [[Heraclitean]] doctrine of [[dialectic]], and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Socratic method]].&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), pp. 35–47 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ionians|Ionian]] philosopher [[Thales]] was influenced by Babylonian cosmological ideas.

===Festivals===
Ancient Mesopotamians had ceremonies each month. The theme of the rituals and festivals for each month was determined by at least six important factors:

# The [[Lunar phase]] (a waxing moon meant abundance and growth, while a waning moon was associated with decline, conservation, and festivals of the Underworld)
# The phase of the annual agricultural cycle
# [[Equinoxes]] and [[solstices]]
# The local mythos and its divine Patrons
# The success of the reigning Monarch
# The [[Akitu]], or [[New Year]] Festival (First full moon after spring equinox)
# Commemoration of specific historical events (founding, military victories, temple holidays, etc.)

Some songs were written for the gods but many were written to describe important events. Although music and songs amused [[Monarch|kings]], they were also enjoyed by ordinary people who liked to sing and dance in their homes or in the [[marketplace]]s. Songs were sung to children who passed them on to their children. Thus songs were passed on through many [[generation]]s as an oral tradition until writing was more universal. These songs provided a means of passing on through the [[century|centuries]] highly important information about historical events.

The [[Oud]] (Arabic:العود) is a small, stringed musical instrument used by the Mesopotamians. The oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the [[Uruk]] period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago. It is on a [[cylinder seal]] currently housed at the British Museum and acquired by Dr. Dominique Collon. The [[image]] depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a boat, playing [[right-handed]]. This instrument appears hundreds of times throughout Mesopotamian history and again in ancient [[Egypt]] from the 18th [[dynasty]] onwards in long- and short-neck varieties. The oud is regarded as a [[wikt:Precursor|precursor]] to the [[Europe]]an [[lute]]. Its name is derived from the Arabic word العود al-‘ūd 'the wood', which is probably the name of the tree from which the oud was made. (The Arabic name, with the definite article, is the source of the word 'lute'.)

===Games===
[[Hunting]] was popular among Assyrian kings. [[Boxing]] and [[wrestling]] feature frequently in art, and some form of [[polo]] was probably popular, with men sitting on the shoulders of other men rather than on horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also played ''majore'', a game similar to the sport [[rugby football|rugby]], but played with a ball made of wood. They also played a board game similar to [[senet]] and [[backgammon]], now known as the "[[Royal Game of Ur]]".

===Family life===

Mesopotamia, as shown by successive law codes, those of [[Urukagina]], [[Lipit Ishtar]] and [[Hammurabi]], across its history became more and more a [[patriarchal society]], one in which the men were far more powerful than the women. For example, during the earliest Sumerian period, the ''"en"'', or high priest of male gods was originally a woman, that of female goddesses, a man.  Thorkild Jacobsen, as well as many others, has suggested that early Mesopotamian society was ruled by a "council of elders" in which men and women were equally represented, but that over time, as the status of women fell, that of men increased. As for schooling, only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals, such as scribes, physicians, temple administrators, went to school. Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Rivkah Harris|title=Gender and Aging in Mesopotamia|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls had to stay home with their mothers to learn [[housekeeping]] and [[cooking]], and to look after the younger children. Some children would help with crushing grain or cleaning birds. Unusually for that time in history, women in Mesopotamia had [[rights]]. They could own [[property]] and, if they had good reason, get a [[divorce]].&lt;ref name=Kramer1963&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=The Univ. of Chicago Press|location=|isbn=978-0226452388|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/sumerians.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

===Burials===
Hundreds of [[grave (burial)|graves]] have been excavated in parts of Mesopotamia, revealing information about Mesopotamian [[burial]] habits. In the city of [[Ur]], most people were buried in family graves under their houses, along with some possessions. A few have been found wrapped in mats and [[carpets]]. Deceased children were put in big "jars" which were placed in the family [[chapel]]. Other remains have been found buried in common city [[graveyard]]s. 17 graves have been found with very precious objects in them. It is assumed that these were royal graves.  Rich of various periods, have been discovered to have sought burial in Bahrein, identified with Sumerian Dilmun.&lt;ref&gt;Bibby, Geoffrey and Phillips, Carl (1996), "Looking for Dilmun" (Interlink Pub Group)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and agriculture==
[[File:Metal production in Ancient Middle East.svg|thumb|Mining areas of the ancient [[West Asia]].

Yellow area stands for [[arsenic bronze]], while grey area stands for tin [[bronze]].]]

Irrigated agriculture spread southwards from the Zagros foothills with the Samara and Hadji Muhammed culture, from about 5,000 BC.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning, 1 Jan 2010 "&gt;{{Citation | url =https://books.google.com/?id=jvsVSqhw-FAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=mesopotamian+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=mesopotamian%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title= The Earth and Its Peoples:  A Global History |author1=Richard Bulliet |author2=Pamela Kyle Crossley |author3=Daniel Headrick |author4=Steven Hirsch |author5=Lyman Johnson |author6=David Northup |publisher=Cengage Learning, 1 Jan 2010 | accessdate =2012-05-30 | isbn =978-0538744386 | date =2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumerian temples functioned as banks and developed the first large-scale [[economy|system of loans and credit]], but the Babylonians developed the earliest system of commercial [[banking]]. It was comparable in some ways to modern [[post-Keynesian economics]], but with a more "anything goes" approach.&lt;ref name=Sheila&gt;Sheila C. Dow (2005), "Axioms and Babylonian thought: a reply", ''Journal of Post Keynesian Economics'' '''27''' (3), pp. 385–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period down to [[Ur III]] temples owned up to one third of the available land, declining over time as royal and other private holdings increased in frequency.  The word [[Ensí|Ensi]] was used to describe the official who organized the work of all facets of temple agriculture. [[Villein]]s are known to have worked most frequently within agriculture, especially in the grounds of temples or palaces.&lt;ref name=" H. W. F. Saggs"&gt;{{Citation | url =https://books.google.com/?id=BPdLxEyHci0C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=agricultural+practice+in+Babylonia#v=onepage&amp;q=agricultural%20practice%20in%20Babylonia&amp;f=false|author=H.W.F.

The geography of southern Mesopotamia is such that agriculture is possible only with irrigation and good drainage, a fact which has had a profound effect on the evolution of early Mesopotamian civilization. The need for irrigation led the Sumerians, and later the Akkadians, to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers. Major cities, such as Ur and Uruk, took root on tributaries of the Euphrates, while others, notably Lagash, were built on branches of the Tigris. The rivers provided the further benefits of fish (used both for food and fertilizer), reeds, and clay (for building materials). With irrigation, the [[food supply]] in Mesopotamia was comparable to the Canadian prairies.&lt;ref&gt;Roux, Georges, (1993) "Ancient Iraq" (Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the [[Fertile Crescent]], which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile. Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for [[crops]], portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable. This is why the development of [[irrigation]] was very important for [[settler]]s of Mesopotamia. Other Mesopotamian [[innovation]]s include the control of water by [[dam]]s and the use of aqueducts. Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden [[plow]]s to soften the [[soil]] before planting crops such as [[barley]], [[onion]]s, [[grape]]s, [[turnip]]s, and [[apple]]s. Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make [[beer]] and [[wine]]. As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian, farmers did not depend on [[slaves]] to complete farm work for them, but there were some exceptions. There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical (i.e. the escape/mutiny of the slave). Although the rivers sustained life, they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities. The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept.  Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils, leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad, further north.

==Government==
The geography of Mesopotamia had a profound impact on the political development of the region. Among the rivers and streams, the Sumerian people built the first cities along with irrigation canals which were separated by vast stretches of open desert or swamp where nomadic tribes roamed. Communication among the isolated cities was difficult and, at times, dangerous. Thus, each Sumerian city became a [[city-state]], independent of the others and protective of its independence. At times one city would try to conquer and unify the region, but such efforts were resisted and failed for centuries. As a result, the political history of Sumer is one of almost constant warfare. Eventually Sumer was unified by [[Eannatum]], but the unification was tenuous and failed to last as the Akkadians conquered Sumeria in 2331 BC only a generation later. The Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings. The empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations.

===Kings===
{{Further information|Sumerian King List|List of kings of Babylon|List of Assyrian kings}}
The Mesopotamians believed their kings and queens were descended from the City of [[God]]s, but, unlike the [[ancient Egyptians]], they never believed their kings were real gods.&lt;ref name="Robert Dalling 2004"&gt;{{Citation|author=Robert Dalling|title=The Story of Us Humans, from Atoms to Today's Civilization|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most kings named themselves “king of the universe” or “great king”. Another common name was “[[shepherd]]”, as kings had to look after their people.

===Power===
When Assyria grew into an empire, it was divided into smaller parts, called [[provinces]]. Each of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, [[Samaria]], [[Damascus]], and [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]]. They all had their own governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes. Governors also had to call up soldiers to war and supply workers when a temple was built. He was also responsible for enforcing the laws. In this way, it was easier to keep control of a large empire. Although Babylon was quite a small [[Sovereign state|state]] in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of [[Hammurabi]]'s rule. He was known as “the law maker”, and soon [[Babylon]] became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia. It was later called Babylonia, which meant "the gateway of the gods." It also became one of history's greatest centers of learning.

===Warfare===
[[File:Stele of Vultures detail 01-transparent.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt3=See caption|Fragment of the [[Stele of the Vultures]] showing marching warriors, Early Dynastic III period, 2600–2350 BC]]
[[File:Raminathicket2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|One of two figures of the ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]'' found in the Royal Cemetery in [[Ur]], 2600–2400 BC]]
With the end of the [[Uruk]] phase, walled cities grew and many isolated [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] villages were abandoned indicating a rise in communal violence.  An early king [[Lugalbanda]] was supposed to have built the white walls around the city.  As [[city-states]] began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over land and canals. These arguments were recorded in tablets several hundreds of years before any major war—the first recording of a war occurred around 3200 BC but was not common until about 2500 BC. An [[Early Dynastic II]] king (Ensi) of Uruk in Sumer, Gilgamesh (c. 2600 BC), was commended for military exploits against [[Humbaba]] guardian of the Cedar Mountain, and was later celebrated in many later poems and songs in which he was claimed to be two-thirds god and only one-third human. The later [[Stele of the Vultures]] at the end of the [[Early Dynastic III]] period  (2600–2350 BC), commemorating the victory of [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]] over the neighbouring rival city of [[Umma]] is the oldest monument in the world that celebrates a massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Irene J. (1985). "After the Battle is Over: The 'Stele of the Vultures' and the Beginning of Historical Narrative in the Art of the Ancient Near East". In Kessler, Herbert L.; Simpson, Marianna Shreve. Pictorial Narrative in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, Symposium Series IV. 16. Washington DC: National Gallery of Art. pp. 11–32. {{ISSN|0091-7338}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point forwards, warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system. At times a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities. This helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states.&lt;ref name="Robert Dalling 2004"/&gt; When empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries. King Sargon, for example, conquered all the cities of Sumer, some cities in Mari, and then went to war with northern Syria. Many Assyrian and Babylonian palace walls were decorated with the pictures of the successful fights and the enemy either desperately escaping or hiding amongst reeds.

===Laws===
{{See also|Mesopotamian marriage law}}
City-states of Mesopotamia created the first law codes, drawn from legal precedence and decisions made by kings.  The codes of [[Urukagina]] and [[Lipit Ishtar]] have been found.  The most renowned of these was that of [[Hammurabi]], as mentioned above, who was posthumously famous for his set of laws, the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (created c. 1780 BC), which is one of the earliest sets of laws found and one of the best preserved examples of this type of document from ancient Mesopotamia. He codified over 200 laws for Mesopotamia.  Examination of the laws show a progressive weakening of the rights of women, and increasing severity in the treatment of slaves&lt;ref&gt;Fensham, F. Charles (19620, "Widow, Orphan, and the Poor in Ancient near Eastern Legal and Wisdom Literature"
(Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 21, No. 2 (Apr., 1962)), pp. 129–139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
{{main article|Art of Mesopotamia}}
[[File:Mesopotamian - Pair of Basket-Shaped Hair Ornaments - Walters 572064, 572065.jpg|thumb|"Pair of Basket-Shaped Hair Ornaments", c. 2000 BC.]]
The art of Mesopotamia rivalled [[Art of Ancient Egypt|that of Ancient Egypt]] as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western [[Eurasia]] from the 4th millennium BC until the [[Persia]]n Achaemenid Empire conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculpture was also painted.

The [[Protoliterate period]], dominated by [[Uruk]], saw the production of sophisticated works like the [[Warka Vase]] and [[cylinder seal]]s.  The [[Guennol Lioness]] is an outstanding small [[limestone]] figure from [[Elam]] of about 3000–2800 BC, part man and part lion.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 24–37&lt;/ref&gt; A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple [[cult image]]s of the deity, but very few of these have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 45–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Sculptures from the [[Sumer]]ian and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men.  Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at [[Ur]] (c. 2650 BC), including the two figures of a ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]'', the ''[[Copper Bull]]'' and a bull's head on one of the [[Lyres of Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 61–66&lt;/ref&gt;

From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Chapters 2–5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burney Relief]] is an unusual elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15&amp;nbsp;inches) [[terracotta]] plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions.  It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 110–112&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 66–74&lt;/ref&gt; the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; and the Assyrian [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and solid late one.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 66–74; 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the [[British Museum]] has an outstanding collection. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures, often the human-headed [[lamassu]], which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 141–193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:SumerianZiggurat.jpg|thumb|right|A suggested reconstruction of the appearance of a Sumerian [[ziggurat]]]]
{{Main article|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}
The study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available [[archaeological]] evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices. Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Sally|last=Dunham|chapter=Ancient Near Eastern architecture|title=A Companion to the Ancient Near East|editor=Daniel Snell|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|year=2005|pages=266–280|isbn=978-0631232933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.

Brick is the dominant material, as the material was freely available locally, whereas building stone had to be brought a considerable distance to most cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Mesopotamia/|title=Mesopotamia|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ziggurat]] is the most distinctive form, and cities often had large gateways, of which the [[Ishtar Gate]] from Neo-Babylonian Babylon, decorated with beasts in polychrome brick, is the most famous, now largely in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]].

The most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at [[Uruk]] from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic period]] sites in the [[Diyala River]] valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] remains at [[Nippur]] (Sanctuary of [[Enlil]]) and [[Ur]] (Sanctuary of [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]), Middle [[Bronze Age]] remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Alalakh]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Kultepe]], Late Bronze Age palaces at [[Bogazkoy]] (Hattusha), [[Ugarit]], [[Ashur]] and [[Nuzi]], Iron Age palaces and temples at [[Assyria]]n ([[Kalhu]]/Nimrud, [[Khorsabad]], [[Nineveh]]), [[Babylonia]]n ([[Babylon]]), [[Urartian]] ([[Tushpa]]/Van,  Kalesi, Cavustepe, Ayanis, [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Yerevan|Erebuni]], [[Bastam]]) and [[Neo-Hittite]] sites ([[Carchemish|Karkamis]], [[Tell Halaf]], [[Karatepe]]). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the [[Iron Age]].

'''''Monmouthshire Houses: A Study of Building Techniques and Smaller House-Plans in the Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries''''' is a study of buildings within the county of [[Monmouthshire]] written by [[Cyril Fox|Sir Cyril Fox]] and [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] and published by [[Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales]]. The study was published in three volumes; ''Part I Medieval Houses'', ''Part II Sub-Medieval Houses, c. 1550–1610'' and ''Part III Renaissance Houses, c. 1590–1714'', between 1951 and 1954. The series was republished by Merton Priory Press in 1994. A later historian of Welsh architecture has described the work as equal in importance, in its own field, to [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. 

==History==
Sir Cyril Fox (1882–1967), was Director of the National Museum of Wales from 1926 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-FOX0-FRE-1882.html |title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography |publisher=Yba.llgc.org.uk |date=1967-01-16 |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Fitzroy Somerset, Lord Raglan]], the great-grandson of [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|the 1st Lord Raglan]], British Commander during the [[Crimean War]], was a soldier, author and resident of [[Cefntilla Court]] in Monmouthshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/15/archives/lord-raglan-79-dies-in-wales-a-soldier-author-and-historian.html|title=Lord Raglan, 79, Dies in Wales; A Soldier, Author and Historian; Ex‐Grenadier Guards Officer Eladed Slave Traders — Attacked literary Myths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raglan was also a Commissioner for [[Scheduled monument|Ancient Monuments]] in Wales and both he and Fox were pioneers of the study of [[vernacular architecture]], being founder members of the Vernacular Architecture Group. From the early 1940s until 1949, Fox and Raglan undertook the most extensive survey of lesser Monmouthshire buildings ever undertaken.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iv}} Raglan described their methodology in the introduction to the first volume, ''Medieval Houses'', published in 1951. He would identify houses of interest and obtain the necessary permissions from owners, before calling in Fox to undertake a detailed survey.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iv}} In the Introduction to the 1994 reprint, Peter Smith, author of ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', recorded Raglan's approach; "as we travelled from farmhouse to farmhouse, I realised that his was a name that carried weight and in Monmouthshire opened every door...status and personal charm carried the day and we followed in his wake".{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iii}} The architectural historian, [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]], author of the [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Pevsner]] for Monmouthshire, considered Fox and Raglan's joint work as "ground-breaking, the single most important publication on any aspect of the county's buildings",{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=84}} and Smith described ''Monmouthshire Houses'' as "this landmark in the history of scholarship, a landmark, in its own field, as significant as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''[[Origin of Species]]''".{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=84}}

In the Introduction to ''Sub-Medieval Houses'', the second volume of their history, Fox and Raglan record the genesis of the project. Wartime defensive precautions in 1941 led to a decision by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] to demolish an important farmhouse, Upper Wern-hir, near [[Llanbadoc]]. Fox and Raglan obtained permission to survey the building before its destruction and their investigations, together with the threats to Wern-hir and other, similar, buildings, convinced them of the need for a comprehensive survey of such structures throughout Monmouthshire.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994b|pp=15–16}}

==Description==
The three-volume work comprises detailed studies of over 400 houses and farmhouses built in Monmouthshire between the [[medieval]] period and 1714.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994a|loc=preface}} The volumes are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">'''Hannibal Napoleon David Alfred Thomas ("Nap") Cordy''' (July 29, 1902 — January 30, 1977) was an amateur scholar in the field of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, who made some notable contributions in the 1930s and 1940s to the early study and decipherment of the [[Maya script]], used by the pre-Columbian [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of southern Mexico and northern Central America.

==Life and accomplishments==
Cordy was born in 1902 in [[Cheltenham]], England. His family emigrated to the United States in 1913, settling in [[Globe, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a coal and copper miner, Cordy briefly studied mining engineering at the [[University of Arizona]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="NapoleonCordy"&gt;"Napoleon Cordy (1902 - 1977)", ''AskART''; Hughes (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as an electrician at the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] from 1922–62, Cordy became fascinated with the Maya civilization, especially Maya hieroglyphs. He wrote a number of articles on the subject for various publications, and was a respected contributor to the journal ''The Masterkey'', published by the [[Southwest Museum]] in Los Angeles. He was also a founding member of the Southwestern Anthropological Association.&lt;ref&gt;SWAA, "Early History of SWAA," https://swaa-anthro.org/early-history-of-swaa/&lt;/ref&gt; Cordy died in Los Angeles in 1977, aged 74.&lt;ref name="NapoleonCordy" /&gt;

His daughter, [[Alana Cordy-Collins]], became an anthropologist/archaeologist, specializing in the Peruvian prehistory, especially the [[Chavín culture|Chavin]] and [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] civilizations. She was a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of San Diego]]. A cousin, [[Ross Cordy]], is an anthropologist specializing in [[Polynesia]]n civilizations. He is chief archaeologist for the state of Hawaii's Historic Preservation Division and teaches at the [[University of Hawaii]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3939">'''Oluf Rygh''' (5 September 1833 – 19 August 1899) was a noted [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[archaeologist]], [[philologist]] and [[historian]]. Oluf Rygh is recognized as one of the founders of professional archaeology in Norway.[[File:Prof oluf rygh.jpg|thumb|Oluf Rygh. Photo: [[Ludvig Forbech|L. Forbech]]]]

==Background==
Oluf Rygh was born in [[Verdal]]. His parents were Peder Strand Rygh (1800–1868) and Ingeborg Marie Bentsen (1809–1878). He was the older brother of [[Evald Rygh]] and [[Karl Ditlev Rygh]]. Oluf Rygh attended the [[Trondheim Cathedral School|Trondhjem Cathedral School]] in 1850 and went to the [[University of Christiania]] to study philology, where he graduated in 1856. In 1858, while a teacher at Nissens Skole in Christiania, he was a research fellow for history. Later he was a professor of classical philology, history and Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=|title=Oluf Rygh|encyclopedia=Norsk biografisk leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Oluf_Rygh/utdypning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:TuneShip.jpg|thumb|right|Rygh led excavation of the [[Tune ship]]]]
Rygh was professor of history at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] between 1866 and 1875. He was director of ''Oldsaksamlingen'' (which subsequently became the [[Museum of Cultural History, Oslo|Museum of Cultural History]]) from 1862 and professor of Nordic archaeology from 1875 – the first professor of archaeology at any [[Scandinavia]]n university. He led excavation of the [[Tune ship]] 1867. His work ''Norske Oldsaker'' (Norwegian Antiquities) published in 1885 is recognized for its detailed illustrations and even today is still a significant reference source.

From 1879 to 1899 he chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oluf Rygh is best known for creation of ''[[Norske Gaardnavne]]'' (Norwegian Farm Names), which is a 19 volume set of books based on a manuscript prepared from 1897 to 1924. The book contains a standardized notation, information on pronunciation, historical forms and the [[etymology]] for recorded farm, estate and manor names in [[Norway]], which became the standard for place names in Norway. It inspired similar research in [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. Rygh died in 1899 at [[Ulefoss]] in [[Holla, Telemark]]. At the time of his death, only three and one half volumes had been published.&lt;ref name=RyghB&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/rygh_ng/rygh_info.html Oluf Rygh: Norwegian Farm Names]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The street ''Oluf Ryghs gate'' at [[Fagerborg]] has been named after him.&lt;ref name=oby&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2000|title=Oluf Ryghs gate|encyclopedia=Oslo byleksikon|edition=4th|editor=Tvedt, Knut Are|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|page=315|isbn=82-573-0815-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography ==
His more significant publications include:&lt;ref name=RyghB /&gt; 
*1869 &amp;ndash; ''Om den ældre Jernalder i Norge'' (On the Older Iron Age in Norway) 
*1877 &amp;ndash; ''Om den yngre Jernalder i Norge'' (On the Younger Iron Age in Norway) 
*1885 &amp;ndash; ''Norske Oldsaker'' (Norwegian Antiquities)
*1897 &amp;ndash; ''[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/rygh_ng/rygh_felt.html Norske Gaardnavne]'' (a 19 volume set on "Norwegian Farm Names" parts of which were completed for publication after his death by other researchers)

'''Paul Veyne''' ({{IPA-fr|vɛn|lang}}; born 13 June 1930 in [[Aix-en-Provence]]) is a [[France|French]] [[archaeologist]] and [[historian]], and a specialist on [[Ancient Rome]]. A former student of the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and member of the [[École française de Rome]], he is now honorary professor at the [[Collège de France]].

==Biography==
From an ordinary background, which he described as "uncultured", Veyne took up archaeology and history by chance, at the age of eight, when he discovered a piece of an [[amphora]] on a [[Celts|Celtic]] site close to the village of [[Cavaillon]]. He developed a particular interest in [[Roman civilization]] since it was the best-known in the environment in which he grew up.

The family having moved to [[Lille]], he assiduously studied the Roman collections of the archaeological museum there, where he received guidance from the curator. He maintains that his interest in the Greeks and Romans stems not from any humanist impulse or any specific admiration, but just from his chance discovery as a child.

Having come to Paris for his [[khâgne]], he had a sudden moment of political awakening in front of the bas-relief that celebrates the liberation of the city at the bottom of the [[Boulevard St. Michel]] and joined the [[Communist Party of France]]. He left the party four years later, without ever having had a true political conviction.

On the other hand, the bad treatment of the Algerians at the hands of the colonials revolted him in equal measure to the atrocities of the Nazis. Once again, however, his shock was neither social nor political, but moral.

Paul Veyne studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris 1951-55. He was a member of the École française de Rome 1955-1957, whereupon he settled in [[Aix-en-Provence]] as a professor at the [[University of Provence]]. It was in his years in Aix that he published his provocative ''Comment on écrit l'histoire'', an essay on the epistemology of history.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''Comment on écrit l'histoire : essai d'épistémologie'', Paris: Le Seuil 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when the dominant trend in French historiography favored quantitative methods, Veyne's essay unabashedly declared history to be a "true tale". Through his essay he became an early representative for the interest in the narrative aspects of scientific history.

His monograph on [[Evergetism]] from 1975 (''Le pain et le cirque''), however, demonstrated that Veyne's concept of narrative somewhat differed from its common use, and that his differences with the hegemonic [[Annales school]] was smaller than what had seemed to be the case in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''Le pain et le cirque'', Paris: Le Seuil 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a comprehensive study of the practice of gift-giving, in the tradition of [[Marcel Mauss]], more in line with the anthropologically influenced ''histoire des mentalités'' of the third ''Annalistes'' generation than with "old-fashioned" narrative history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://40ans.ehess.fr/2015/06/01/1976-paul-veyne-met-au-jour-la-logique-des-bienfaits/|title=1976: Paul Veyne met au jour la logique des bienfaits|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Veyne entered the Collège de France thanks to the support of [[Raymond Aron]], who had been abandoned by his former heir apparent [[Pierre Bourdieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://journals.openedition.org/lhomme/29548|title=Entretien avec Paul Veyne|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Veyne, by failing to cite the name of Aron in his inaugural lecture, aroused his displeasure, and according to Veyne he was persecuted by Aron ever since this perceived sign of his ingratitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/paul-veyne_810802.html|title=Paul Veyne|date=2005-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veyne remained there from 1975 to 1999 as holder of the chair of Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.babelio.com/auteur/Paul-Veyne/4757|title=Paul Veyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Veyne's epistemological essay was reissued in tandem with a new essay on [[Michel Foucault]] as a historian: "Foucault révolutionne l'histoire."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''Comment on écrit l'histoire, suivi par "Foucault révolutionne l'histoire"''; Paris: Le Seuil 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay Veyne moved away from the insistence on history as narrative, and focused instead on how the work of Foucault constituted a major shift in historical thinking. The essence of the Foucauldian 'revolution' was, according to Veyne, a shift of attention from 'objects' to 'practices', to highlight the way the epistemological objects were brought into being, rather than the objects themselves. With this essay Veyne established himself as an idiosyncratic and important interpreter of his colleague. The relationship between the historian of antiquities and the philosopher also influenced Foucault's turn towards antiquity in the second volume of the ''[[History of Sexuality]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[David Halperin]], ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality'', New York: Routledge, 1990, page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his reading of [[economic liberalism|liberalism]] in his public lectures (1978-9).&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-1979).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, 317-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Veyne published a full-length book on Foucault, reworking some of the themes from his 1978 essay, expanding it to an intellectual portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, ''Foucault. Sa pensée, sa personne''; Paris: Albin Michel, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Veyne now lives in [[Bédoin]], in the [[Vaucluse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/2014/10/26/livres/paul-veyne-quelle-ete-vie-11531188/|title=Paul Veyne : "Quelle a été ma vie?"|date=2014-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Hume Brown.jpg|thumb|Peter Hume Brown]]

'''Peter Hume Brown''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (17 December 1849 – 1 December 1918) was a Scottish historian and professor who played an important part in establishing Scottish history as a significant academic discipline. As well as teaching and writing, he spent 16 years as editor of the Register of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]], and served as [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal]].

==Early life==
Hume Brown was born in [[Tranent]] but soon he and his widowed mother moved to [[Prestonpans]], a few miles away, where he started at the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] school in 1857. After his mother's death in 1866 he stayed at the school as a pupil teacher&lt;ref&gt;An "apprentice" teacher, teaching the younger children while also receiving general education from a senior teacher.&lt;/ref&gt; for another three years.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

He taught in England and Wales before starting a degree in theology at Edinburgh in 1872.{{cn|date=January 2018}} He decided he had no vocation to be a [[clergy|minister]] and left in 1874, only to start a different course the following year, graduating as [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] in 1878. In the meantime he had started on a lifelong "loyal ... friendship"&lt;ref name="scotsman1918"&gt;''Scotsman'' 2 December 1918&lt;/ref&gt; with [[R. B. Haldane]] who shared some of his intellectual interests. He had also sold his theology books and bought [[Montaigne]]'s ''Essays'' instead. For the rest of his life, Hume Brown's interest in French and German culture flourished alongside his dedication to the history of Scotland; the biographies he wrote of [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]] and [[John Knox]] gave full attention to the influence of continental Europe in their lives.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Independent scholar==
After graduation he started a private school, and married the following year, 1879. His wife died only three years later, and Hume Brown gave up the school, earning a small living through private teaching and writing for ''Chambers' Encyclopaedia'', while tolerating periods of material "privation"&lt;ref name="scotsman1918"/&gt; to concentrate on his own independent studies. He had little hope of a university post in history, which at that time was not a well-supported subject at Edinburgh or other Scottish universities.&lt;ref&gt;One important reason for this was the traditional predominance of philosophy, a required element in many degrees at Edinburgh. (Robertson)&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued his research and published his first book, ''George Buchanan, Humanist and Reformer'', in 1890. Three other books followed before his biography of Knox in 1895. In 1896 he was made an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] by Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.registry.ed.ac.uk/graduations/Honorary_Grads/1889_1900.htm Edinburgh honorary graduates]&lt;/ref&gt; and later honorary degrees came from [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref name="scotsman1918"/&gt;

Now Hume Brown's reputation as a historian was established, [[Cambridge University Press]] commissioned a three-volume ''History of Scotland''. In the year the first volume was published, 1898, Hume Brown was asked to succeed [[David Masson]], his old teacher, as editor of the Register of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]], which not only brought him financial security, but untrammelled access to historically crucial 17th century documents.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Professor of Scottish history==
In 1901 [[Edinburgh University]] made him its first professor of [[Scottish history]], after receiving a [[bequest]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Hume Brown's university chair had the slightly awkward title of ''Sir [[William Fraser (antiquarian)|William Fraser]] Professor of Ancient (Scottish) History and Palaeography'' or ''Sir William Fraser Professor of Ancient History and Palaeography'' because Fraser's will had left money for a professorship in his "life's work" (genealogy and antiquarian research) which he described as "ancient history".(DNB article on Fraser)&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment highlights Hume Brown's major role in "establish[ing] the academic respectability of Scottish history".&lt;ref name="robertson"&gt;Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; When this new departure for the university was announced, Hume Brown was described as "a man of new mark and likelihood among Scottish historical scholars" whose book ''Scotland before 1700'' "presents a view of Scotland based entirely upon contemporary native sources".&lt;ref&gt;''Scotsman'' 20 July 1901&lt;/ref&gt; Before Hume Brown's inaugural address the principal expressed pleasure that "there was being introduced a fresh subject into the work of the University." The new professor himself said it could not be a "revolutionary step" for a university to include study of "the national history".&lt;ref name="scotsman1901"&gt;''Scotsman'' 23 October 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume Brown was concerned with Scotland's nationhood, and saw the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] as a key period in the development of a national consciousness,&lt;ref name="robertson" /&gt; when "Scotland was entering on a new phase of her national life".&lt;ref&gt;''Renascence and Reformation'' in ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes'' (1907–21), Volume III&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured his students on the ''Making of Scotland'', while conceding that no historian could ever give a fully adequate account of the "making" of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;''Scotsman'' 15 October 1902&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested in studying Scotland in a European context more than in the context of the [[British Empire]],&lt;ref name="robertson" /&gt; and stressed that one country's history could only be understood by "reference to the histories of other countries".&lt;ref name="scotsman1901"/&gt; Though his writing style is considered restrained, he was more outgoing in conversation, entertaining friends and making an impression on the younger people around him.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis&lt;/ref&gt;

At first his lectures only covered the years up to 1500, but when a second specialist on the history of Scotland, Henry Meikle, joined him in 1909, he added a course taking students up to 1800. He was invited to give prestigious lecture series at other universities, including the [[Rhind lectures]] for 1903 on "Scotland in the Time of Queen Mary" and the [[Ford Lectures]] for 1913/14.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 1908 he was made Historiographer Royal.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==The Haldanes and Goethe==
Lord Haldane, his mother and his sister [[Elizabeth Haldane|Elizabeth]] were a lifelong support and regularly invited Hume Brown to their estate at Cloan in [[Perthshire]], a change from the suburban home where he lived alone except for his dog.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Between 1898 and 1912 he made annual trips with Haldane to [[Weimar]] where [[Goethe]] had lived, the two sharing an enthusiasm for Goethe's work and German literature in general. In 1913 Hume Brown brought out the first half of a biography of Goethe; the other volume would appear posthumously, nearly complete in 1918, but edited by Richard and Elizabeth Haldane who also published a collection of his lectures.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Hume Brown also admired the French literary critic [[Sainte-Beuve]], and believed the study of history should not be separated from literature. Other writers whose work particularly influenced his thought were [[Montaigne]] and [[Ernest Renan|Renan]].&lt;ref name="robertson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;

He died suddenly on 1 December 1918, leaving behind him a substantial body of published work, and a new sense of Scottish history as a major academic subject. His will gave Edinburgh University not only a [[death mask]] of Goethe he had received from the [[David Masson|Masson family]], but money to fund a prize connected with his own field. The Hume Brown prize is now awarded biennially to a previously unpublished writer who makes an "original contribution to Scottish History".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarships.ed.ac.uk/presentstudents/hss/shc.htm#sco Hume Brown Senior Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip de Jersey''' is a [[Guernsey]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Numismatics|numismatist]].  He is known as an expert on [[Celtic coinage|Celtic coins]] of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]].

==Life and career==
De Jersey was born in Guernsey, and studied [[Geography]] at [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford College]], [[University of Oxford]].  After graduating he stayed on at Oxford University to study for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] on the late [[Iron Age]] in north-west [[Prehistory of France|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Philip de Jersey | url=http://www.shirebooks.co.uk/authors/Philip_de_Jersey/ | publisher=[[Shire Books]] | accessdate=2012-06-30 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505080106/http://www.shirebooks.co.uk/authors/Philip_de_Jersey/ | archivedate=2013-05-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 2008 de Jersey was employed as keeper of the Oxford University [[Celtic Coin Index]], and was responsible for the computerisation of the index.

[[File:Teimuraz son of George XII .jpg|thumb|Prince Teimuraz of Georgia]]
'''Teimuraz Bagrationi''' ({{lang-ka|თეიმურაზ ბაგრატიონი}}) otherwise known as [[Tsarevich]] '''Teimuraz Georgievich''' ({{lang-ru|царевич Теймураз Георгиевич}}) (April 23, 1782 – October 25, 1846) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] royal prince (''[[batonishvili]]'') and scholar primarily known as an author of the first critical history in Georgian as well as for his work to popularize interest in the history and culture of Georgia and preserve its treasures.

Prince Teimuraz was born in [[Tbilisi]] to Heir Apparent [[George XII of Georgia|George]], subsequently the last king of Georgia ([[Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti]]) from 1798 to 1800, and his wife, [[Ketevan Andronikashvili]]. He studied at the [[Telavi]] Seminary, and, at the age of 13, took part in the 1795 [[Battle of Krtsanisi]] at which his grandfather, King [[Heraclius II of Georgia]], was defeated by a [[History of Iran|Persian]] invading army under [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]]. Teimuraz did not accept the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] annexation of Georgia of 1801, which followed shortly after his father's death and fled to Persia, whence his uncle, [[Alexander of Georgia|Alexander]] fought to expel the Russians from Georgia. During the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], Teimuraz was a Persian artillery commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmanfarmaian|first=Roxane|title=War and peace in Qajar Persia : implications past and present|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415421195|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 16, 1810, however, he surrendered to the Russian authorities. On January 12, 1811, he settled in [[St Petersburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Natchkebia|first=Irina|title=Franco-Persian Diplomatic Relations And Georgia (1804-1810)|url=http://www.fereidani.ge/181_irina/181_irina.html|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was granted a state salary and pension. In 1813, he acquired a mansion on [[Vasilievsky Island]] and concentrated on scholarly work. He collected and researched old Georgian chronicles and analyzed [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Armenia]]n sources on Georgia. He was a collaborator and friend of [[Marie Brosset]], a [[France|French]] scholar, whom he frequently consulted on the history of Georgia. At the same time, Prince Teiumraz befriended and tutored the young Georgian students in St Petersburg – [[Platon Ioseliani]], and [[David Chubinashvili]] – both of whom eventually became prolific Georgian historians.

In the 1830s-1840s, he composed two major works on the early history of Georgia – "ისტორია დაწყებითგან ივერიისა, ესე იგი გიორგიისა, რომელ არს სრულიად საქართველოჲსა" (1832, ''History of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] or Georgia, that is All of [[Sakartvelo]]'') and "ისტორია ძველი კოლხიდისა" (1840, ''History of Ancient [[Colchis]]'') – and wrote commentaries to the 12th-century Georgian national epic "[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]" ("განმარტება პოემა ვეფხისტყაოსანისა", 1843). His articles were published in the [[Paris]]-based Journal Asiatique and Memoires inedits. He was elected an honorary member of the French [[Societe Asiatique]] (1831), the Russian [[Imperial Academy of Sciences]] (1837) and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Antiquarian|Royal Antiquarian Society]] (1838). Prince Teimuraz also authored several poems, and a memoir of his [[Europe]]an travels as well as the Georgian translations of [[Tacitus]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Pushkin]].

He died in [[Saint Petersburg]] and was buried there at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].

'''Robert Grant Haliburton''' [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]], [[Doctor of Civil Law|D.C.L.]]  (3 June 1831 – 6 March 1901) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] lawyer and anthropologist. He became famous after founding the [[Canada First]] organization that saw English Canadian society as the "heirs of Aryan northmen" and that the French Canadians were a "bar to progress."&lt;ref name= "Francis-Jones p. 61"&gt;{{harvnb|Francis|Jones|2011| p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Haliburton was born in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]]. His father was the famous [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton|Judge Haliburton]] who wrote the best selling ''Clockmaker series'' about the humorous adventures of the [[Sam Slick]] character. Like his father he graduated from [[University of King's College]] and was part of the local volunteer militia where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. He was a lawyer, called to the bar in 1853.&lt;ref name= "Chamberlain pp=62-63"&gt;{{harvnb|Chamberlain|1901|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada First and the Aryan North ==

The ''Canada First'' movement was organized in Ottawa in 1868. It was at first supported by [[Goldwin Smith]] and [[Edward Blake]]. Ontario residents, [[George Denison (Canadian politician)|George Denison]], [[Charles Mair]], William Alexander Foster and Robert Grant Haliburton founded the movement.&lt;ref name= "Vigod p="&gt;{{harvnb|Vigod|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haliburton and like minded authors that made up the Canada First movement saw that the milder southern climate was said to lead to "degeneration, decay, and effeminacy."&lt;ref name= "Holman p. 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Holman|2009|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harsher northern climate they argued was said to produce the most Canadian of characteristics, "the inclination to be moderate".&lt;ref name= "Holman p. 85"/&gt; The Canada First movement saw the French Canadian and [[Métis]] cultures as dead weight that was holding the advancement of English Canada back.&lt;ref name= "Francis-Jones p. 61"/&gt;

==Later life ==

Ill health required Haliburton to move to warmer climates and he spent his winters in [[Jamaica]]. After a lucrative career in law he was able to live off his investments and spent some time as an anthropologist and was instrumental in discovering the "dwarf races" of northern Africa and the Atlas region.&lt;ref name= "Chamberlain pp=62-63"/&gt; A "rover" he died in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], United States, on 6 March 1901; he was 69.&lt;ref name= "Davies p. 231"&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2005|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Bettina Birn''' (born 1952) is a Canadian historian and author whose main field of research is the security forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and their role in the [[Holocaust]]. For nearly 15 years, she held a position of chief historian in the war crimes section at the [[Canadian Department of Justice]]. With [[Norman Finkelstein]], Birn is the co-author of ''[[A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth]]''.

==Education and career==
Ruth Bettina Birn was born in 1952 in [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]]. In 1985, she received her PhD from the [[Stuttgart University]] with the dissertation ''Die Höheren SS-und Polizeiführer: Himmlers Vertreter im Reich und in den besetzten Gebieten'' ("Higher SS and Police Leaders: Himmler's Representatives in the Reich and the Occupied Territories"), published in Düsseldorf in 1986 as a book. From 1991 to 2005, she was the chief historian at the War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Section of the [[Canadian Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://us.macmillan.com/author/ruthbettinabirn Profile], [[Macmillan Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiio"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hiio |first1=Toomas |authorlink1=Toomas Hiio|title=Toomas Hiio: Saksa salapolitsei Eestis ja eestlased Saksa salapolitseis |url=http://www.sirvilauad.ee/?p=232 |website=Sirvilauad.ee |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birn studied the [[Estonian Security Police and SD]], publishing a book on this topic, ''Die Sicherheitspolizei in Estland 1941 – 1944: Eine Studie zur Kollaboration im Osten'' ("The Security Police in Estonia 1941 – 1944: A Study in Collaboration in the East"). Based on hundreds of Security Police investigation files kept in the [[Estonian State Archives]], the book analyzes the persecution policies against various victim groups: Communists, Jews, Roma, Russians, Soviet prisoners of war, and so-called [[Black triangle (badge)|asocials]].&lt;ref name="Hiio"/&gt;

==''A Nation on Trial''==
Since the 1970s, Birn conducted research at the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]] in Germany. She was sharply critical of the 1996 book by [[Daniel Goldhagen]], ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'', who she accused of being highly selective with the materials from the Central Office in her article "Historiographical review: Revising the Holocaust", published in ''[[The Historical Journal]]''. The American political science professor [[Norman Finkelstein]] also published a critical article, "Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's 'Crazy' Thesis", in the [[UK]] political journal ''[[New Left Review]]''.&lt;ref name="attack"&gt;Shatz, Adam. (April 8, 1998) [http://slate.com/id/3143/ Goldhagen's willing executioners: the attack on a scholarly superstar, and how he fights back], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. Retrieved January 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finkelstein's and Birn's essays were later published in book form as ''[[A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth]]''.&lt;ref name="attack"/&gt; In response to their book, Goldhagen sought a retraction and apology from Birn, threatening at one point to sue her for libel and according to ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' declaring Finkelstein "a supporter of Hamas".&lt;ref name="attack"/&gt; The force of the counterattacks against Birn and Finkelstein from Goldhagen's supporters was described by Israeli journalist [[Tom Segev]] as "bordering on cultural terrorism .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The Jewish establishment has embraced Goldhagen as if he were Mr Holocaust himself (...). All this is absurd, because the criticism of Goldhagen is backed up so well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vidal |first= Dominique |title= From 'Mein Kampf' to Auschwitz |url= http://mondediplo.com/1998/10/14vidal |journal= [[Le Monde Diplomatique]] |date= 14 October 1998 |accessdate= 26 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Hans Mommsen]] describes Birn's criticism as harsh; he writes that, in an effort to refute Goldhagen's assertion that Jews and Gentiles were treated completely differently by the regime, Birn comes "close to obviously unintended apologetics". At the same time, he regrets that Goldhagen reacted to Birn's criticism by threatening her and her editor with legal action, thus choosing this route in order "to silence his academic critics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Mommsen]]: ''Einleitung''.

Claassen-Verlag, Hildesheim 1998, pp. 9–22, pp. 14 &amp; 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarai Lashkari.jpg|thumb|400 px| right|A carvanserai near Doraha town in Ludhiana district]]

'''Serai Lashkari Khan''' located on Highway number One near Gurdwara Manji Sahib, Kotan (near [[Daroha|Doraha]]) in [[Ludhiana District]], [[Punjab]] is a historical inn built by [[Mughal Empire|moghul]] military general Lashkari Khan, in the reign of [[Aurangzeb|Emperor Aurangzeb]] in 1667 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_ldh40.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A specimen of major structural types of Islamic architecture, this is one of many Carvanserais meant to be halting places along the old Mughal highway connecting Agra, Delhi and Lahore. These caravanserais played an important role in economic, cultural and political life but gradually fell in disuse with shifting routes and advent of railroads in the nineteenth century. Many of these disappeared altogether due to modernization and urban expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=1523076|title=Four Mughal Carvanserais built during the reign of Jahangir and Shah Jahan|author=Wayne E. Begley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic inn, though, declared as a protected monument has largely been neglected and has been in a dilapidated condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Major-monuments-given-a-miss-on-Punjab-tourisms-website/articleshow/43571742.cms|title=Major monuments given a miss on Punjab tourisms website|publisher=[[Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Serai was made popular after it was featured in the popular movie ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' referred to by its acronym RDB. Some tourists started referring to it the RDB fort after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/history-revisited/410105/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004220547/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/history-revisited/410105/ |archivedate=4 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010601/ldh4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Siachen conflict''', sometimes referred to as the '''Siachen War''', was a military conflict between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] over the disputed [[Siachen Glacier]] region in [[Kashmir]]. A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/26/world/fg-ceasefire26|title=India and Pakistan Agree to Cease-Fire in Kashmir|last=Watson|first=Paul|date=26 November 2003|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=27 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193640/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/26/world/fg-ceasefire26|archive-date=27 April 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contended area is nearly {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2}} of territory.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958254-2,00.html|title=The Himalayas War at the Top Of the World|first=Edward W.|last=Desmond|date=31 July 1989|publisher=|via=www.time.com|access-date=11 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114104526/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C958254-2%2C00.html|archive-date=14 January 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict began in 1984 with India's successful [[Operation Meghdoot|Operation ''Meghdoot'']] during which it gained control over all of the Siachen Glacier (unoccupied and undemarcated area).

==Causes==

[[File:Un-kashmir-jammu.png|thumb|right|UN map of Siachen]]

The Siachen Glacier is the highest battleground on earth,&lt;ref&gt;VAUSE, Mikel.  Peering Over the Edge: The Philosophy of Mountaineering, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CHILD, Greg.  Mixed Emotions: Mountaineering Writings, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; where [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought intermittently since 13 April 1984. Both countries maintain permanent military presence in the region at a height of over {{convert|6000|m}}. More than 2000 people have died in this inhospitable terrain, mostly due to weather extremes and the natural hazards of [[mountain warfare]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The conflict in Siachen stems from the incompletely demarcated territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as [[NJ9842]] ({{Coord|35.008371|77.008805}}). The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.&lt;ref&gt;Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===
Following the UN-mediated ceasefire in the 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

Paragraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:
{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease- fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}

Later, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the "Line of Control" extending from the "''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers."'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&amp;pg=PA53&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL – UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

=== Oropolitics ===
In 1949, a Cease-Fire Line Agreement (CFL) was signed and ratified by India, Pakistan and the UN Military Observer Group that delineated entire CFL. In 1956–58, a scientific team led by the [[Geological Survey of India]] recorded its findings publicly including information about the Siachen and other glaciers.&lt;ref name="tribune" /&gt;

After Pakistan ceded [[Shaksgam Valley]] to China in a boundary agreement in 1963, Pakistan started giving approval to western expeditions to the east of [[K2|mountain K2]].&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm Facts vs bluff on Siachen, Kayani's suggestion worth pursuing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422175121/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm |date=22 April 2012 }}, B.G. Verghese, Saturday, 21 April 2012, Chandigarh, India&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Pakistan permitted a British expedition under [[Eric Shipton]] to approach the Siachen glacier through the Bilafond La, and recce [[Saltoro Kangri]].&lt;ref&gt;Himalayan Journal Vol. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later a Japanese-Pakistani expedition put two Japanese and a Pakistani Army climber on top of [[Saltoro Kangri]].&lt;ref&gt;Himalayan Journal Vol. 25&lt;/ref&gt; These were early moves in this particular game of [[oropolitics]].

In the 1970s and early 1980s several [[mountaineering]] expeditions applied to Pakistan to climb high peaks in the Siachen area due in part to US Defense Mapping Agency and most other maps and atlases showing it on the Pakistani side of the line. Pakistan granted a number of permits. This in turn reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.&lt;ref&gt;SANGAKU 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confuence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary "Expedition to the longest glacier" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.

The Indian government and military took notice, and protested the cartography. Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical 'oropolitical' riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200302/200302_siachen_1.html |title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=15 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411111640/http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200302/200302_siachen_1.html |archive-date=11 April 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled "High Politics in the Karakoram" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph – Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text was re-printed as "Oropolitics" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Alpine Journal, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===

Maps from Pakistan, the United Nations and other global atlases depicted the CFL correctly till around 1967–72.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show international boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&amp;nbsp;m (18,136&amp;nbsp;ft) on the China border.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

US, Pakistani and Indian maps in the 1970s and 1980s were consistently showing a dotted line from [[NJ9842]] (the northernmost demarcated point of the India-Pakistan cease-fire line, also known as the ''Line of Control'') to the [[Karakoram Pass]], which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Military expeditions==

In 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.

==Major combat operations==

At army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now retired Pakistani army colonel. "They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitters who also supplied the Indians," says the colonel. "Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits—twice as many as we had—and rushed their men up to Siachen". The acquisition of key supplies needed for operations in glaciated zones marked the start of major combat operations on the glacier.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt; [[File:Dogra Siachen.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial at the headquarters of the [[Dogra Regiment]] of the Indian Army in remembrance of members of the regiment who died or served in the Siachen Conflict.]]

Hoon learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian Army launched an operation to preempt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.  Men of the Ladakh Scouts  and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army in turn learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes. This operation led by the Pakistan Army led to the first armed clash on the glacier on 25 April 1984.&lt;ref name="India Defence Review D.P.

June – July 1987: [[Operation Rajiv]]: Over the next three years, with Indian troops positioned at the critical passes, Pakistan Army attempted to seize heights overlooking the passes. One of the biggest successes achieved by Pakistan in this period was the seizure of a feature overlooking Bilafond La. This feature was named "Qaid Post" and for three years it dominated Indian positions on the glacier. Pakistani Army held Qaid post overlooked Bilafond La area and offered and excellent vantage point to view Indian Army activities. On 25 June 1987 Indian Army under the leadership of Brig. Gen. Chandan Nugyal, Major Varinder Singh, Lt. Rajiv Pande and Naib Subedar [[Bana Singh]] launched a successful strike on Qaid Post and captured it from Pakistani forces.&lt;ref name="Kunal2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kunal Verma |title=The Long Road to Siachen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9-bAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT421 |year=2012 |publisher=Rupa |isbn=978-81-291-2704-4 |chapter=XIV Op Rajiv |pages=415–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his role in the assault, Subedar Bana Singh was awarded the [[Param Vir Chakra]] – India's highest gallantry award.

March – May 1989: In March 1989 Operation Ibex by Indian Army attempted to seize the Pakistani post overlooking the Chumik Glacier. The operation was unsuccessful at dislodging Pakistani troops from their positions. Indian Army under Brig. R. K.

American observers say that the military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Siachen Glacier "made no military or political sense".&lt;ref name="India Changes Course"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8p19H4UwE_AC&amp;pg=PA109 |title=India Changes Course: Golden Jubilee to Millennium |last=Dettman |first=Paul R.  |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |isbn=9780275973087 |edition=illustrated |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An article in the [[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] stated: "Their combat over a barren, uninhabited world of questionable value is a forbidding symbol of their lingering, irreconcilability."&lt;ref name="India Changes Course" /&gt; [[Stephen P.

In the book ''Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia: The Causes and Consequences of the Kargil Conflict'', Khan, Lavoy and Clary wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Pakistan army sees India's 1984 occupation of the Siachen Glacier as a major scar, outweighed only by Dhaka's fall in 1971. The event underscored the dilution of the Simla Agreement and became a domestic issue as political parties, led by Benazir Bhutto's Peoples Party, blamed an incompetent military government under Zia ul-Haq for failing to defend Pakistani-held territory — while Zia downplayed the significance of the loss.{{sfn|Lavoy|2009|p=75}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

General [[Ved Prakash Malik]], in his book ''Kargil from Surprise to Victory'', wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Siachen is considered a military setback by the Pakistan Army. That the Indians dominate the area from the Saltoro Ridge and Pakistani troops are nowhere near the Siachen Glacier is a fact never mentioned in public. The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Severe conditions==
A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200 million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&amp;nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|1 = |last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kargil War==

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

The '''United States invasion of Grenada''' began on 25 October 1983. The  invasion, led by the [[United States]], of the [[Caribbean]] island nation of [[Grenada]], which has a population of about 91,000  and is located {{convert|160|km}} north of [[Venezuela]], resulted in a U.S. victory within a matter of days. Codenamed '''Operation Urgent Fury''', it was triggered by the internal strife within the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] that resulted in the house arrest and the execution of the previous leader and second [[Prime Minister]] of Grenada [[Maurice Bishop]], and the establishment of a preliminary government, the Revolutionary Military Council with [[Hudson Austin]] as [[Chairman]]. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by [[Grenadian general election, 1984|democratic elections in 1984]]. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.

Grenada gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[New Jewel Movement]] seized power in a coup in 1979 under [[Maurice Bishop]], suspending the constitution and detaining a number of [[political prisoner]]s. Among Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and Apartheid. Under Bishop's leadership, the National Women’s Organization was formed which participated in policy decisions along with other social groups. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organisations for education (Center for Popular Education), health care, and youth affairs (National Youth Organization) were also established. In 1983, an internal power struggle began over Bishop's relatively moderate foreign policy approach, and on 19 October, [[hard-line]] [[military junta]] elements captured and executed Bishop and his partner [[Jacqueline Creft]], along with three cabinet ministers and two union leaders. Subsequently, following appeals by the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] and the [[Governor-General]] of Grenada, [[Paul Scoon]], the [[Reagan Administration]] in the U.S. quickly decided to launch a military intervention. U.S. President Ronald Reagan's justification for the intervention was in part explained as "concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island" and fears of a repeat of the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

The U.S. invasion began six days after Bishop's death, on the morning of 25 October 1983, just two days and several hours after the bombing of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut]]. The invading force consisted of the [[Rapid deployment force|U.S. Army's Rapid Deployment Force]] (the 1st and 2nd Ranger Battalions and [[82nd Airborne Division]] paratroopers); U.S. Marines (22nd MAU); U.S. Army Delta Force; U.S. Navy SEALs, and ancillary forces totaling 7,600 U.S.troops, together with [[Jamaica]]n forces, and troops of the [[Regional Security System]] (RSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3377.html|title=Caribbean Islands – A Regional Security System|work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
USAF Pararescue and TACP personnel from the 21St Tass, Shaw AFB were attached to various other Special Operations Units during the Grenada conflict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/pj.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion force defeated Grenadian resistance after a low-altitude airborne assault by Rangers on Point Salines Airport at the south end of the island, and a Marine helicopter and amphibious landing on the north end at [[Pearls Airport]]. The [[Military dictatorship|military government]] of [[Hudson Austin]] was deposed and replaced by a government appointed by [[Paul Scoon|Governor-General Paul Scoon]].

The invasion was criticized by several countries including [[Canada]]. British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] privately disapproved of the mission and the lack of notice she received, but publicly supported the intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: At her Zenith'' (2016) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations General Assembly]], on 2 November 1983 with a vote of 108 to 9, condemned it as "a flagrant violation of international law".&lt;ref name=UN_GA_Resolution_38_7&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/38/7|title=United Nations General Assembly resolution 38/7 |publisher=United Nations |date= 2 November 1983 | access-date =5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it enjoyed broad public support in the United States&lt;ref name=Magnuson&gt;{{cite news| last=Magnuson |first=Ed |title=Getting Back to Normal |newspaper=Time |date=21 November 1983 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926318-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, over time, a positive evaluation from the Grenadian population, who appreciated the fact that there had been relatively few civilian casualties, as well as the return to democratic elections in 1984.&lt;ref name="AP 2012"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/06/08/grenada-trying-to-find-remains-slain-marxist-pm.html Associated Press report in 2012, printed in Fox News]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Spurious claim that receives little attention or explanation in the article.

The date of the invasion is now a national holiday in Grenada, called [[Thanksgiving Day#Grenada|Thanksgiving Day]], which commemorates the freeing, after the invasion, of several political prisoners who were subsequently elected to office. A [[History of Grenada#Truth and reconciliation commission|truth and reconciliation commission]] was launched in 2000 to re-examine some of the controversies of the era; in particular, the commission made an unsuccessful attempt to find Bishop's body, which had been disposed of at Hudson Austin's order, and never found.

For the U.S., the invasion also highlighted issues with communication and coordination between the different branches of the United States military when operating together as a joint force, contributing to investigations and sweeping changes in the form of the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] and other reorganizations.

==Background==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Sir [[Eric Gairy]] had led [[Grenada]] to independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. His term in office coincided with civil strife in Grenada. The political environment was highly charged and although Gairy—head of the [[Grenada United Labour Party]]—claimed victory in the general election of 1976, the opposition did not accept the result as legitimate. The civil strife took the form of street violence between Gairy's [[private army]], the [[Mongoose Gang]], and gangs organized by the [[New Jewel Movement]] (NJM). In the late 1970s the NJM began planning to overthrow the government. Party members began to receive military training outside of Grenada. On 13 March 1979, while Gairy was out of the country, the NJM—led by [[Maurice Bishop]]—launched an armed revolution and overthrew the government, establishing the [[People's Revolutionary Government]].

=== Airport ===

The Bishop government began constructing the [[Point Salines International Airport]] with the help of Britain, Cuba, [[Libya]], Algeria, and other nations. The airport had been first proposed by the [[British government]] in 1954, when Grenada was still a British colony. It had been designed by [[Canada|Canadians]], underwritten by the British government, and partly built by a London firm. The [[U.S. government]] accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the [[Caribbean]] based upon the 9,000-foot length runway, which could accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft like the [[An-12]], [[An-22]], and the [[An-124]], which would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop's government claimed that the airport was built to accommodate commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport on the island's north end (5,200 feet) and could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain at one end and the ocean at the other.
[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|left|Point Salines International Airport, Grenada]]
In 1983, then-member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] [[Ron Dellums]] (D, California), traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by the country's prime minister. Dellums described his findings before Congress:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... based on my personal observations, discussion and analysis of the new international airport under construction in Grenada, it is my conclusion that this project is specifically now and has always been for the purpose of economic development and is not for military use. ... It is my thought that it is absurd, patronizing, and totally unwarranted for the United States government to charge that this airport poses a military threat to the United States' national security.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Another "Low Dishonest Decade" on the Left|date=January 1987|publisher=Commentary|author=Peter Collier, [[David Horowitz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] began issuing warnings about the threat posed to the United States and the Caribbean by the "Soviet-Cuban militarization" of the Caribbean as evidenced by the excessively long airplane runway being built, as well as intelligence sources indicating increased Soviet interest in the island. He said that the {{convert|9000|ft|m|sing=on}} runway and the numerous fuel storage tanks were unnecessary for commercial flights, and that evidence indicated that the airport was to become a Cuban-Soviet forward military airbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C12F6385D0C758EDDAA0894DB484D81&amp;scp=20&amp;sq=grenada&amp;st=nyt|title=Grenada|last=Gailey|first=Phil|date=26 March 1983|work=New York Times|author2=Warren Weaver Jr.|accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2009 the [[Point Salines International Airport]] was officially renamed the [[Maurice Bishop International Airport]], in honour of the slain pre-coup leader [[Maurice Bishop]] by the Government of Grenada.&lt;ref name="airport_rename1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-16694--32-32--.html|title=St. Vincent's Prime Minister to officiate at renaming of Grenada international airport|date=26 May 2009|publisher=Caribbean Net News newspaper}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="airport_rename2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/38264/2009-05-30.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612200521/http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/38264/2009-05-30.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 June 2009 |title=Bishop's Honour: Grenada airport renamed after ex-PM |date=30 May 2009 |publisher=[[Caribbean News Agency]] (CANA) |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== October 1983 ===
On 16 October 1983, a party faction led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] seized power. Bishop was placed under house arrest. Mass protests against the action led to Bishop's escaping detention and reasserting his authority as the head of the government. Bishop was eventually captured and murdered, along with his pregnant partner, and several government officials and union leaders loyal to him. The army under [[Hudson Austin]] then stepped in and formed a military council to rule the country. The [[Governor-General of Grenada|governor-general]], [[Paul Scoon]], was placed under house arrest. The army announced a four-day total curfew where anyone seen on the streets would be subject to [[summary execution]].[[File:Eastern Caribbean Defense Force.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the Eastern Caribbean Defense Force]]The [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS), as well as the nations of [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]], appealed to the United States for assistance.&lt;ref name="dtic" /&gt; It was later announced that [[Governor-General of Grenada|Grenada's governor-general]], Paul Scoon, had actually requested the invasion through secret diplomatic channels and for his safety it had not been made public.&lt;ref name="z9f6WdltuE"&gt;{{YouTube|_z9f6WdltuE|Sir Paul Scoon, G-G of Grenada, at 2:36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoon was well within his rights to take this action under the [[reserve power]]s vested in the Crown.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/world/americas/paul-scoon-who-invited-grenada-invaders-dies-at-78.html|title=Paul Scoon, Who Invited Grenada Invaders, Dies at 78|last=Martin|first=Douglas|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday 22 October 1983, the Deputy High Commissioner in Bridgetown, Barbados visited Grenada and reported that Sir Paul Scoon was well and "did not request military intervention, either directly or indirectly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thatcher|first1=Margaret|title=The Downing Street Year|date=Jan 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=9780062029102|page=841}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his book, ''Survival for Service'', Scoon confirmed that he had invited the United States and Caribbean nations to intervene militarily, before the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2013/09/08/paul-scoon-who-had-key-role-invasion-grenada-dies/imPMQVhekcgrDRbqKryBLO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/world/americas/paul-scoon-who-invited-grenada-invaders-dies-at-78.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October, Grenada was invaded by the combined forces of the United States and the [[Regional Security System]] (RSS) based in Barbados, in an operation codenamed ''Operation Urgent Fury''.  The U.S. stated this was done at the request of the prime ministers of Barbados and [[Dominica]], [[Tom Adams (politician)|Tom Adams]] and [[Eugenia Charles|Dame Eugenia Charles]], respectively.  Nonetheless, the invasion was highly criticized by the governments in Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom.  The [[United Nations General Assembly]] condemned it as "a flagrant violation of international law"&lt;ref name="UN_Resolution"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/res/resa38.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001119041100/http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/res/resa38.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 November 2000 |title=United Nations General Assembly resolution 38/7 |publisher=United Nations |date=2 November 1983 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 108 in favour to 9, with 27 abstentions.&lt;ref name="UN_Resolution_Vote"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1309/is_v21/ai_3073305 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627152449/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1309/is_v21/ai_3073305 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-27 |title=Assembly calls for cessation of "armed intervention" in Grenada |work=UN Chronicle |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Nations Security Council considered a similar resolution, which failed to pass when vetoed by the United States.

==First day of the invasion==
The invasion commenced at 05:00 on 25 October 1983. U.S. forces refuelled and departed from the [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] on the nearby [[Caribbean]] island of [[Barbados]] before daybreak en route to Grenada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-airport boss recalls Cubana crash |last=Carter |first=Gercine |url=http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/ex-airport-boss-recalls-cubana-crash/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124195240/http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/ex-airport-boss-recalls-cubana-crash/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 January 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first major operation conducted by the U.S. military since the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Joseph Metcalf, III]], Commander [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]], was the overall commander of U.S. forces, designated Joint Task Force 120, which included elements of each military service and multiple special operations units. Fighting continued for several days and the total number of U.S. troops reached some 7,000 along with 300 troops from the Organization of American States [[Organization of American States|(OAS)]]. The invading forces encountered about 1,500 Grenadian soldiers and about 700 armed [[Cuba]]n nationals manning defensive positions. Grenada's security forces possessed no tanks, only eight [[BTR-60|BTR-60PB]] armored personnel carriers and two [[BRDM-2]] scout cars they had received from the Soviet Union in February 1981.&lt;ref name="PH2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Huchthausen|title=America's Splendid Little Wars: A Short History of U.S. Engagements from the Fall of Saigon to Baghdad|location=New York| publisher=Penguin|year=2004|page=69|isbn=0-14-200465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;''Grenada 1983'' by Lee E.

The main objectives on the first day of the invasion were the capture of the [[Point Salines International Airport]] by the [[75th Ranger Regiment]], to permit the [[82nd Airborne Division]] to land reinforcements on the island; the capture of [[Pearls Airport]] by the [[8th Marine Regiment]]; and the rescue of the U.S. students at the True Blue Campus of [[St. George's University]]. In addition, a number of special operations missions were undertaken to obtain intelligence and secure key individuals and equipment. In general, many of these missions were plagued by inadequate intelligence, planning, and accurate maps of any kind (the U.S. forces mostly relied upon tourist maps).

===Cuban forces in Grenada===
The nature of the Cuban military presence in Grenada was more complex than initially thought.&lt;ref name="Castro"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jorge | last = Dominguez|title = To Make a World Safe for Revolution: Cuba's Foreign Policy|pages=154–253 | publisher = Center for International Affairs| isbn= 978-0674893252}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], and other nations with large numbers of Cuban troops, the line between civilians and military personnel was blurred. For example, [[Fidel Castro]] often described Cuban construction crews deployed overseas as "workers and soldiers at the same time," the dual nature of their role being consistent with Havana's 'citizen soldier' tradition.&lt;ref name="Castro" /&gt; At the time of the invasion, there were an estimated 784 Cuban nationals on the island.&lt;ref name="Demographic"&gt;Domínguez, Jorge I. (1989). ''To Make a World Safe for Revolution: Cuba's Foreign Policy''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-674-89325-5}}. pp. 168–69&lt;/ref&gt; At least 636 Cubans were formally listed as construction workers, another 64 as military personnel, and 18 as dependents. The remainder were either medical staff or teachers.&lt;ref name="Demographic" /&gt; Colonel Pedro Tortoló Comas, the highest ranking Cuban military official in Grenada in 1983, later stated that he issued weapons and ammunition to many of the construction workers for the purpose of self-defense.&lt;ref name="Demographic" /&gt; According to journalist [[Bob Woodward]] in his book ''Veil'', captured "military advisors" from socialist countries were actually accredited diplomats and their dependents. None, Woodward claimed, took any actual part in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Woodward, Bob |title=Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981–1987 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have asserted that most of the supposed civil technicians on Grenada were Cuban special forces and combat engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leckie, Robert |title=The Wars of America |publisher=Castle Books |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban nationals were expressly forbidden to surrender to U.S. forces.&lt;ref name="Demographic" /&gt;

===Navy SEAL reconnaissance missions===
U.S. Special Operations Forces were deployed to Grenada beginning on 23 October, before the 25 October invasion. U.S. Navy SEALs from [[SEAL Team Six]] with Air Force combat controllers were airdropped at sea to perform a reconnaissance mission on Point Salines, resulting in four SEALs dying. The bodies of Machinist Mate 1st Class Kenneth J. Butcher, Quartermaster 1st Class Kevin E. Lundberg, Hull Technician 1st Class Stephen L. Morris and Senior Chief Engineman Robert R. Schamberger were never recovered. The survivors continued their mission, but their boats flooded while evading a patrol boat, causing the mission to be aborted. A SEAL mission on 24 October also was unsuccessful due to harsh weather, resulting in little intelligence being gathered in advance of the impending U.S. intervention.&lt;ref name="Navy SEAL Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=SEAL History: Navy SEALs in Grenada Operation URGENT FURY|url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-navy-seals-in-grenada|publisher=Navy SEAL Museum|accessdate=6 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316041137/https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-navy-seals-in-grenada|archive-date=16 March 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air assault on Point Salines ===
[[File:Op Urgent Fury Invasion Map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Initial troop invasion areas]]

At midnight on 24 October, A and B companies of the 1st Battalion of the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] embarked on [[C-130]]s at [[Hunter Army Airfield]] to perform an air assault landing on [[Point Salines International Airport]]. Initially intending to land at the airport and then disembark, the Rangers had to switch abruptly to a parachute landing when it was learned mid-flight that the runway was obstructed.  The air drop began at 05:30 on 25 October in the face of moderate resistance from [[ZU-23]] anti-aircraft guns and several BTR-60 APCs, the latter of which were knocked out by [[M67 recoilless rifle|90mm recoilless rifles]]. [[AC-130]] gunships provided support for the landing. Cuban construction vehicles were commandeered to help clear the airfield, and one was even used to provide mobile cover for the Rangers as they moved to seize the heights surrounding the airfield.&lt;ref name=Stuart&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Richard W.|title=Operation Urgent Fury: The Invasion of Grenada, October 1983|date=2008|publisher=U.S. Army|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/grenada/urgent_fury.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10:00, the airstrip had been cleared of obstructions and transport planes were able to land and unload additional reinforcements, including [[M151|M151 Jeeps]] and elements of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]], who were assigned to guard the perimeter and detainees.  Starting at 14:00, units from the [[82nd Airborne Division]], under MG [[Edward Trobaugh]], began landing at Point Salines, including battalions of the [[325th Infantry Regiment]]. At 15:30, a counterattack by three BTR-60s of the Grenadian Army Motorized Company was repelled with fire from recoilless rifles and an AC-130.&lt;ref name=CombatReform&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning the Tide: Operation Urgent Fury|url=http://www.combatreform.org/grenada.htm|website=Combat Reform|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rangers fanned out and secured the surrounding area, including negotiating the surrender of over a hundred Cubans in an aviation hangar. However, a Jeep-mounted Ranger patrol became lost searching for [[Saint George's University|True Blue Campus]] and was ambushed, with four killed. The Rangers eventually secured True Blue campus and its students, where they were shocked to discover only 140 students, and were told that more were at another campus in Grand Anse. In all, the Rangers lost five men on the first day, but succeeded in securing Point Salines and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Stuart /&gt;

===Capture of Pearls Airport===
Close to midnight on 24 October, a platoon of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 4 under Lieutenant Mike Walsh approached the beach near [[Pearls Airport]]. After evading patrol boats and overcoming stormy weather, they found that the beach was undefended, but unsuitable for an amphibious landing. The 2nd Battalion of the [[8th Marine Regiment]] then landed south of Pearls Airport using [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] and [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters at 05:30 on 25 October. The Marines then captured Pearls Airport, encountering only light resistance, including a [[DShK]] machine gun which was destroyed by a Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]].&lt;ref name=Kreisher&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreisher|first1=Otto|title=Operation URGENT FURY – Grenada|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada|publisher=Marine Corps Association &amp; Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raid on Radio Free Grenada===
In the early morning of 25 October, [[UH-60 Blackhawk]] helicopters delivered [[SEAL Team 6]] operators to Radio Free Grenada with the purpose of using the radio station for [[PsyOps|psychological operations]]. The station was captured unopposed and the SEALs destroyed the radio transmitter. However, a counter-attack with cars and an armored personnel carrier forced the lightly-armed SEALs to cut a fence and retreat into the ocean as they received fire from the armored personnel carrier. The SEALs swam to the USS Guam (LPH-9). At least two SEALs were seriously wounded and bleeding, one with a shoulder injury and the other with a calf injury. Both SEALs were transferred by helicopter to the USS Independence (CV-62); one was carried in a stretcher by AO2 Wilczynski and others to the medical unit for treatment.&lt;ref name="Navy SEAL Museum &amp; Robert Wilczynski's Personal experience on-board CV-62"/&gt;

===Raids on Fort Rupert and Richmond Hill Prison===
On 25 October, [[Delta Force]] and C Company of the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] embarked in [[UH-60 Blackhawk|MH-60]] and [[MH-6 Little Bird]] helicopters of [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment|Task Force 160]] to capture Fort Rupert, where the leadership of the Revolutionary Council was believed to reside, and Richmond Hill Prison, where political prisoners were being held. The raid on Richmond Hill Prison lacked vital intelligence, including the fact that several anti-aircraft guns defended the prison, and that the prison was on a steep hill without room for a helicopter to land. Anti-aircraft fire wounded passengers and crew, and forced one MH-60 helicopter to crash land, causing another helicopter to land next to it to protect the survivors. One pilot was killed, and the Delta Force operators had to be relieved by a separate force of Rangers. The raid on Fort Rupert, however, was successful in capturing several leaders of the [[People's Revolutionary Government]].&lt;ref name="CombatReform"/&gt;

===Mission to rescue Governor General Scoon===
The last major special operation was a mission to rescue and evacuate [[Paul Scoon|Governor General Paul Scoon]] from his mansion in [[Saint George, Grenada]]. The mission departed late at 05:30 on 25 October from Barbados, resulting in the Grenadian forces being already aware of the U.S. invasion. They closely guarded Governor Scoon. Although the SEAL team's entry into the mansion went unopposed, a counterattack led by [[BTR-60]] armored personnel carriers trapped the SEALs and the governor inside. [[AC-130]] gunships, [[A-7 Corsair]] strike planes, and [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but the SEALs remained trapped for the next 24 hours.

[[File:AH-1S firing cannon Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|right|A U.S. Army AH-1S Cobra attack helicopter opens fire on an enemy position]]

At 19:00 on 25 October, 250 U.S. Marines from G Company of the [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd Marine Assault Unit]] equipped with [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle|amphibious assault vehicles]] and four [[M60 Patton]] tanks landed at Grand Mal Bay, and relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, 26 October, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.&lt;ref name="Kreisher" /&gt;

=== Airstrikes ===
Airstrikes were undertaken by [[U.S. Navy]] [[A-7 Corsair]]s as well as [[U.S. Marine]] [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians.&lt;ref name="dtic" /&gt;{{rp|62}} Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five KIA.&lt;ref name="Kreisher" /&gt;

==Second day of the invasion==
On the second day, the U.S. ground commander, General Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division, had two goals: securing the perimeter around Salines Airport and rescuing U.S. students held in Grand Anse. Because of the lack of undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day, the Army had to delay pursuing the second objective until it made contact with Marine forces.

===Attack on the Cuban compound===
Early on the morning of the 26 October, a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment was ambushed by Cuban forces near the village of Calliste, suffering six wounded and two killed in the ensuing firefight, including the commander of Company B. Following that, U.S. Navy air strikes and an artillery bombardment by [[M102 howitzer|105mm howitzers]] targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. US forces pushed on into the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. There, a reconnaissance platoon mounted on gun-jeeps was ambushed by Cuban forces, but return fire from the jeeps, and mortars from a nearby infantry unit inflicted four casualties on the ambushers with no U.S. losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt;

===Rescue at Grand Anse===
On the afternoon of 26 October, US Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the Ranger Regiment mounted U.S. Marine [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus guards offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, but one of the helicopters crashed on the approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The 233 U.S. students present were successfully evacuated by [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters, but informed the U.S. commanders that there was a third campus with U.S. students at Prickly Bay.&lt;ref name="Kreisher" /&gt; A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by the [[USS Caron]] at 23:00.&lt;ref name="CombatReform" /&gt;

==Third day of the invasion and after==
By 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the U.S. forces did not yet realize this. The Marine 22nd MAU and 8th Regiment continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single BTR-60 during the night and dispatched it with a [[M72 LAW]]. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward Saint George, capturing Grand Anse (where they discovered 20 U.S. students they had missed the first day), the town of Ruth Howard, and the capital of Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An A-7 airstrike called by an air-naval gunfire liaison team accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died of wounds.&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt;

[[File:Explosion2 during Grenada invasion 1983.JPEG|thumb|right|Bombardment of Point Calivigny]]

The Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into ocean), [[A-7 Corsair]]s, [[AC-130]]s, and the [[USS Caron]]. However, when the [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks, they approached too fast. One of them crash-landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.&lt;ref name="CombatReform" /&gt;

In the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers.

On 1 November, two companies from the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of [[Carriacou]] 17 miles (27&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Grenada. The nineteen Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada |title=Operation URGENT FURY – Grenada |last=Kreisher |first=Otto |date=October 2003 |website=Marine Corps Association and Foundation | accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
Official U.S. sources state that some of their opponents were well prepared and well positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the U.S. called in two [[battalion]]s of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October. The total naval and air superiority of the coalition forces—including [[helicopter gunship]]s and [[naval gunfire support]] as well as members of reserve [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]], had overwhelmed the defenders.

Nearly 8,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines had participated in Operation Urgent Fury along with 353 Caribbean allies of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]]s. U.S. forces sustained 19 killed and 116 wounded; Cuban forces sustained 25 killed, 59 wounded, and 638 combatants captured. Grenadian forces suffered 45 dead and 358 wounded; at least 24 civilians were also killed, 18 of whom died in the accidental bombing of a Grenadian mental hospital.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|62}} The U.S. also destroyed a significant amount of Grenada's military hardware, including six APCs and an armored car.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; A second armored car was impounded and later shipped back to [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] for inspection.&lt;ref name="BRDM"&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160812115858/http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Fortitudine%20Vol%2015%20No%204_2.pdf Fortitudine: Newsletter of the Marine Corps Historical Program, Volumes 15–18]''.

==Legality of US invasion==
The US government defended its invasion of Grenada as an action to protect American citizens, including medical students, living on the island. "Action was necessary to resolve what Article 28 of...[the charter of the [[Organization of American States]] (O.A.S.)] refers to as a 'situation that might endanger the peace,'" said US Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam, adding that "Both the O.A.S. Charter, in articles 22 and 28, and the U.N. Charter, in Article 52, recognize the competence of regional security bodies in ensuring regional peace and stability."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 15 Nov. 1983, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/world/us-defending-grenada-action-before-oas.html U.S. Defending Grenada Action Before O.A.S.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dam was referring the decision by the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]] to approve the invasion. 

However, scholars of international law have concluded that the invasion constituted neither justifiable self-defense (because there was no credible imminent threat to the US), nor humanitarian intervention or rescue (because there was no credible immediate danger to US citizens), and, in any case, the US invasion far exceeded in the scope and magnitude of force used and in duration any action that would have been necessary to remove US citizens. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force by member states except in cases of self defense or when specifically authorized by the [[UN Security Council]]. The UN Security Council had not even considered the matter, let alone authorized invasion.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Karas and Jerald M. Goodman, "The United States Action in Grenada: An Exercise in Real Politik", 16 U. Miami Inter-Am. L.

==Reaction in the United States==
[[File:Citizens of Grenada-US leaflet.jpg|thumb|Leaflet distributed during the invasion by 9th PSYOP Bn]]
A month after the invasion, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine described it as having "broad popular support." A [[United States Congress|congressional]] study group concluded that the invasion had been justified, as most members felt that U.S. students at the university near a contested runway could have been taken hostage as [[Iran hostage crisis|U.S. diplomats in Iran]] had been four years previously. The group's report caused [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to change his position on the issue from opposition to support.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;

[[File:M102 howitzers during Operation Urgent Fury.jpg|thumb|left|M102 howitzers of 1st Bn 320th FA, 82D Abn Div firing during battle]] However, some members of the study group dissented from its findings. Congressman [[Louis Stokes]], D-Ohio, stated: "Not a single American child nor single American national was in any way placed in danger or placed in a hostage situation prior to the invasion."  The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] denounced the invasion and seven [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressmen, led by [[Ted Weiss]], introduced an unsuccessful resolution to [[impeach]] Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;

In the evening of 25 October 1983 by telephone, on the newscast ''[[Nightline]]'', anchor [[Ted Koppel]] spoke to medical students on Grenada who stated that they were safe and did not feel their lives were in danger. The next evening, again by telephone, medical students told Koppel how grateful they were for the invasion and the Army Rangers, which probably saved their lives. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] officials had assured the medical students that they would be able to complete their medical school education in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=656934 Nightline – 25 Oct 1983 – ABC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/diglib-fulldisplay.pl?SID=20100809760314941&amp;code=tvn&amp;RC=656937&amp;Row=341 Television News Archive: Nightline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
[[File:Grenada Invasion.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of invasion plan]]
On 2 November 1983 by a vote of 108 in favour to 9 voting against ([[Antigua and Barbuda]], Barbados, [[Dominica]], El Salvador, [[Israel]], Jamaica, [[Saint Lucia]], Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United States), with 27 abstentions, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted General Assembly Resolution 38/7, which "deeply deplores the armed intervention in Grenada, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State."&lt;ref name=UN_GA_Resolution_38_7 /&gt; It went on to deplore "the death of innocent civilians" the "killing of the prime Minister and other prominent Grenadians" and called for an "immediate cessation of the armed intervention" and demanded "that free elections be organized".

This was the first military [[rollback]] of a Communist nation.  The Soviet Union said that Grenada had for a long time been the object of United States threats, that the invasion violated international law, and that no small nation not to the liking of the United States would find itself safe if the aggression against Grenada were not rebuffed. The governments of some countries stated that the United States intervention was a return to the era of barbarism. The governments of other countries said the United States by its invasion had violated several treaties and conventions to which it was a party.&lt;ref&gt;''United Nations Yearbook'', Volume 37, 1983, Department of Public Information, United Nations, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar resolution was discussed in the [[United Nations Security Council]] and although receiving widespread support it was ultimately [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|vetoed]] by the United States.&lt;ref name=Zunes&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zunes |first=Stephen |title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada: A Twenty Year Retrospective |publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus |date=October 2003 |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/history/2003/10grenada.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spartacus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDgrenada.htm |title=Spartacus Educational |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629064517/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDgrenada.htm |archivedate=29 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="un veto"/&gt;

President of the United States [[Ronald Reagan]], when asked if he was concerned by the lopsided 108–9 vote in the [[UN General Assembly]], said, "it didn't upset my breakfast at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19831104&amp;id=uDcSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6O4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5592,2048008 |title=Reagan: Vote loss in U.N.

Grenada is part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and, following the invasion, it requested help from other Commonwealth members. The intervention was opposed by Commonwealth members including the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada, among others.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|50}} British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], a close ally of Reagan on other matters, personally opposed the U.S. invasion. Reagan told her it might happen; she did not know for sure it was coming until three hours before. At 12:30 on the morning of the invasion, Thatcher sent a message to Reagan:

{{quote|This action will be seen as intervention by a Western country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime. I ask you to consider this in the context of our wider East/West relations and of the fact that we will be having in the next few days to present to our Parliament and people the siting of [[Cruise missile]]s in this country. I must ask you to think most carefully about these points. I cannot conceal that I am deeply disturbed by your latest communication. You asked for my advice. I have set it out and hope that even at this late stage you will take it into account before events are irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=109427|title=Thatcher letter to Reagan ("deeply disturbed" at U.S. plans) [memoirs extract]|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=25 October 1983|accessdate=25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, Margaret (1993) ''The Downing Street Years'' p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; (The full text remains classified.)}}

Reagan told Thatcher before anyone else that the invasion would begin in a few hours, but ignored her complaints. She publicly supported the U.S. action. Reagan phoned to apologize for the miscommunication{{what|date=October 2018}}, and the long-term friendly relationship endured.&lt;ref&gt;John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (2011) pp. 273–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Williams, "'A Matter of Regret': Britain, the 1983 Grenada Crisis, and the Special Relationship."

==Aftermath==

[[File:Urgent fury civilians waiting.jpg|thumb|left|American students waiting to be evacuated from Grenada]]
Following the U.S. victory, the American and Caribbean governments quickly reaffirmed Scoon as Queen Elizabeth II's sole legitimate representative in Grenada—and hence, the only lawful authority on the island. In accordance with Commonwealth constitutional practice, Scoon assumed power as interim head of government, and formed an advisory council which named [[Nicholas Brathwaite]] as chairman pending new elections.&lt;ref name=z9f6WdltuE/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; [[Grenadian general election, 1984|Elections held in December 1984]] were won by the [[Grenada National Party]] and a government was formed led by Prime Minister [[Herbert Blaize]].

[[File:A-7E over Port Salines airfield Grenada 1983.jpg|thumb|right|A [[VFA-87|VA-87]] [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7E]] from [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS ''Independence'']] over Port Salines airfield]]
U.S. forces remained in Grenada after combat operations finished in December as part of Operation Island Breeze. Elements remaining, including [[Military Police Corps (United States Army)|military police]], [[U.S. special forces|special forces]], and a specialized [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|intelligence detachment]], performed security missions and assisted members of the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force and the Royal Grenadian Police Force. &lt;!--&lt;ref name=Sundin/&gt; --&gt;

The [[Point Salines International Airport]] was renamed in honor of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop on 29 May 2009, the 65th anniversary of his birth.&lt;ref name="airport_rename1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="airport_rename2" /&gt; Hundreds of Grenadians turned out to commemorate the event. [[Tillman Thomas]], Prime Minister of Grenada, gave the keynote speech and referred to the renaming as an act of the Grenadian people coming home to themselves.&lt;ref name="Grenadian_Connection"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.grenadianconnection.com/Grenada/ViewNews.asp?NID=6835&amp;CID=15008&amp;TC=701&amp;EP=381&amp;yr=2009&amp;Cat=0000 |title=Prime Minister Speech at Airport Renaming Ceremony |date=30 May 2009 |website=Grenadian Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also hoped that it would help bring closure to a chapter of denial in Grenada's history.

===United States===

====US disinformation====
The invasion showed problems with the U.S. government's "information apparatus," which ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' described as still being in "some disarray" three weeks after the invasion.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; --&gt;  For example, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] falsely claimed that a [[mass grave]] had been discovered that held 100 bodies of islanders who had been killed by communist forces.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; Major General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]], deputy commander of the invasion force, said that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans had been killed during the invasion; [[the Pentagon]] had given a much lower count of 59 Cuban and Grenadian deaths.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; Ronald H. Cole's [[Invasion of Grenada#The Invasion|report]] for the Joint Chiefs of Staff showed an even lower count.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;

====Lack of communication and information====
Also of concern were the problems that the invasion showed with the military. There was a lack of intelligence about Grenada, which exacerbated the difficulties faced by the quickly assembled invasion force.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; --&gt;  For example, it was not known that the students were actually at two different campuses and there was a thirty-hour delay in reaching students at the second campus.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;  Maps provided to soldiers on the ground were tourist maps on which [[Military Grid Reference System|military grid reference lines]] were drawn by hand to report locations of units and request artillery and aircraft fire support. They also did not show [[topography]] and were not marked with crucial positions. [[U.S. Navy]] ships providing naval gunfire and U.S. Marine, [[U.S. Air Force]] and Navy fighter/bomber support aircraft providing close air support mistakenly fired upon and killed U.S. ground forces due to differences in charts and location coordinates, data, and methods of calling for fire support. Communications between services were also noted as not being compatible and hindered the coordination of operations. The landing strip was drawn by hand on the map given to some members of the invasion force.{{citation needed|date=May 2007}}

====Role of Vietnam Syndrome====
Conservative US leaders, and Ronald Reagan in particular, had long complained about the "[[Vietnam Syndrome]]," the aversion on the part of the American people to U.S. military operations following the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald, 18 August 1980, "Address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in Chicago," http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=85202&lt;/ref&gt; The Reagan administration hoped that the perceived success of the invasion of Grenada would help dispel the Vietnam Syndrome so that the American public could be successfully galvanized to support new US military actions,&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International]], 28 May 1984, [https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/28/Reagans-view-of-Vietnam-War-unwavering/1916454564800/ Reagan's View of Vietnam War Unwavering] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy, 7 Jun. 2010, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/06/07/think-again-ronald-reagan/ "Think Again: Ronald Reagan, The Gipper Wasn't the Warhound His Conservative Followers Would Have You Think"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Angeles Times]], 2 Mar. 1991, [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-02/news/mn-1736_1_vietnam-syndrome U.S. Shakes Off Torment of Vietnam]&lt;/ref&gt; with President Reagan after the invasion declaring: "Our days of weakness are over. Our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall."&lt;ref&gt;[[Baltimore Sun]], 13 Dec. 1983, "Days of Weakness Over, Reagan Tells War Heroes" &lt;/ref&gt;

====Fictionalized version in film====
A heavily fictionalized account of the invasion from a U.S. military perspective is shown in the 1986 [[Clint Eastwood]] motion picture ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'', in which Marines replaced the actual roles of U.S. Army units. Due to the movie's portrayal of several incompetent officers and NCOs, the Army withdrew its support of the movie.

===Goldwater-Nichols Act===
{{Main|Goldwater-Nichols Act}}
[[File:Grenada barracks before and after attack 1983.jpg|thumb|Calivigny barracks before and after being bombed]]

Analysis by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] showed a need for improved communications and coordination between the branches of the U.S. forces. [[U.S. Congress]]ional investigations of many of the reported problems resulted in the most important legislative change affecting the U.S. military organization, doctrine, career progression, and operating procedures since the end of World War II: the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act|Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986]] (Pub. L.99–433).

The Goldwater-Nichols Act reworked the command structure of the United States military, thereby making the most sweeping changes to the United States Department of Defense since the department was established in the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. It increased the powers of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and created the concept of a truly unified joint U.S. forces (i.e., Army, Air Force, Marines, and Naval forces organized under one command). One of the first reorganizations resulting from both the Department of Defense analysis and the legislation was the formation of the [[U.S. Special Operations Command]] in 1987.

===Other===
[[File:GrenadaMemorial.jpg|left|thumb|SGU Campus Memorial]]
October 25 is a national holiday in Grenada, called [[Thanksgiving Day#Grenada|Thanksgiving Day]], to commemorate the invasion.

[[St. George's University]] (SGU) built a monument on its [[St. George's University|True Blue Campus]] to memorialize the U.S. servicemen killed during the invasion, and marks the day with an annual memorial ceremony.

In 2008, the [[Government of Grenada]] announced a move to build a monument to honour the Cubans killed during the invasion. At the time of the announcement the [[Government of Cuba|Cuban]] and Grenadian governments are still seeking to identify a suitable site for the monument.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110526020758/http://www.nationnews.com/304534390906229.php For Cubans] ''The Nation Newspaper'', 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1986 film ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' by [[Clint Eastwood]] follows a group of Marines preparing for and participating in the invasion.

The 1990 film ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' mentioned Grenada when a unit of soldiers talked among themselves about the invasion.

The 1994 film ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' mentioned Grenada when one of the main characters claimed he witnessed the invasion.

In the 2013 movie ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', the invasion of Grenada is used as a metaphor for a court case that is impossible to lose.

In 2012 and 2014 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketches where Bill Hader attends a puppet class and uses his puppet to tell his grim stories of the invasion.

The ''[[Yes Prime Minister]]'' episode ''[[A Victory for Democracy]]'' parodies the invasion using a fictitious British Commonwealth country called St George's Island located in the Indian Ocean and under threat of Communist invasion and American counter-invasion.

'''Ursula Klein''' (born 1952) is a German [[history of science|historian of science]] known for her cross-disciplinary work in history, [[philosophy]] and [[semiotics]]. Klein's concept of a [[paper tool]] has been widely applied, and is seen as marking a foundational change in scientific reasoning and practice in the history of chemistry in the early 19th century.

Klein is a senior research scholar at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].  In 2016 she received the HIST Award for outstanding achievements in the history of chemistry from the [[American Chemical Society]].

==Education==
Klein completed her Higher State Exam in chemistry and biology in 1979.&lt;ref name="MaxBio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursula Klein|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/users/klein|website=Max Planck Institute for the History of Science|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After studying chemistry and biology at the [[Free University of Berlin]], she taught both subjects at the secondary level from 1980 to 1988.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Academia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Ursula Klein|url=http://www.academia-net.org/profil/prof-dr-ursula-klein/1133837|website=Academia Net|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned her [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy (''summa cum laude'') from the [[University of Konstanz]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;  Her work ''Verbindung und Affinität: Die Grundlegung der neuzeitlichen Chemie'' (1994) explored the 18th century meaning of "chemical  compound".&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verbindung"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Ursula|title=Verbindung und Affinität. Die Grundlegung der neuzeitlichen Chemie an der Wende vom 17. zum 18. Jahrhundert|date=1994|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Basel}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received [[Habilitation]] in philosophy from the University of Konstanz in 2000.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1995 Klein became a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; In 2005, she became a Senior research scholar at the Max Planck Institute.&lt;ref name="MaxBio"/&gt; She became an unscheduled professor at the University of Konstanz  in 2007, teaching only occasionally.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

Klein is an associate editor of ''[[Studies in History and Philosophy of Science ]]''&lt;ref name="MaxBio"/&gt; and ''[[Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences]]'',.&lt;ref name="HSNS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences|url=http://cstms.berkeley.edu/publications/hsns/|website=Center for Science, Technology, Medicine &amp; Society|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also serves on the editorial boards of ''[[Ambix]]'',&lt;ref name="Academia"/&gt; ''[[Annals of Science]]'',&lt;ref name="Academia"/&gt; and  ''[[Hyle]]''.&lt;ref name="Hyle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyle International Journal  for Philosophy of Chemistry ISSN 1433-5158|url=http://www.hyle.org/|website=Hyle|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being named a member of [[Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher/Leopoldina]] as of 2008, Ursula Klein also serves on the Human Rights Committee (HRC) of the Leopoldina.&lt;ref name="Leopoldina"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Committee (HRC) of the Leopoldina|url=http://www.leopoldina.org/en/international-issues/human-rights-committee/|website=Leopoldina|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

Over her career Klein has mentored a number of historians whose work now engages with  the broader historical ontology developed in her research on the experimental sciences.   This group of scholars includes Carsten Reinhardt at Bielefeld University (former director of the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia, USA), Emma Spary at Cambridge University, Maria Rentetzi at the National Technical University of Athens, José Ramón Bertomeu-Sánchez at the University of Valencia and Matthew Daniel Eddy at Durham University.

==Research==

===Paper tools===
Klein's interdisciplinary work draws upon history, philosophy of science, [[epistemology]] and [[semiotics]]. She is interested in the manipulation of [[sign systems]] on paper and their relationships with experimental and classificatory performance in the laboratory sciences.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Mary S.|chapter=Modelling as a method of inquiry|title=The world in the model : how economists work and think|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521176194|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/Morgan/Morgan%20Chap1%20Modelling%20as%20a%20Method%20of%20Enquiry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Experiments"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Ursula|title=Experiments, models, paper tools : cultures of organic chemistry in the nineteenth century|date=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif|isbn=9780804743594}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}

Klein introduced the concept of the [[paper tool]] through an examination of [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius|Berzelian]] formulas and their impact on inorganic and organic chemistry.&lt;ref name="Berzelian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Ursula|title=Berzelian formulas as paper tools in early nineteenth-century chemistry|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|date=2001|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7–32|doi=10.1023/A:1011460318779|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/KLEBFA|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berzelian formulas were particularly important because they connected a world of signs with the world of laboratory experimentation.&lt;ref name="Lightman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Bernard|title=A Companion to the History of Science|date=2016|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9781118620779|pages=561-562|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q918CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA561|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They enabled scientists to describe complex materials and reactions in organic chemistry in organized ways, similar to the ways in which chemists had identified and classified inorganic substances.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Morgan|editor-first1=Mary S.|editor-last2=Morrison|editor-first2=Margaret|title=Models as mediators : perspectives on natural and social sciences|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521655712|last=Klein|first=Ursula|pages=146-167|chapter=Chapter 6: Techniques of modelling and paper-tools in classical chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berzelian"/&gt;

Berzelian formulas offered a graphically suggestible representation of compositional structure that could be manipulated to investigate chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="Lundgren 2003"/&gt;  In this way, formulas became a "material resource" for the creation and manipulation of chemical models.&lt;ref name="Lightman"/&gt; 
These interpretive models of organic reactions were not based on a particular theory but could be applied to a variety of theories. They gave scientists a new tool for the examination of their ideas. Theories could be supported by the manipulation of Berzelian formulas as well as by experiments.&lt;ref name="Lundgren 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lundgren|first1=Anders|title=Ursula Klein.

The idea of paper tools has been adopted since by others and applied to constructs such as [[periodic tables]],&lt;ref name="Scerri"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Klein|editor-first1=Ursula|last=Scerri|first=Eric |chapter=The periodic table: The ultimate paper tool in chemistry|title=Tools and modes of representation in the laboratory sciences|date=2001|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-90-481-5859-1|pages=163-177|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-94-015-9737-1|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Benjamin R.|title=The Element of the Table: Visual Discourse and the Preperiodic Representation of Chemical Classification|journal=Configurations|date=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=41–75|doi=10.1353/con.2005.0001|url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/25225/12.1cohen.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feynman diagrams]]&lt;ref name="Lightman"/&gt; and the molecular architecture of [[Linus Pauling]], among others.&lt;ref name="Nye"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Klein|editor-first1=Ursula|last=Nye|first=Mary Jo|chapter=Paper Tools and Molecular Architecture in the Chemistry of Linus Pauling|title=Tools and modes of representation in the laboratory sciences|date=2001|pages=117-132|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-90-481-5859-1|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-94-015-9737-1|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Klein examines paper tools, models and experiments in terms of their impact on scientific reasoning and practice in early-nineteenth-century organic chemistry in her book ''Experiments, models, paper tools'' (2003).&lt;ref name="Experiments"/&gt; She is credited with identifying the "invisible turning point" of a "quiet revolution" which shifted chemistry's foundation from natural history, medicine and pharmacy to carbon chemistry.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

===Ontology of materials===
Much of Klein's work has focused on the [[ontology]] of [[materials]], the notion of substance, and the development of the observational and experimental sciences. She is particularly interested in  forms of knowledge, including bodily skills, technical competence, [[explicit knowledge]], [[connoisseur]]ship, and analytic and theoretical knowledge; and in methods of [[measurement]], [[data collection]], and [[classification]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Georgette|title=Materials in Eighteenth-Century Science: A Historical Ontology by Ursula Klein and Wolfgang Lefèvre|journal=Aestimatio|date=2007|volume=4|pages=101–111|url=http://www.ircps.org/sites/ircps.org/files/aestimatio/4/2007-06-01_Taylor.pdf|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|title=Materials and Expertise in Early Modern Europe|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo8153903.html|website=The University of Chicago Press Books|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthenberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruthenberg|first1=Klaus|last2=Brakel|first2=Jaap van|title=Stuff : the nature of chemical substances|date=2008|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|location=Würzburg|isbn=9783826037047|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ExJ5JeVE00C&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Materials in Eighteenth-Century Sciences'' (2007)&lt;ref name="Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Ursula|last2=Lefèvre|first2=Wolfgang|title=Materials in eighteenth-century sciences : a historical ontology|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262113069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein and Lefèvre discuss ways in which eighteenth century chemistry  was grounded in a world of materials such as [[balsams]], fats, [[salts]], [[alloys]], plant materials and [[blood]], and practiced in a wide variety of settings including “apothecary's shops, foundries, assaying laboratories, arsenals, dye manufactories, distilleries, [and] coffee shops.”&lt;ref name="Pawley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pawley|first1=Emily|title=Materials Matter|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Fall 2008|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/materials-matter|volume=26|number=3|page=44|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then focus on a transitional period in eighteenth-century European chemistry, around 1830. At this time, methods of classification of substances changed, from focusing on experiential classification such as chemical composition, provenance, and properties of the substance, to more fundamental levels such as chemical structure and application. The book was praised for its breadth and "well-written exposition of an important change in materials science".&lt;ref name="Westbrook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westbrook|first1=Jack H.|title=''Materials in Eighteenth-Century Science: A Historical Ontology'' (review)|journal=Technology and Culture|date=2008|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1104–1105|doi=10.1353/tech.0.0155|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/255541|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander von Humboldt===
Klein's most recent publication, ''Humboldts Preußen. Wissenschaft und Technik im Aufbruch'' (2015), discusses [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and his contemporaries in the context of the early development of Prussian science and technology. Other figures discussed include [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]], [[Franz Karl Achard]], [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] and [[Carl Abraham Gerhard]].&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

'''Vernon''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[McIntosh County, Oklahoma|McIntosh County]], [[Oklahoma]], United States.  Its elevation is 696&amp;nbsp;feet (212&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1099244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vernon was established in 1911 as an all-black community, and is one of thirteen such that still exists. It was named for Bishop W. T. Vernon of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name="EOHC-Vernon"&gt;{{cite web| last=O'Dell | first=Larry | work= [[Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture]]| title=Vernon | accessdate= 2012-05-23 | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/V/VE004.html|  publisher= [[Oklahoma Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fort Smith and Western Railway]], which opened in 1899 and closed in 1939, operated through the town. The FS&amp;W served major coal mining operations in eastern Oklahoma at Coal Creek, [[Bokoshe, Oklahoma|Bokoshe]] and [[McCurtain, Oklahoma|McCurtain]]. Other towns served included [[Crowder, Oklahoma|Crowder]], [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]], [[Boley, Oklahoma|Boley]], [[Prague, Oklahoma|Prague]], Vernon, [[Indianola, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma|Indianola]] and [[Meridian, Logan County, Oklahoma|Meridian]]. A major portion of the road's freight traffic was metallurgical-grade coal from San Bois Coal Company mines near McCurtain. However, the railroad was ultimately abandoned after the [[Great Depression]].

A post office was established in 1920, in what was grocery and [[dry goods]] store; the building, known as [[The Rock Front]], later became a tavern and pool hall and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in McIntosh County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ocgi.okstate.edu/shpo/shpopic.asp?id=84003152 |work= National Register Properties in Oklahoma| title= The Rock Front | accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community is also home to a cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1099245|Vernon Cemetery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1818986|Vernon Post Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West Lothian Archaeological Trust''' was formed on 19 April 2012 and registered as Scottish Charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscr.org.uk/ |title=Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; No. SC043118 on 26 April 2012, having been known informally, since 2007, as West Lothian (Aerial) Archaeology. The Trust also has an interest in sites in England, especially Gloucestershire, where it is known as Stroud Aerial Archaeology.

In May 2013, the Trust was approved as an Associated Partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeolandscapes.eu/index.php/en/about/partners.html |title=ArchaeoLandscapes Europe |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of ArcheoLandscapes Europe (ArcLand), part of the European Union's Culture Programme, to represent its area of expertise. Also in May, the Trust launched The Scottish National Aerial Photography Scheme (SNAPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/snaps.htm |title=The Scottish National Aerial Photography Scheme|accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Trust became a member of the successor to ArcLand Europe, ArcLand International.

==Goals of the Trust==
The aims of the [[Charitable Trust]], as officially registered, are for 'the advancement of heritage and science' by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westlothian.gov.uk/media/pdfdocs/2219063/2344655/HerNewsAut2012 |date=Autumn 2012 |title=West Lothian Heritage: Newsletter of West Lothian Heritage Services |publisher=West Lothian Council |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|(a) Investigating  (with emphasis on non-invasive techniques), recording and publicising (by publication and presentation) the archaeological/heritage sites of [[West Lothian]], and elsewhere.

(b) Promoting the use of [[kite]] aerial photography as a low-cost, inclusive, environmentally friendly technique for archaeological/heritage photography and promoting the use of any other techniques which may be deemed appropriate by the Trustees.

(c) Running and maintaining an archaeological website as part of an associated community and heritage website.}}

==Work of the Trust==
West Lothian Archaeology specialises in [[kite aerial photography]] (KAP) from the near [[ultra-violet]] through to the near&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/phototech07.htm |title=Links: Other IR / UV KAPers |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thermal [[infrared]]&lt;ref&gt; Kite Aerial Thermography, [http://www.bradford.ac.uk/archsci/archprospection/menu.php?0 International Society for Archaeological Prospection], Newsletter, 29, 9-10, November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/aarg/aerarch/papers/Thermal.pdf |title=Thermal prospecting on vegetation |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Thermography]]). KAP is one of many techniques of [[aerial archaeology]] and was first used in an archaeological context by [[Henry Wellcome]] over 100 years ago. For a detailed consideration of kite aerial photography in the near-UV and near-IR, see the online publications of Geert Verhoeven which are listed in the external links below. On-site aerial  photography complements the non-invasive methods of [[geophysical survey (archaeology)]] and images can be used to create virtual 3D models and animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topofly.com/ |title=Low Altitude Aerial Photography and Visualisation of Heritage  |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kite aerial photography is a simple, cheap, technique. A Camera, or phone, is suspended on a kite line about 20m from the kite, on either a Picavet suspension (see [[Kite aerial photography]]) or using a simple selfie stick. Details are given in the Scottish National Aerial Photography Scheme reference 3.

The work of the Trust is published on its Community and Heritage Website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk// |title=Armadale Community and Heritage Website  |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Armadale, West Lothian]] and on its Kite Aerial Remote Sensing Facebook page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/KARSensing |title=Kite Aerial Remote Sensing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust maintains a register of archaeological/heritage kite aerial photographers in the UK and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/groupmembers.htm |title=The Register of Kite Aerial Photographers and Remote Sensing Specialists (UK &amp; Ireland)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing ''Who Killed Homer?'' for [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Francis Fukuyama]] described it as "ostensibly" focused on the decline of classical studies, but "really about the loss of a common, humanistic core in contemporary education and culture."&lt;ref name=FukuyamaReview&gt;Fukuyama, Francis. Foreign Affairs 77, no. 4 (1998): 121-22. doi:10.2307/20048981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
''Who Killed Homer?,'' was a polemic book criticizing classics scholars including [[Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz]], [[Judith Hallett]], and [[Amy Richlin]], who, in the authors' opinion, misinterpreted and debased classical texts in the service of [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[identity politics]] and other political causes.&lt;ref name="KottaTradition"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kotta |first1=Sandra |title=Bald Men Fighting Over a Comb: Arguments About the Classical Tradition |url=https://quillette.com/2017/05/17/bald-men-fighting-comb-arguments-classical-tradition/ |accessdate=6 September 2018 |publisher=Quillette |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisUpdate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Paul |title=Not to Bury Homer but to Update Him |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/07/books/not-to-bury-homer-but-to-update-him.html |accessdate=6 September 2018 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=7 March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7401">The '''Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society''' ('''YAHS'''), formerly known as the '''Yorkshire Archaeological Society''', is a [[learned society]] and registered [[Charitable organization|charity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|224083}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1863. It is dedicated to the study of the [[archaeology]], history and people of the three [[Riding (country subdivision)|Ridings]] of the historic county of [[Yorkshire]]. It publishes an annual [[Academic journal|journal]], the ''Yorkshire Archaeological Journal''; and, particularly through its Record Series, it also functions as a [[text publication society]]. Its headquarters are in [[Leeds]].

The Society has seven special interest groups, such as the Family History or the Roman Antiquities sections. These may be joined without full membership of the main YAHS.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1863 as the '''Huddersfield Archaeological and Topographical Association'''. The initial purpose was to facilitate renewed excavations at [[Slack Roman fort]], and later to promote interest in the history and archaeology of the [[Huddersfield]] area. The principal instigator was [[George Lloyd (archaeologist)|George Lloyd]] (1820–1885).&lt;ref name="HC 9 December 1865" &gt;''Huddersfield Chronicle'' 9 December 1865: "The site of Cambodunum"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 the society expanded its interests to cover the whole of Yorkshire, and changed its name accordingly to the '''Yorkshire Archaeological Society'''. In 1896 it moved its headquarters from Huddersfield to [[Leeds]]. In 2015 it changed its name again to the '''Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society'''.

From 1968 the Society had its headquarters at "Claremont", a large house built in the 1770s, close to the main campus of the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yas.org.uk/content/claremont.html |title=Claremont |publisher=Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations began to sell "Claremont" in 2016, with the aim of opening smaller office accommodation in the same vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yas.org.uk/content/yasblog/2017/01/01/a-happy-new-year-to-all/ |first=Gill |last=Cookson |title=Gill's message to members 1 Jan 2017 |publisher=Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society |date=1 January 2017 |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistory Section==
The Prehistory Section has an active programme and a regular publication for section members called ''The Bulletin''. The aim is to bring together those with an interest in the prehistoric archaeology of the region.

==Roman Antiquities Section==
The Roman Antiquities Section meets for lectures about five times a year. It has an annual ''Bulletin'' for section members and occasional monographs.

==Medieval Section==
The Medieval Section meets about three times a year at locations suited to the subject matter of the day schools. It publishes ''Medieval Yorkshire'', an annual publication free to section members.

==Industrial History Section==
The Industrial History Section has a very active programme of lectures, visits and informal social events. It publishes three newsletters a year for section members.

==Family History Section==
The Family History Section has monthly lectures at Claremont and a Workshop for section members every Tuesday afternoon. It publishes a quarterly newsletter, ''The Yorkshire Family Historian''.

The Society also has two publishing only sections :
# '''The Parish Register Section''' transcribes, annotates and prints Parish Registers from the region. The section's aim is to produce one volume a year.
# '''The Wakefield Court Roll Section''' publishes [[manorial roll]]s from the Manor of Wakefield.

==Collections==
The Society possesses a library of some 45,000 works, which has been described as "probably the largest single resource for research on Yorkshire's past outside the [[British Library]]";&lt;ref&gt;McHugh and Barber 2013, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and also an extensive collection of manuscripts, including many papers of early [[antiquarian]]s. These collections were formerly held at its headquarters, "Claremont"; but in 2015, in anticipation the sale of the building, were transferred to the custody of the [[Brotherton Library]] of the [[University of Leeds]], where they are now accessible through the Library's Special Collections section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections/collection/1176 |title=Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society Collection Guide |work=The University Library: Special Collections |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
