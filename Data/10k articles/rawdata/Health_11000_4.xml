[[File:Abrasion 1.png|thumb|Abrasion occurring on the cervical margins from the effects of friction from toothbrushing and abrasive toothpastes]]

'''Abrasion''' is the non carious, mechanical wears of tooth from interaction with objects other than tooth-tooth contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López-Frías|first=Francisco J.|last2=Castellanos-Cosano|first2=Lizett|last3=Martín-González|first3=Jenifer|last4=Llamas-Carreras|first4=José M.|last5=Segura-Egea|first5=Juan J.|date=2012-02-01|title=Clinical measurement of tooth wear: Tooth wear indices|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e48–e53|doi=10.4317/jced.50592|issn=1989-5488|pmc=3908810|pmid=24558525}}&lt;/ref&gt; It most commonly affects the [[premolar]]s and [[canine tooth|canines]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes-Haley, C., Jones, S. B., Davies, M., &amp; West, N. X. (2016). Establishing the Effect of Brushing and a Day's Diet on Tooth Tissue Loss in Vitro. Dentistry Journal, 4 (3).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on clinical surveys, studies have shown that abrasion is the commonest aetiological factor for development of non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) and is most frequently caused by incorrect toothbrushing technique.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Cesar dos Reis|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Mariana Rodrigues|last3=Prado|first3=Natália Aráujo Silva|last4=Miranda|first4=Marianna Sorozini Ferreira de|last5=Macêdo|first5=Mariana de Andrade|last6=Fernandes|first6=Bárbara Monteiro Pessôa|date=2012|title=Restoration of Noncarious Cervical Lesions: When, Why, and How|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijd/2012/687058/|journal=International Journal of Dentistry|language=en|volume=2012|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2012/687058|issn=1687-8728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrasion frequently presents at the cemento-enamel junction and can be caused by many contributing factors, all with the ability to affect the tooth surface in varying degrees.&lt;ref name="Sugi"&gt;Sugita L, Nakashima S, Ikeda A, Burrow M, Nikaido T. A pilot study to assess the morphology and progression of non-carious cervical lesions. Journal of Dentistry 2017:51-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance may vary depending on the aetiology of abrasion, however most commonly presents in a [[V-shaped]] caused by excessive lateral pressure whilst tooth-brushing. The surface is shiny rather than carious, and sometimes the ridge is deep enough to see the pulp chamber within the tooth itself.

With the presence of non-carious cervical loss due to abrasion, this may lead to consequences and symptoms such as increased tooth sensitivity to hot and cold, increased plaque trapping which will result in caries and periodontal disease, difficulty of dental appliances such as retainer and denture in engaging the tooth, and also it may be aesthetically unpleasant to some people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In order for successful treatment of abrasion to occur, the aetiology first needs to be identified and ceased, e.g. overzealous brushing. Once this has occurred subsequent treatment may involve the changes in oral hygiene or toothpaste, application of fluoride to reduce sensitivity or the placement of a restoration to aid in reducing the progression of further tooth loss.&lt;ref name=Sugi /&gt;

== Aetiology ==
Cause of abrasion may arise from interaction of teeth with other objects such as [[toothbrush]]es, [[toothpick]]s, [[Dental floss|floss]], and ill-fitting dental appliance like retainers and dentures. Apart from that, people with habits such as nail biting, chewing tobacco, lip or tongue piercing,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Moor|first=R J G|last2=Witte|first2=A M J C De|last3=Delmé|first3=K I M|last4=Bruyne|first4=M A A De|last5=Hommez|first5=G M G|last6=Goyvaerts|first6=D|date=October 2005|title=Dental and oral complications of lip and tongue piercings|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/4812852|journal=British Dental Journal|language=En|volume=199|issue=8|pages=506–509|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4812852|issn=1476-5373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having occupation such as joiner, are subjected to higher risks of abrasion.

Abrasion can also occur from the type of dentifrice being utilized as some have more abrasive qualities such as whitening toothpastes.The aetiology of dental abrasion can be due to a single stimuli or, as in most cases, multi-factorial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee A, He LH, Lyons K, Swain MV. Tooth wear and wear investigations in dentistry. Journal of oral rehabilitation. 2012 Mar 1;39(3):217-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cause of dental abrasion, is the combination of mechanical and chemical wear.

Tooth brushing is the most common cause of dental abrasion, which is found to develop along the [[gingival margin]], due to vigorous brushing in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Sadaf D, Ahmad Z. Role of brushing and occlusal forces in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL). International journal of biomedical science: IJBS. 2014 Dec;10(4):265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salas MM, Nascimento GG, Vargas-Ferreira F, Tarquinio SB, Huysmans MC, Demarco FF. Diet influenced tooth erosion prevalence in children and adolescents: Results of a meta-analysis and meta-regression. Journal of dentistry. 2015 Aug 31;43(8):865-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of toothbrush, the technique used and the force applied when brushing can influence the occurrence and severity of resulting abrasion.&lt;ref&gt;Zanatta FB, Bergoli AD, Werle SB, Antoniazzi RP. Biofilm removal and gingival abrasion with medium and soft toothbrushes. Oral Health Prev Dent. 2011 Jan 1;9(2):177-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, brushing for extended periods of time (exceeding 2-3 min) in some cases, when combined with medium/hard bristled toothbrushes can cause abrasive lesions.&lt;ref name=vieira&gt;Vieira GH, Nogueira MB, Gaio EJ, Rosing CK, Santiago SL, Rego RO. Effect of Whitening Toothpastes on Dentin Abrasion: An In Vitro Study. Oral health &amp; preventive dentistry. 2016 Jun 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different toothbrush types are more inclined to cause abrasion, such as those with medium or hard bristles. The bristles combined with forceful brushing techniques applied can roughen the tooth surface and cause abrasion as well as aggravating the gums.&lt;ref name=Weigand&gt;Wiegand A, Kuhn M, Sener B, Roos M, Attin T. Abrasion of eroded dentin caused by toothpaste slurries of different abrasivity and toothbrushes of different filament diameter. Journal of dentistry. 2009 Jun 30;37(6):480-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive irritation to the [[gingival margin]] can eventually cause recession of the gums. When the gums recede, the root surface is exposed which is more susceptible to abrasion.&lt;ref name=Addy&gt;Addy M, Hunter ML. Can tooth brushing damage your health? Effects on oral and dental tissues. International dental journal. 2003 Jun 1;53(S3):177-86.&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparatively, electric toothbrushes have less abrasive tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegand A, Lemmrich F, Attin T. Influence of rotating–oscillating, sonic and ultrasonic action of power toothbrushes on abrasion of sound and eroded dentine. Journal of periodontal research. 2006 Jun 1;41(3):221-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of toothpastes can also damage enamel and dentine due to the abrasive properties.&lt;ref&gt;Tellefsen G, Liljeborg A, Johannsen A, Johannsen G. The role of the toothbrush in the abrasion process. International journal of dental hygiene. 2011 Nov 1;9(4):284-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific ingredients  are used in toothpaste to target removal of the bio-film and extrinsic staining however in some cases can contribute to the pastes being abrasive.&lt;ref&gt;Bizhang M, Riemer K, Arnold WH, Domin J, Zimmer S. Influence of Bristle Stiffness of Manual Toothbrushes on Eroded and Sound Human Dentin–An In Vitro Study. PLoS ONE. 2016 Apr 12;11(4):e0153250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weigand/&gt; 
Whitening toothpastes are found to be one of the most abrasive types of toothpastes, according to the RDA Scale, detailed below.&lt;ref name=Demarco&gt;Demarco FF, Meireles SS, Sarmento HR, Dantas RV, Botero T, Tarquinio SB. Erosion and abrasion on dental structures undergoing at-home bleaching. Clin Cosmet Investig Dent. 2011 Jul 18;3:45-52.&lt;/ref&gt; In-home and clinical whitening have been proven to increase the likelihood of an individual experiencing dental abrasion. It is believed that dental abrasion due to the whitening process is caused by a combination of both mechanical and chemical irritants, for example, using whitening toothpaste and at home bleaching kits together.&lt;ref name=Demarco /&gt; However, if an individual is regimented in their after-whitening care then they can avoid loss of dentine minerals and in turn abrasion can be avoided. (that contribute to developing abrasion).&lt;ref&gt;John SS, White DJ. History of the development of abrasivity limits for dentifrices 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that can contribute to abrasion is alteration of pH levels in the saliva. This can be sugary/ acidic foods and liquids. The reasoning behind this is that an increase in acidity of saliva can induce demineralization and therefore compromising the tooth structure to abrasive factors such as tooth brushing or normal wear from mastication.&lt;ref&gt;Neel EA, Aljabo A, Strange A, Ibrahim S, Coathup M, Young AM, Bozec L, Mudera V. Demineralization–remineralization dynamics in teeth and bone. International Journal of Nanomedicine. 2016;11:4743.&lt;/ref&gt; When the tooth structure is compromised, this is where the mineral content of the saliva can create shallow depressions in the enamel and thus, when brushed can cause irreparable damage on tooth surface.&lt;ref name=Demarco /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lussi A, Schlüter N, Rakhmatullina E, Ganss C. Dental erosion–an overview with emphasis on chemical and histopathological aspects. Caries research. 2011 May 31;45(Suppl. 1):2-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaeggi T, Lussi A. Toothbrush abrasion of erosively altered enamel after intraoral exposure to saliva: an in situ study. Caries Research. 1999 Sep 23;33(6):455-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The dental abrasion process can be further stimulated and accelerated through the effects of dental [[Acid erosion]].

== Relative dentin abrasivity ==
''Relative dentin abrasivity'' (''RDA'') is a standardised measurement of the abrasive effect that the components of the toothpaste have on a tooth.&lt;ref name=vieira/&gt;

The RDA scale was developed by the American Dental Association (ADA).  The RDA scale compares toothpaste abrasivity to standard abrasive materials and measures the depth of cut at an average of 1 millimetre per 100,000 brush strokes onto dentine.&lt;ref name=John&gt;John S, White D. History of the development of abrasivity limits for dentifrices. The journal of clinical dentistry. 2015;26(02):51-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison generates abrasive values for the dentifrices that would be safe for daily use.&lt;ref name=Addy/&gt;  In vitro dental studies showed a positive correlation between the highest RDAs and greater dentin wear.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald E, North A, Maggio B, Sufi F, Mason S, Moore C, Addy M, West NX. Clinical study investigating abrasive effects of three toothpastes and water in an in situ model. J Dent 2010;38:509–516.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, the RDA value is set by the standards DIN EN ISO 11609. Currently, the claim on products such as toothpaste are not regulated by law, however a dentifrice is required to have a level lower than 250 to be considered safe and before being given the ADA seal of approval.&lt;ref&gt;Toothpastes. Ada.org. 2017 [cited 7 May 2017]. Available from: http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/toothpastes&lt;/ref&gt; The values obtained depend on the size, quantity and surface structure of abrasive used in toothpastes.

{| class="wikitable" 
! RDA Score !! Level &lt;ref name=Darb&gt;Walsh M, Darby ML. Dental hygiene: theory and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences; 2014 Apr 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

|}

While the RDA score has been shown to have a statistically significant correlation to the presence of abrasion, it is not the only contributing factor to consider.&lt;ref name=John /&gt;&lt;ref name=Addy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Darb /&gt; Other factors such as the amount of pressure used whilst brushing, the type, thickness and dispersion of bristle in the toothbrush and the time spent brushing are other factors that contribute to dental abrasion.&lt;ref name=Darb /&gt;

== Treatment ==

There are several reasons to treat abrasion lesion(s) (also known as ‘Class V cavity’) such as:-
# Sensitivity.
# Presence of carious lesion.
# Aesthetically unpleasant.
# Arresting the progression of the lesion.
# Reducing potential onset of caries or periodontal disease as these lesions can present as a plaque retention factor.
# Where there is a risk of pulpal exposure if lesion depth is severe enough.
# When retention of a removable appliance is interfered. Ie. Denture
# To improve denture clasp(s) retention.
# Overall integrity of tooth structure is compromised.
In order for successful treatment of abrasion to occur, the [[#Aetiology|aetiology]] first needs to be identified. The most accurate way of doing so is completing a thorough medical, dental, social and diet history. All aspects needs to be investigated as in many cases the cause of abrasion can be multi-factorial. Once a definitive diagnosis is completed the appropriate treatment can commence. 
Treatment for abrasion can present in varying difficulties depending on the current degree or progress caused by the abrasion. Abrasion often presents in conjunction with other dental conditions such as attrition, decay and erosion. Evidence suggest there is a decrease in the effect of dental abrasion with dental erosion when fluoride varnish is applied onto teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sar Sancakli|first=H.|last2=Austin|first2=R. S.|last3=Al-Saqabi|first3=F.|last4=Moazzez|first4=R.|last5=Bartlett|first5=D.|date=March 2015|title=The influence of varnish and high fluoride on erosion and abrasion in a laboratory investigation|journal=Australian Dental Journal|volume=60|issue=1|pages=38–42|doi=10.1111/adj.12271|issn=1834-7819|pmid=25721276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful treatment focuses on the prevention and progression on the condition and modifies the current habit/s instigating the condition.

===Removal of Causes===

If the aetiology of abrasion is due to habitual behaviours, the discontinuation and change of habit is critical in the prevention of further tooth loss.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström J, Lavstedt S. An epidemiologic approach to toothbrushing and dental abrasion. Community dentistry and oral epidemiology. 1979 Feb 1;7(1):57-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The correct brushing technique is pivotal and involves a gentle scrub technique with small horizontal movements with an extra-soft/soft bristle brush.&lt;ref name="Darb" /&gt; Excessive lateral force can be corrected by holding the toothbrush in a pen grasp or by using the non-dominant hand to brush.&lt;ref name="Darb" /&gt; If abrasion is the result of an ill-fitting dental appliance, this should be corrected or replaced by a dental practitioner and should not be attempted in a home setting.

===Chemical===

The current selection of dentifrice should also be critically analysed and changed to include a less abrasive and gentler paste such as sensitive toothpaste as evidence suggests that a  very abrasive toothpaste would lead to loss of tooth structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganss|first=C.|last2=Marten|first2=J.|last3=Hara|first3=A. T.|last4=Schlueter|first4=N.|date=November 2016|title=Toothpastes and enamel erosion/abrasion - Impact of active ingredients and the particulate fraction|journal=Journal of Dentistry|volume=54|pages=62–67|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2016.09.005|issn=1879-176X|pmid=27650640}}&lt;/ref&gt; A toothpaste containing increased fluoride will also help combat the increased sensitivity and risk to dental decay.&lt;ref&gt;Seong J, Parkinson CP, Davies M, Claydon NC, West NX. Randomised clinical trial to evaluate changes in dentine tubule occlusion following 4 weeks use of an occluding toothpaste. Clinical Oral Investigations. 2017 Apr 1:1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fluoride varnish  is known to  alleviate hypersensitivity in teeth  and can be used as a preventive measure for high risk patients of dental erosion with abrasion because fluoride varnish is reported to have an effect on  the surface and subsurface of the tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sar Sancakli|first=H.|last2=Austin|first2=R. S.|last3=Al-Saqabi|first3=F.|last4=Moazzez|first4=R.|last5=Bartlett|first5=D.|date=March 2015|title=The influence of varnish and high fluoride on erosion and abrasion in a laboratory investigation |journal=Australian Dental Journal|volume=60|issue=1|pages=38–42|doi=10.1111/adj.12271|issn=1834-7819|pmid=25721276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment in the dental chair may include a fluoride application or the placement of a restoration in more severe cases. If the lesion is small and confined to enamel or cementum, a restoration is not warranted, instead the eradication of rough edges should occur to reduce plaque retentive properties.&lt;ref&gt;Marinho VC. Cochrane fluoride reviews: an overview of the evidence on caries prevention with fluoride treatments. Faculty Dental Journal. 2014 Apr;5(2):78-83.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of dental decay, aesthetic concerns or defects close to the pulp a restoration may be completed.&lt;ref&gt;Harpenau LA, Noble WH, Kao RT. Diagnosis and management of dental wear. Today's FDA: official monthly journal of the Florida Dental Association. 2011 Dec;24(5):50-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Further restorative work may be required when the lesion compromises the overall strength of the tooth or when the defect contributes to a periodontal problem the lesion may be restored.&lt;ref&gt;White JM, Eakle WS. Rationale and treatment approach in minimally invasive dentistry. The Journal of the American Dental Association. 2000 Jun 30;131:13S-9S.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once abrasions has been diagnosed and treated it should be closely monitored to identify further progression or potential relief of symptoms.

=== Restoration ===
Ideal properties of restoration materials particularly for these lesions include:-&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Burke, F. J. (2015). Dental Materials: What Goes Where? Class V Restorations. Dental Update,42(9), 829-839.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Satisfactory wear resistance most commonly caused by overzealous/excessive force used during toothbrushing.
# Low modulus of elasticity, given that teeth (anterior dentition) have been considered to flex around the cervical area (area closest to gum levels).
# Good aesthetics.
There are other properties of restoration materials which could be considered appropriate, although not specific to Class V restorations, which includes:-
# Small filler particles for polishability to achieve better aesthetics.
# Sufficiently stiff consistency to hold shape but still allows easy handling for placement into a cavity.
# Self-curing/setting or curable to any depth.
# Dimensionally stable or low shrinkage/stress.
# Fluoride release.
# Self-adhesive to enamel and dentine.
Dental materials such as amalgam, glass ionomer (GI), resin-modified glass ionomer (a variant of GI) and resin composite are the types of restoration materials available when active treatment by means of restoration is appropriate.

Taking into consideration these factors and their respective dental materials' properties, evidence and studies has shown that resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) restoration material is the recommended restoration material in clinical situations as it performs optimally - provided when aesthetics is not the top priority when restoring these lesions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The surface of such lesions should be roughened prior to its restoration&lt;ref&gt;Stewardson DA, Creanor S, Thornley P, Bigg T, Bromage C, Browne A, Cottam D, Dalby D, Gilmour J, Horton J, Roberts E, Westoby L, Burke T.

'''Burkhard Huwiler, [[White Fathers|M.Afr.]]''' (7 April 1868 – 1 October 1954), was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] Roman Catholic bishop who served as a missionary in Africa from 1929 to 1946.

Huwiler was born in [[Buttwil]], in the Canton of [[Aargau]], the son of Martin Leonz and Ana Maria Barbara Huwiler. He attended a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Einsiedeln]], after which, in 1887, he entered the seminary of the Missionaries of Africa (traditionally known as the [[White Fathers]]), determined to serve in the missions there. At the age of 25, on 2 July 1893, he was ordained a priest. Before his pastoral work in central Africa, he traveled for four years throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland, charged with raising funds for the work of his [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]]. In 1897 he was sent to serve in the region of [[Lake Victoria]], then part of [[German East Africa]]. Two years later he had to return home to Switzerland due to his health, where he remained until 1904, when he returned to Africa.&lt;ref name=HDS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9878.php|work=[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]]|title=Register of Swiss Surnames|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his nationality, Huwiler was able to remain at his post after [[World War I]], when Germany lost this colony and it became a [[League of Nations mandate]], to be administered by the United Kingdom, called the [[Tanganyika Territory]]. In March 1929 Huwiler was named by [[Pope Pius XI]] to head the newly created [[Vicariate Apostolic]] of [[Bukoba]] (now the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rulenge-Ngara]]) and [[titular bishop]] of Vazaritanus. He was consecrated on the following 14 July by Bishop [[Joseph Sweens]], M.Afr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bhuwi.html|work=Catholic Hierarchy|title=Bishop Burkhard Huwiler, M. Afr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huwiler resigned his office on 20 March 1946 and died in Bukoba, where he was buried, in keeping with the practice of his congregation.&lt;ref name=HDS /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Cellulitis''' is a [[bacterial infection]] involving the inner layers of the [[skin]].&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; It specifically affects the [[dermis]] and [[subcutaneous fat]].&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; Signs and symptoms include an area of redness which increases in size over a few days.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; The borders of the area of redness are generally not sharp and the skin may be swollen.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; While the redness often turns white when pressure is applied, this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; The area of infection is usually painful.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; [[Lymphatic vessels]] may occasionally be involved,&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tint2010&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=1016 |edition=7th |isbn=0-07-148480-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the person may have a [[fever]] and feel tired.&lt;ref name=Mint2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mistry|first=RD|title=Skin and soft tissue infections |journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America |date=Oct 2013|volume=60|issue=5|pages=1063–82|pmid=24093896|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2013.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The legs and face are the most common sites involved, though cellulitis can occur on any part of the body.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; The leg is typically affected following a break in the skin.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; Other [[risk factor]]s include [[obesity]], [[pedal edema|leg swelling]], and old age.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; For facial infections, a break in the skin beforehand is not usually the case.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; The bacteria most commonly involved are [[streptococci]] and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; In contrast to cellulitis, [[erysipelas]] is a bacterial infection involving the more superficial layers of the skin, present with an area of redness with well-defined edges, and more often is associated with a fever.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; Diagnosis is usually based on the presenting signs and symptoms, while [[cell culture]] is rarely possible.&lt;ref name=Vary2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vary|first=JC|author2=O'Connor, KM|title=Common Dermatologic Conditions |journal=Medical Clinics of North America |date=May 2014|volume=98|issue=3|pages=445–85|pmid=24758956|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2014.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before making a diagnosis, more serious infections such as an underlying [[osteomyelitis|bone infection]] or [[necrotizing fasciitis]] should be ruled out.&lt;ref name=Tint2010/&gt;

&lt;!-- Diagnosis and treatment --&gt;
Treatment is typically with [[antibiotic]]s taken by mouth, such as [[cephalexin]], [[amoxicillin]] or [[cloxacillin]].&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ2012/&gt; For those who are seriously allergic to [[penicillin]], [[erythromycin]] or [[clindamycin]] may be used.&lt;ref name=BMJ2012/&gt; When [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (MRSA) is a concern, [[doxycycline]] or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] may, in addition, be recommended.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; Concern is related to the presence of [[pus]] or previous MRSA infections.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mint2013/&gt; Elevating the infected area may be useful, as may [[analgesics|pain killers]].&lt;ref name=Tint2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prognosis and epidemiology --&gt;
Potential complications include [[abscess]] formation.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; Around 95% of people are better after seven to ten days of treatment.&lt;ref name=Mint2013/&gt; Those with diabetes, however, often have worse outcomes.&lt;ref name=Dryden2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dryden|first=M|title=Pathophysiology and burden of infection in patients with diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease: focus on skin and soft-tissue infections |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |date=Sep 2015|volume=21|pages=S27–S32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulitis occurred in about 21.2 million people in 2015.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre/&gt; In the United States about two of every 1,000 people per year have a case affecting the lower leg.&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt; Cellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De/&gt; In the United Kingdom, cellulitis was the reason for 1.6% of admissions to a hospital.&lt;ref name=BMJ2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phoenix|first=G|author2=Das, S |author3=Joshi, M |title=Diagnosis and management of cellulitis |journal=BMJ |series=Clinical Research |date=Aug 7, 2012|volume=345|pages=e4955|pmid=22872711|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical signs and symptoms of cellulitis is an area which is red, hot, and painful. The photos shown here of are of mild to moderate cases, and are not representative of earlier stages of the condition.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Complications===
Potential complications may include [[abscess]] formation, [[fascitis]], and [[sepsis]].&lt;ref name=Vary2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rook's textbook of dermatology |date=2016 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=9781118441190 |page=26.18 |edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Cellulitis is caused by a type of [[bacterium|bacteria]] entering the skin, usually by way of a cut, abrasion, or break in the skin. This break does not need to be visible. [[Group A streptococcal infection|Group A]] ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' are the most common of these bacteria, which are part of the normal flora of the skin, but normally cause no actual infection while on the skin's outer surface.

About 80% of cases of [[Ludwig's angina]], or cellulitis of the submandibular space, are caused by dental infections. Mixed infections, due to both aerobes and anaerobes, are commonly associated with this type of cellulitis. Typically, this includes [[streptococcus#Alpha-hemolytic|alpha-hemolytic streptococci]], staphylococci, and [[bacteroides]] groups.&lt;ref name="Dhingra"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Dhingra |first1=PL |last2= Dhingra |first2= Shruti |editor1-last= Nasim |editor1-first= Shabina |others= Dhingra, Deeksha |title= Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat |edition= 5th |year= 2010 |origyear= 1992 |publisher= Elsevier |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-81-312-2364-2 |pages= 277–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predisposing conditions for cellulitis include insect or [[spider bite]], [[blister]]ing, animal bite, [[tattoos]], [[Itch|pruritic]] (itchy) skin rash, recent [[surgery]], [[athlete's foot]], [[xeroderma|dry skin]], [[eczema]], injecting drugs (especially subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or where an attempted intravenous injection "misses" or blows the vein), pregnancy, diabetes, and obesity, which can affect circulation, as well as burns and [[boil]]s, though debate exists as to whether minor foot lesions contribute. Occurrences of cellulitis may also be associated with the rare condition [[hidradenitis suppurativa]] or dissecting cellulitis.

The appearance of the skin assists a doctor in determining a diagnosis. A doctor may also suggest blood tests, a wound culture, or other tests to help rule out a blood clot deep in the veins of the legs. Cellulitis in the lower leg is characterized by signs and symptoms similar to those of a [[deep vein thrombosis]], such as warmth, pain, and swelling (inflammation).

This reddened skin or rash may signal a deeper, more serious infection of the inner layers of skin. Once below the skin, the bacteria can spread rapidly, entering the lymph nodes and the bloodstream and spreading throughout the body. This can result in influenza-like symptoms with a high temperature and sweating or feeling very cold with shaking, as the sufferer cannot get warm.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In rare cases, the infection can spread to the deep layer of tissue called the [[fascial]] lining. [[Necrotizing fasciitis]], also called by the media "flesh-eating bacteria", is an example of a deep-layer infection. It is a [[medical emergency]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Risk factors===
The elderly and those with [[immunodeficiency|a weakened immune system]] are especially vulnerable to contracting cellulitis. [[diabetes mellitus|Diabetics]] are more susceptible to cellulitis than the general population because of impairment of the immune system; they are especially prone to cellulitis in the feet, because the disease causes impairment of blood circulation in the legs, leading to diabetic foot or foot ulcers. Poor control of blood glucose levels allows bacteria to grow more rapidly in the affected tissue, and facilitates rapid progression if the infection enters the bloodstream. Neural degeneration in diabetes means these ulcers may not be painful, thus often become infected. Those who have suffered [[poliomyelitis]] are also prone because of circulatory problems, especially in the legs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Immunosuppressive drugs, and other illnesses or infections that weaken the immune system, are also factors that make infection more likely. [[Chickenpox]] and [[shingles]] often result in blisters that break open, providing a gap in the skin through which bacteria can enter. [[Lymphedema]], which causes swelling on the arms and/or legs, can also put an individual at risk.

Diseases that affect blood circulation in the legs and feet, such as [[chronic venous insufficiency]] and [[varicose veins]], are also risk factors for cellulitis.

Cellulitis is also common among dense populations sharing hygiene facilities and common living quarters, such as military installations, college dormitories, nursing homes, oil platforms, and homeless shelters.

==Diagnosis==
Cellulitis is most often a clinical diagnosis, readily identified in many people by history and physical examination alone, with rapidly spreading areas of cutaneous [[edema|swelling]], redness, and heat, occasionally associated with inflammation of regional lymph nodes. While classically distinguished as a separate entity from erysipelas by spreading more deeply to involve the subcutaneous tissues, many clinicians may classify erysipelas as cellulitis.  Both are often treated similarly, but cellulitis associated with [[Boil|furuncles]], [[carbuncle]]s, or [[abscess]]es is usually caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'', which may affect treatment decisions, especially antibiotic selection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Skin and Soft Tissue Infections: 2014 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America|url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/14/cid.ciu296|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = 2014-06-18|issn = 1058-4838|pmid = 24947530|pages = 147–59|doi = 10.1093/cid/ciu296|first = Dennis L.|last = Stevens|first2 = Alan L.|last2 = Bisno|first3 = Henry F.|last3 = Chambers|first4 = E.

It is important to evaluate for co-existent abscess, as this finding usually requires surgical drainage as opposed to antibiotic therapy alone.  Physicians' clinical assessment for abscess may be limited, especially in cases with extensive overlying induration, but use of [[Medical ultrasound|bedside ultrasonography]] performed by an experienced practitioner readily discriminates between abscess and cellulitis and may change management in up to 56% of cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Management of Skin Abscesses in the Era of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus|journal = New England Journal of Medicine|date = 2014-03-13|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 24620867|pages = 1039–1047|volume = 370|issue = 11|doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1212788|first = Adam J.|last = Singer|first2 = David A.|last2 = Talan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of ultrasound for abscess identification may also be indicated in cases of antibiotic failure.  Cellulitis has a characteristic "cobblestoned" appearance indicative of subcutaneous edema without a defined hypoechoic, heterogeneous fluid collection that would indicate abscess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Essential Guide to Primary Care Procedures|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=f0PyCAAAQBAJ|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2015-05-04|isbn = 9781496318718|first = Paul|last = Bornemann|chapter = Ambulatory Ultrasound|editor-first = E.J.|editor-last = Mayeaux|last2 = Rao|first2 = Victor|last3 = Hoppmann|first3 = Richard|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160506003603/https://books.google.com/books?id=f0PyCAAAQBAJ|archivedate = 2016-05-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that may mimic cellulitis include [[Venous thrombosis|deep vein thrombosis]], which can be diagnosed with a compression leg [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], and [[stasis dermatitis]], which is inflammation of the skin from poor blood flow. Signs of a more severe infection such as necrotizing fasciitis or [[gas gangrene]] that would require prompt surgical intervention include purple [[bulla (dermatology)|bulla]]e, skin sloughing, subcutaneous edema, and systemic toxicity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Misdiagnosis can occur in up to 30% of people with suspected lower-extremity cellulitis, leading to 50,000 to 130,000 unnecessary hospitalization and $195 to $515 million in avoidable healthcare spending annually in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weng|first=Qing Yu|last2=Raff|first2=Adam B.|last3=Cohen|first3=Jeffrey M.|last4=Gunasekera|first4=Nicole|last5=Okhovat|first5=Jean-Phillip|last6=Vedak|first6=Priyanka|last7=Joyce|first7=Cara|last8=Kroshinsky|first8=Daniela|last9=Mostaghimi|first9=Arash|title=Costs and Consequences Associated With Misdiagnosed Lower Extremity Cellulitis|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2578851|journal=JAMA Dermatology |volume=153|issue=2|pages=141|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.3816|pmid=27806170|year=2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104141444/http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2578851|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated musculoskeletal findings are sometimes reported. When it occurs with [[acne conglobata]], [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], and [[pilonidal cyst]]s, the syndrome is referred to as the [[follicular occlusion triad]] or tetrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scheinfeld NS |title=A case of dissecting cellulitis and a review of the literature |journal=Dermatology Online Journal |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=8 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12639466 |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/91/case_reports/dissecting/scheinfeld.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414110641/http://dermatology.cdlib.org/91/case_reports/dissecting/scheinfeld.html |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyme disease]] can be misdiagnosed as staphylococcal- or streptococcal-induced cellulitis. Because the characteristic [[Erythema chronicum migrans|bullseye rash]] does not always appear in people infected with Lyme disease, the similar set of symptoms may be misdiagnosed as cellulitis.  Standard treatments for cellulitis are not sufficient for curing Lyme disease. The only way to rule out Lyme disease is with a blood test, which is recommended during warm months in areas where the disease is endemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nowakowski J, McKenna D, Nadelman RB |title=Failure of treatment with cephalexin for Lyme disease |journal=Archives of Family Medicine |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=563–7 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10862221 |doi=10.1001/archfami.9.6.563  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==

Antibiotics are usually prescribed, with the agent selected based on suspected organism and presence or absence of [[purulence]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although the best treatment choice is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilburn|first1=SA|last2=Featherstone|first2=P|last3=Higgins|first3=B|last4=Brindle|first4=R|title=Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=16 June 2010|issue=6|pages=CD004299|pmid=20556757|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004299.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an abscess is also present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of [[necrotizing fasciitis]].  Elevation of the affected area is often recommended.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics choices depend on regional availability, but a penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillin or a first-generation [[cephalosporin]] is currently recommended for cellulitis without abscess.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A course of antibiotics is not effective in between 6 and 37% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obaitan|first1=Itegbemie|last2=Dwyer|first2=Richard|last3=Lipworth|first3=Adam D.|last4=Kupper|first4=Thomas S.|last5=Camargo|first5=Carlos A.|last6=Hooper|first6=David C.|last7=Murphy|first7=George F.|last8=Pallin|first8=Daniel J.|title=Failure of antibiotics in cellulitis trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2016.05.064|pmid=27344098|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1645–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Cellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide, up from 12,600 in 2005.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De/&gt;

==Other animals==
[[Horse]]s may acquire cellulitis, usually secondarily to a wound (which can be extremely small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath or joint.&lt;ref name="pmid16882479"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adam EN, Southwood LL |title=Surgical and traumatic wound infections, cellulitis, and myositis in horses |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Equine Practice |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=335–61, viii |date=August 2006 |pmid=16882479 |doi=10.1016/j.cveq.2006.04.003 |url=http://journals.elsevierhealth.com/retrieve/pii/S0749-0739(06)00031-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18296664"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fjordbakk CT, Arroyo LG, Hewson J |title=Retrospective study of the clinical features of limb cellulitis in 63 horses |journal=Veterinary Record |volume=162 |issue=8 |pages=233–36 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18296664 |doi= 10.1136/vr.162.8.233|url=http://veterinaryrecord.bvapublications.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18296664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less [[lameness (equine)|lameness]] (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from [[filled legs|stocking up]] in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of [[NSAID]]s, such as [[phenylbutazone]], cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a [[poultice]], and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe [[antibiotic]]s.
Cellulitis is also seen in staphylococcal and corynebacterial mixed infections in bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pathan MM, Khan MA, Bhonsle AV, Bhikane AU, Moregaonkar SD, Kulkarni MB |title=Cellulitis in a Red Kandhari Bull: A Case Report |journal=Vetworld |pages=183–84 |year=2012 |url=http://www.scopemed.org/?mno=13313 |volume=5 |issue=3 |doi=10.5455/vetworld.2012.183-184 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316015558/http://scopemed.org/?mno=13313 |archivedate=2013-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition''' ('''DSM-5''') is the 2013 update to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the taxonomic and diagnostic tool published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). In the United States, the DSM serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by [[Health professional|health care provider]]s, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance.

The DSM-5 was published on May 18, 2013, superseding the [[DSM-IV-TR]], which was published in 2000. The development of the new edition began with a conference in 1999 and proceeded with the formation of a Task Force in 2007, which developed and field-tested a variety of new classifications.  In most respects, the DSM-5 is not greatly modified from the DSM-IV-TR; however, some significant differences exist between them. Notable changes in the DSM-5 include the reconceptualization of [[Asperger syndrome]] from a distinct disorder to an [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]]; the elimination of subtypes of [[schizophrenia]]; the deletion of the "bereavement exclusion" for [[major depressive disorder|depressive disorders]]; the renaming of ''gender identity disorder'' to ''[[gender dysphoria]]'', along with a revised treatment plan; the inclusion of [[binge eating disorder]] as a discrete eating disorder; the renaming and reconceptualization of ''paraphilias'' to ''paraphilic disorders''; the removal of the axis system; and the splitting of ''disorders not otherwise specified'' into ''other specified disorders'' and ''unspecified disorders''. In addition, the DSM-5 is the first DSM to use an [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] instead of a [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] in its title, as well as the first "[[living document]]" version of a DSM.&lt;ref name="Wakefield 139–154"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakefield|first=Jerome C.|date=2013-05-22|title=DSM-5: An Overview of Changes and Controversies|url=|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|language=en|volume=41|issue=2|pages=139–154|doi=10.1007/s10615-013-0445-2|issn=0091-1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authorities criticized the fifth edition both before and after it was formally published. Critics assert, for example, that many DSM-5 revisions or additions lack empirical support; [[inter-rater reliability]] is low for many disorders; several sections contain poorly written, confusing, or contradictory information; and the psychiatric drug industry unduly influenced the manual's content. Many of the members of work groups for the DSM-5 had conflicting interests, including ties to pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Steven|last2=Klassen|first2=Cherisse|last3=Borisova|first3=Oxana|last4=Clothier|first4=Holly|title=The DSM-5 controversies: How should psychologists respond?|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033841|journal=Canadian Psychology/Psychologie canadienne|volume=54|issue=3|pages=166–175|doi=10.1037/a0033841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various scientists have argued that the DSM-5 forces clinicians to make distinctions that are not supported by solid evidence, distinctions that have major treatment implications, including drug prescriptions and the availability of health insurance coverage. General criticism of the DSM-5 ultimately resulted in a petition, signed by many [[mental health]] organizations, which called for outside review of the DSM-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coalition for DSM-5 Reform |publisher=Coalition for DSM-5 Reform |url=http://dsm5-reform.com/ |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes==
This part of the article summarizes changes from the [[DSM-IV]] to the DSM-5. The DSM-5 is divided into three Sections, using [[Roman numerals]] to designate each Section. The same organizational structure is used in this overview, e.g., [[DSM-5#Section I|Section I]] (immediately below) summarizes relevant changes discussed in the DSM-5, Section I.

Note that if a specific disorder (or set of disorders) cannot be seen, e.g., [[enuresis]] and other [[Mental disorders diagnosed in childhood#Elimination disorders|elimination disorders]], mentioned in [[DSM-5#Section II: diagnostic criteria and codes|Section II: diagnostic criteria and codes]] (below), it means that the diagnostic criteria for those disorders did not change significantly from DSM-IV to DSM-5.
  
===Section I===
Section I describes DSM-5 chapter organization, its change from the multiaxial system, and Section III's dimensional assessments.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; The DSM-5 deleted the chapter that includes "disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence" opting to list them in other chapters.&lt;ref name=highlights&gt;{{cite web |title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 |url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf |format=PDF |date=May 17, 2013 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |archive-date=February 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226050453/http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A note under Anxiety Disorders says that the "sequential order" of at least some DSM-5 chapters has significance that reflects the relationships between diagnoses.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

This introductory section describes the process of DSM revision, including field trials, public and professional review, and expert review. It states its goal is to harmonize with the ICD systems and share organizational structures as much as is feasible. Concern about the categorical system of diagnosis is expressed, but the conclusion is the reality that alternative definitions for most disorders is scientifically premature.

The new version replaces the NOS ([[Not Otherwise Specified]]) categories with two options: ''other specified disorder'' and ''unspecified disorder'' to increase the utility to the clinician. The first allows the clinician to specify the reason that the criteria for a specific disorder are not met; the second allows the clinician the option to forgo specification.

DSM-5 has discarded the multiaxial system of diagnosis (formerly Axis I, Axis II, Axis III), listing all disorders in Section II. It has replaced Axis IV with significant psychosocial and contextual features and dropped Axis V (Global Assessment of Functioning, known as GAF). The World Health Organization's (WHO) Disability Assessment Schedule is added to Section III (Emerging measures and models) under Assessment Measures, as a suggested, but not required, method to assess functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-introduction"&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=Fifth |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Arlington, VA |pages=5–25 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section II: diagnostic criteria and codes===

====Neurodevelopmental disorders====
* "[[Mental retardation]]" has a new name: "[[intellectual disability|intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)]]".&lt;ref name="medscape1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_3 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Neurodevelopmental Disorders |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phonological disorder]] and [[stuttering]] are now called [[communication disorder]]s—which include [[language disorder]], [[speech sound disorder]], [[childhood-onset fluency disorder]], and a new condition characterized by impaired social verbal and nonverbal communication called [[social (pragmatic) communication disorder]].&lt;ref name="medscape1"/&gt;
* [[Autism spectrum disorder]] incorporates [[Asperger disorder]], [[childhood disintegrative disorder]], and [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS)—see {{sectionlink|Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome|DSM-5 changes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_4 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Autism Spectrum Disorders |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A new sub-category, [[motor disorder]]s, encompasses [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[stereotypic movement disorder]], and the [[tic disorder]]s including [[Tourette syndrome]].&lt;ref name=MotorDisorderDSM&gt;{{Cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=Fifth |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Arlington, VA |pages=74–85 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders====
* All subtypes of [[schizophrenia]] were removed from the DSM-5 ([[paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[disorganized schizophrenia|disorganized]], [[catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]], [[undifferentiated schizophrenia|undifferentiated]], and [[residual schizophrenia|residual]]).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* A major mood episode is required for [[schizoaffective disorder]] (for a majority of the disorder's duration after criterion A [related to delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, and negative symptoms such as avolition] is met).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Criteria for [[delusional disorder]] changed, and it is no longer separate from [[shared delusional disorder]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Catatonia]] in all contexts requires 3 of a total of 12 symptoms. Catatonia may be a specifier for depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders; part of another medical condition; or of another specified diagnosis.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Bipolar and related disorders====
* New specifier "with mixed features" can be applied to [[bipolar I disorder]], [[bipolar II disorder]], bipolar disorder NED (not elsewhere defined, previously called "NOS", not otherwise specified) and [[Major depressive disorder|MDD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_12 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Mixed-Mood Specifier |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allows [[Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified|other specified bipolar and related disorder]] for particular conditions.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Anxiety]] symptoms are a specifier (called "anxious distress") added to bipolar disorder and to depressive disorders (but are not part of the bipolar diagnostic criteria).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Depressive disorders====
* The [[Grief|bereavement]] exclusion in DSM-IV was removed from [[depression (mood)|depressive]] disorders in DSM-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_10 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Removal of the Bereavement Exclusion From MDD |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_6 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children up to age 18 years.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] moved from an appendix for further study, and became a disorder.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Specifiers were added for mixed symptoms and for anxiety, along with guidance to physicians for suicidality.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
*The term [[dysthymia]] now also would be called persistent depressive disorder.

====Anxiety disorders====
* For the various forms of [[phobia]]s and [[anxiety]] disorders, DSM-5 removes the requirement that the subject (formerly, over 18 years old) "must recognize that their fear and anxiety are excessive or unreasonable". Also, the duration of at least 6 months now applies to everyone (not only to children).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Panic attack]] became a specifier for all DSM-5 disorders.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Panic disorder]] and [[agoraphobia]] became two separate disorders.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Specific types of phobias became specifiers but are otherwise unchanged.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* The generalized specifier for [[social anxiety disorder]] (formerly, social phobia) changed in favor of a performance only (i.e., public speaking or performance) specifier.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Separation anxiety disorder]] and [[selective mutism]] are now classified as anxiety disorders (rather than disorders of early onset).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders====
* A new chapter on [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] and related disorders includes four new disorders: [[excoriation (skin-picking) disorder]], [[hoarding disorder]], substance-/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, and obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Trichotillomania]] (hair-pulling disorder) moved from "impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified" in DSM-IV, to an obsessive-compulsive disorder in DSM-5.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* A specifier was expanded (and added to [[body dysmorphic disorder]] and hoarding disorder) to allow for good or fair insight, poor insight, and "absent insight/delusional" (i.e., complete conviction that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Criteria were added to body dysmorphic disorder to describe repetitive behaviors or mental acts that may arise with perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* The DSM-IV specifier “with obsessive-compulsive symptoms” moved from anxiety disorders to this new category for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* There are two new diagnoses: [[other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder]], which  can include [[body-focused repetitive behavior disorder]] (behaviors like nail biting, lip biting, and cheek chewing, other than hair pulling and skin picking) or [[obsessional jealousy]]; and [[unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Trauma- and stressor-related disorders====
* [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is now included in a new section titled "Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=M. J. |author2=Resick, P. A. |author3=Bryant, R.

* The PTSD diagnostic clusters were reorganized and expanded from a total of three clusters to four based on the results of confirmatory factor analytic research conducted since the publication of DSM-IV.&lt;ref name="considering"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=M. J. |author2=Resick, P. A. |author3=Bryant, R. A. |author4=Brewin, C.

* Separate criteria were added for children six years old or younger.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* For the diagnosis of [[Acute stress reaction|acute stress disorder]] and PTSD, the stressor criteria (Criterion A1 in DSM-IV) was modified to some extent. The requirement for specific subjective emotional reactions (Criterion A2 in DSM-IV) was eliminated because it lacked empirical support for its utility and predictive validity.&lt;ref name="considering" /&gt; Previously certain groups, such as military personnel involved in combat, law enforcement officers and other first responders, did not meet criterion A2 in DSM-IV because their training prepared them to not react emotionally to traumatic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adler |first=A.

* [[Adjustment disorders]] were moved to this new section and reconceptualized as stress-response syndromes. DSM-IV subtypes for depressed mood, anxious symptoms, and disturbed conduct are unchanged.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Dissociative disorders====
* [[Depersonalization disorder]] is now called [[Depersonalization disorder|depersonalization]]/[[derealization]] disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=Fifth |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Arlington, VA |page=302 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dissociative fugue]] became a specifier for [[dissociative amnesia]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* The criteria for [[dissociative identity disorder]] were expanded to include "possession-form phenomena and functional neurological symptoms". It is made clear that "transitions in identity may be observable by others or self-reported".&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; Criterion B was also modified for people who experience gaps in recall of everyday events (not only trauma).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Somatic symptom and related disorders====
* [[Somatoform disorder]]s are now called somatic symptom and related disorders.
* Patients that present with chronic pain can now be diagnosed with the mental illness '''somatic symptom disorder''' with predominant pain; or ''psychological factors that affect other medical conditions''; or with an ''adjustment disorder''.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Somatic%20Symptom%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Somatic Symptom Disorder |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102010911/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Somatic%20Symptom%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/saving-normal/201312/diagnostic-ethics-harmsbenefits-somatic-symptom-disorder |title=Diagnostic Ethics: Harms/Benefits, Somatic Symptom Disorder |work=Psychology Today |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/clinical-updates/psychiatry-psychology/diagnostic-statistical-manual-mental-disorders-redefines-hypochondriasis |title=DSM-5 redefines hypochondriasis&amp;nbsp;— For Medical Professionals&amp;nbsp;— Mayo Clinic |work=mayoclinic.org |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/04/justina-pelletier-case-continues/ |title=Justina Pelletier: The Case Continues |work=Mad In America |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Somatization disorder]] and [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]] were combined to become [[somatic symptom disorder]], a diagnosis which no longer requires a specific number of somatic symptoms.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Somatic symptom and related disorders are defined by positive symptoms, and the use of medically unexplained symptoms is minimized, except in the cases of [[conversion disorder]] and [[pseudocyesis]] (false pregnancy).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* A new diagnosis is [[psychological factors affecting other medical conditions]]. This was formerly found in the DSM-IV chapter "Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention".&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Criteria for [[conversion disorder]] (functional neurological symptom disorder) were changed.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Feeding and eating disorders====
* Criteria for [[Pica (disorder)|pica]] and [[rumination disorder]] were changed and can now refer to people of any age.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Binge eating disorder]] graduated from DSM-IV's "Appendix B -- Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study" into a proper diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_5 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Binge Eating Disorder |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Requirements for [[bulimia nervosa]] and binge eating disorder were changed from "at least twice weekly for 6 months to at least once weekly over the last 3 months".
* The criteria for [[anorexia nervosa]] were changed; there is no longer a requirement of [[amenorrhea]].
* "Feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood", a rarely used diagnosis in DSM-IV, was renamed to [[Selective eating disorder|avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]], and criteria were expanded.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Elimination disorders====
* NO significant changes.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Disorders in this chapter were previously classified under disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence in DSM-IV.  Now it is an independent classification in DSM 5.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Sleep–wake disorders====
* "Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder, and sleep disorders related to a general medical condition" were deleted.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Primary insomnia became [[insomnia disorder]], and [[narcolepsy]] is separate from other [[hypersomnolence]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* There are now three breathing-related sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnea [[hypopnea]], [[central sleep apnea]], and sleep-related [[hypoventilation]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Circadian rhythm sleep disorder|Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders]] were expanded to include [[Advanced sleep phase disorder|advanced sleep phase syndrome]], [[Irregular sleep–wake rhythm|irregular sleep–wake type]], and [[Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder|non-24-hour sleep–wake type]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; [[Jet lag]] was removed.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder]] and [[restless legs syndrome]] are each a disorder, instead of both being listed under "dyssomnia not otherwise specified" in DSM-IV.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Sexual dysfunctions====
* DSM-5 has sex-specific sexual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* For females, sexual desire and arousal disorders are combined into [[female sexual interest/arousal disorder]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Sexual dysfunctions (except substance-/medication-induced sexual dysfunction) now require a duration of approximately 6 months and more exact severity criteria.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* A new diagnosis is [[genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder]] which combines [[vaginismus]] and [[dyspareunia]] from DSM-IV.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Sexual aversion disorder]] was deleted.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Subtypes for all disorders include only "lifelong versus acquired" and "generalized versus situational" (one subtype was deleted from DSM-IV).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Two subtypes were deleted: "sexual dysfunction due to a general medical condition" and "due to psychological versus combined factors".&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Gender dysphoria====
{{Further|Gender dysphoria}}
* DSM-IV [[gender identity disorder]] is similar to, but not the same as, [[gender dysphoria]] in DSM-5. Separate criteria for children, adolescents and adults that are appropriate for varying developmental states are added.
* Subtypes of gender identity disorder based on sexual orientation were deleted.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Among other wording changes, criterion A and criterion B (cross-gender identification, and aversion toward one’s gender) were combined.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; Along with these changes comes the creation of a separate gender dysphoria in children as well as one for adults and adolescents. The grouping has been moved out of the sexual disorders category and into its own. The name change was made in part due to stigmatization of the term "disorder" and the relatively common use of "gender dysphoria" in the GID literature and among specialists in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=P 01 Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents or Adults |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/GenderDysphoria.aspx |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing and ability to express it in the event that they have insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=P 00 Gender Dysphoria in Children |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=192# |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders====
Some of these disorders were formerly part of the chapter on early diagnosis, [[oppositional defiant disorder]]; [[conduct disorder]]; and [[disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified]] became [[other specified and unspecified disruptive disorder]], [[impulse-control disorder]], and [[conduct disorder]]s.&lt;!-- needs clarification, are there multiple conduct disorders in DSM-5? Multiple impulse-control disorders? --&gt;&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; [[Intermittent explosive disorder]], [[pyromania]], and [[kleptomania]] moved to this chapter from the DSM-IV chapter "Impulse-Control Disorders Not Otherwise Specified".&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Antisocial personality disorder]] is listed here ''and'' in the chapter on personality disorders (but [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD]] is listed under neurodevelopmental disorders).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Symptoms for [[oppositional defiant disorder]] are of three types: angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness.&lt;!-- the three types is inaccurate --&gt; The conduct disorder exclusion is deleted. The criteria were also changed with a note on frequency requirements and a measure of severity.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* Criteria for conduct disorder are unchanged for the most part from DSM-IV.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; A specifier was added for people with limited "prosocial emotion", showing [[callous and unemotional traits]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* People over the disorder's minimum age of 6 may be diagnosed with [[intermittent explosive disorder]] without outbursts of physical aggression.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; Criteria were added for frequency and to specify "impulsive and/or anger based in nature, and must cause marked distress, cause impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or be associated with negative financial or legal consequences".&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Substance-related and addictive disorders====
* [[Gambling disorder]] and [[tobacco use disorder]] are new.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* [[Substance abuse]] and [[substance dependence]] from DSM-IV-TR have been combined into single substance use disorders specific to each substance of abuse within a new "addictions and related disorders" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_11 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Substance Use Disorder |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Recurrent legal problems" was deleted and "craving or a strong desire or urge to use a substance" was added to the criteria.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; The threshold of the number of criteria that must be met was changed&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; and severity from mild to severe is based on the number of criteria endorsed.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; Criteria for [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[caffeine]] withdrawal were added.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; New specifiers were added for early and sustained [[Cure|remission]] along with new specifiers for "in a controlled environment" and "on maintenance therapy".&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

DSM-5 substance dependencies include:&lt;!-- In order from least to greatest --&gt;
* 303.90 Alcohol dependence
* 304.00 Opioid dependence
* 304.10 [[Sedative]], [[hypnotic]], or [[anxiolytic]] dependence (including benzodiazepine dependence and barbiturate dependence)
* 304.20 Cocaine dependence
* 304.30 Cannabis dependence
* 304.40 Amphetamine dependence (or amphetamine-like)
* 304.50 [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|Hallucinogen]] dependence
* 304.60 [[Inhalant]] dependence
* 304.80 Polysubstance dependence
* 304.90 [[Phencyclidine]] (or phencyclidine-like) dependence
* 304.90 Other (or unknown) substance dependence
* 305.10 Nicotine dependence

There are no more polysubstance diagnoses in DSM-5; the substance(s) must be specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |agency=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |date=2013 |page=16 |format=PDF |quote=The DSM-IV specifier for a physiological subtype has been eliminated in DSM-5, as has the DSM-IV diagnosis of polysubstance dependence. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurocognitive disorders====
* [[Dementia]] and [[Amnesia|amnestic disorder]] became major or mild [[Cognitive disorder|neurocognitive disorder]] (major NCD, or mild NCD).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_13 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Neurocognitive Disorder |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSM-5 has a new list of neurocognitive domains.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; "New separate criteria are now presented" for major or mild NCD due to various conditions.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; [[Substance/medication-induced NCD]] and [[unspecified NCD]] are new diagnoses.&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

====Personality disorders====
* [[Personality disorder]] (PD) previously belonged to a different axis than almost all other disorders, but is now in one axis with all mental and other medical diagnoses.&lt;ref name = APA-PD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Personality%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Personality Disorders |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same ten types of personality disorder are retained.&lt;ref name = APA-PD/&gt;
* There is a call for the DSM-5 to provide relevant clinical information that is empirically based to conceptualize personality as well as psychopathology in personalities. The issue(s) of heterogeneity of a PD is problematic as well. For example, when determining the criteria for a PD it is possible for two individuals with the same diagnosis to have completely different symptoms that would not necessarily overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Robert F.|last2=Hopwood|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Wright|first3=Aidan G. C.|last4=Markon|first4=Kristian E.|date=2014-09-01|title=DSM-5 and the Path Toward Empirically Based and Clinically Useful Conceptualization of Personality and Psychopathology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cpsp.12073/abstract|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=245–261|doi=10.1111/cpsp.12073|issn=1468-2850}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern as to which model is better for the DSM - the diagnostic model favored by psychiatrists or the dimensional model that is favored by psychologists. The diagnostic approach/model is one that follows the diagnostic approach of traditional medicine, is more convenient to use in clinical settings, however, it does not capture the intricacies of normal or abnormal personality. The dimensional approach/model is better at showing varied degrees of personality; it places emphasis on the continuum between normal and abnormal, and abnormal as something beyond a threshold whether in unipolar or bipolar cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crocq|first=Marc-Antoine|date=2013|title=Milestones in the History of Personality Disorders|url=http://www.dialogues-cns.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DialoguesClinNeurosci-15-147.pdf|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=15|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=8 August 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paraphilic disorders====
* New specifiers "in a controlled environment" and "in remission" were added to criteria for all [[paraphilic disorders]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;
* A distinction is made between paraphilic behaviors, or [[paraphilia]]s, and paraphilic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_14 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Paraphilias and Paraphilic Disorders |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All criteria sets were changed to add the word disorder to all of the paraphilias, for example, [[pedophilic disorder]] is listed instead of [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt; There is no change in the basic diagnostic structure since DSM-III-R; however, people now must meet both qualitative (criterion A) and negative consequences (criterion B) criteria to be diagnosed with a paraphilic disorder. Otherwise they have a paraphilia (and no diagnosis).&lt;ref name=highlights /&gt;

===Section III: emerging measures and models===

====Alternative DSM-5 model for personality disorders====
An alternative hybrid dimensional-categorical model for personality disorders is included to stimulate further research on this modified classification system.&lt;ref name="medscape2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803884_8 |title=A Guide to DSM-5: Personality Disorders |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for further study==
These conditions and criteria are set forth to encourage future research and are not meant for clinical use.
* [[Attenuated psychosis syndrome]]
* [[Depressive episodes with short-duration hypomania]]
* [[Persistent complex bereavement disorder]]
* [[Caffeine use disorder]]
* [[Video game addiction|Internet gaming disorder]]
* [[Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure]]
* [[Suicidal behavior disorder]]
* [[Non-suicidal self-injury]]&lt;ref name="DSM-5-future"&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=Fifth |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Arlington, VA |pages=783–808 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In 1999, a DSM–5 Research Planning Conference; sponsored jointly by APA and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), was held to set the research priorities. Research Planning Work Groups produced "white papers" on the research needed to inform and shape the DSM-5&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=First |first=Michael B. |year=2002 |title=A Research Agenda for DSM-V: Summary of the DSM-V Preplanning White Papers Published in May 2002 |work=DSM-V Prelude Project |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |url=http://dsm5.org/whitepapers.cfm |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |archivedate=April 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413001720/http://dsm5.org/whitepapers.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the resulting work and recommendations were reported in an APA monograph&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor=Kupfer, David J. |editor2=First, Michael B. |editor3=Regier, Darrel A. |year=2002 |title=A Research Agenda for DSM-5 |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |publication-place=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780890422922 |oclc=49518977 |url=http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Regier |first=Darrel A |last2=Narrow |first2=William E |last3=First |first3=Michael B |last4=Marshall |first4=Tina |title=The APA classification of mental disorders: future perspectives |journal=[[Psychopathology (journal)|Psychopathology]] |volume=35 |issue=2–3 |pages=166–170 |year=2002 |pmid=12145504 |doi=10.1159/000065139 |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?doi=10.1159/000065139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were six workgroups, each focusing on a broad topic: Nomenclature, Neuroscience and Genetics, Developmental Issues and Diagnosis, Personality and [[Relational Disorder]]s, Mental Disorders and Disability, and Cross-Cultural Issues. Three additional white papers were also due by 2004 concerning gender issues, diagnostic issues in the geriatric population, and mental disorders in infants and young children.&lt;ref name=dsm5researchplanning&gt;{{Citation |title=DSM-5 Research Planning |work=DSM-V Prelude Project |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |url=http://www.dsm5.org/planning.cfm |at=DSM-V Research White Papers |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424075423/http://dsm5.org/planning.cfm |archivedate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The white papers have been followed by a series of conferences to produce recommendations relating to specific disorders and issues, with attendance limited to 25 invited researchers.&lt;ref name=dsm5researchplanning/&gt;

On July 23, 2007, the APA announced the task force that would oversee the development of DSM-5. The DSM-5 Task Force consisted of 27 members, including a chair and vice chair, who collectively represent research scientists from psychiatry and other disciplines, clinical care providers, and consumer and family advocates. Scientists working on the revision of the DSM had a broad range of experience and interests. The APA Board of Trustees required that all task force nominees disclose any competing interests or potentially conflicting relationships with entities that have an interest in psychiatric diagnoses and treatments as a precondition to appointment to the task force. The APA made all task force members' disclosures available during the announcement of the task force. Several individuals were ruled ineligible for task force appointments due to their competing interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Regier DA  |year=2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2007 |title=Somatic Presentations of Mental Disorders: Refining the Research Agenda for DSM-V |journal=[[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]] |pmid=18040087 |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=827–828 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e31815afbe4 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/reprint/69/9/827.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 field trials included [[test-retest reliability]] which involved different clinicians doing independent evaluations of the same patient—a common approach to the study of diagnostic reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Reliability_and_Prevalence_in_DSM-5_Field_Trials_1-12-12.pdf |title=Reliability and Prevalence in the DSM-5 Field Trials|accessdate=January 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131110008/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Reliability_and_Prevalence_in_DSM-5_Field_Trials_1-12-12.pdf |archivedate=January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 68% of DSM-5 task-force members and 56% of panel members reported having ties to the [[pharmaceutical industry]], such as holding stock in pharmaceutical companies, serving as consultants to industry, or serving on company boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cosgrove|first1=Lisa|last2=Bursztajn|first2=Harold J.|last3=Krimsky|first3=Sheldon|title=Developing Unbiased Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines in Psychiatry|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=7 May 2009|volume=360|issue=19|pages=2035–2036|doi=10.1056/NEJMc0810237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revisions and updates==
Beginning with the fifth edition, it is intended that diagnostic guidelines revisions will be added incrementally.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web |title=About DSM-5 Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.dsm5.org/about/pages/faq.aspx |website=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-5 is identified with [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] rather than [[Roman numerals]], marking a change in how future updates will be created. Incremental updates will be identified with decimals (DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2, etc.), until a new edition is written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harold |first1=Eve |title=APA Modifies DSM Naming Convention to Reflect Publication Changes |issue=Release No. 10-17 |publisher=The American Psychiatric Association |date=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The change reflects the intent of the APA to respond more quickly when a preponderance of research supports a specific change in the manual. The research base of mental disorders is evolving at different rates for different disorders.&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

==Criticism==

===General===
[[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], the head of the DSM-III task force, publicly criticized the APA for mandating that DSM-5 task force members sign a [[nondisclosure agreement]], effectively conducting the whole process in secret: "When I first heard about this agreement, I just went bonkers. Transparency is necessary if the document is to have credibility, and, in time, you're going to have people complaining all over the place that they didn't have the opportunity to challenge anything."&lt;ref name=nyt081218&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/health/18psych.html?pagewanted=all |title=Psychiatrists Revise the Book of Human Troubles |first=Benedict |last=Carey |date=December 17, 2008 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Allen Frances]], chair of the DSM-IV task force, expressed a similar concern.&lt;ref name=pbsnewhour&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june10/mentalillness_02-10.html Psychiatrists Propose Revisions to Diagnosis Manual.] via [[PBS Newshour]], February 10, 2010 (interviews Frances and [[Alan Schatzberg]] on some of the main changes proposed to the DSM-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the APA has since instituted a disclosure policy for DSM-5 task force members, many still believe the association has not gone far enough in its efforts to be transparent and to protect against industry influence.&lt;ref name=pmid16636630&gt;{{Citation |first1=Lisa |last1=Cosgrove |first2=Sheldon |last2=Krimsky |first3=Manisha |last3=Vijayaraghavan |first4=Lisa |last4=Schneider |date=April 2006 |title=Financial Ties between DSM-IV Panel Members and the Pharmaceutical Industry |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=154–160 |pmid=16636630 |doi=10.1159/000091772 |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?doi=91772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2009 Point/Counterpoint article, Lisa Cosgrove, PhD and Harold J. Bursztajn, MD noted that "the fact that 70% of the task force members have reported direct industry ties—an increase of almost 14% over the percentage of DSM-IV task force members who had industry ties—shows that disclosure policies alone, especially those that rely on an honor system, are not enough and that more specific safeguards are needed".&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove L, Bursztajn HJ, Kupfer DJ, Regier DA. [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-v/article/10168/1364672?pageNumber=1 "Toward Credible Conflict of Interest Policies in Clinical Psychiatry"] [[Psychiatric Times]] 26:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Kupfer, chair of the DSM-5 task force, and Darrel A.

In June 2009, Allen Frances issued strongly worded criticisms of the processes leading to DSM-5 and the risk of "serious, subtle, (...) ubiquitous" and "dangerous" unintended consequences such as new "false 'epidemics'".  He writes that "the work on DSM-V has displayed the most unhappy combination of soaring ambition and weak methodology" and is concerned about the task force's "inexplicably closed and secretive process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frances |first=Allen |date=June 26, 2009 |title=A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1425378?verify=0A |format=Full text |accessdate=September 6, 2009 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His and Spitzer's concerns about the contract that the APA drew up for consultants to sign, agreeing not to discuss drafts of the fifth edition beyond the task force and committees, have also been aired and debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Lane |title=The Diagnostic Madness of DSM-V |work=Slate |date=July 24, 2009 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2223479/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment, in May 2008, of two of the taskforce members, [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[Ray Blanchard]], led to an internet petition to remove them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Activists alarmed over APA: Head of psychiatry panel favors 'change' therapy for some trans teens |author=[[Lou Chibbaro, Jr.]] |date=May 30, 2008 |work=[[Washington Blade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to MSNBC, "The petition accuses Zucker of having engaged in 'junk science' and promoting 'hurtful theories' during his career, especially advocating the idea that children who are unambiguously male or female anatomically, but seem confused about their [[gender identity]], can be treated by encouraging gender expression in line with their anatomy."&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Alexander |title=What's 'normal' sex?

In 2011, psychologist [[Brent Robbins]] co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Approximately 13,000 individuals and [[mental health]] professionals signed a petition in support of the letter. Thirteen other [[American Psychological Association]] divisions endorsed the petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointpark.edu/NewsArtsSciences.aspx?id=467 |title=Professor co-authors letter about America's mental health manual |author= |date=December 12, 2011 |work=Point Park University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2011 article about the debate in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Robbins notes that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/26/MNJJ1M3DFK.DTL |title=Revision of psychiatric manual under fire |author=Erin Allday |date=November 26, 2011 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a footnote was added to the draft text which explains the distinction between grief and depression.&lt;ref name=carey2012nyt&gt;{{Citation |last=Carey |first=Benedict |publication-date=May 8, 2012 |title=Psychiatry Manual Drafters Back Down on Diagnoses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |at=nytimes.com |accessdate=May 12, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/health/dsm-panel-backs-down-on-diagnoses.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 has been criticized for purportedly saying nothing about the biological underpinnings of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-dsm5-ignores-biology-mental-illness/ ''New DSM-5 Ignores Biology of Mental Illness'']; "The latest edition of psychiatry's standard guidebook neglects the biology of mental illness. New research may change that." May 5, 2013 [[Scientific American]]&lt;/ref&gt; A book-long appraisal of the DSM-5, with contributions from philosophers, historians and anthropologists, was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Demazeux |first1=Steeves |last2=Singy |first2=Patrick |title=The DSM-5 in Perspective: Philosophical Reflections on the Psychiatric Babel |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-017-9764-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial association of DSM-5 panel members with industry continues to be a concern for financial conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=Cosgrove&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cosgrove |first=Lisa |author2=Drimsky Lisa |title=A comparison of DSM-iv and DSM-5 panel members' financial associations with industry: A pernicous problem persisits |journal=PLoS Medicine |date=March 2012 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=1–5 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001190 |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001190 |pmid=22427747 |pmc=3302834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the DSM-5 task force members, 69% report having ties to the pharmaceutical industry, an increase from the 57% of DSM-IV task force members.&lt;ref name=Cosgrove /&gt;

A 2015 essay from an Australian university criticized the DSM-5 for having poor cultural diversity, stating that recent work done in cognitive sciences and cognitive anthropology is still only accepting western psychology as the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Dominic|title=Deviant deviance": Cultural diversity in DSM-5|date=2015 |url=https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/MurphyDeviantDevianceCulturalDiversityDSMV2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borderline personality disorder controversy===
In 2003, the Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) campaigned to change the name and designation of [[borderline personality disorder]] in DSM-5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tara4bpd.org Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD)]&lt;/ref&gt; The paper ''How Advocacy is Bringing BPD into the Light''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=35 |title=TARA Association for Personality Disorder |work=tara4bpd.org |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020191907/http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=35 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that "the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing [[Social stigma|stigma]]." Instead, it proposed the name "emotional regulation disorder" or "emotional dysregulation disorder." There was also discussion about changing borderline personality disorder, an Axis II diagnosis (personality disorders and mental retardation), to an Axis I diagnosis (clinical disorders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=New |first=Antonia |author2=Triebwasser Joseph |author3=Charney Dennis |title=The case for shifting borderline personality disorder to Axis I |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |date=October 2008 |volume=64 |issue=8 |pages=653–9 |url=http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/New%20Triebwasser%20Charney%20Bio%20Psychiatry%20In%20Press%20(BPD%20to%20Axis%20I).pdf |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.04.020 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |pmid=18550033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TARA-APD recommendations do not appear to have affected the American Psychiatric Association, the publisher of the DSM. As noted above, the DSM-5 does not employ a multi-axial diagnostic scheme, therefore the distinction between Axis I and II disorders no longer exists in the DSM [[nosology]]. The name, the diagnostic criteria for, and description of, borderline personality disorder remain largely unchanged from [[DSM-IV-TR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=Fifth |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Arlington, VA |pages=663–6 |isbn=978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Psychological Society response===
The [[British Psychological Society]] stated in its June 2011 response to DSM-5 draft versions, that it had "more concerns than plaudits".&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.bps.org.uk/_publicationfiles/consultation-responses/DSM-5%202011%20-%20BPS%20response.pdf British Psychological Society Response, June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It criticized proposed diagnoses as "clearly based largely on social norms, with 'symptoms' that all rely on subjective judgements... not value-free, but rather reflect[ing] current normative social expectations", noting doubts over the reliability, validity, and value of existing criteria, that personality disorders were not normed on the general population, and that "not otherwise specified" categories covered a "huge" 30% of all personality disorders.

It also expressed a major concern that "clients and the general public are negatively affected by the continued and continuous medicalisation of their natural and normal responses to their experiences... which demand helping responses, but which do not reflect illnesses so much as normal individual variation".

The Society suggested as its primary specific recommendation, a change from using "diagnostic frameworks" to a description based on an individual's specific experienced problems, and that mental disorders are better explored as part of a spectrum shared with [[normality (behavior)|normality]]:

{{Cquote|''[We recommend] a revision of the way mental distress is thought about, starting with recognition of the overwhelming evidence that it is on a spectrum with 'normal' experience, and that psychosocial factors such as poverty, unemployment and trauma are the most strongly-evidenced causal factors. Rather than applying preordained diagnostic categories to clinical populations, we believe that any classification system should begin from the bottom up – starting with specific experiences, problems or 'symptoms' or 'complaints'... We would like to see the base unit of measurement as specific problems (e.g. hearing voices, feelings of anxiety etc.)? These would be more helpful too in terms of epidemiology''.

''While some people find a name or a diagnostic label helpful, our contention is that this helpfulness results from a knowledge that their problems are recognised (in both senses of the word) understood, validated, explained (and explicable) and have some relief. Clients often, unfortunately, find that diagnosis offers only a spurious promise of such benefits. Since – for example – two people with a diagnosis of 'schizophrenia' or 'personality disorder' may possess no two symptoms in common, it is difficult to see what communicative benefit is served by using these diagnoses. We believe that a description of a person's real problems would suffice. Moncrieff and others have shown that diagnostic labels are less useful than a description of a person's problems for predicting treatment response, so again diagnoses seem positively unhelpful compared to the alternatives''. - [[British Psychological Society]] June 2011 response}}

===National Institute of Mental Health===
[[National Institute of Mental Health]] director Thomas R. Insel, MD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/directors-biography.shtml |title=Director's Biography |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=May 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523015756/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/directors-biography.shtml |archivedate=May 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in an April 29, 2013 blog post about the DSM-5:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Insel |first=Thomas |title=Transforming Diagnosis |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|''The goal of this new manual, as with all previous editions, is to provide a common language for describing psychopathology. While DSM has been described as a "Bible" for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been "reliability" – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. The weakness is its lack of validity ... Patients with mental disorders deserve better''.}}

Insel also discussed an NIMH effort to develop a new classification system, [[Research Domain Criteria]] (RDoC), currently for research purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) (Draft 3.1) |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/nimh-research-domain-criteria-rdoc.shtml |date=June 2011 |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insel's post sparked a flurry of reaction, some of which might be termed [[sensationalism|sensationalistic]], with headlines such as "Goodbye to the DSM-V",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goodbye to the DSM-V |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/new-harbinger-publications-inc/goodbye-to-the-dsmv_b_3307510.html |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |first=New |last=Harbinger |date=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Federal institute for mental health abandons controversial 'bible' of psychiatry",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal institute for mental health abandons controversial 'bible' of psychiatry |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/3/4296626/nimh-abandons-controversial-bible-of-psychiatry |publisher=Verge |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "National Institute of Mental Health abandoning the DSM",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Institute of Mental Health abandoning the DSM |url=http://mindhacks.com/2013/05/03/national-institute-of-mental-health-abandoning-the-dsm/ |publisher=Mind Hacks |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Psychiatry divided as mental health 'bible' denounced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychiatry divided as mental health 'bible' denounced |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23487-psychiatry-divided-as-mental-health-bible-denounced.html |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other responses provided a more nuanced analysis of the NIMH Director's post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did the NIMH Withdraw Support for the DSM-5?

&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Insel, on behalf of NIMH, issued a joint statement with [[Jeffrey Lieberman|Jeffrey A. Lieberman]], MD, president of the American Psychiatric Association,&lt;ref name="NIMH and APA joint statement"&gt;{{cite web |title=DSM-5 and RDoC: Shared Interests |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2013/dsm-5-and-rdoc-shared-interests.shtml |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health and American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasized that DSM-5 "... represents the best information currently available for clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Patients, families, and insurers can be confident that effective treatments are available and that the DSM is the key resource for delivering the best available care. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not changed its position on DSM-5." Insel and Lieberman say that DSM-5 and RDoC "represent complementary, not competing, frameworks" for characterizing diseases and disorders.&lt;ref name="NIMH and APA joint statement" /&gt; However, epistemologists of psychiatry tend to see the RDoC project as a putative revolutionary system that in the long run will try to replace the DSM, its expected early effect being a liberalization of the research criteria, with an increasing number of research centers adopting the RDoC definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Aragona M.

[[India]] is a party to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], having signed the treaty on 30 March 2007 and ratified it on 1 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UN Treaty Collection: parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: List of parties |publisher=United Nations |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2015-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819033725/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike those in the West, most people with '''[[Disability|disabilities]] in India''' and their families are focused on survival in the context of deep poverty. India's [[disability rights movement]], however, mainly comprises elite, middle-class activists who generally mirror the goals of the disability rights movement in Western countries.&lt;ref name="ghaiexcl" /&gt;

Common public perceptions of disability in India are influenced by certain discourses that are generally rejected by the field of [[disability studies]]. People with disabilities are often seen as wicked or deceitful, or as unable to progress to adulthood and dependent on charity and pity for assistance.&lt;ref name="ghaiexcl" /&gt; This is as opposed to an emphasis on the strengths people possess despite their disabilities, and their potential for adaptation.

Disability in India is affected by other social divisions such as class, gender, and [[caste system in India|caste]].&lt;ref name="ghaiexcl" /&gt; Statistics show that women with disabilities in India are more marginalized than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="ghaiexcl" /&gt; Anita Ghai argues that [[feminism in India|Indian feminism]] has ignored the unique conditions of women with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ghaiexcl" /&gt;

==Prevalence==

The number of people with disabilities in India was stated as 21 million in the [[2001 Census of India]].&lt;ref name="ID-charity"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chavan |first1=B.S. |last2=Rozatkar |first2=Abhijit R. |title=Intellectual disability in India: Charity to right based |journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry |date=2014 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=113–116 |doi=10.4103/0019-5545.130477 |pmid=24891695 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4040055/ |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2011 Census of India|2011 census]], the figure rose by 22.4% to 26.8 million.&lt;ref name="toi-rising"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sivakumar |first1=B. |title=Disabled population up by 22.4% in 2001-11 |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Disabled-population-up-by-22-4-in-2001-11/articleshow/28072371.cms |accessdate=19 August 2018 |agency=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ghai offered a higher estimate in 2002, of 70 million.&lt;ref name=ghaiexcl&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghai|first1=Anita|title=Disabled Women: An Excluded Agenda of Indian Feminism|journal=Hypatia|date=2002|volume=17|issue=3|pages=49–66|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hypatia/v017/17.3ghai.html|accessdate=20 November 2015|doi=10.1353/hyp.2002.0052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 census, 20.3% of people with disabilities in India have movement disabilities, 18.9% have hearing impairments, and 18.8% have visual impairments. The 2011 census additionally collected data on mental disability for the first time, and found that 5.6% of Indians with disabilities fall into that category.&lt;ref name="toi-rising"/&gt;

== Legislation and Government Policy ==
The Parliament enacted the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunity, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act in 1995 to provide recognition to the rights and special needs of the disabled in the country. It also provided for reservations for persons with disabilities in government jobs and higher educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/fact-check-what-has-the-govt-done-for-persons-with-disabilities|title=Fact Check: What Has the Govt Done for Persons With Disabilities?|work=The Quint|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016]] replaced the earlier legislation, and widened the scope for defining disability in India, with types of recognised disabilities being increased from 7 to 21. The reservation offered in the 1995 legislation was also increased to provide more opportunities for the upliftment of the differently abled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thelogicalindian.com/fact-check/government-disabilities-act/|title=Fact Checking Government Claims On The ‘Rights Of Persons With Disabilities Act’|date=2018-10-11|work=The Logical Indian|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government has also enacted initiatives such as the [[Accessible India Campaign]] to make public spaces and transportation barrier-free for persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.hindustantimes.com/analysis/our-cities-cannot-be-smart-until-they-are-accessible-for-everybody/story-RXiPRhqmFG4wHj59UrS6qO.html|title=Our cities cannot be smart, until they are accessible for everybody|date=2018-10-23|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the term "Divyangjan" was also mandated as an alternative to the term "Persons with Disability" in Hindi to sensitise the general populace about the plight of the differently abled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/india/whats-the-correct-word-a-little-sensitivity-goes-a-long-way.html|title=What's the correct word? A little sensitivity goes a long way!|last=Pioneer|first=The|work=The Pioneer|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Indian cinema==
 
India's [[Bollywood|Hindi-language cinema]] has often reinforced negative stereotypes about people with disabilities, but more recently it has produced several films that have helped raise awareness.&lt;ref name=moha&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohapatra|first1=Atanu|title=Portrayal of Disability in Hindi Cinema: A Study of Emerging Trends of Differently-Abled|journal=Asian Journal of Multidimensional Research|date=Dec 2012|volume=1|issue=7|url=http://www.tarj.in/images/download/ajmr/AJMR%20DEC.%202012%20PAPERS%20PDF/12.12,%20Dr.%20Atanu%20Mohapatra.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurrent theme has for a long time been that disability is a punishment for misdeeds, for instance in ''[[Jeevan Naiya]]'' (1936), ''[[Aadmi (1968 film)|Aadmi]]'' (1968), and ''[[Dhanwan (1981 film)|Dhanwan]]'' (1981).&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt; Characters with mental disabilities have frequently been used as comic relief, a trend which has been criticized by [[Dinesh Bhugra]] as reinforcing social stigma.&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt; Atanu Mohapatra identifies several ways in which women with disabilities are misrepresented in Hindi films as compared to men with disabilities: they are included less frequently, they very rarely win the love of able-bodied men despite the converse often being the case, they are much less likely to become self-supporting economically, and they are not included unless they are physically attractive.&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt;

The decade following 2005 has seen a shift in the representation of people with disabilities by Hindi cinema. The immediate cause for the shift appears to have been an international disability film festival in 2005 facilitated by the Ability Foundation (an Indian NGO).&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt; ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005) broke new ground by focusing on a female protagonist with a disability, a girl who is blind, deaf, and mute but succeeds academically after considerable struggle.&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt; Other films including ''[[Taare Zameen Par]]'' (2007) by famed actor and director [[Aamir Khan]] have explored the lives of people with [[dyslexia]], [[progeria]], [[Asperger syndrome]], and [[amnesia]], among other conditions.&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt; There were some earlier precedents to these more well-rounded portrayals, including ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) and ''[[Sparsh (film)|Sparsh]]'' (1980), which explored deafness and blindness respectively.&lt;ref name="moha" /&gt; Conversely, some recent Hindi films have continued to display ill-founded stereotypes about people with disabilities.Also some Tamil film industry movies have portrayed disabled people like the movie ''[[Deiva Thirumagal]]'' which portrays a mentally challenged father and his daughter.

The ERRs are orphan [[nuclear receptors]], meaning the identity of their endogenous ligand has yet to be unambiguously determined. They are named because of sequence homology with estrogen receptors, but do not appear to bind estrogens or other tested steroid hormones. 

There are three human '''[[estrogen]] related receptors''':
* [[estrogen-related receptor alpha|ERRα]] ({{gene|ESRRA}})
* [[estrogen-related receptor beta|ERRβ]] ({{gene|ESRRB}})
* [[estrogen-related receptor gamma|ERRγ]] ({{gene|ESRRG}})

ERRs bind enhancers throughout the genome where they exert effects on gene regulation. The ERR family exhibit varying transcriptional activation capabilities and physically interact with the transcriptional co-activators [[PPARGC1A|PGC1-alpha]] and PGC1-beta,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schreiber SN, Emter R, Hock MB, Knutti D, Cardenas J, Podvinec M, Oakeley EJ, Kralli A | title = The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) functions in PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha)-induced mitochondrial biogenesis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 17 | pages = 6472–7 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15087503 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0308686101 | pmc = 404069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonoda J, Laganière J, Mehl IR, Barish GD, Chong LW, Li X, Scheffler IE, Mock DC, Bataille AR, Robert F, Lee CH, Giguère V, Evans RM | title = Nuclear receptor ERR alpha and coactivator PGC-1 beta are effectors of IFN-gamma-induced host defense | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 21 | issue = 15 | pages = 1909–20 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17671090 | pmc = 1935029 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1553007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huss JM, Kopp RP, Kelly DP | title = Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) coactivates the cardiac-enriched nuclear receptors estrogen-related receptor-alpha and -gamma.

'''''Go the Fuck to Sleep''''' is a book written by American author [[Adam Mansbach]] and illustrated by [[Ricardo Cortés (illustrator)|Ricardo Cortés]]. Described as a "children's book for adults",&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; it reached No. 1 on [[Amazon.com]]'s bestseller list a month before its release, thanks to an unintended [[viral marketing]] campaign during which booksellers forwarded [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] copies of the book by e-mail.

==Background==
When Adam Mansbach's daughter, Vivien, was two years old, she would take up to two hours to fall asleep. Exhausted and exasperated, one night Mansbach posted a note on [[Facebook]], "Look out for my forthcoming children’s book, ''Go the&amp;nbsp;— to Sleep''". Following his post, friends of Mansbach responded enthusiastically, so that Mansbach began writing what was then only a hypothetical book. Mansbach had the illustrations for the [[picture book]] done by a friend, illustrator Ricardo Cortés (a contributor to ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name=neill&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Bookseller]]|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/spoof-kids-book-canongate.html|title=Spoof kids' book to Canongate|last=Neill|first=Graeme|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2011|archivedate=October 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028025037/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/spoof-kids-book-canongate}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and approached [[Akashic Books]], a book publisher from New York.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmanci|first=Reyhan|title=A Whim, A Book, And, Wow!|accessdate=May 13, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 28, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/us/29bcbart.html?scp=1&amp;sq=adam%20mansbach&amp;st=cse|archivedate=October 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028024949/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/us/29bcbart.html?scp=1&amp;sq=adam%20mansbach&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content summary==
[[File:Adam Mansbach.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Mansbach]], author of ''Go the Fuck to Sleep'', in 2007]]

''Go the Fuck to Sleep'' is written as a "children's book for adults".&lt;ref name=harmanci/&gt; While its writing is in the style of classic children's [[Bedtime story|bedtime stories]], it includes the parent's language as commentary on the tricks used by Mansbach's daughter to avoid having to go to bed.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite news|last=Balzer|first=Sarah Western|title=Go The F*ck To Sleep (Review)|url=http://life.hereisthecity.com/2011/05/12/go-the-fk-to-sleep-review/|accessdate= May 13, 2011|newspaper=Here is the City|date= May 12, 2011|archivedate=October 6, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006163333/http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2011/05/12/go-the-fk-to-sleep-review/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator advises the child that other animals have gone to sleep already including cats and lambs, and asks the child to "Please go the fuck to sleep".&lt;ref name="halford" /&gt; As the pleading progresses, the narrator begins to grow more upset, decrying himself as a parent, then eventually falling asleep himself. He wakes to find his child asleep, then quietly exits to watch a movie with his spouse. Unfortunately, a beep from the microwave wakes up their child again.

==Publication history==
''Go the Fuck to Sleep'' was subject to an unintended viral marketing campaign after PDF copies of the book, presumably from advance copies sent to booksellers, were distributed via email. While the book was originally scheduled for release in October 2011, by the end of April the book had hit No. 2 on [[Amazon.com]]'s bestseller list,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; and by May 12 the book was No. 1. In the meantime, the publishing date was moved up to June, and the publisher increased its first printing to 150,000 copies.&lt;ref name=hetter/&gt; Akashic, which acknowledged the importance of [[social media]] in popularizing the book ("it's a miracle from the heavens for us"&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;), is trying to prevent [[copyright infringement]] of the book. The book's title on the cover had the letters "uc" in the word "fuck" hidden by a full moon, while the book's text includes the full word.&lt;ref name=harmanci&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmanci|first=Reyhan|title='Go the F--- to Sleep': The Case of the Viral PDF|url=http://www.baycitizen.org/books/story/go-f-sleep-case-viral-pdf/|work=[[The Bay Citizen]]|date= May 12, 2011|accessdate= May 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020084505/https://www.baycitizen.org/news/books/go-f-sleep-case-viral-pdf/|archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights for the United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] were acquired by [[Canongate Books|Canongate]].&lt;ref name=neill/&gt; The [[film rights]] have been optioned by [[Fox 2000]].&lt;ref name=harmanci/&gt;

The audiobook company [[Audible.com]] published an audiobook version of ''Go the Fuck to Sleep,'' narrated by [[Samuel L. Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/06/samuel-l-jackson-reads-go-the-f-to-sleep.html|title=Samuel L. Jackson reads 'Go the F --- to Sleep'|last=Netburn|first=Deborah|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 15, 2011|publisher=latimesblogs.latimes.com|archivedate=December 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210105236/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/06/samuel-l-jackson-reads-go-the-f-to-sleep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CD's total running time is just over 7 minutes, which includes an unabridged reading of the book by Jackson, a brief introductory monologue by Jackson explaining why he decided to record the book, and approximately 2 minutes' worth of introductory and legal matter (spoken copyright notice, etc.). The actual reading of the manuscript by Jackson runs approximately 4 1/2 minutes.

As a follow-up, Mansbach wrote a family-friendly version of the book called ''Seriously, Just Go To Sleep''.&lt;ref name="seriouslyjust"&gt;{{cite book|first=Adam|last=Mansbach|authorlink=Adam Mansbach|title=Seriously, Just Go to Sleep|publisher=Akashic Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1617750786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the original was a parody of a children's book written expressly for the adult age group, ''Seriously, Just Go To Sleep'' is a real children's book for a parent to read to his or her child, and the word "fuck" was replaced by the parent in the story expressing frustration with the stubborn child in a more [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|G-rated]] way. For example, "I know you're not thirsty, that's bullshit. Stop lying. Lie the fuck down, my darling, and sleep" was changed to "I know you're not thirsty. You just had a drink. Stop goofing around now, and sleep."&lt;ref name="seriouslyjust" /&gt;

The book was translated into many other languages, and in February 2014, it was announced on Facebook and in other sources the book would receive a translation into [[Jamaican patois]], entitled ''Go de Rass to Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/02/11/hey-mon-go-the-f-to-sleep-gets-a-jamaican-patois-translation/  |title=Hey mon: ‘Go the F— to Sleep’ gets a Jamaican patois translation|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=Style Blog|first=Ron|last=Charles|accessdate=October 28, 2014|date=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/go-de-rass-to-sleep/ |title=Go de Rass to Sleep|work=Akashic Books|publisher=Akashicbooks.com|accessdate=October 28, 2014|date=2014|archivedate=March 18, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318180807/http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/go-de-rass-to-sleep/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
According to Mansbach, the frustrations he wrote about "are not permissible to talk about. We're not completely honest because we don't want to be bad parents."&lt;ref name=hetter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-13/living/go.the.f--k.to.sleep_1_parenting-books-sleep-bad-parents?_s=PM:LIVING|title=Bedtime story: Go the bleep to sleep|last=Hetter|first=Katia|date= May 13, 2011|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate= May 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028202100/http://www.cnn.com/2011/LIVING/05/13/go.the.f--k.to.sleep/index.html?_s=PM:LIVING|archivedate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macy Halford said this frustration elicited a response peculiar to modern parents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whatever the cause, it is definitely the case that, when faced with a kid who refuses to go to sleep, we get annoyed, like all parents before us, but, rather than just abandoning the child to the dark and telling it that it can go to sleep or stay awake as it likes but it is staying in the bed until morning (remember [[Proust]] at the opening of ''Swann’s Way''?), we sit there with it, reading to it and singing to it and distracting it with swirling night lights until it decides it feels like going to sleep, all the while thinking to ourselves, Go the fuck to sleep, kid."&lt;ref name=halford/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Mark Rotella]], an editor at ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' (and father of two), this is one of the books "that are less earnest about raising your child. They help parents step back and laugh at themselves a bit&amp;nbsp;... It's more like a parenting book for when the parent is inconsolable in the middle of night and frustrated."&lt;ref name=hetter/&gt; The publisher for the UK and the Commonwealth, Canongate, likewise pointed to the book as a parents' book: "This book perfectly captures the familiar and unspoken tribulations of putting your child down for the night. In the process, it opens up a conversation about parenting, charming and enraging as it can be, and chimes a note of solidarity with tired parents everywhere."&lt;ref name=neill/&gt;

==Reception==

Positive initial response to the Facebook posts was matched by positive criticism from reviewers. Macy Halford, writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', said "the book is super funny, and the art, by Ricardo Cortés, is perversely sweet, so sweet and genuine that it made me cringe."&lt;ref name=halford&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mystery of ''Go the F to Sleep'' Solved|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/05/the-mystery-of-go-the-f-to-sleep-solved-1.html|last=Halford|first=Macy|date= May 5, 2011|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate= May 13, 2011|archivedate=October 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028025529/http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-mystery-of-go-the-f-to-sleep-solved}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reviewers chimed in from experience, as did Sarah Western Balzer, writing for ''Here Is the City'': "It goes on a bit too long, and by the end, he's kind of in a rage. But then, putting a two- or three-year-old to bed can be totally fucking enraging at times."&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt;

The senior vice president and director of Macmillan Children's Publishing announced that she felt the book was a parody of Macmillan's book ''It's Time to Sleep, My Love'' by author [[Eric Metaxas]] and illustrator Nancy Tillman, saying "Except for the profanity laced throughout, the book has the same kind of lilting lullaby as Eric's, and the art style is the same as Nancy's."&lt;ref name="tofeiwel"&gt;{{cite news|title=To Feiwel and Friends, Instant Bestseller Is a Bit of Deja Vu |first=Sally |last=Lodge|date=June 8, 2011|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|publisher=PublishersWeekly.com|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/47565-to-feiwel-and-friends-instant-bestseller-is-a-bit-of-deja-vu.html|accessdate=June 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227101241/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/47565-to-feiwel-and-friends-instant-bestseller-is-a-bit-of-deja-vu.html|archivedate=December 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Metaxas complained that the book damages the innocence of children's lullabies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Metaxas |first=Eric |subjectlink=Eric Metaxas |interviewer=[[Hugh Hewitt]] |title=Hugh Hewitt Show|date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansbach responded that he was not familiar with the Macmillan book and that his work satirized children's bedtime books in general rather than any particular book.&lt;ref name="tofeiwel" /&gt;

==Parodies==

In July 2011, ''Men's Health'' published a retort to the book: a parody poem written from the child's perspective titled "Get the Fuck Out of My Room" and containing parenting advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.menshealth.com/best-life/get-out-my-room |title=Get the F**k out of my room! |author1=Eric Adams |author2=Steve Belanger |author3=Adam Campbell |author4=Bill Phillips |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |date=July 2011 |work=[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]] |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722164922/http://www.menshealth.com/best-life/get-out-my-room |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[MAD Magazine]]'' parodied the book as "Stay The Fuck Awake" in its February 2012 issue, in reference to [[air traffic controllers]] sleeping on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On the Stands: MAD #513 | work=Tom's MAD Blog!|publisher=tomrichmond.com|first=Tom|last=Richmond |date=December 12, 2011|url=http://www.tomrichmond.com/blog/tag/513/|accessdate=September 27, 2012|archivedate=October 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028203116/http://www.tomrichmond.com/blog/tag/513/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''MAD Magazine'' 20 Dumbest Things of 2011: Sleeping Air Traffic Controllers in "Stay the F**k Awake"| publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=December 5, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/23.html |accessdate=September 27, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]] |archivedate=January 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127092744/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/23.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/23/sleeping-air-traffic-controller_n_839775.html |accessdate=September 27, 2012|title=NTSB Investigating Sleeping Air Traffic Controller At Reagan National|date=March 23, 2011

In September 2012, Samuel L. Jackson parodied his audio narration of the book by appearing in an ad for [[Barack Obama]]'s reelection campaign entitled "Wake the Fuck Up," written by Mansbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blistein|first=Jon|title=Samuel L.

Jackson]], the book attracted several celebrity readings including by German film director [[Werner Herzog]] at the official launch of the book at the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Martin|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2011/06/video-werner-herzog-reads-go-fck-sleep/38855/|title=Werner Herzog Reads 'Go the F*ck to Sleep'|work=[[The Atlantic Wire]]|date=June 15, 2011|archivedate=October 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028204720/http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2011/06/video-werner-herzog-reads-go-fck-sleep/38855/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Pollak]], doing a vocal impression of [[Christopher Walken]], read some of the story on ''[[Kevin Pollak's Chat Show]]'' by viewer request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Pollak|authorlink=Kevin Pollak|title=Kevin Pollak reading a piece of "Go the F*** To Sleep" as Christopher Walken |publisher=YouTube (Official channel) |work=Kevin Pollak's Chat Show|date=June 22, 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH9k8t-d79k |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805181300/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH9k8t-d79k&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;amp;has_verified=1|archivedate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a rapidly growing [[internet meme]], the publisher of the book in Australia, [[Text Publishing]], posted a video of Australian actress [[Noni Hazlehurst]] reading the book to camera in the style she formerly used on the children's television program [[Play School (Australian TV series)|''Play School'']]. She immediately offered to record a reading of the book after being sent a copy by the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Karl|last=Quinn|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/noni-hazlehurst-reads-expletiveridden-childrens-book-20110713-1hd2s.html|title=Noni Hazlehurst reads expletive-ridden 'children's' book|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=July 13, 2011|archivedate=July 16, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716062329/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/noni-hazlehurst-reads-expletiveridden-childrens-book-20110713-1hd2s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Go the F**k to Sleep|location=Australia|work=[[Text Publishing]]|date=July 13, 2011|url=http://textpublishing.com.au/books-and-authors/book/go-the-f-k-to-sleep/|accessdate=September 27, 2012|archivedate=October 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028205054/https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/go-the-f-k-to-sleep/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local health departments ==

[[Local health departments in the United States]] were the first health departments in the United States.  There is some dispute at the local level as to the claim of being the first to establish a local board or health department.  At least three cities claim to be the first health department in the United States.  The city of [[Petersburg, Virginia]], claims it established the first permanent board of health in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Department of Health. Go to Virginia Department of Health. http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/three-rivers/history/. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], claims it established the first US health department in 1793,&lt;ref&gt;About The Baltimore City Health Department. Baltimore City Health Department. https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/20. Published March 30, 2016. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], followed 1794, claiming its Board of Health as "one of the first".&lt;ref&gt;Agency History. Philadelphia Department of Public Health. http://www.phila.gov/phils/docs/inventor/graphics/agencies/A080.htm. Published April 24, 2000. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Boston, Massachusetts]], claims in 1799 it established the first board of health and the first health department, with Paul Revere named as the first health officer.&lt;ref&gt;Our History. Boston Public Health Commission. http://www.bphc.org/aboutus/our-history/Pages/our-history.aspx. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== State health departments ==

Each [[state health agency]] initially followed local moves to create health departments in each state.  [[Louisiana]] was the first state to create a state board of health in 1855,&lt;ref&gt;History. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners. http://www.lsbme.la.gov/content/history. Published 2014. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; but it functioned primarily to influence regulations in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;Everard W. New Orleans Health Department Records, City Archives. New Orleans Public Library. http://nutrias.org/inv/health.htm. Published December 10, 2001. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Massachusetts was the first to establish a state board that functioned throughout its state with statewide authority in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;State Board of Health of Massachusetts: a brief history of its organization and its work, 1869–1912 : material compiled mainly from the reports of the Board : Massachusetts. Dept. of Public Health Streaming. Internet Archive. https://archive.org/details/stateboardofheal00mass. Published January 1, 1970. Accessed September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States Department of Health and Human Services ==

At the national level, a simple National Board of Health functioned from 1879–1883.&lt;ref&gt;Michael JM. The National Board of Health: 1879–1883. Public Health Reports. 2011;126(1):123-129. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001811/&lt;/ref&gt;  Not until 1939 was another federal agency established to manage public health on a national level.  It went through several iterations a federal agency called the Federal Security Agency that had health functions such as the [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), and the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).  In 1953, that agency was reorganized and its health functions were elevated to a cabinet-level position to establish the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW), which was renamed in 1980 to become the current and modern [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).

== Current laws and regulations overview ==
HHS notes the laws and regulations that it carries out on its website.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA). Laws &amp; Regulations. HHS.gov. https://www.hhs.gov/regulations/index.html. Published March 18, 2016. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Every state also has a health department to which HHS has given a description and hyperlink for each state health department.&lt;ref&gt;State Health Departments. Healthfinder.gov. https://healthfinder.gov/FindServices/SearchContext.aspx?show=1&amp;topic=820. Published September 17, 2017. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other levels of government within each state are varied.
For example, the [[California Department of Public Health]] (CDPH) has within it a health department in each of its 58 subdivisions called counties, but only three cities.&lt;ref&gt;Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). Research. State and Local Public Health Relationships.  http://astho.org/Research/Major-Publications/California-Case-Study/. Published May 2012. Accessed September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; One is in [[San Francisco]]: the San Francisco Department of Public Health; and two are in [[Los Angeles County]]: the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services and the Pasadena Public Health Department.

'''Illicit drug use in Australia''' is the [[Recreational drug use|recreational use]] of [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibited drugs]] in [[Australia]]. Illicit drugs include illegal drugs (such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[opiates]], and certain types of [[stimulants]]), pharmaceutical drugs (such as [[pain-killers]] and [[tranquillisers]]) when used for non-medical purposes, and other substances used inappropriately (such as [[Inhalant abuse|inhalants]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/publication-detail/?id=32212254712&amp;tab=2 |format=downloadable PDF |author=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |year=2011 |title=2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey report |work=Drug statistics series |number=25 |id=PHE 145 |location=Canberra |publisher=AIHW |accessdate=23 February 2012 |isbn=978-1-74249-188-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to government and community organisations, the use and [[drug abuse|abuse]], and the illegality, of illicit drugs is a social, health and legal issue that creates an annual illegal market estimated to be worth {{AUD}}6.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Collins |first2=Helen |last2=Lapsley |first3=Robert |last3=Marks |title=Illicit drugs damage Australian business |publisher=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation |date=March 2007 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug use in Australia==

===History===
Prior to [[Australian Federation]], there was little policy response to the use of illicit substances.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Margaret |editor1-first=Jurg |editor1-last=Gerber |editor2-first=Eric L. |editor2-last=Jensen |title=Drug War, American Style: The Internationalization of Failed Policy and Its Alternatives |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yyjnqwvaC0wC |format=essay collection |accessdate=19 May 2008 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |pages=97–120 |chapter=Australia's Drug Policy - Our Own? |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyjnqwvaC0wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA97,M1 |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-3405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opium]] was mostly regulated via colonial trade laws, with most government interventions taking the form of warning labels, designed to prevent death through overdose. According to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Premier's Drug Advisory Council in 1899, there were three main "classes" of opium users. The first class of opium users were [[middle-class]], [[middle-age]]d women who took the drug for [[Menstruation|menstrual pain]] or to alleviate the symptoms of depression. The second class of opium users included doctors, nurses and other health professionals, who used the drug as a strategy for coping with the [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] of their work. The third class were [[Chinese immigration to Australia|Chinese immigrants]], amongst whom the drug was primarily used as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational substance]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;

Many of the initial attempts to control opium were motivated by [[racism]], with [[Anglo-Celtic Australian]]s citing opium use by [[Chinese Australians]] as a danger to health and
[[morality]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt; As Australia approached [[Federation of Australia|Federation]], an increasing number of [[Bill (law)|bills]] were passed in state parliaments to restrict the use of opium. By 1905, there were many laws in place which prohibited the import and use of smoking grade opium; however, by the 1930s, Australia had the developed world's highest per capita rate of heroin consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Name your poison: Ecstasy, or MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/4984/full |journal=Cosmos Magazine |publisher=Luna Media Pty Ltd. |accessdate=5 November 2012 |author=Karen McGhee |issue=40 |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of laws and policies which prohibited the import and use of opium, [[Taxation in Australia|taxation income]] the government had previously been earning from opium imports was redundant. A [[Customs| customs report]] in 1908 noted that "it is very doubtful if such a prohibition has lessened to any great extent the amount bought into Australia."&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;

Desmond Manderson, an expert on the history of Australian drug policy, has asserted that from this time forward, Australia's drug policies have been more dictated by international relations and a political need for [[moral panic]] than any concern for health and welfare (Manderson, 1993).&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;

Following [[World War I]], the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] and [[The Treaty of Versailles]] began to set international agreements on drug laws (Berridge, 1999). [[United Kingdom|Britain]] signed the [[Treaty|treaties]] on behalf of Australia, and from this point on, Australia's State and Territory governments have created their own laws and policies relating to illicit drug use.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, there was an increasingly internationalist approach to drug policy, overseen by the [[League of Nations]], with Australia enacting a series of increasingly strict drug laws (Mandelson, 1987),&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt; despite the low incidence of illicit drug use in Australia during this period. Although Australia was initially influenced by the strict illicit drug controls and penalties promoted by the League of Nations, and subsequently the [[United Nations]]; following the end of the [[World War II|World War 2]], Australia's illicit drug policies became increasingly influenced by the United States, due to the United States' increasingly pro-active participation in United Nations policy making and large financial contribution to United Nations budgets. Hence, the strong British influence on Australia's drug policies waned, and Australia's illicit drug policies shifted from a [[Public health|health]] and social focus to an increased focus on [[law enforcement]] and [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illicit Drug Policies: Using Evidence To Get Better Outcomes|url=http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=B53E9387|work=Policy and Programs, RACP|publisher=The Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illicit drug use in [[Australia]] was popularized in Australia in the 1960s. The shifting of social and [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], which explicitly involved a [[revolution|sense of revolution]], created a [[youth culture]] which was enthusiastic about exploring [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] and were keen to experiment with drugs. In 1960's [[Sydney]], the most high-profile use of illicit drugs was focused around the [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] area, whose reputation as a [[Red-light district|"red light district"]] attracted members of various international armed forces on leave from the [[Indochina Wars]].

[[United States Armed Forces|American troops]] stationed in major Australian cities such as [[Sydney]] provided access to drugs like [[heroin]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia's love affair with drugs|url=http://theconversation.edu.au/australias-love-affair-with-drugs-6311|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=James Rowe|date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroin became immensely popular during the Vietnam War-era, and was smuggled into the country from [[South East Asia]] through [[Organized crime|crime syndicates]] in collaboration with members of the [[Nugan Hand Bank]] and the [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|C.I.A.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Involvement in Drug Smuggling Part 2|url=http://darkpolitics.wordpress.com/cia-involvement-in-drug-smuggling-part-2/|work=Dark Politics|publisher=Dark Politics|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, drug use increased in the 1960s and 1970s, as did laws prohibiting illicit drug use and police powers. Since this period, Kings Cross has retained its reputation for [[vice]] and has remained a popular destination for tourists.

Prior to this time, drugs had been synonymous with Kings Cross and the neighboring suburb of Darlinghurst. In the 1920s and 1930s, local [[razor gang|Razor Gangs]] achieved such a level of notoriety through their violent attempts to control the local [[cocaine]] trade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background and Evaluation |url=http://www.sydneymsic.com/background-and-evaluation|work=Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Center|publisher=2010 Sydney MSIC.|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Darlinghurst became colloquially known as "Razorhurst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kings Cross and the Razor Gangs.|url=http://www.sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au/Publications/Drug_and_Alcohol/CommMag%20FINAL%20June%202005.pdf|journal=Cross Lights|publisher=South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service.|accessdate=7 November 2012|issue=1|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Phil Jeffs established one of the area's most notorious nightclubs, the Fifty-Fifty club, in which [[gambling]], [[Sex worker|sex work]], [[Sly-grog shop|"sly-grog"]] (illicit alcohol) and cocaine were freely available.

Drug use increased exponentially by the mid-1980s. With the emergence of HIV/AIDS, transmission of the virus was identified as a serious public health risk for injecting drug users and media attention focusing on illicit drug use increased dramatically. A series of public health campaigns, known as the [[Grim Reaper (advertisement)|"Grim Reaper campaign"]] were televised in 1987, designed to increase awareness of the risk of transmission of virus;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grim Reaper Scared Generation of Australians Against AIDS and Gay Men |url=http://www.postkiwi.com/2005/grim-reaper-generation/ |work=Postkiwi |publisher=Duncan Macleod |accessdate=7 November 2012 |author=Duncan Macleod |date=6 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to the "shock tactics" used in the advertisements, the campaign was criticized as further marginalizing groups at high risk of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grim Reaper stemmed AIDS tide |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/grim-reaper-stemmed-aids-tide/story-e6frg8y6-1111114997299 |work=The Australian |publisher=The Australian |accessdate=7 November 2012 |author=ADAM CRESSWELL |date=1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Australia's [[Prime Minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], revealed in a nationally televised interview that his daughter, Rosslyn, was a heroin user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Hawke at breaking point|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/bob-hawke-at-breaking-point/story-e6frgczf-1225890245409 |work=Hawke: The Prime Minister |publisher=The Australian |accessdate=5 November 2012|author=BLANCHE D'ALPUGET |date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Hawke's admission, a new drug initiative, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The prohibition of illicit drugs is killing and criminalising our children and we are all letting it happen |url=http://www.australia21.org.au/publications/press_releases/Australia21_Illicit_Drug_Policy_Report.pdf |work=Report of a high level Australia21 Roundtable |publisher=Australia 21 Limited|accessdate=6 November 2012 |author1=Bob Douglas |author2=David McDonald |date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roundtable discussions instigated by the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse produced a National Drug Strategy that has continued to provide a foundation for Australia's illicit drug policy approach.

As a result of this, many other illicit drugs have risen and fallen in popularity to fill this void, with prescription [[temazepam]], [[morphine]], [[oxycodone]], [[methamphetamine]] and cocaine all being used as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/NDARCWeb.nsf/resources/Mono_7/$file/Mono.60.pdf |publisher=NDARC |title=Australian Drug Trends |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 has seen a reversal of this trend, with the arrival of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] heroin being seen in Sydney for the first time ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/afghan-brown-heroin-hits-sydney-streets/2008/03/15/1205472157938.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Afghan brown heroin hits Sydney streets |date=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anecdotal evidence from illicit drug users reject the claim, some researchers assert that the potency of heroin has since been on the rise, and is nearly comparable to the purity of heroin prior to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heroin: Is smack coming back? |url=http://www.nuaa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129:heroin-is-smack-coming-back&amp;catid=8:issue-no-52-summer-200708&amp;Itemid=5 |work=User's News |publisher=NSW Users and AIDS Association |accessdate=5 December 2012 |author1=Gideon Warhaft |author2=Emma Black |author3=Natasha Sindicich |issue=52 |year=2007–2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre opened in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]. It was opened on the recommendation of the [[Wood Royal Commission]]. Prior to this, several venues such as [[strip clubs]] or [[brothels]] in Kings Cross rented out rooms to injecting drug users so that they could have a private and safe place to inject. This practice went on with unofficial approval by the police, as it kept injecting drug use off the streets and in the one area. This further allowed criminal activity to profit off illicit drug use, as many venue owners would sell rooms and drugs. The Wood Royal Commission identified that while there were benefits to these illegal shooting galleries, allowing police to cooperate with illegal activities could encourage corruption, it suggested an independent medical facility to continue providing safety for the users, and safety for the public by lessening the impact of drug use on the streets, such as discarded needles or drug related deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneymsic.com/report.htm |title=Report on the Establishment or Trial of Safe Injecting Rooms |author=The Joint Select Committee into Safe Injecting Rooms |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |work=Executive Summary |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Crime Commission's illicit drug data report for 2011–2012 was released in western Sydney on 20 May 2013 and revealed that the seizures of illegal substances during the reporting period were the largest in a decade due to record interceptions of amphetamines, cocaine and steroids. The report also stated that average strength of crystal methamphetamine doubled in most jurisdictions within a 12-month period and the majority of laboratory closures involved small "addict-based" operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Purity on the rise as ice tops the drugs wave|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/purity-on-the-rise-as-ice-tops-the-drugs-wave/story-e6frg6nf-1226646323941|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=20 May 2013|author=MARK SCHLIEBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melbourne inner-city suburbs of Richmond and Abbotsford are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated for a protracted time period. Research organisation the Burnet Institute completed the 2013 'North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study' in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum, City of Yarra and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing "widespread, frequent and highly visible" nature of illicit drug use in the areas. During the period between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of needles and syringes collected from disposal units and street-sweep operations was documented for the two suburbs. In the local government area the City of Yarra, of which Richmond and Abbotsford are parts, 1550 syringes were collected each month from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Furthermore, ambulance callouts for heroin overdoses were 1.5 times higher than for other Melbourne areas in the period between 2011 and 2012 (a total of 336 overdoses), and drug-related arrests in North Richmond were also three times higher than the state average. The Burnet Institute's researchers interviewed health workers, residents and local traders, in addition to observing the drug scene in the most frequented North Richmond public injecting locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syringe machine push for addicts in Melbourne's heroin hot spots|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/syringe-machine-push-for-addicts-in-melbournes-heroin-hot-spots/story-e6frg6n6-1226646482548|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=20 May 2013|author=Lucie Van Den Berg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated in the media that it recommends 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray after the area's drug culture continues to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The Institute's research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and inappropriately discarding injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken open syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded injecting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug experts propose needle vending machines for Footscray|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/west/drug-experts-propose-needle-vending-machines-for-footscray/comments-fngnvmj7-1226651497633|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun Maribyrnong Leader|date=28 May 2013|author=Bridie Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study (part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 published in ''The Lancet''), led by Professor Louisa Degenhardt from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, reported in late August 2013 that Australia has one of the world's most serious drug problems, caused by amphetamines, cocaine, cannabis and opioids. Co-author Professor Harvey Whiteford, from the University of Queensland, stated: "There is no doubt Australia has a culture, especially among our young people, which does not see the taking of illicit substances or binge drinking as particularly detrimental to the health. Our study suggests otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia found to have one of the world's worst drug problems|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/29/drugs-health-australia-youth-culture|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 August 2013|author=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-September 2013, research by the Australian Bureau of Statistics valued the contribution of the illicit drugs market to the Australian economy at A$6 billion, while tax avoidance is responsible for an additional A$20 billion. The same research also recorded a fall of 19 per cent between 2008 and 2013 due to a reduction in the sales of heroin and cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Illegal drugs industry adds $6bn to economy|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/illegal-drugs-industry-adds-6bn-to-economy/story-e6frg926-1226718031249?net_sub_uid=44933799|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=13 September 2013|author=David Uren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian study released on 16 September 2013 showed that ambulance callouts for meth and amphetamine-related issues rose from 445 to 880 cases in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of Victoria—this rise is attributed mainly to crystal methamphetamine, as attendance figures rose from 136 to 592 cases. The list of reasons for the callouts included anxiety, paranoia, palpitations, gastrointestinal symptoms, and self-harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crystal meth harms on the rise in Australia|url=http://theconversation.com/crystal-meth-harms-on-the-rise-in-australia-18190|accessdate=16 September 2013|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=16 September 2013|author=Cherie Heilbronn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures obtained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on drug overdose were released in August 2014. The data revealed that the 1,427 overdose deaths recorded nationally in 2012 by the ABS outnumbered the road toll for the second year in a row, as well as a 65-per cent increase in accidental overdose deaths among females over the previous decade. Many of the recorded deaths were the result of prescription drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=PETER MICKELBUROUGH|title=More women dying from accidental drug overdoses than in road toll, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for Penington Institute show|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-women-dying-from-accidental-drug-overdoses-than-in-road-toll-australian-bureau-of-statistics-figures-for-penington-institute-show/story-fni0fiyv-1227022216299?nk=d20db5752a3171a643ec49c270b81844|accessdate=13 August 2014|work=Herald Sun|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 United Nations World Drug Report===
The 2012 United Nations World Drug Report published data that indicated that Australia has one of the highest global prevalence of cannabis use. The report also stated that cocaine use had increased over the four years leading up to 2012. The use of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine ([[MDMA]]), more commonly known as "Ecstasy", declined from 3.7 per cent to 3.0 percent between 2007 and 2010; however, the highest number of manufacturing laboratory interceptions occurred in Australia during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aussies the biggest recreational drug users in the world - report|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-old/aussies-the-biggest-recreational-drug-users-in-the-world-report/story-e6frfkvr-1226409745235|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=News.com.au|date=27 June 2012|author=Paul Toohey|agency=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maps Of Illegal Drug Use Around The World|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/un-drug-report-war-2012-6?op=1|work=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider, Inc|accessdate=9 September 2012|author=Michael Kelley|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy response===
The Australian government enacted numerous policies in response to illicit drug use. During the 1980s, it was one of the first countries to enact the policy of "harm minimisation", which consists of three pillars: "[[demand reduction]]", "supply reduction" and "[[harm reduction]]". This policy is still in effect as of 2012 and the following outlines are contained in ''The National Drug Strategy: Australia's integrated framework'' document:

* Supply reduction strategies to disrupt the production and supply of illicit drugs, and the control and regulation of licit substances.&lt;ref name="NDS"&gt;Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy (2004). The National Drug Strategy: Australia's integrated framework. Canberra: The Commonwealth of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; It involves border security, [[Australian Customs Service|Customs]] and prosecuting people involved in the trafficking of illicit substances.
* Demand reduction strategies to prevent the uptake of harmful drug use, including abstinence orientated strategies and treatment to reduce drug use;&lt;ref name="NDS" /&gt; This involves programs promoting abstinence or treating existing users.
* Harm reduction strategies to reduce drug-related harm to individuals and communities.&lt;ref name="NDS" /&gt; It is a policy that is a "[[Social safety net|safety net]]" to the preceding two policies. The threefold model accepts that demand prevention and supply prevention will never be completely effective, and if people are involved in risky activities, the damage they cause to themselves and society at large should be minimised. It involves programs like [[Needle-exchange programme|needle &amp; syringe programs]] and [[Safe injection site|safe injecting sites]], which aim to prevent the spread of disease or deaths from overdoses, while providing users with support to reduce or stop using drugs.

In 2007 [[Bronwyn Bishop]] headed a federal parliamentary committee reported that the Government's harm reduction policy is not effective enough. It recommended re-evaluating harm reduction and a [[zero-tolerance]] approach for drug education in schools. The committee also wanted the law changed so children can be put into mandatory care if parents were found to be using drugs. It suggested "''establish[ing] adoption as the 'default' care option for children aged 0–5 years where the child protection notification involved illicit drug use by the parent/s''". The report says federal, state and territory governments should only fund treatment services that are trying to make people permanently drug-free and priority should go to those that are more successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/13/2031956.htm |work=ABC News |location=Australia |title=Govt drug policy 'should be zero-tolerance' |date=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |author=House of Representatives: Standing Committee on Family and Human Services |year=2007 |title=The winnable war on drugs: The impact of illicit drug use on families |location=Canberra |publisher=Parliament of Australia |isbn=978-0-642-79002-6 |id=42222551 |page=750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was criticised by a range of organisations such as Family Drug Support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |publisher=Family Drug Support |year=2007 |title=An Opportunity Missed: A Considered Response to the 'Winnable War on Drugs' |work=House Standing Committee on Family &amp; Human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Democrats]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |first=Sen.

The Labor Party authors also released a dissenting report. The report and its recommendations have been shelved since the election of the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] in 2007 (Rudd was prime minister until 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kevin Rudd claims victory in federal election |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/11/24/1195753362801.html |accessdate=16 September 2012 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emotional Rudd bows out |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-24/emotional-rudd-bows-out/879390|work=ABC News |publisher=ABC |accessdate=16 September 2012 |author=Emma Rodgers |date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report authored by Professor Alison Ritter, the director of the drug policy modelling program at the [[University of New South Wales|University of NSW (UNSW)]], was released in June 2013 calculated that the Australian Government continues to spend A$1.7 billion on its annual illicit drug response. Entitled "Government Drug Policy Expenditure in Australia", the report also concluded that the harm reduction arm of the government's policy, with 2.1 per cent of the drugs budget, or A$36 million, devoted to harm reduction in the 2009-10 financial year. During the same time period, A$361 million, or 21 per cent, was directed towards treatment and A$1.1 billion was  expended on law enforcement. The report identifies a significant decrease in the proportion of funds allocated to harm reduction over time and Ritter expressed her concern in an interview with the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' newspaper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's a shift in policy that hasn't been formally acknowledged. There is absolutely no reason that investment should have decreased. We don't have good evidence that law enforcement works, and we have [[wikt:anecdotal|anecdotal]] evidence I suppose that it might not work as a policy. We continue to arrest people and drugs keep coming into Australia … and profits continue to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug crime budgets leave spending on harm reduction way behind|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/drug-crime-budgets-leave-spending-on-harm-reduction-way-behind-20130619-2oj8l.html|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 June 2013|author=Amy Corderoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Drug law reform==
A number of Australian and international groups have promoted reform in regard to 21st-century Australian drug policy. Organisations such as Australian Parliamentary Group on Drug Law Reform,&lt;ref name="John" /&gt; Responsible Choice,&lt;ref name="Choice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.responsiblechoice.com.au/|work=Responsible Choice|publisher=Responsible Choice|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation,&lt;ref name="Dr Alex Wodak 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://adlrf.org.au/|work=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation|publisher=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation|accessdate=27 February 2013|author= Alex Wodak|authorlink= Alex Wodak|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norml]] Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://normlaustralia.webs.com/|work=NORML Australia|publisher=Norml Australia.

The membership of some of these organisations is diverse and consists of the general public, social workers, lawyers and doctors, and the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] has been a formative influence on a number of these organisations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Australian Parliamentary Group on Drug Law Reform===
The Australian Parliamentary Group on Drug Law Reform consists of politicians from state and federal governments. Upon joining the group, all members sign a charter that states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This Charter seeks to encourage a more rational, tolerant, non-judgmental, humanitarian and understanding approach to people who currently use illicit drugs in our community. The aims of the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform are to minimise the adverse health, social and economic consequences of Australia's policies and laws controlling drug use and supply.&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Parliamentary Group For Drug Law Reform|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19981117033|work=Parliament of New South Wales|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=27 February 2013|author=John Mills|date=17 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 1998, short-term goals of the Group include:
*an increasing focus on the reduction of harm associated with drug use
*abolition of criminal sanctions for the personal use of drugs
*the adoption on a national basis of the South Australian and Australian Capital Territory expiation notice model for the reform of laws regarding the personal use of marijuana
*the adoption of a process including consultation and prescription by medical practitioners for selected illicit drugs&lt;ref name="John" /&gt;

Long-term goals include "the reform of drug laws in planned stages with detailed evaluation of such laws at all stages and the minimisation of the harmful use of drugs".&lt;ref name="John" /&gt;

===Responsible Choice===
According to its website, Responsible Choice is an organisation that was initiated in response to the criminalisation of cannabis in Australia, specifically in terms of the legalisation of alcohol, another drug that the organisation describes as "our ONLY legal similarly categorised substance". The organisation explains that its mission is to "enliven the debate as to whether or not cannabis should enjoy regulation within Australian society comparable to alcohol. It is also our intention to provide recent, relevant and factual information regarding both cannabis and alcohol"&lt;ref name="Our"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.responsiblechoice.com.au/about/|work=Responsible Choice|publisher=Responsible Choice|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Responsible Choice's "resident writer", Tim, further explains that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a parent I have come to realise that I no longer believe alcohol is a recreational drug I would encourage my children to use. Knowing full well that when the time comes the choice will not be mine to make, I have made it a goal of mine to investigate, research and comment on current drug policy juxtaposed with the negative effects alcohol, with a view towards providing researched based information to those who are seeking it. This has allowed me to see the place that cannabis should rightly have in our society, specifically in its capacity to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Our" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of February 2013, Responsible Choice provides support to the Australian Drug Law Reform political party.&lt;ref name="Choice" /&gt;

===Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation===
The Charter of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation is "endorsed by the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform, seeks to encourage a more rational, tolerant and humanitarian approach to the problems created by drugs and drug use in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter|url=http://adlrf.org.au/charter/|work=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation|publisher=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation|accessdate=27 February 2013|author= Alex Wodak|authorlink= Alex Wodak|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the organisation can provide financial donations, join the organisation as a member and review the website for its information resources. The website also lists numerous Australian supporters of drug law reform:

*Nicholas Cowdery AM QC Former NSW Director of Public Prosecutions
*Ken Crispin QC (retired) Supreme Court Judge
*Professor Peter Baume AC Former Senator for New South Wales
*Geoff Gallop Former Premier of Western Australia
*Dr. Wendell J. Rosevear OAM

*Dr Michael Wooldridge Former Commonwealth Minister for Health
*Professor David Penington AC Former dean of medicine and vice-chancellor at Melbourne University
*The Hon. Cate Faehrmann Member of the NSW Legislative Council
*The Hon. John Della Bosca Former member of the NSW Legislative Council&lt;ref name="Reform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reformers|url=http://adlrf.org.au/supporters-of-reform/|work=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation|publisher=Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation|accessdate=27 February 2013|author= Alex Wodak|authorlink= Alex Wodak|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hon. Stanley Lee Jones states on the website of the Foundation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If heroin were legal today, as it was in 1953, society would not have a drug problem. I talked to a former member for Monaro who was a chemist and who dispensed heroin in the 1950s. He said he had no problems with his customers when heroin was legal. In those days 70 per cent of crime was not associated with drug prohibition: It did not exist because heroin was legal. The problems began only when heroin became illegal and a criminal fraternity developed around its sale, as occurred during the prohibition era of the 1930s when criminals made money by selling illegal alcohol. When there is a profit motive involved people will push any illegal substance. That is the key problem: If there were no profit motive there would be no incentive to push drugs on the streets of Cabramatta or anywhere else. When people finally realise that they will find a solution to the drug problem.&lt;ref name="Reform" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Foundation features numerous reports that are available for download on its website, such as the Australia21 reports "Alternatives to Prohibition" and "The Prohibition of Ilicit Drugs: Killing and Criminalising Our Children", "A Balancing Act" from the Open Society Foundation, Release's "A Quiet Revolution: Drug Decriminalisation Policies in Practice Across the Globe", and "Children of the Drug War", edited by Damon Barrett and produced by Harm Reduction International.&lt;ref name="Dr Alex Wodak 2013"/&gt;

===Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) Australia===
As of February 2013, Paul Cubitt, a former correctional officer who was originally based at Long Bay prison in New South Wales, Australia, is the President of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) Australia. Cubitt has revealed that successive employment positions within the Australian correctional and justice system, including a period at the [[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]] correctional centre in [[Canberra]], Australia, and a vocational course led him to an understanding of "the harm that society is doing to people who are afflicted by drug abuse".&lt;ref name="Radio" /&gt; As of February 2013, the website of the organisation is not functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://leapaustralia.org/board/|work=leapaustralia.org|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Denham, a former police officer who served in the Australian states of [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], has conducted work on behalf of LEAP Australia in the Victorian capital city of [[Melbourne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Necessary Evil' Episode #01: Greg Denham - LEAP Australia|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWS7mQckXF0|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=27 February 2013|author=preacherpusher|format=Video upload|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne 420 Rally - Greg Denham LEAP - Law Enforcemnet against prohi ...|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC7m9V1Qn0s|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=27 February 2013|author=cyberho73|format=Video upload|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as the executive officer of the Yarra Drug and Health Forum, Denham has also been a vocal supporter of a proposal to establish a supervised injecting facility in the Melbourne suburb of North Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State shoots down Yarra safe injecting room push|url=http://www.melbournetimesweekly.com.au/story/1277035/state-shoots-down-yarra-safe-injecting-room-push/|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Melbourne Times Weekly|date=4 February 2013|author=Alana Schetzer|agency=Fairfax Regional Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug Law Reform Australia===
The organisation, under the leadership of Greg Chipp, emerged prominently in 2013, and is a political outflow of non-political parents' and friends' groups for drug law reform. The organisation achieved the status of a political party in early 2013 by attracting in excess of 500 members, and fielded candidates in the 2013 Australian election. The goals of the Drug Law Reform Party are:

*Stop the senseless harm caused by the failed prohibition policies, which criminalize ordinary Australians for personal drug use.
*Advocate for conscience votes on single issues where legislation does not match the lived reality of large proportions of the Australian public.
*To encourage political and community debate of alternatives to the current drug laws.
*Call for a royal commission into organized crime and corruption associated with the drug trade.
*Through parliament representation, use the senate committees, and productivity commission to examine the current drug laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://druglawreform.com.au/About%20Drug%20Law%20Reform%20Party|work=Drug Law Reform Australia|publisher=Drug Law Reform Australia|accessdate=27 February 2013|author=Greg Chipp|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Commission on Drugs===
In its 2011 report, the Global Commission on Drugs found that the "global war on drugs has failed."&lt;ref name="globalcommission"&gt;Global Commission on Drugs (June 2011). War on Drugs. Retrieved from http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/wp-content/themes/gcdp_v1/pdf/Global_Commission_Report_English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission, headed by several former heads of state, a former UN Secretary General and others, observed that governments around the world must begin introducing "models of legal regulation of drugs to undermine the power of organized crime and safeguard the health and security of their citizens."&lt;ref name="globalcommission"/&gt;{{rp|2}} With this in mind, the organisation, Australia 21, began researching drug policy in the Australian context.

===Australia21 reports===
In response to a 2011 international report by the Global Commission on Drugs, the organisation, Australia21 appointed a steering committee to evaluate Australia's current illicit drug policy.&lt;ref&gt;Australia 21 (2012). ''Australian Policy on Illicity Drugs Second Report''. Retrieved from http://www.australia21.org.au/our_research/illicit_drugs.html&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that Australia's current drug policy, focused as it is, on criminalisation of supply and use of drugs, has driven the production and use of drugs underground and has "fostered the development of a criminal industry that is corrupting civil society and government and killing our children."&lt;ref name="australia21.org.au"&gt;Australia 21 (2012). The Report (p. 4). Retrieved from http://www.australia21.org.au/publications/press_releases/Australia21_Illicit_Drug_Policy_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They also noted that "[b]y defining the personal use and possession of certain psychoactive drugs as criminal acts, governments have also avoided any responsibility to regulate and control the quality of substances that are in widespread use."&lt;ref name="australia21.org.au"/&gt; The report also highlighted the fact that, just as alcohol and tobacco are regulated for quality assurance, distribution, marketing and taxation, so should currently, unregulated, illicit drugs.&lt;ref name="australia21.org.au"/&gt;

The independent organisation has also released the following reports: "Alternatives to Prohibition"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives to Prohibition|url=http://www.australia21.org.au/publications/press_releases/A21_Alternatives_to_Prohibition_SEP_12.pdf|work=Alternatives to Prohibition|publisher=Australia21 Limited|accessdate=27 February 2013|author=Bob Douglas|author2=Alex Wodak |author2-link=Alex Wodak |author3=David McDonald |format=PDF|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Prohibition of Illicit Drugs: Killing and Criminalising Our Children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Policy on Illicit Drugs Second Report.|url=http://www.australia21.org.au/our_research/illicit_drugs.html|work=Australia21|publisher=Australia21|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian illicit drug user organisations==
In response to the emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the mid-1980s, Australian drug users began to
[[Community organizing|self-organize]] into community, peer-driven state and national drug user
[[Non-governmental organization|organisations]]. The aim of these organisations was to give voice to the experiences of Australian drug users and to [[Advocacy|advocate]] for [[Drug policy reform|drug-related policy reform]], the provision of [[Needle-exchange programme|harm reduction prophylactics]], the expansion of [[Opioid replacement therapy|opioid substitution programs]], to highlight the health issues affecting illicit drug users and to reduce the [[Social stigma|stigma]] and [[discrimination]] many illicit drug users experience. Drug user organisations have been recognized by state and federal governments as an effective strategy to educate [[Drug user|illicit drug users]] in relation to techniques for avoiding [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne virus transmission]], responding to [[drug overdose]], [[Injecting drug user#Safer injection|safer injecting techniques]], [[Safe sex|safer sex]] and [[Prohibition of drugs|legal issues]]. Australian drug user organisations use a [[peer education]] and [[community development]] approach to [[health promotion]], with the aim of [[Empowerment|empowering]] illicit drug users by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.

As of November 2012, every [[States and territories of Australia|Australian State and Territory]], with the exception of [[Tasmania]], has a state-funded drug user organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Member Organisations |url=http://www.aivl.org.au/?p=58#p=58 |work=AIVL |publisher=aivl.org.au |accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of health services also employ illicit drug users to provide peer education in relation to specific issues affecting illicit drug users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The acceptability and feasibility of peer worker support role in community based HCV treatment for injecting drug users|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1477-7517-5-8.pdf |work=Harm Reduction Journal |publisher=Harm Reduction Journal 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2012 |author1=Josephine Norman |author2=Nick M Walsh |author3=Janette Mugavin |author4=Mark A Stoové |author5=Jenny Kelsall |author6=Kirk Austin |author7=Nick Lintzeris |date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community alcohol &amp; drug treatment services |url=http://www.health.vic.gov.au/aod/about/comm3.htm |work=Department of Health, Victoria |publisher=Department of Health, State Government of Victoria |accessdate=5 November 2012 |date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's peer-based drug user organisations are members of the [[Australian Injecting and Illicit Drug Users League]] (AIVL), a national drug user organisation, which advocates for changes to current illicit drug policy at a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who is the Australian Injecting &amp; Illicit Drug Users League? |url=http://www.aivl.org.au/?p=55#p=55 |work=Who is AIVL?|publisher=aivl.org.au |accessdate=5 November 2012 |author=AIVL}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member-based organisation, AIVL also supports State and Territory peer-based organisations to strengthen their [[Governance|internal governance structures]], their capacity to provide services to illicit drug users and assists member-based organisations to develop advocacy strategies for engaging in localized drug-related policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australia's hidden gem: A Tradition of Exceptional Drug User Orgs |url=http://blackpoppymag.wordpress.com/category/drug-user-run-orgs/ |work=Black Poppy's Junk Mail |publisher=Black Poppy |accessdate=5 November 2012 |author=ERIN |date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
===Imprisonment===
In 2017, 6155 people were in prison with their most serious offence being an illicit drug crime.

From 2013-2017, the amount of people imprisoned for illicit drug crimes increased faster than people imprisoned for any other type of crime.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;

In 1990, 1347 people were in prison with the most serious offence being an illicit drug offence.

'''Imaging informatics''', also known as '''radiology informatics''' or '''medical imaging informatics''', is a subspecialty of [[biomedical informatics]] that aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, usability and reliability of medical imaging services within the healthcare enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Branstetter | first = B | year = 2007 | title = Basics of Imaging Informatics | journal = Radiology | volume = 243 | pages = 656–67 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2433060243 | pmid = 17431128 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is devoted to the study of how information about and contained within medical images is retrieved, analyzed, enhanced, and exchanged throughout the medical enterprise. 

As radiology is an inherently data-intensive and technology-driven specialty of medicine, radiologists have become leaders in Imaging Informatics. However, with the proliferation of digitized images across the practice of medicine to include fields such as cardiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, gastroenterology, obstetrics, gynecology and pathology, the advances in Imaging Informatics are also being tested and applied in other areas of medicine. Various industry players and vendors involved with medical imaging, along with IT experts and other biomedical informatics professionals, are contributing and getting involved in this expanding field. 

Imaging informatics exists at the intersection of several broad fields:
*biological science – includes bench sciences such as biochemistry, microbiology, physiology and genetics
*clinical services – includes the practice of medicine, bedside research, including outcomes and cost-effectiveness studies, and public health policy
*[[information science]] – deals with the acquisition, retrieval, cataloging, and archiving of information
*[[medical physics]] / [[biomedical engineering]] – entails the use of equipment and technology for a medical purpose
*[[cognitive science]] – studying human computer interactions, usability, and information visualization
*[[computer science]] – studying the use of computer algorithms for applications such as computer assisted diagnosis and computer vision

==Areas of interest==
Key areas relevant to Imaging informatics include:
*[[Picture archiving and communication system]] (PACS) and component systems
*Imaging informatics for the enterprise

The '''Irish White Cross''' was established on 1 February 1921 as a mechanism for distributing funds raised by the [[American Committee for Relief in Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan in Douglas- Intro. p9&lt;/ref&gt; It was managed by the [[Quaker]] businessman, and later [[Irish Free State]] senator,  [[James G. Douglas]]. The White Cross continued to operate until the [[Irish Civil War]] and its books were officially closed in 1928. From 1922 its activities were essentially wound down and remaining funds divested to subsidiary organisations. The longest running of these aid committees was the Children's Relief Association which distributed aid to child victims of this troubled period, north and south of the border, until 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Ceannt p67 winding up accounts audit&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/healthinnovation/ '''Ivey''' '''International Centre for Health Innovation'''] is located within the [[Ivey Business School]] at [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]]. The Centre acts as a catalyst for health system transformation and the adoption of a value-based health care management system in Canada. It aims to prepare health leaders with the skills they need to identify, assess and facilitate the adoption of innovative technologies, systems and processes that health systems need in order to be sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/research/centres-institutes/|title=Ivey Business School's Centres and Institutes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was officially established in 2009 when the federal government, through [https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/home Industry Canada], invested $5 million in the creation of the Ivey International Centre for Health Innovation and Leadership (the Centre), as part of the government’s strategy to advance and promote science and technology in Canada. Since its inception, the Centre has been an objective 3rd party academic centre, working to take proven health sector innovations and implement them into the system using evidence-based methods.

==History==
In 2009, the federal government, through [https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/home Industry Canada], invested $5 million in the creation of the Ivey International Centre for Health Innovation and Leadership (the Centre), as part of the government’s strategy to advance and promote science and technology in Canada. Originally, the Centre was given the mandate to, "develop a highly skilled workforce that fosters next-generation health technologies/innovations that would create new jobs and business opportunities and grow the economy" (Hon. T. Clement, March 23, 2009). Additionally, the Centre was also tasked with becoming, "a global leader in identifying, assessing and commercializing innovative technologies, systems and processes for Canada’s health care system and providers that would lead to meaningful progress in patient care…[and] would abide by the mission of the Richard Ivey School of Business, which sets out to develop Canadian business leaders who ‘think globally, act strategically and contribute to the societies within which they operate’.

'''&lt;big&gt;Leveraging Innovation and Leadership&lt;/big&gt;'''

The Centre’s founding Academic Chair was Hon. Dr. [[Kellie Leitch]], a pediatric orthopedic surgeon, who now serves as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Simcoe-Grey region in Ontario. During her tenure as Academic Chair, Dr. Leitch advanced the Centre’s creation of thought leadership through publishing several white papers, including: "Innovation Takes leadership" (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3468705/white-paper.pdf|title=Innovation Takes Leadership:Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Canada’s Health Care System|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Leveraging Information Technologies to Transform and Sustain British Columbia’s Health Care Sector" (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3468657/bc-white-paper-final.pdf|title=Leveraging InformatioTechnologies To Transform and Sustain British Columbia’s Health Care Sector|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Transforming Canadian Health Care through Consumer Engagement: The Key to Quality and System Innovation" (2011).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/healthinnovation/research/white-papers/|title=White Papers|website=Ivey Business School|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3468134/consumer-engagement-white-paper-final.pdf|title=Transforming Canadian Health Care through Consumer Engagement: The Key to Quality and System Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research projects focused on adoption strategies for innovations in health systems.

'''&lt;big&gt;Value Based Health Care and Health System Design&lt;/big&gt;'''

Following Hon. Dr. Leitch’s successful election as an MP in 2011, Dr. Anne Snowdon was appointed the Centre’s Academic Chair. Throughout Dr. Snowdon’s tenure at the Centre (2011-2015), she continued building the Centre’s reputation as a thought leader through publishing the following white papers: "Transforming Canada into a Global Centre for Medical Device Innovation and Adoption" (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3468059/ichil-medical-devices-white-paper-final2.pdf|title=Transforming Canada into a Global Centre for Medical Device Innovation and Adoption|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strengthening Health Systems Through Innovation: Lessons Learned" (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3468020/globalhealthsystemswhitepaperfinal.pdf|title=Strengthening Health Systems Through Innovation: Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Measuring What Matters: The Cost vs. Values of Health Care" (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3467948/white-paper-measuring-what-matters.pdf|title=Measuring What Matters: The Cost vs. Values of Health Care|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "’It’s All About Me’: The Personalization of Health Systems" (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/cmsmedia/3467873/its-all-about-me-the-personalization-of-health-systems.pdf|title="It’s All About Me": The Personalization of Health Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the same time, the Centre’s research projects took a shift towards health system design, pathway development, and global health care best practices, while still facilitating the adoption of health system innovations in Canada.

'''&lt;big&gt;The Future of Health Innovation Today&lt;/big&gt;'''

In 2015, Dr. David Barrett was appointed the Centre's Executive Director. Since the inception of the Centre in 2009, new markets and opportunities have emerged that were unimaginable 7 years ago. The Centre is optimistic about the future of innovation and health system improvements and is looking forward to contributing positively to that future.

'''Jacquemijntje Garniers''' (c. 1590 — 8 September 1651) was a Belgian painter and midwife from [[Ypres]], West Flanders. She had 4 husbands throughout her life, and had a total of 4 children, including [[Gabriël Metsu]]. Multiple times throughout the 17th century, she was a midwife in [[Leiden]], [[South Holland]], and was also an independent midwife. She died in Leiden as a widow and had silver objects and three houses in her possession at the time of her death.

== Biography ==
Garniers was born in roughly 1590, to Franchoyse Fremouts and Isack Garniers,&lt;ref name="vondel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jacquemyntgen Garniers |url=http://www.vondel.humanities.uva.nl/ecartico/persons/10087 |website=VONDEL: Virtueel ONDErzoeksLaboratorium voor de Gouden Eeuw |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ypres]], [[West Flanders]], Belgium, and was raised and educated in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="rkd"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ontdek amatuerschilder Jacquemijntje Garniers |url=https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/441035 |website=Rkd.nl |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Abraham Le Foutere on 5 June 1608,&lt;ref name="vondel"/&gt; and they had 3 children.&lt;ref name="resources"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van der Hut |first1=Margreet |title=Garniers, Jacquemijntje (ca. 1590-1651) |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1780-1830/DVN/lemmata/data/Garniers |website=Resources Huygens ING |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Foutere died in about 1918,&lt;ref name="vondel"/&gt; and Garniers remarried to Guillaume Fermout, an artist, who's nickname was Strazio Veluto.&lt;ref name="catalogue"&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Groot |first1=Cornelis Hofstede |title=A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch Painters of the Seventeenth Century |date=1908 |publisher=Macmillan |pages=235, 329 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BM1FAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she was married to Fermout, she had moved to [[Dordrecht]], [[Netherlands]], and was being trained there as a [[midwife]]. In 1624, Fermout died,&lt;ref name="vondel"/&gt; and Garniers subsequently moved to [[Leiden]], [[South Holland]], Netherlands.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

In January 1624, Garniers became a midwife at Leiden after submitting a successful request to the court, but later decided to become an independent midwife. Garniers married a third time on 10 November 1625,&lt;ref name="vondel"/&gt; to Jacques Metsu, who, like Fermout, was an artist.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt; The two of them had one child, [[Gabriël Metsu]], who was raised as a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gabriel Metsu 1629—1667 |work=[[National Gallery of Art]] |url=https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/exhibitions/pdfs/metsu_brochure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metsu painted a 29 {{frac|1|2}} by 24 {{frac|1|2}} inch portrait of Garniers, which was sold in 1845 in London. Another portrait of Garniers which Metsu painted was sold on May 9, 1881, in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="catalogue"/&gt;

On 6 March 1629, soon after Gabriël was born, Jacques died, leaving Garniers widowed again.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Roever |first1=Nicolaas |title=Oud-Holland: tijdschrift voor Nederlandse kunstgeschiedenis, Volumes 24-25 |date=1976 |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |page=198 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttVHAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632, she asked to become a midwife of Leiden again and was accepted, with her salary being sixty guilders, twice the amount it was before. Her fourth husband was Cornelis Gerritsz Bontecraey, a skipper, whom she married on 14 September 1636.&lt;ref name="vondel"/&gt; However, Bontecraey died as well, in 1649,&lt;ref name="vondel"/&gt; and Garniers became a widow yet again. Garniers did not marry again after Bontecraey's death, but the skippers craft paid her two guilders a week so that she could help care for the four children she had. Garniers was able to acquire enough money to have three houses and many silver objects in her possession. Garniers died in Leiden on 8 September 1651.&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

It is believed that Garnier was also an amateur [[oil painter]]. Although no paintings made by Garniers have been found, it is suspected that she painted due to her second and third husbands being artists.&lt;ref name="rkd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="resources"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''Local sleep''' is a [[neurological]] phenomenon where brain activity in an organism that is otherwise awake enters a state which closely resembles that of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cirelli|first=Charia|author2=Giulio Tuononi |title=Perchance to Prune|journal=Scientific American|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nir|first=Yuval|title="Local" sleep: brain regions go offline at different moments|url=http://www.hfsp.org/frontier-science/awardees-articles/local-sleep-brain-regions-go-offline-different-moments|publisher=Human Frontier Science Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[Electroencephalography|Electroencephalogram]], these patterns generally resemble [[NREM]] slow-wave sleep, and oscillate between 'on' and 'off' periods in the same way that would be expected during an actual sleeping state.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vyazovskiy|first=W|author2=Olcese U |author3=Hanlon EC |author4=Nir Y |author5=Cirelli C |author6=Tononi G. |title=Local sleep in awake rats.|journal=Nature|date=April 2011|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v472/n7344/full/nature10009.html |doi=10.1038/nature10009 |volume=472 |issue=7344 |pmid=21525926 |pmc=3085007 |pages=443–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=M|author2=Huber R |author3=Esser S |author4=Riedner BA |author5=Massimini M |title=The cortical topography of local sleep.|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|date=November 2011|pmid=21906021 |pmc=3243778 |volume=11 |issue=19 |pages=2438–46 |doi=10.2174/156802611797470303}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Local sleep can be induced by sustained and intense periods of activation of a particular brain region, especially when coupled with [[sleep deprivation]] (a condition colloquially called "sleep drunk"), although certain cortical regions of mice have been demonstrated to enter local sleep for very brief amounts of time without any immediate trigger.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; Unlike [[microsleep]] however, these brief periods of local sleep occur while the animal is still entirely conscious and functioning, although abilities associated with the specific brain region in local sleep tend to decline substantially.&lt;ref name=Discover&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Ed|title=Individual Neurons go to Sleep While Rats Stay Awake|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/04/27/individual-neurons-go-to-sleep-while-rats-stay-awake/#.UfK-hdLVCSo|newspaper=Discover Magazine|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, local sleep in brain regions associated with movement can lead to lapses in coordination, and more generally cognitive functioning seems to be somewhat impaired by local sleep of cortical regions, with mice undergoing cortical sleep exhibiting far less awareness of their surroundings and having delayed or inappropriate reactions to stimuli. 

While the function of local sleep is not definitively established, in at least one study the process has been shown to improve the performance of a task in mice.&lt;ref name=Discover/&gt; The mechanism behind this is suspected to be shared with the general mechanism driving [[sleep and learning|learning]] and [[memory consolidation]] during sleep.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4310">The '''Massachusetts General Hospital Psychiatry Academy''' is an educational organization for psychiatrists, psychologists, other [[mental health]] professionals, and other [[healthcare]] professionals (like [[registered nurse]]s, [[social workers]], and [[school counselors]]) who diagnose and treat patients with mental health disorders.  It is directly organized and managed by the Department of [[Psychiatry]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], which is owned by [[Partners HealthCare]], the largest healthcare provider in [[Massachusetts]].

The Psychiatry Academy organizes and produces [[continuing medical education|CME]] activities—like one-day live [[academic conference|symposia]] and online [[webcasts]]—that educate attendees about effective clinical practice for treating mental health disorders, like [[anxiety]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]] and [[major depressive disorder|major depression]].

==History==
The Psychiatry Academy was officially started in 2003 by the Department of [[Psychiatry]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH).  This Department was founded in 1934 with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], has numerous staff who hold [[professor]] and teaching positions at [[Harvard Medical School]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Massachusetts General Hospital]], Psychiatry Department Facts, 2006 [http://www.massgeneral.org/allpsych/facts1.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been ranked #1 in the country for numerous years by ''U.S.News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. News &amp; World Report|''U.S.News &amp; World Report'']], survey of America's Best [[Hospitals]], 2007 [http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/search.php?spec=reppsyc]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Psychiatry Academy launched a 25-year partnership with Reed Medical Education (RME).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradeshowweek.com/article/CA6482901.html "Reed Medical Reels in Mass General", ''Tradeshow Week'', October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  RME now produces the continuing medical education programs offered by the Psychiatry Academy and handles tasks like marketing and logistics, while the Psychiatry Academy focuses on determining educational needs and content development.

The Psychiatry Academy's Webcast programs used to be called "PsychLink" and were also offered via satellite broadcasts, yet that changed slightly with the launch of the new agreement with RME.  Now they are available only via Webcast, and are no longer called PsychLink.

In May 2008, the Psychiatry Academy held a live [[webcast]] entitled ''The Returning Veteran: [[PTSD]] and [[Traumatic Brain Injury]]''.  Panelists for this [[webcast]] included Colonel Elspeth Cameron Ritchie, Director of Proponency of Behavioral Health, U.S. Army Surgeon General's Office; and Terence M. Keane, PhD, Director, Behavioral Science Division, National Center for [[PTSD]], and Professor and Vice-Chair, Department of Psychiatry, [[Boston University]] School of [[Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital Psychiatry Academy's archived program of ''The Returning Veteran: PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury''[http://www.mghcme.org/?page=events/details&amp;eventid=5174]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty and staff==
[[professor|Faculty]] at Psychiatry Academy activities and programs come from within [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and other educational institutions like [[Yale University]] and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mghcme.org/?page=organization/faculty Psychiatry Academy faculty list, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microsoft HealthVault''' is a web-based [[personal health record]] created by [[Microsoft]], in October 2007, to store and maintain health and fitness information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2191920,00.asp |title=MicrosoftLaunches 'HealthVault' Records-Storage Site |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=2007-10-04 |access-date=2008-02-04 |publisher=PCMAG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20071004.wgtmsfthealth1004%2FBNStory%2FTechnology%2Fhome&amp;ord=18107047&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true |title=Microsoft launches medical records site |access-date=2008-02-04 |publisher=globeandmail.com |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=348945&amp;story_id=9916512 |title=The vault is open |date=2007-10-04 |access-date=2008-02-06 |publisher=economist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Oct04/0,4670,MicrosoftHealthVault,00.html Microsoft Launches Health Records Site]&lt;/ref&gt; This website addresses both individuals and healthcare professionals, and in June 2010 expanded its services beyond the United States to include the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/ehi/6022 |title=E-Health Insider :: Microsoft launches HealthVault in UK |last=Hoeksma |first=Jon |date=2010-06-23 |website=E-Health Insider |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316120320/http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/ehi/6022 |archive-date=2013-03-16 |access-date=2013-10-16 |quote=Microsoft has launched its personal health record platform in the UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
A HealthVault record stores an individual's health information. Access to a record is through a HealthVault account, which may be authorized to access records for multiple individuals, e.g., so that a parent may manage records for their children, or a child may have access to their parent's records to help the parent deal with medical issues. Authorization of the account could previously be performed with the use of a [[Facebook]] account, [[Windows Live ID]] account, or an account from a limited set of other [[OpenID]] providers. On April 6, 2016, Microsoft announced via email to users that [[Facebook]] and [[OpenID]] sign in will not be available after 31 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/5008a2c2-2e6b-4b14-a202-506565511e39/unable-to-access-records-from-facebook-signin?forum=HealthVaultCustomer|title=Unable to access records from Facebook sign-in|website=social.technet.microsoft.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, when attempting to log in using these methods, a page indicating they are no longer supported is displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://account.healthvault-ppe.com/status.aspx?code=UnsupportedSignupCredential|title=Status - HealthVault|website=account.healthvault-ppe.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authorization ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
An individual interacts with their HealthVault record through either the HealthVault website or, more typically,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} through an app, application, or device that communicates with the HealthVault platform. When an individual first uses a HealthVault application, they are asked to authorize the application to access a specific set of data types, and those data types are the only ones the application can use. An individual can also share either their entire health record or selected data with another interested individual, such as a doctor, relative, etc.

== Devices ==
HealthVault Connection Center allows health and fitness data to be exchanged between selected devices (such as [[blood pressure monitor]]s, [[heart rate monitor|heart rate watch]]es, and the [[Withings]] wifi bodyscale) into an individual's HealthVault record. It can also be used to find and download drivers for medical devices.&lt;ref name="istartedsomething"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20071004/microsoft-healthvault/ |title=Dr. Microsoft is now ready to see you |access-date=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.healthvault.com/WhatIsConnectionCenter.htm |title=HealthVault Connection Center |access-date=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2014, Microsoft introduced the [[Microsoft Band]], a fitness band powered by the ''Microsoft Health'' service that supports the Microsoft HealthVault for aggregation and integration of various services, such as [[MyFitnessPal]].&lt;ref name="VentureBeatMicrosoftBand"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/11/04/with-the-launch-of-the-microsoft-band-healthvault-moves-behind-the-scenes/ |title=With the launch of the Microsoft Band, HealthVault moves behind the scenes. |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |date=4 November 2014 |work=VentureBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PocketNowMicrosoftBand"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://pocketnow.com/2014/11/03/how-many-different-health-platforms-does-microsoft-need |title=How many different health platforms does Microsoft need? |last=Lein |first=Adam Z. |date=3 November 2014 |work=PocketNow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Imaging==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
HealthVault supports storage, viewing, uploading, and downloading, by consumers and third parties, of [[DICOM]] based medical imaging.  Additionally, a plethora of third party HealthVault medical imaging viewers has been released to connect to HealthVault.

== Interoperability ==
HealthVault supports a number of exchange formats, including industry standards such as the [[Continuity of Care Document]] and the [[Continuity of Care Record]].  Support for industry standards makes it possible to integrate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://community.recordsforliving.com/forums/thread/1302.aspx |title=PHR integration |access-date=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many [[personal health record]] solutions.

The '''National Rural Water Association''' ('''NRWA'''), with its affiliated state rural water associations, is the largest water and wastewater utility membership organization in the United States of America.  The NRWA is a [[professional organization]] that supports [[rural]] and small water utilities throughout the nation. NRWA and its state affiliates are organized as a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] trade association, and represent more than 31,000 water and wastewater utility members.

The association provides training, technical assistance and source water protection assistance to the rural and small utilities which comprise 94 percent of the nation's community water supplies.  This assistance is supported by the United States Congress and is provided in partnership with the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA's]] [[Rural Utilities Service]], the [[Farm Service Agency]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].

The NRWA and state rural water affiliates also represent rural and small utilities in the regulatory and legislative process.

==History==
The National Rural Water Association was founded in 1976 in response to the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]], passed in 1974. The SDWA authorized the United States Environmental Protection Agency to set national health-based standards for drinking water to protect against both naturally occurring and man-made contaminants that may be found in drinking water. The NRWA was founded because many of the original EPA standards were written for large [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] water utilities, and many smaller utilities did not have the resources to meet those standards.

NRWA's first meeting in Oklahoma City was attended by eight states: Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Indiana and Texas. States quickly joined the organization with Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa and South Carolina joining in 1977; Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon and Tennessee 1978; and Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, New York, Ohio in 1979 and Arizona in 1990. Hawaii incorporated its rural water association in December 2010, bringing NRWA programs to all 50 states.

The [[Circuit rider (water/wastewater)|Circuit Rider Program]], a signature of NRWA, began in 1980 in 18 states. Circuit riders are roving drinking water and wastewater experts that provided technical assistance to the unities in their area. The program provided another tool for small water systems that did not always have the experience, equipment, training or personnel to deal large or persistent problems.

During its operation, the NRWA has added a variety of training, technical assistance, [[source water protection]] and financial programs to assist small water and waste water systems. The NRWA's network of training and assistance had allowed rural and small community water supplies to maintain compliance with the SDWA at rates similar to metropolitan systems on a percentage basis.

==Quality on Tap and Protecting Our Environment==
[[Image:QOTblue.gif|right]]
"Quality On Tap – Our Commitment – Our Profession" is a nationwide, grassroots public relations and awareness campaign designed especially for the drinking water industry. QOT is intended to promote a positive image to the public, focusing on the safety of drinking water and the expertise of the technical professional who ensure water quality.

"Protecting Our Environment" is a companion campaign for the wastewater industry. This campaign is designed to publicize  the credentials of the wastewater personnel and the role they play in Environmental Protection, especially the prevention of water pollution. Rural water has made environmental protection, especially source water protection, a priority for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Protecting water an industry priority|year=2009|publisher=National Rural Water Association|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2008%2004%20April/ProtectDrinking%20Water.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both campaigns were designed to be practical, hands-on guides to better public relations for rural and small water and wastewater utilities.

==Programs==
The NRWA and its state affiliates provide a range of programs to assist utilities in their governance, management, finance and operations.  Annually over 100,000 personnel are trained and over 100,000 types of on-site technical assistance is rendered throughout the 50 United States, and Puerto Rico.

Training and technical assistance is delivered through a cadre of personnel with a range of technical and practical experience. This technical knowledge, combined with the experience of managing and operating water and wastewater systems has allowed NRWA training, assistance and “common sense solutions” that are practical at the local level.

===Member support services===
NWRA and the state associations offer a variety of support services provided to member utilities. All support services are delivered through the state associations.  These may include but are not limited to revolving loan funds, insurance, discounts, bond pools, certification, background checks, conferences, legislative events on the state and national level and a VIP Fleet Discount for systems of any size and any number of vehicles.

These programs and services available through the NRWA homepage or state associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrwa.org NRWA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency Response/Disaster Relief==
NRWA and its state affiliates provide assistance to small systems recovering from disasters. This assistance is considered to be an extension of the regular services provided to small water utilities: "It's the same thing we do every day, just with more urgency and immediate need."

These efforts have been praised for their ability to quickly provide responsive, meaningful assistance to small utilities and support repair efforts months, even years after the disaster.
 
Rural water relief efforts since 2008 include assistance to areas damaged by hurricanes ([[Hurricane Gustav]], [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hurricane Hanna]], and [[Hurricane Ike]]), tornados ([[Parkersburg, Iowa#Tornado|Parkersburg Tornado]], [[Picher, Oklahoma#May 2008 Tornado|Picher Tornado]], [[Dierks, Arkansas#2009 Tornado|Dierks Tornado]] and [[Magee, Mississippi#Weather|Magee Tornado]]), floods, and ice storms ([[January 2009 Central Plains and Midwest ice storm|2009 Ice Storms]]).

In 2009, NRWA instituted a training program to educate, train and certify Rural Water staff in emergency response. The program provides training in hands-on skills for field staff, and organizational training for association leaders. Field staff training includes instruction on planning and preparedness, assessment and documentation, safety, power generation, and the operation of emergency generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Rural Water experts certified at Emergency Response training|year=2009|publisher=National Rural Water Association|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2009%2005%20May/RWExperts.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 2009 In-Service a success|year=2009|publisher=National Rural Water Association|accessdate=2009-05-21|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2009%2005%20May/In-service.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership training includes more focus on planning, organization, leadership and management during emergency and disaster situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Directors trained as emergency response Incident Commanders|year=2009|publisher=National Rural Water Association|accessdate=2009-08-04|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2009%2008%20August/ED%20training.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Small communities comprise more than 94 percent of the community water supplies NRWA through its state affiliates  represents 26,696 water and utility members from 48 non-profit, state rural water associations that cover the 50 United States and Puerto Rico.

==Events==
===WaterPro Conference===
WaterPro is the annual conference of the National Rural Water Association.

WaterPro is designed to bring together water and wastewater utility systems - large and small, municipal and rural - for sessions in operations, management, boardsmanship and governance.

===Rural Water Rally===
The National Rural Water Association holds and annual Rally in Washington D.C. to further the work of providing drinking water and wastewater services to rural communities. Rural Water professionals, leaders and customers from every state attend the rally to thank their Senators and Representatives for their support and encourage them to further support the goals and needs of the Rural Water Industry. NRWA welcomes V.I.P. guest speakers from legislative staffs and federal organizations, like the EPA and USDA, to share their views and insight to the assembled guests. The NRWA held the first Rural Water Rally in 1986 and has grown in attendance every year.

===Great American Water Taste Test===
In 1999, the National Rural Water Association hosted the first Great American Taste Test during the Rural Water Rally in Washington D.C. Each of NRWA's state affiliates selects an entry at their own state taste tests. A gallon of the winning system's water is shipped to the rally for national judging. Five finalists are selected by a panel of judges during a preliminary tasting. The final five are then judged by a V.I.P panel in a tasting during the Rural Water Luncheon on the final day of the rally.&lt;br&gt;
Each entry is judged on three criteria:
* Clarity
* Bouquet
* Taste
In the event of a tie, the winner is decided by a “Drink Off.” Drink Off was used to decide a winner for first time during the 2009 GAWTT to break a tie between entries between [[Perdido Bay]], [[Alabama]] (the eventual winner) and [[Allen County, Kentucky]].

===Regional/Water District Issues Forum===
The forum is designed to specifically address the issues facing larger regional utilities and water districts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12328">'''Organ transplantation in Israel''' has historically been low compared to other Western countries due to a common belief that organ donation is prohibited under Jewish law. This changed with the passage of new organ donation laws in 2008. If two patients have the same medical need, priority will now go to the patient who has signed an organ donor card, or whose family members have donated an organ (though medical necessity still takes precedence). This policy was nicknamed '''don't give, don't get'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2010/01/22/israels-organ-donation-law/|accessdate=2010-01-30|title=Israel's Organ Donation Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also defines "[[brain death]]" as an indication of death for all legal purposes, including organ donation. Additionally the law provides financial reimbursement to living donors for medical expenses due to donation and lost time at work. Organ trafficking is explicitly banned. Health insurance plans can no longer reimburse patients who go abroad to receive transplants.

Currently, although the rate of organ donation is still relatively low, it is rising.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/health/.premium-1.699944&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
Until 2008, there was no law prohibiting organ trafficking in Israel.&lt;ref name=Klarenbach&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccdt.ca/english/publications/background-pdfs/Economic_Living_Organ_Donor_Klarenbach.pdf|format=PDF|author=Scot Klarenbach|title=A Review of the Economic Implications of Living Organ Donation: Donor Perspectives and Policy Considerations|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=2009-08-29|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[Knesset]] approved two laws designed to regulate organ donations. The first law defines brain-respiratory death as a situation in which person who has no [[blood pressure]], fails to breathe without external life support systems and has no response from the pupils or any other [[reflex]]es is declared dead by two certified doctors.&lt;ref name=laws&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3523461,00.html Knesset approves organ donation law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	 
The second law provides for various benefits to living organ donors, such as reimbursement for medical expenses and lost work up to 18,000 NIS (roughly US$5,000), priority on the transplant list should they require a future organ donation,&lt;ref name=jewishweek&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c40_a7588/News/Israel.html Organ Donation: Legal, But Still Controversial] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416013029/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c40_a7588/News/Israel.html |date=April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  waived self-participation fee for any medical service resulting from the donation, and the attainment of a "chronic patient" status, which entitles the holder to additional medical benefits. In addition, the law criminalizes organ trafficking, receiving compensation for organs, or acting as an organ broker.&lt;ref name="laws"/&gt; This law was cited as a model by proposed 2009 legislation in the US.&lt;ref name="Guttman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/111473/ |title=Kidney Donation Scandal Sparks New Debate Over Specter’s Organ Legislation |date=2009-08-05 |publisher=[[The Forward]] |first=Nathan |last=Guttman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations ==
Israel operates a National Transplant and Organ Donation Center, established in 1993 as an institute of the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;Organ donation and transplantation, Orit Brawer Ben-David, p.143, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The center incorporates the ADI organization, founded by private citizens, which maintains a database of donors and sponsors donor cards. As of 2009, the database contains around 500,000 names of donors, about 10% of Israel's adult population.
	 
Since some ultra-religious Jews feel the 2008 law does not properly address [[halacha|halachic]] questions, Israel's Chief Rabbinate has decided to issue an organ donor card of its own, which allows organ harvesting from the potential donor only if brain death is determined according to the strictest letter of the law - for example by requiring that brain death be confirmed using electronic equipment rather than just the determination of a physician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3764753,00.html Organ donation to get halachic approval]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.hods.org Halachic Organ Donor Society] is active in Israel trying to raise awareness about Halachic acceptance of brain-stem death and support of organ donation. Most Israelis are secular but when it comes to death, most turn to Orthodox rabbis to seek guidance. That is why Israel has one of the lowest organ donor rates in the Western world. The Halachic Organ Donor Society has succeeded in recruiting more than 230 rabbis to register for organ donor cards. It has given presentations to over 30,000 Jews around the world to encourage them to donate organs to the general public. This public awareness campaign has increased the number of Israelis who have signed organ donor cards.

== Prevalence of donations ==
Both Orthodox Jews and the majority secular Jewish population often cite Jewish law as the reason for not donating.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-30/shimon-peres-wanted-israelis-be-organ-donors-him&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of agreement to organ donation is only 45%, which is 50% lower than the rate in most Western countries.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=824553&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y|title=Compensation for organ donation |first=Yaakov |last=Levi |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of people who hold an organ donation card in Israel is only 14 percent;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.il/English/Topics/organ_transplant/Pages/kartis_ADI.aspx Israel Ministry of Health - ADI&lt;/ref&gt; in Western countries the rate is 30-40%.  As a result, there are about 1,000 Israelis currently on the "waiting list" for organs, and it is estimated that roughly 10% of them die annually, due to a lack of donations.&lt;ref name=jewishweek /&gt; 

Yaakov Levi, the director of the Heart Transplant Unit at [[Sheba Medical Center]] has called for organs to be allocated first to those who are willing to donate their own organs and have possessed a donor card for several years. This call was accepted and incorporated into the 2008 law. According to the [[New York Times]], "Organ donation rates in Israel are among the lowest in the developed world, about one-third the rate in Western Europe, in large part because of what Health Ministry officials and doctors describe as a widespread impression that [[Halakha|Jewish law]] prohibits transplants as a 'desecration of the body......'" &lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/world/organ-trade-global-black-market-tracking-sale-kidney-path-poverty-hope.html?pagewanted=2 |title=THE ORGAN TRADE: A Global Black Market; Tracking the Sale of a Kidney On a Path of Poverty and Hope |publisher=New York Times |date=2004-05-23 | first=Larry | last=Rohter | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organ trafficking ==
{{Main|Organ trade}}
According to organ trade expert [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]] of [[Organ Watch]] (in 2001), Israel had become a "pariah" in the organ transplant world. The lack of donations due to Jewish custom heightened the disparity between the supply and demand of organs. This led to the popularity of "transplant tourism" in which patients in need of organs travel to medical centres abroad to receive organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_07/uk/doss34.htm |title=The organ of  last resort |publisher=[[UNESCO Courier]] |date=July 2001 |first=[[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2008 law prohibiting it, some Israeli organ brokers advertised on the radio and in newspapers. Kidneys, which are the most traded organ, may fetch up to $150,000 for brokers who usually pay the donors far less.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The Jewish weekly newspaper ''[[The Forward]]'' reported in the wake of this scandal that an Organ Trafficking Prohibition Act of 2009, sponsored by Democratic Senator [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania, has yet to be officially introduced in the U.S., but that its proposed language cites Israel as a model of a country that has enacted a law providing benefits for organ donors.&lt;ref name="Guttman"/&gt; 

The lack of regulations against organ trafficking prior to 2008 made Israel a focal point for the international organ trade. Health insurance would reimburse Israelis for organ transplants done abroad, but this has been banned in the new law.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/world/organ-trade-global-black-market-tracking-sale-kidney-path-poverty-hope.html?pagewanted=3 |title=THE ORGAN TRADE: A Global Black Market; Tracking the Sale of a Kidney On a Path of Poverty and Hope |publisher=New York Times |date=2004-05-23 | first=Larry | last=Rohter | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of all the abuses of the illegal market in human organs, there is a growing movement of activists in Israel and in America to legalize a Government-regulated program to offer financial incentives to people for living kidney donations and to families for deceased donations from brain-stem dead donors. This movement is headed, among other organizations, by the [http://organdonorincentives.org/wordpress/ Alliance for Organ Donor Incentives].

== The Aftonbladet accusations ==
{{Main|2009 Aftonbladet Israel controversy}}
In August 2009 the Swedish tabloid [[Aftonbladet]] published an article alleging that in 1992 the [[Israeli Defense Force]] took organs from Palestinians who died in Israeli custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article5691805.ab Aftonbladet: "Our sons are plundered of their organs"]&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations were denied by Israel, and the article caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/24/world/fg-israel-sweden24 |title=Article about organ harvesting sparks Israel-Sweden tiff |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-02-21 | first=Richard | last=Boudreaux}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the author of the article, Donald Boström, spoke to Israel Radio on 19 August 2009 and said he was worried by the allegations he reported: "It concerns me, to the extent that I want it to be investigated, that's true. But whether it's true or not — I have no idea, I have no clue."&lt;ref name="ap1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iSYpeLo9EP1NAwa_SduklhjH4znAD9A62EFG0|title=Israel furious over Swedish newspaper article|last=Friedman|first=Matti|date=19 August 2009|accessdate=19 August 2009|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December an interview was broadcast on Israeli television during which Israel's chief pathologist, Dr. [[Yehuda Hiss]], discussed the [[Organ harvesting|harvesting of organs]] in the 1990s at the [[Abu Kabir Forensic Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/12/20/world/AP-ML-Israel-Organ-Harvesting.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2018}} The interview was followed by a confirmation from Israeli officials that organs were taken in the 1990s without the permission of families of the deceased. Officials denied that the practice continued, and noted that both Israeli and Palestinian organs were taken without permission. "We started to harvest corneas for various hospitals in Israel,"  Hiss said in an interview on Israel's Channel 2 network. "Whatever was done was highly informal. No permission was asked from the families," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/12/21/israel.organs/ | work=CNN | title=Israel harvested organs without permission, officials say - CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-20 | date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Otitis Media.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Otitis media.]]
An integral symptom of acute otitis media is [[otalgia|ear pain]]; other possible symptoms include fever, and irritability (in infants). Since an episode of otitis media is usually precipitated by an [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (URTI), there are often accompanying symptoms like a cough and nasal discharge.&lt;ref name=AAP2013/&gt;

[[Otorrhea|Discharge from the ear]] can be caused by acute otitis media with perforation of the ear drum, chronic suppurative otitis media, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, or acute otitis externa. Trauma, such as a [[basilar skull fracture]], can also lead to discharge from the ear due to cerebral spinal drainage from the brain and its covering (meninges).

==Causes==
The common cause of all forms of otitis media is dysfunction of the [[Eustachian tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bluestone, CD |title= Eustachian tube: structure, function, role in otitis media |year=2005 |location=Hamilton, London |publisher=BC Decker |pages=1–219 |isbn=9781550090666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually due to inflammation of the [[mucous membranes]] in the [[nasopharynx]], which can be caused by a viral [[upper respiratory tract infection|URTI]], [[strep throat]], or possibly by [[allergy|allergies]].&lt;ref name="John D Donaldson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/859316-overview |title=Acute Otitis Media |author=John D Donaldson |publisher=Medscape |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328051741/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/859316-overview |archivedate=28 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, the gas volume in the middle ear is trapped and parts of it are slowly absorbed by the surrounding tissues, leading to negative pressure in the middle ear. Eventually, the negative middle-ear pressure can reach a point where fluid from the surrounding tissues is sucked into the middle ear's cavity ([[tympanic cavity]]), causing a middle-ear effusion. This is seen as a progression from a Type A [[tympanogram]] to a Type C to a Type B tympanogram.

By reflux or aspiration of unwanted secretions from the nasopharynx into the normally sterile middle-ear space, the fluid may then become infected &amp;mdash; usually with [[bacteria]]. The virus that caused the initial URI (upper respiratory infection) can itself be identified as the [[pathogen]] causing the infection.&lt;ref name="John D Donaldson"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Subtotal Perforation of the right tympanic membrane.tif|thumbnail|Perforation of the right tympanic membrane resulting from a previous severe acute otitis media]]
As its typical symptoms overlap with other conditions, such as acute external otitis, clinical history alone is not sufficient to predict whether acute otitis media is present; it has to be complemented by visualization of the [[tympanic membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laine MK, Tähtinen PA, Ruuskanen O, Huovinen P, Ruohola A |title=Symptoms or symptom-based scores cannot predict acute otitis media at otitis-prone age |journal=Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=e1154–61 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20368317 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Videos in clinical medicine.

In more severe cases, such as those with associated hearing loss or high [[fever]], [[audiometry]], [[tympanogram]], [[temporal bone]] [[CT scan|CT]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] can be used to assess for associated complications, such as [[mastoid effusion]], [[Periosteum|subperiosteal]] [[abscess]] formation, [[osteomyelitis|bony destruction]], [[venous thrombosis]] or [[meningitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=MM|last2=Eisenberg|first2=L|last3=Witsell|first3=D|last4=Schulz|first4=KA|title=Assessment of acute otitis externa and otitis media with effusion performance measures in otolaryngology practices.|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|date=October 2008|volume=139|issue=4|pages=490–494|pmid=18922333|doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2008.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute otitis media in children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new onset of otorrhea (drainage) is not due to external otitis. Also, the diagnosis may be made in children who have mild bulging of the ear drum and recent onset of ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema (redness) of the ear drum.

To confirm the diagnosis, middle-ear effusion and inflammation of the eardrum have to be identified; signs of these are fullness, bulging, cloudiness and redness of the eardrum.&lt;ref name=AAP2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberthal|first=AS|author2=Carroll, AE|author3=Chonmaitree, T|author4=Ganiats, TG|author5=Hoberman, A|author6=Jackson, MA|author7=Joffe, MD|author8=Miller, DT|author9=Rosenfeld, RM|author10=Sevilla, XD|author11=Schwartz, RH|author12=Thomas, PA|author13=Tunkel, DE|title=The Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media|journal=Pediatrics|date=Feb 25, 2013|pmid=23439909|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-3488|volume=131|issue=3|pages=e964–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to attempt to differentiate between acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME), as antibiotics are not recommended for OME.&lt;ref name="AAP2013"/&gt; It has been suggested that bulging of the tympanic membrane is the best sign to differentiate AOM from OME, with a bulging of the membrane suggesting AOM rather than OME.&lt;ref name="Acad Pediatr 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=N|display-authors= etal|title=Development of an algorithm for the diagnosis of otitis media.|journal=Academic Pediatrics|date=March 28, 2012|pmid=22459064|doi=10.1016/j.acap.2012.01.007|volume=12|issue=3|pages=214–218|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/14061/1/22459064.full.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viral otitis may result in blisters on the external side of the tympanic membrane, which is called ''bullous myringitis'' (''myringa'' being Latin for "eardrum").&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts DB |title=The etiology of bullous myringitis and the role of mycoplasmas in ear disease: a review|journal=Pediatrics |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=761–6 |date=April 1980 |pmid=7367083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, sometimes even examination of the eardrum may not be able to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the canal is small. If wax in the ear canal obscures a clear view of the eardrum it should be removed using a blunt cerumen curette or a wire loop. Also, an upset young child's crying can cause the eardrum to look inflamed due to distension of the small blood vessels on it, mimicking the redness associated with otitis media.

===Acute otitis media===
The most common bacteria isolated from the middle ear in AOM are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]],''&lt;ref name="AAP2013" /&gt; and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and otitis media: changes in pathogenicity following widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine|journal = Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|date = 2008-03-01|issn = 0194-5998|pmid = 18312870|pages = 274–278|volume = 138|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.otohns.2007.11.011|first = Michael S.|last = Benninger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early-onset OME is associated with feeding of infants while lying down, early entry into group [[child care]], parental [[smoking]], lack, or too short a period of [[breastfeeding]] and greater amounts of time spent in group child care, particularly those with a large number of children. These risk factors increase the incidence and duration of OME during the first two years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Owen MJ, Baldwin CD, Swank PR, Pannu AK, Johnson DL, Howie VM |title=Relation of infant feeding practices, cigarette smoke exposure, and group child care to the onset and duration of otitis media with effusion in the first two years of life |journal=J.

===Chronic suppurative otitis media===

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity that is characterised by discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane for at least 6 weeks. CSOM occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection that has led to acute otitis media. This progresses to a prolonged inflammatory response causing mucosal (middle ear) oedema, ulceration and perforation.  The middle ear attempts to resolve this ulceration by production of granulation tissue and polyp formation.  This can lead to increased discharge and failure to arrest the inflammation, and to development of CSOM, which is also often associated with [[cholesteatoma]]. There may be enough pus that it drains to the outside of the ear ([[otorrhea]]), or the pus may be minimal enough to be seen only on examination with an otoscope or binocular microscope. Hearing impairment often accompanies this disease.

People are at increased risk of developing CSOM when they have poor [[eustachian tube]] function, a history of multiple episodes of acute otitis media, live in crowded conditions, and attend paediatric day care facilities.  Those with craniofacial malformations such as [[cleft lip|cleft lip and palate]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[microcephaly]] are at higher risk.

Worldwide approximately 11% of the human population is affected by AOM every year, or 709 million cases.&lt;ref name=Mon2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26063472 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, Collaborators |date=22 August 2015 |title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9995 |pages=743–800 |pmid=26063472 |pmc=4561509 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.&lt;ref name=pmid26063472 /&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], CSOM is a primary cause of hearing loss in children.&lt;ref name=acuin /&gt; Adults with recurrent episodes of CSOM have a higher risk of developing permanent conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.

In Britain, 0.9% of children and 0.5% of adults have CSOM, with no difference between the sexes.&lt;ref name=acuin/&gt;

The incidence of CSOM across the world varies dramatically where high income countries have a relatively low prevalence while in low income countries the prevalence may be up to three times as great.&lt;ref name=Mon2012 /&gt;

Each year 21,000 people worldwide die due to complications of CSOM.&lt;ref name=acuin&gt;{{cite book |title=Chronic suppurative otitis media : burden of illness and management options |author1=Acuin, Jose |author2=WHO Dept. of Child and Adolescent Health and Development |author3=WHO Programme for the Prevention of Blindness and Deafness |location=Geneve |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42941 |isbn=978-92-4-159158-4 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228162750/http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42941 |archivedate=2017-02-28 |df= |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adhesive otitis media===
Adhesive otitis media occurs when a thin [[tympanic membrane retraction|retracted ear drum]] becomes sucked into the middle-ear space and stuck (i.e., adherent) to the [[ossicle]]s and other bones of the middle ear.

==Management==
Oral and topical [[analgesics|pain killers]] are effective to treat the pain caused by otitis media. Oral agents include [[ibuprofen]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), and [[opiates]]. Topical agents shown to be effective include [[antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Best evidence topic reports. Bet 1.

===Antibiotics===
It is important to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for acute otitis media. As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one [[perforation]], and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash.&lt;ref name=Venekamp2015/&gt; If pain is present, [[analgesic|pain medications]] may be used.
 
For bilateral acute otitis media in infants younger than 24 months of age, there is evidence that the benefits of antibiotics outweigh the harms.&lt;ref name=Venekamp2015/&gt; A 2015 Cochrane review concluded that watchful waiting is the preferred approach for children over six months with non severe acute otitis media.&lt;ref name=Ven2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venekamp| first1=R| last2=Sanders|first2=S| first3=P| last3=Glasziou|title=Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2015|volume=6| issue=6|pages=CD000219.pub4 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub4| pmid=26099233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence indicates that most children older than 6 months of age who have acute otitis media do not benefit from treatment with antibiotics. If antibiotics are used, [[amoxicillin]] is generally recommended.&lt;ref name=AAP2013/&gt; If there is [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] or use of amoxicillin in the last 30 days then [[co-amoxiclav|amoxicillin-clavulanate]] or another penicillin derivative plus beta lactamase inhibitor is recommended.&lt;ref name=AAP2013/&gt; Taking amoxicillin once a day may be as effective as twice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thanaviratananich|first1=S|last2=Laopaiboon|first2=M|last3=Vatanasapt|first3=P|title=Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 December 2013|volume=12|issue=12|pages=CD004975|pmid=24338106|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004975.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or three times a day.

Complications of acute otitis media consists of perforation of the ear drum, infection of the mastoid space behind the ear ([[mastoiditis]]), and more rarely intracranial complications can occur, such as [[bacterial meningitis]], [[brain abscess]], or [[dural sinus thrombosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung|first1=TT|last2=Alper|first2=CM|last3=Hellstorm|first3=SO|last4=Hunter|first4=LL|last5=Casselbrant|first5=ML|last6=Groth|first6=A|last7=Kemaloglu|first7=YK|last8=Kim|first8=SG|last9=Lim|first9=D|last10=Nittrourer|first10=S|last11=Park|first11=KH|last12=Sabo|first12=D|last13=Sprately|first13=J|title=Panel 8: Complications and sequelae|journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |date=April 2013|volume=148|issue=4 Suppl|pages=E122–43 |doi=10.1177/0194599812467425 |pmid=23536529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that each year 21,000 people die due to complications of otitis media.&lt;ref name=Mon2012 /&gt;

===Membrane rupture===
In severe or untreated cases, the tympanic membrane may [[tympanic membrane perforation|perforate]], allowing the [[pus]] in the middle-ear space to drain into the [[ear canal]]. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of the tympanic membrane suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the [[infection]] and the ear drum nearly always heals.
An option for severe acute otitis media in which analgesics are not controlling ear pain is to perform a tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through the tympanic membrane to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).

===Hearing loss===
Children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic suppurative otitis media have higher risks of developing [[conductive hearing loss|conductive]] and [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Globally approximately 141&amp;nbsp;million people have mild hearing loss due to otitis media (2.1% of the population).&lt;ref name=LancetEpi2012/&gt; This is more common in males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).&lt;ref name=LancetEpi2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990–2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2|last2=Flaxman|first2=A.

J.|last30=Bennett|first30=D|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This hearing loss is mainly due to fluid in the middle ear or rupture of the tympanic membrane. Prolonged duration of otitis media is associated with ossicular complications and, together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation, contributes to the severity of the disease and hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Da Costa SS |title=Sensorineural hearing loss in patients with chronic otitis media |journal=Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol |volume=266 |issue=2 |pages=221–4 |date=February 2009 |doi=10.1007/s00405-008-0739-0 |pmid=18629531 |last2=Rosito |first2=Letícia Petersen Schmidt |last3=Dornelles |first3=Cristina|hdl=10183/125807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periods of conductive hearing loss from otitis media may have a detrimental effect on speech development in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberts K |title=A preliminary account of the effect of otitis media on 15-month-olds' categorization and some implications for early language learning |journal=J Speech Lang Hear Res |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=508–18 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9210110 |url=http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781836 |doi=10.1044/jslhr.4003.508 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053607/http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781836 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have linked otitis media to learning problems, attention disorders, and problems with [[social adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bidadi S, Nejadkazem M, Naderpour M |title=The relationship between chronic otitis media-induced hearing loss and the acquisition of social skills |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=139 |issue=5|pages=665–70 |date=November 2008 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0194599808012989 |pmid=18984261|doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2008.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with otitis media have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with normal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gouma P, Mallis A, Daniilidis V, Gouveris H, Armenakis N, Naxakis S |title=Behavioral trends in young children with conductive hearing loss: a case-control study |journal=Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol |volume=268 |issue=1 |pages=63–6 |date=January 2011 |pmid=20665042 |doi=10.1007/s00405-010-1346-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood otitis media may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yilmaz S, Karasalihoglu AR, Tas A, Yagiz R, Tas M |title=Otoacoustic emissions in young adults with a history of otitis media |journal=J Laryngol Otol |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=103–7 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16359151 |doi=10.1017/S0022215105004871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Acute otitis media is very common in childhood. It is the most common condition for which medical care is provided in children under five years of age in the US.&lt;ref name="John D Donaldson" /&gt; Acute otitis media affects 11% of people each year (709&amp;nbsp;million cases) with half occurring in those below five years.&lt;ref name=Mon2012 /&gt; Chronic suppurative otitis media affects about 5% or 31&amp;nbsp;million of these cases with 22.6% of cases occurring annually under the age of five years.&lt;ref name=Mon2012 /&gt; Otitis media resulted in 2,400 deaths in 2013&amp;mdash;down from 4,900 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD204/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''otitis media'' is composed of ''otitis'', [[Ancient Greek]] for "inflammation of the ear", and ''media'', [[Latin]] for "middle".

'''Pharmacocybernetics''' (also known as '''pharma-cybernetics''', '''cybernetic pharmacy''' and '''cyberpharmacy''') is an upcoming field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the [[pharmaceutical care]] of patients.&lt;ref name="Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture"&gt;Yap KY, Chuang X, Lee AJM, Lee RZ, Lim L, Lim JJ, Nimesha R. Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture: empowering drug knowledge through user-, experience- and activity-centered designs. International Journal of Computer Science Issues 2009; 3: 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an interdisciplinary field that integrates the domains of [[medicine]] and [[pharmacy]], [[computer science]]s (informatics, cybernetics, interactive digital media, human-computer-environment interactions) and [[psychological sciences]] to design, develop, apply and evaluate technological innovations which improve drugs and medications management, as well as prevent or solve drug-related problems.

==Terminology==
"Pharmaco" originates from the Greek word "pharmakon", which means drugs or poisons;&lt;ref name="Stedmans Medical Dictionary"&gt;Stedman TL. Stedman's Medical Dictionary. 28th ed. Baltimore, Maryland: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while "[[cybernetics]]" originates from the Greek word "kubernetes", which means "the art of steering".&lt;ref name="Pangago Getting started guide to cybernetics"&gt;Pangaro P. "Getting started" guide to cybernetics. Available at: http://pangaro.com/published/cyber-macmillan.html.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norbert Wiener]] first defined cybernetics as the science or study of "control and communication in the animal and the machine".&lt;ref name="Pangago Getting started guide to cybernetics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASC Foundations subject of cybernetics"&gt;American Society for Cybernetics. Foundations - the subject of cybernetics: defining 'cybernetics'. Available at: http://www.asc-cybernetics.org/foundations/definitions.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the [[American Society for Cybernetics]] has further described this field as "the design or discovery and application of principles of regulation and communication".&lt;ref name="ASC Foundations subject of cybernetics" /&gt;

[[Cybernetics]] has been applied to many fields, such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[System theory|systems theory]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]]. The defining characteristic of a cybernetic system is its relationship between endogenous goals and the external environment.&lt;ref name="Corning Synergy cybernetics and evolution of politics"&gt;Corning PA. Synergy, cybernetics, and the evolution of politics. International Political Science Review 1996; 17(1): 91-119. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/019251296017001006 DOI: 10.1177/019251296017001006]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, cybernetics was applied in healthcare as a means of setting positive outcome goals for patients who were not satisfied with their [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeries]].&lt;ref name="Psycho-cybernetics author"&gt;'Psycho-cybernetics' Author. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/643367622.html?dids=643367622:643367622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+2%2C+1973&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281886-Current+File%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B5&amp;desc=%27PSYCHO-CYBERNETICS%27+AUTHOR Plastic surgeon tries to heal 'inner scars']. Los Angeles Times 1973, 2 November; Sect. Part 1-A: B5-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of "[[new cybernetics]]" or "[[second-order cybernetics]]" further expanded this concept to include the interactions between cybernetic systems and the people interacting with them, as well as to society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Geyer Challenge of sociocybernetics"&gt;Geyer F. The challenge of sociocybernetics. Kybernetes: The International Journal of Systems &amp; Cybernetics 1995; 24(4): 6-32. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03684929510089321 DOI: 10.1108/03684929510089321]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cybernetics also includes the concept of "[[cyberspace]]", which is described by the science fiction author [[William Gibson]] as a virtual representation of information in varying states of accessibility that is linked to various people and organizations in his book [[Neuromancer]].&lt;ref name="Adams Cyberspace and virtual places"&gt;Adams PC. Cyberspace and virtual places. Geographical Review 1997; 87(2): 155-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trappl Cybernetics and systems revival"&gt;Trappl R. The cybernetics and systems revival: Paper presented at: 14th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research (EMCSR'98); 14–17 April 1998; University of Vienna, Austrian Society for Cybernetic Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson Neuromancer"&gt;Gibson W. Neuromancer (Special 20th Anniversary Edition). Hardcover ed: Ace Books; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is also reiterated in the movie "[[The Matrix]]" and its sequels, which revolves around [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]), a computer programmer, who lives in a simulated matrix world created by sentient machines but perceived by humans as reality. The term "cyberspace" is now used ubiquitously to describe anything that is associated with computers, informatics and internet technologies, and also user experiences through interactions with these technologies.

==Context==
The increased popularity of informatics and internet technologies in healthcare has led to the development of various software, tools and applications for healthcare professionals and patients to improve pharmaceutical care and health-related outcomes. [[Pharmacoinformatics]] (or [[pharmacy informatics]]) is a field within [[Ehealth|e-health]] that targets drug-related problems through the use of informatics and internet technologies.&lt;ref name="Yap Improving pharmaceutical care in oncology by pharmacoinformatics"&gt;Yap KY, Chan A, Chui WK. Improving pharmaceutical care in oncology by pharmacoinformatics: the evolving role of informatics and the internet for drug therapy. Lancet Oncology 2009; 10(10): 1011-1019. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70104-4 DOI: 10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70104-4] {{PMID|19796753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacocybernetics goes one step further by merging the science of technology with human-computer-environment interactions, so that technological innovations can be designed, developed, applied and evaluated in relation to supporting medicines and drugs use, as well as to reduce or prevent drug-related problems. Pharmacocybernetic approaches target patient care and safety, and they take into account the flow of information and knowledge between users and cybernetic systems or the environment, the actions taken by users to achieve their goals, user interactivity, as well as feedback.&lt;ref name="Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture" /&gt; This field requires clinical knowledge and experience, as well as advanced skills and expertise to deal with technologies and human-computer-environment interactions in relation to the management of medicines and drug therapies.&lt;ref name="Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture" /&gt;

==Relation to pharmaceutical care and drug-related problems==
[[Pharmaceutical care]] involves the identification, solving and prevention of medication/drug-related problems with regards to patients' drug therapies.&lt;ref name="ASHP statement on pharmaceutical care"&gt;American Society of Hospital Pharmacists. [http://www.ashp.org/doclibrary/bestpractices/orgstpharmcare.aspx ASHP statement on pharmaceutical care]. American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy 1993; 50: 1720-1723.&lt;/ref&gt; These problems are classified into various categories, which differ slightly between the American and European systems.

The [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] classifies drug-related problems into eight major categories:&lt;ref name="ASHP statement on pharmaceutical care" /&gt;

* Untreated indications
* Medication use without indication
* Failure to receive medications
* Improper drug selections
* Underdose
* Overdose
* Adverse drug reactions
* Drug interactions

The Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe classifies them by problems and causes:&lt;ref name="PCNE classification for DRPs v6.2"&gt;Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe. PCNE classification for drug-related problems v6.2. Available at: http://www.pcne.org/sig/drp/documents/PCNE%20classification%20V6-2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Classification by problems'':
* Treatment effectiveness
* Adverse reactions
* Treatment costs
* Other types of problems

''Classification by causes'':
* Drug selection
* Drug form
* Dose selection
* Treatment duration
* Drug use/administration process
* Logistics-related
* Patient-related
* Other causes

The rapid adoption of [[cybermedicine]] has led to several other associated medication/drug-related problems.&lt;ref name="Yap Improving pharmaceutical care in oncology by pharmacoinformatics" /&gt; These include:
* Digital dehumanization of the patient-practitioner relationship
* Virtual conflicts of recommendation
* Phenomenon of online self-prescribing

Pharmacocybernetics approaches target the whole [[digital healthcare]] innovation cycle from identifying the healthcare problem, designing, developing, applying and evaluating the technological innovations that aim to address these drug-related problems. These technological innovations tend to be based on [[User-centered design|user-centered]], [[User experience design|experience-centered]] and [[Activity-centered design|activity-centered]] designs.

==Types of environments==
The types of environments that are relevant to pharmacocybernetics approaches follow [[Urie Bronfenbrenner|Urie Bronfenbrenner’s]] [[Ecological Systems Theory]].&lt;ref name="Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paquette Bronfenbrenners ecological systems theory"&gt;Paquette D, Ryan J. Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory. Available at: {{cite web |url=http://pt3.nl.edu/paquetteryanwebquest.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928164029/http://pt3.nl.edu/paquetteryanwebquest.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These environments, when applied to healthcare (for example, when a patient with a chronic disease searches the internet for information regarding his drug therapy), are as follows:

* ''Microsystem'' (the patient’s immediate environment): The physical characteristics of the desktop or laptop, mouse sensitivity, or hardware and software faults that the patient experiences when performing the task.
* ''Mesosystem'' (the relation between the patient’s immediate environments): Whether the patient carries out the task alone or in the company of others will affect his experiences, psychological state and behavior.
* ''Exosystem'' (the external settings that indirectly affect but do not include the patient): When his family also understands his medical condition and drug therapy, they can provide encouragement and support which will prompt a sense of closeness experienced by the patient. This in turn may lead to improved medication compliance.
* ''Macrosystem'' (cultural context of the patient): Sharing of his experiences with other similar patients on social networking channels may alleviate the stigma felt and positively influence and enhance the experiences of the patient.
* ''Chronosystem'' (the time-space dimension over the patient’s course of life): As the patient gains more moral support in time from others with similar experiences, he can better adapt to life and may be motivated to improve his lifestyle and keep healthy.

==Pharmacocybernetic maxims==
Four pharmacocybernetic maxims have been defined for designers and developers of pharmaco-informatics tools and applications that provide information on medications and drug therapies.&lt;ref name="Yap Pharmaco-cybernetics as an interactive component of pharma-culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yap Merging the old with the new"&gt;Yap KY, Lim KJ. Merging the old with the new: a cybermedicine marriage for oncology interactions with traditional herbal therapies and complementary medicines. Tang - International Journal of Genuine Traditional Medicine 2012; 2(2): e18. [https://dx.doi.org/10.5667/tang.2012.0004 DOI: 10.5667/tang.2012.0004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan Detection and management of oncology drug interactions"&gt;Chan A, Yap KY. Detection and management of oncology drug interactions: Can we do better? Maturitas 2010; 65(3): 181-182. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.12.001 DOI: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.12.001] [http://www.pubmed.com/20036470 PMID 20036470]&lt;/ref&gt; These design principles are in relation to:

# ''Quality of drug information'': The quality of the drug information provided by the tool/application should be accurate and evidence based. Its content should follow that from appropriate sources, such as research articles, established drug databases and drug package information.
# ''Quantity of drug information'': The tool/application should provide adequate content regarding the medication or drug therapy so that its users have enough knowledge to minimize the likelihood of drug-related problems.
# ''Relation to target audiences'': The medication- or drug-related content provided by the tool/application should be relevant to its target audience and clarify their doubts.
# ''Manner of data presentation'': The information provided by the tool/application should be presented in a clear manner that avoids ambiguity and misinterpretation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14110">'''Pharmacodynamics''' ('''PD''') is the study of the [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiologic]] effects of [[drug]]s (especially [[pharmaceutical drug]]s). The effects can include those manifested within [[animal]]s (including humans), [[microorganism]]s, or combinations of [[organism]]s (for example, [[infection]]). Pharmacodynamics is the study of how a drug affects an organism, whereas [[pharmacokinetics]] is the study of how the organism affects the drug. Both together influence [[dosing]], benefit, and [[adverse effect]]s. Pharmacodynamics is sometimes abbreviated as PD and pharmacokinetics as PK, especially in combined reference (for example, when speaking of [[PK/PD models]]).

Pharmacodynamics places particular emphasis on [[dose–response relationship]]s, that is, the relationships between drug [[concentration]] and effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lees P, Cunningham FM, Elliott J |title=Principles of pharmacodynamics and their applications in veterinary pharmacology |journal=J.

==Effects on the body==
The majority of drugs either {{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha
|mimic or inhibit normal physiological/biochemical processes or inhibit pathological processes in animals or
|inhibit vital processes of endo- or ectoparasites and microbial organisms.}}
There are 7 main drug actions:
*[[Stimulation|stimulating action]] through direct [[Agonist|receptor agonism]] and downstream effects
*[[Depression (physiology)|depressing action]] through direct [[Agonist|receptor agonism]] and downstream effects (ex.: [[inverse agonist]])
*blocking/antagonizing action (as with [[Receptor antagonist|silent antagonists]]), the drug binds the receptor but does not activate it
*stabilizing action, the drug seems to act neither as a stimulant or as a depressant (ex.: some drugs possess receptor activity that allows them to stabilize general receptor activation, like [[buprenorphine]] in opioid dependent individuals or [[aripiprazole]] in schizophrenia, all depending on the dose and the recipient)
*exchanging/replacing substances or accumulating them to form a reserve (ex.: [[glycogen]] storage)
*direct beneficial chemical reaction as in [[Antioxidant#Oxidative challenge in biology|free radical scavenging]]
*direct harmful chemical reaction which might result in damage or destruction of the cells, through induced toxic or lethal damage ([[cytotoxicity]] or [[irritation]])

===Desired activity===
The desired activity of a drug is mainly due to successful targeting of one of the following:
*[[Cellular membrane]] disruption
*[[Chemical reaction]] with downstream effects
*Interaction with [[enzyme]] proteins
*Interaction with [[structural]] proteins
*Interaction with [[Carrier-protein|carrier]] proteins
*Interaction with [[ion channel]]s
*[[Ligand binding]] to [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]:
**[[Hormone]] receptors
**[[Neuromodulator]] receptors
**[[Neurotransmitter]] receptors

[[General anesthetic]]s were once thought to work by disordering the neural membranes, thereby altering the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx. [[Antacid]]s and [[chelating agent]]s combine chemically in the body. Enzyme-substrate binding is a way to alter the production or metabolism of key [[endogenous]] chemicals, for example [[aspirin]] irreversibly inhibits the enzyme [[cyclooxygenase|prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase)]] thereby preventing [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] response. [[Colchicine]], a drug for gout, interferes with the function of the structural protein [[tubulin]], while [[Digitalis]], a drug still used in heart failure, inhibits the activity of the carrier molecule, [[Na-K-ATPase pump]]. The widest class of drugs act as ligands which bind to receptors which determine cellular effects. Upon drug binding, receptors can elicit their normal action (agonist), blocked action (antagonist), or even action opposite to normal (inverse agonist).

In principle, a pharmacologist would aim for a target [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentration of the drug for a desired level of response. In reality, there are many factors affecting this goal. Pharmacokinetic factors determine peak concentrations, and concentrations cannot be maintained with absolute consistency because of metabolic breakdown and excretory clearance. [[Genetics|Genetic]] factors may exist which would alter metabolism or drug action itself, and a patient's immediate status may also affect indicated dosage.

===Undesirable effects===
Undesirable effects of a drug include:
*Increased probability of cell [[Mutagen|mutation]] ([[carcinogen]]ic activity)
*A multitude of simultaneous assorted actions which may be deleterious
*Interaction (additive, multiplicative, or metabolic)
*Induced physiological damage, or abnormal chronic conditions

===Therapeutic window===
{{Main|Therapeutic window}}
The therapeutic window is the amount of a [[medication]] between the amount that gives an effect ([[effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]]) and the amount that gives more [[adverse effects]] than desired effects. For instance, medication with a small pharmaceutical window must be administered with care and control, e.g. by frequently measuring blood concentration of the drug, since it easily loses effects or gives adverse effects.

===Duration of action===
The ''duration of action'' of a drug is the length of time that particular drug is effective.&lt;ref name="pmid7352385"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carruthers SG | title = Duration of drug action | journal = Am. Fam.

==Receptor binding and effect==
The binding of ligands (drug) to receptors is governed by the ''[[law of mass action]]'' which relates the large-scale status to the rate of numerous molecular processes. The rates of formation and un-formation can be used to determine the equilibrium concentration of bound receptors. The ''equilibrium dissociation constant'' is defined by:
:&lt;chem&gt;L + R &lt;=&gt; LR &lt;/chem&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;K_d = \frac{[L][R]}{[L R]}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L''=ligand, ''R''=receptor, square brackets [] denote concentration. The fraction of bound receptors is

:::&lt;math&gt;Fraction \ Bound = \frac{[L R]}{[R]+[L R]} =\frac{1}{1+\frac{K_d}{[L]}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:DoseResponse.png|thumb|320px|Semi-log plots of two agonists with different K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.  The blue curve represents the ligand with greater potency.]]

This expression is one way to consider the effect of a drug, in which the response is related to the fraction of bound receptors (see: [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill equation]]). The fraction of bound receptors is known as occupancy. The relationship between occupancy and pharmacological response is usually non-linear. This explains the so-called ''receptor reserve'' phenomenon i.e. the concentration producing 50% occupancy is typically higher than the concentration producing 50% of maximum response. More precisely, receptor reserve refers to a phenomenon whereby stimulation of only a fraction of the whole receptor population apparently elicits the maximal effect achievable in a particular tissue.

The simplest interpretation of receptor reserve is that it is a model that states there are excess receptors on the cell surface than what is necessary for full effect. Taking a more sophisticated approach, receptor reserve is an integrative measure of the response-inducing capacity of an [[agonist]] (in some receptor models it is termed intrinsic efficacy or [[intrinsic activity]]) and of the signal amplification capacity of the corresponding receptor (and its downstream signaling pathways). Thus, the existence (and magnitude) of receptor reserve depends on the agonist ([[efficacy]]), tissue (signal amplification ability) and measured effect (pathways activated to cause signal amplification). As receptor reserve is very sensitive to agonist’s intrinsic efficacy, it is usually defined only for full (high-efficacy) agonists.&lt;ref name="pmid7161296"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruffolo RR Jr | title = Review important concepts of receptor theory | journal = J.

Often the response is determined as a function of log[''L''] to consider many orders of magnitude of concentration. However, there is no biological or physical theory which relates effects to the log of concentration. It is just convenient for graphing purposes. It is useful to note that 50% of the receptors are bound when [''L'']=''K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' .

The graph shown represents the conc-response for two hypothetical receptor agonists, plotted in a semi-log fashion. The curve toward the left represents a higher potency (potency arrow does not indicate direction of increase) since lower concentrations are needed for a given response. The effect increases as a function of concentration.

== Multicellular pharmacodynamics ==
The concept of pharmacodynamics has been expanded to include '''Multicellular Pharmacodynamics''' (MCPD). MCPD is the study of the static and dynamic properties and relationships between a set of drugs and a dynamic and diverse multicellular four-dimensional organization. It is the study of the workings of a drug on a minimal multicellular system (mMCS), both ''in vivo'' and ''in silico''. '''Networked Multicellular Pharmacodynamics''' (Net-MCPD) further extends the concept of MCPD to model regulatory genomic networks together with signal transduction pathways, as part of a complex of interacting components in the cell.

== Toxicodynamics ==
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are termed [[toxicokinetics]] and [[toxicodynamics]] in the field of [[ecotoxicology]]. Here, the focus is on toxic effects on a wide range of organisms. The corresponding models are called toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic models.&lt;ref name="pmid20863871"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Q, Hickman M | title = Toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic (TK/TD) evaluation to determine and predict the neurotoxicity of artemisinins | journal = Toxicology | volume = 279 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 20863871 | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2010.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Convolution Illustrated eng.png|thumb|right|270x270px|Image formation in a [[confocal microscope]]: central longitudinal (XZ) slice. The 3D acquired distribution arises from the [[convolution]] of the real light sources with the PSF.]]

[[Image:spherical-aberration-disk.jpg|thumb|269x269px|A [[point source]] as imaged by a system with negative (top), zero (center), and positive (bottom) [[spherical aberration]]. Images to the left are [[defocus]]ed toward the inside, images on the right toward the outside.]]

The '''point spread function''' ('''PSF''') describes the response of an imaging system to a [[point source]] or point object.  A more general term for the PSF is a system's [[impulse response]], the PSF being the impulse response of a focused optical system. The PSF in many contexts can be thought of as the extended blob in an image that represents an unresolved object.  In functional terms it is the [[spatial domain]] version of the [[Optical transfer function|optical transfer function of the imaging system]]. It is a useful concept in [[Fourier optics]], [[astronomy|astronomical imaging]], [[medical imaging]], [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and other imaging techniques such as [[dimension|3D]] [[microscopy]] (like in [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]]) and [[fluorescence microscopy]]. The degree of spreading (blurring) of the point object is a measure for the quality of an imaging system. In [[coherence (physics)|non-coherent]] imaging systems such as [[fluorescent]] [[microscopes]], [[telescopes]] or optical microscopes, the image formation process is linear in power and described by [[linear system]] theory. This means that when two objects A and B are imaged simultaneously, the result is equal to the sum of the independently imaged objects. In other words: the imaging of A is unaffected by the imaging of B and ''vice versa'', owing to the non-interacting property of photons. The image of a complex object can then be seen as a [[convolution]] of the true object and the PSF. However, when the detected light is [[coherence (physics)|coherent]], [[image formation]] is linear in the [[complex number|complex]] [[electric field|field]]. Recording the intensity image then can lead to cancellations or other non-linear effects.

==Introduction==
By virtue of the linearity property of optical imaging systems, i.e.,

: ''Image''(''Object''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''Object''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''Image''(''Object''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''Image''(''Object''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

the image of an object in a microscope or telescope can be computed by expressing the object-plane field as a weighted sum over 2D impulse functions, and then expressing the image plane field as the weighted sum over the ''images'' of these impulse functions.  This is known as the ''superposition principle'', valid for [[linear systems]].  The images of the individual object-plane impulse functions are called point spread functions, reflecting the fact that a mathematical ''point'' of light in the object plane is ''spread'' out to form a finite area in the image plane (in some branches of mathematics and physics, these might be referred to as [[Green's functions]] or [[impulse response]] functions).
[[File:PSF Deconvolution V.png|thumb|265x265px|Application of PSF: Deconvolution of the mathematically modeled PSF and the low-resolution image enhances the resolution.&lt;ref name=Kiarash1&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ahi |first1=Kiarash |first2=Mehdi |last2=Anwar |date=May 26, 2016 |title=Developing terahertz imaging equation and enhancement of the resolution of terahertz images using deconvolution |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303563271_Developing_terahertz_imaging_equation_and_enhancement_of_the_resolution_of_terahertz_images_using_deconvolution |journal=Proc.

When the object is divided into discrete point objects of varying intensity, the image is computed as a sum of the PSF of each point.  As the PSF is typically determined entirely by the imaging system (that is, microscope or telescope), the entire image can be described by knowing the optical properties of the system. This process is usually formulated by a [[convolution]] equation. In [[microscope image processing]] and [[astronomy]], knowing the PSF of the measuring device is very important for restoring the (original) image with [[deconvolution]]. For the case of laser beams, the PSF can be mathematically modeled using the concepts of [[Gaussian beam]]s.&lt;ref name=Kiarash2&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ahi |first1=Kiarash |first2=Mehdi |last2=Anwar  |date=May 26, 2016 |title=Modeling of terahertz images based on x-ray images: a novel approach for verification of terahertz images and identification of objects with fine details beyond terahertz resolution |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303563365_Modeling_of_terahertz_images_based_on_x-ray_images_a_novel_approach_for_verification_of_terahertz_images_and_identification_of_objects_with_fine_details_beyond_terahertz_resolution |journal=Proc. SPIE 9856, Terahertz Physics, Devices, and Systems X: Advanced Applications in Industry and Defense, 98560N |doi=10.1117/12.2228685}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, as shown in the figure on the right, deconvolution of the mathematically modeled PSF and the image, improves the resolution from 2.2&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Kiarash1/&gt;

==Theory==
The point spread function may be independent of position in the object plane, in which case it is called ''shift invariant''.  In addition, if there is no distortion in the system, the image plane coordinates are linearly related to the object plane coordinates via the [[magnification]] ''M'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_i, y_i) = (M x_o, M y_o)&lt;/math&gt;.

If the imaging system produces an inverted image, we may simply regard the image plane coordinate axes as being reversed from the object plane axes.  With these two assumptions, i.e., that the PSF is shift-invariant ''and'' that there is no distortion, calculating the image plane convolution integral is a straightforward process.

Mathematically, we may represent the object plane field as:

:&lt;math&gt; O(x_o,y_o) = \int\!\!\int O(u,v) ~ \delta(x_o-u,y_o-v) ~ du\, dv&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., as a sum over weighted impulse functions, although this is also really just stating the shifting property of 2D delta functions (discussed further below).  Rewriting the object transmittance function in the form above allows us to calculate the image plane field as the superposition of the images of each of the individual impulse functions, i.e., as a superposition over weighted point spread functions in the image plane using the ''same'' weighting function as in the object plane, i.e., &lt;math&gt;O(x_o,y_o)&lt;/math&gt;.  Mathematically, the image is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;I(x_o,y_o) = \int\!\!\int O(u,v) ~ \mathrm{PSF}(x_i/M-u , y_i/M-v) \, du\, dv&lt;/math&gt;

in which PSF(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; /M'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''u'',  ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; /M'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp; ''v'') is the image of the impulse function δ(''x&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp; ''u'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp; ''v'').

The 2D impulse function may be regarded as the limit (as side dimension ''w'' tends to zero) of the "square post" function, shown in the figure below.

[[Image:SquarePost.svg|Square Post Function|right|thumb|220px]]

We imagine the object plane as being decomposed into square areas such as this, with each having its own associated square post function.  If the height, ''h'', of the post is maintained at 1/w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then as the side dimension ''w'' tends to zero, the height, ''h'', tends to infinity in such a way that the volume (integral) remains constant at 1.  This gives the 2D impulse the sifting property (which is implied in the equation above), which says that when the 2D impulse function, δ(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''u'',''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''v''), is integrated against any other continuous function, {{nowrap|''f''(''u'',''v'')}}, it "sifts out" the value of ''f'' at the location of the impulse, ''i''.''e''., at the point {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}}.

Since the concept of a perfect point source object is so central to the idea of PSF, it's worth spending some time on that before proceeding further. First of all, there is no such thing in nature as a perfect mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely non-physical and is nothing more than a mathematical construct used to model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave — a wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with uniform intensity everywhere on the spheres (see [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]]). Such a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below. We also note that a perfect point source radiator will not only radiate a uniform spectrum of propagating plane waves, but a uniform spectrum of exponentially decaying ([[Evanescent wave|evanescent]]) waves as well, and it is these which are responsible for resolution finer than one wavelength (see [[Fourier optics]]). This follows from the following [[Fourier transform]] expression for a 2D impulse function,

:&lt;math&gt;\delta (x,y) \propto  \int\!\!\int e^{j(k_x x + k_y y)} \, d k_x\, d k_y&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:PSF.svg|Truncation of Spherical Wave by Lens|right|thumb|400px]]

The quadratic [[lens (optics)|lens]] intercepts a ''portion'' of this spherical wave, and refocuses it onto a blurred point in the image plane. For a single [[lens (optics)|lens]], an on-axis point source in the object plane produces an [[Airy disc]] PSF in the image plane. This comes about in the following way. ''It can be shown'' (see [[Fourier optics]], [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], [[Fraunhofer diffraction]]) that the field radiated by a planar object (or, by reciprocity, the field converging onto a planar image) is related to its corresponding source (or image) plane distribution via a [[Fourier transform]] (FT) relation. In addition, a uniform function over a circular area (in one FT domain) corresponds to the [[Airy function#circular Airy function|Airy function]], {{nowrap|''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')/''x''}} in the other FT domain, where {{nowrap|''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the first-order [[Bessel function]] of the first kind. That is, a uniformly-illuminated circular aperture that passes a converging uniform spherical wave yields an Airy function image at the focal plane. A graph of a sample 2D Airy function is shown in the adjoining figure.

[[Image:Airy-3d.svg|[[Airy function#circular Airy function|Airy function]]|right|thumb|300px]]

Therefore, the converging (''partial'') spherical wave shown in the figure above produces an [[Airy disc]] in the image plane. The argument of the Airy function is important, because this determines the ''scaling'' of the Airy disc (in other words, how big the disc is in the image plane). If Θ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum angle that the converging waves make with the lens axis, ''r'' is radial distance in the image plane, and [[wavenumber]] ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2π/λ where λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;wavelength, then the argument of the Airy function is: {{nowrap|kr tan(Θ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. If Θ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is small (only a small portion of the converging spherical wave is available to form the image), then radial distance, r, has to be very large before the total argument of the Airy function moves away from the central spot. In other words, if Θ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is small, the Airy disc is large (which is just another statement of Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] for FT pairs, namely that small extent in one domain corresponds to wide extent in the other domain, and the two are related via the ''space-bandwidth product''). By virtue of this, high [[magnification]] systems, which typically have small values of Θ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (by the [[Abbe sine condition]]), can have more blur in the image, owing to the broader PSF.  The size of the PSF is proportional to the [[magnification]], so that the blur is no worse in a relative sense, but it is definitely worse in an absolute sense.

In the figure above, illustrating the truncation of the incident spherical wave by the lens, we may note one very significant fact.  In order to measure the point spread function — or impulse response function — of the lens, we do not need a perfect point source that radiates a perfect spherical wave in all directions of space. This is because our lens has only a finite (angular) bandwidth, or finite intercept angle. Therefore, any angular bandwidth contained in the source, which extends past the edge angle of the lens (i.e., lies outside the bandwidth of the system), is essentially wasted source bandwidth because the lens can't intercept it in order to process it. As a result, a perfect point source is not required in order to measure a perfect point spread function. All we need is a light source which has at least as much angular bandwidth as the lens being tested (and of course, is uniform over that angular sector). In other words, we only require a point source which is produced by a convergent (uniform) spherical wave whose half angle is greater than the edge angle of the lens.

==History and methods==
The diffraction theory of point-spread functions was first studied by [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]] in the nineteenth century. He developed an expression for the point-spread function amplitude and intensity of a perfect instrument, free of aberrations (the so-called [[Airy disc]]). The theory of aberrated point-spread functions close to the optimum focal plane was studied by the Dutch physicists [[Frits Zernike]] and Nijboer in the 1930–40s. A central role in their analysis is played by [[Frits Zernike|Zernike's]] [[Zernike polynomials|circle polynomials]] that allow an efficient representation of the aberrations of any optical system with rotational symmetry. Recent analytic results have made it possible to extend Nijboer and Zernike's approach for point-spread function evaluation to a large volume around the optimum focal point. This extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory is instrumental in studying the imperfect imaging of three-dimensional objects in [[confocal microscopy]] or astronomy under non-ideal imaging conditions. The ENZ-theory has also been applied to the characterization of optical instruments with respect to their aberration by measuring the through-focus intensity distribution and solving an appropriate [[inverse problem]].

==The PSF in microscopy==
[[File:63x 1.4NA Confocal Point Spread Function 2+3D.png|thumb|An example of an experimentally derived point spread function from a confocal microscope using a 63x 1.4NA oil objective. It was generated using Huygens Professional deconvolution software. Shown are views in xz, xy, yz and a 3D representation.]]
In microscopy, experimental determination of PSF requires sub-resolution (point-like) radiating sources. [[Quantum dot]]s and [[fluorescent]] [[bead]]s are usually considered for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Light transmitted through minute holes in a thin layer of silver  vacuum or chemically deposited on a slide or cover-slip have also been used, as they are bright and do not photo-bleach.

Theoretical models as described above, on the other hand, allow the detailed calculation of the PSF for various imaging conditions. The most compact [[diffraction limited]] shape of the PSF is usually preferred. However, by using appropriate optical elements (e.g., a [[spatial light modulator]]) the shape of the PSF can be engineered towards different applications.

==The PSF in astronomy==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Hubble PSF with flawed optics.jpg|thumb|The point spread function of [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera|WFPC]] camera before corrections were applied to its optical system.]]

In [[observational astronomy]] the experimental determination of a PSF is often very straightforward due to the ample supply of point sources ([[star]]s or [[quasars]]). The form and source of the PSF may vary widely depending on the instrument and the context in which it is used.

For [[radio telescopes]] and [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction-limited]] space [[telescopes]] the dominant terms in the PSF may be inferred from the configuration of the aperture in the [[Fourier domain]].  In practice there may be multiple terms contributed by the various components in a complex optical system.  A complete description of the PSF will also include diffusion of light (or photo-electrons) in the detector, as well as [[Attitude control|tracking]] errors in the spacecraft or telescope.

For ground-based optical telescopes, atmospheric turbulence (known as [[astronomical seeing]]) dominates the contribution to the PSF. In high-resolution ground-based imaging, the PSF is often found to vary with position in the image (an effect called anisoplanatism). In ground-based [[adaptive optics]] systems the PSF is a combination of the aperture of the system with residual uncorrected atmospheric terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telescope-optics.net/diffraction_image.htm|title=POINT SPREAD FUNCTION (PSF)|website=www.telescope-optics.net|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The PSF in lithography==
[[File:Airy_spot_overlap.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Overlapped PSF peaks.''' When the peaks are as close as ~ 1 wavelength/NA, they are effectively merged. The FWHM is ~ 0.6 wavelength/NA at this point.]]
The PSF is also a fundamental limit to the conventional focused imaging of a hole,&lt;ref name=nat_res&gt;[http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/litho_tutor/TUTOR23%20(Fall%2098).pdf The Natural Resolution]&lt;/ref&gt; with the minimum printed size being in the range of 0.6-0.7 wavelength/NA, with NA being the [[numerical aperture]] of the imaging system. For example, in the case of an [[extreme ultraviolet lithography|EUV]] system with wavelength of 13.5 nm and NA=0.33, the minimum individual hole size that can be imaged is in the range of 25-29 nm. A [[phase-shift mask]] has 180-degree phase edges which allow finer resolution.&lt;ref name=nat_res/&gt;

==Point spread functions in ophthalmology==

Point spread functions have recently become a useful diagnostic tool in clinical [[ophthalmology]].  Patients are measured with a [[wavefront]] sensor, and special software calculates the PSF for that patient's eye.  In this manner a physician can "see" what the patient sees.{{dubious|This claim is misleading. Wavefront technology may help physicians better understand "some" characteristics of the image being formed on the patient's retina. However, after the image is formed on the retina it a vast amount of neural processing, both within the retina and also the brain, which arguably plays just as much a role in determining what the patient actually "sees" as the optical system of the eye does. This statement is not incorrect, but needs to be more qualified and measured|date=March 2018}} This method also allows a physician to simulate potential treatments on a patient, and see how those treatments would alter the patient's PSF.  Additionally, once measured the PSF can be minimized using an adaptive optics system.  This, in conjunction with a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and an adaptive optics system, can be used to visualize anatomical structures not otherwise visible ''in vivo'', such as cone photoreceptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roorda|first=Austin|last2=Romero-Borja|first2=Fernando|last3=Iii|first3=William J.

== Why PHE? ==

More than 1 billion people live in [[ecological hotspot]]s, many of which are remote areas of critically important [[biodiversity]] under intense pressure from human activity. Conservation work is usually located in these remote areas to protect the remaining biodiversity. In the developing world , the communities in these remote areas often suffer from ill health because of limited access to health services or [http://www.cfr.org/women/population-environment-connections/p24656 family planning]. These communities also tend to suffer from poor [[nutrition]], water supplies or [[sanitation]]. Inadequate [[health care]] in these communities is usually because of economic struggles. Livelihoods in the rural communities depend on natural resources and small-scale agriculture, which can force people to use natural resources unsustainably because of pressures such as rapid [[population growth]] or health issues. This can be damaging to [[ecosystem]]s and the biodiversity in these rural areas.

Conversely, people’s health relies on the [[Environmental health|health of their environment]]. Their surrounding ecosystem provides them with goods and services such as water, food, medicine, fuel wood, building materials, and other resources.  Damage or disruption of these natural goods and services can have severe consequences for [[human health]].

Projects that take the PHE approach work to create [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/issue-23-to-live-the-sea-reproductive-health-care-and-marine-conservation-madagascar healthier communities and ecosystems]. These projects aim to bring better health services to remote communities to improve participation in conservation efforts. PHE projects also promote family planning services to help slow population growth that can put pressure on [[natural resource]]s. That means PHE approaches strive to simultaneously improve access to health services while helping communities manage their natural resources in ways that improve their health and livelihood even as they protect the environment. Beyond this, the PHE approach also targets synergies between human health and [[ecosystem health]] by including a wide spectrum of development and conservation targets such as the sustainable management of natural resources, improving livelihoods, [[food security]] and nutrition, and by maintaining or restoring habitats and ecosystem functions.  By focusing on the [[synergy]] between communities and their environment, the PHE approach conserves biodiversity while at the same time improving environmental health conditions for the local people. PHE is effective at achieving a wide range of positive results over multiple sectors.

== History of PHE ==

In the late 1980s conservation organizations and practitioners began to realize the benefits of improving the [[quality of life]] for people by managing biodiversity and natural resources. These projects were initially called [[Integrated Conservation and Development Project|integrated conservation and development projects]] (ICDP) and addressed a wide variety of community development needs. At the end of the 1990s it was realized that ICDPs were not achieving conservation or development goals as successfully as anticipated. This was because the scope of ICDPs was often too broad. One of the lessons learned from ICDP attempts was that the success of the projects depended on the ability to focus on key interventions and avoid excessive complexity. From the lessons learned from early ICDPs the conservation sector gave birth to the PHE approach with a new generation of integrated projects.

[[Program designer]]s began to realize that efforts to conserve biological diversity (biodiversity) in developing countries was most successful in long-term indicators when local people perceived their efforts as serving their economic and cultural interests. This gave birth to the integrated development approach. To achieve success it was found that ICDPs had to consider the linkage between conservation and development objectives in every unique place that the project was implemented. The first step to determining the linkages is to consider where the conservation and [[economic development]] goals intersect. Development interventions should then be introduced where this intersection occurs.

One of the most important lessons learned from ICDPs in the last 20 years was the failure to equitably involve projected beneficiaries as partners in all phases of project implementation, from design through evaluation, has led to consistently disappointing project results. It must be recognized that local participants are not a homogenous group of community members but differ widely in terms of access and dependency of resources, economic positions and their sensitivity to [[environmental change]]s. These lessons learned from past ICDPs has led the design of the [[stakeholder analysis]] where individuals or groups vested in the project are identified and incorporated into all stages of project design and implementation.

Drawing on what was learned from ICDPs, the conservation sector piloted the PHE approach during the 1990s with the first generation of PHE integrated projects. Since then USAID (the [[United States Agency for International Development]]), the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], and the Summit Foundation have worked to strengthen the approach. The PHE approach has pushed on with the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) in mind. As the PHE approach advances it has demonstrated to have the kind of synergies needed to reach these goals.

==Past PHE Project Profiles==

'''Successful Communities from Ridge to Reef, Kenya:'''
This project was implemented in an area designated a [[UNESCO]] reserve in the [[Kiunga Marine National Reserve|Kiunga National Marine Reserve]]. The reserve has outstanding [[marine biodiversity]] of over 11,000 species, 60-70% of which are endemic to the [[Indo-Pacific]] Ocean. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) with funding from USAID, was able to provide communities that depend on the reserve’s resources access to family planning through a mobile clinic. Members of the community began to actively participate in conservation activities once they know WWF was willing to help them meet basic health needs.

'''Healthy Families, Health Forests, Cambodia:'''
When refugees from the [[Cambodia]]/[[Vietnam]] war in the 1970s returned to their homes they found their land had been destroyed through logging and agriculture. With USAID support, [[Conservation International]] helped the Khmer Daeum [[refugee]]s to replenish their land and supplied the refugees with their first-ever access to family planning. Healthy families were able to develop long-term plans for sustainable [[land use]] and local women created associations that mobilized the community to increase income earning opportunities and strengthen participation in conservation activities.

'''Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM), Philippines'''
Rapid population growth in the [[Philippines]] has led to [[deforestation]] and destruction of [[coral reef]]s. Only 3% of original forest cover remains and only 5% of coral reefs are intact and in pristine condition. This uncontrollable population growth, coupled with the depletion of coastal resources led to the development of the Integrated Population and Coastal Resource Management (IPOPCORM) project with support from USAID and PATH Foundation Philippines Inc. The IPOPCORM Project focuses on communities in the Philippines’ most endangered coastal reef areas and works to improve food security and livelihoods by promoting family planning and sustainable [[fisheries management]]. The program has earned strong support from local mayors and community members who have appreciated IPOPCORM’s focus on improving livelihoods.

'''Population and Resource Management in Madagascar'''
[[Africa]]’s greatest concentration of unique plant and animal species can be found in [[Madagascar]].  These species have been historically threatened by rapid population growth leading to deforestation. USAID/Madagascar planned for the development of an innovative population and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] program in the region that linked community-based [[natural resource management]] with interventions to improve [[family health]] and planning while allowing for better preservation of the island’s unique biodiversity. The program had worked with local communities in order to support family planning services, [[sustainable agriculture]], good governance, improved food production, alternative livelihoods, and [[environmental education]].

'''Community-Centered Conservation Efforts in Tanzania'''
The [[Jane Goodall Institute]], with funding from USAID/[[Tanzania]], constructed the TACARE project to eliminate [[poverty]] and support sustainable livelihoods, while alleviating the depletion of natural resources in the country. The community-based approach aimed to improve the livelihoods in Tanzanian communities while promoting conservation and an understanding of the need to preserve biodiversity. This approach provides family planning methods, information, and counseling by community volunteers that has resulted in a greater acceptance of family planning. With funding from USAID/Washington the TACARE approach is being replicated in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

'''Andean Highlands of Ecuador'''
A collaborative operations research effort by CEMOPLAF, [[World Neighbors]], and the [[University of Michigan]]’s Population-Environment Fellows Program was supported by USAID. The study showed quantified benefits of integrating family planning efforts and information with [[agriculture]] and natural resource management in the area.

"Conservation Through Public Health"
With funding from USAID, Conservation Through Public Health, a Ugandan-based NGO and US registered non-profit added family planning to its integrated One Health program promoting wildlife health and community-based health care to prevent zoonotic disease transmission between people, wildlife and livestock. CTPH has received recognition for having a model PHE program promoting gorilla conservation and community health and development in and around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, SW Uganda.

The '''Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union''', officially the ''Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union of Employees'', (QNMU) is a [[trade union]] that represents [[nurse]]s and [[midwives]] in both the public and private sectors of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It was formed on 8 November 1921 under the name of the ''Australasian Trained Nurses' Association (Queensland Branch) Union of Employees''. Its current incarnation began in 1982 when the union broke away from the ''Royal Australian Nursing Federation'', now known as the [[Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation]] (ANMF).

Before being known as the Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union, the union  went under the name of the Queensland Nurses' Union. This was changed in 2017. 

Before this the union was known as the ''Royal Australian Nursing Federation, Queensland Branch, Union of Employees''. This royal title was assumed, like other branches of the federation, in 1956 to mark the Queen's visit to Australia.

The QNMU is affiliated with the Queensland Council of Unions, and in the late 1980s signed a "harmonisation" agreement with the then ANF which recognised members of the then QNU as members of the Queensland Branch of the ANF. 

In September 2010 the union announced the end of its affiliation with the [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qnu.org.au/news/press-releases/current-releases/qnu-and-the-alp-affiliation-statement QNU and the ALP Affiliation statement (press release)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218012445/http://www.qnu.org.au/news/press-releases/current-releases/qnu-and-the-alp-affiliation-statement |date=18 February 2011 }}, 20 September 2010, QNU website.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rhabdomyoma''' is a [[benign]] [[tumor]] of [[striated muscle]]. Rhabdomyomas may be either "cardiac" or "extra cardiac" (occurring outside the heart). Extracardiac forms of rhabdomyoma are sub classified into three distinct types: adult type, fetal type, and genital type.&lt;!-- most people can count to three --&gt;

Cardiac rhabdomyomas are the most common primary tumor of the heart in infants and children. It has an association with [[tuberous sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid14615733"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bader RS, Chitayat D, Kelly E, etal |title=Fetal rhabdomyoma: prenatal diagnosis, clinical outcome, and incidence of associated tuberous sclerosis complex |journal=J.

It is most commonly associated with the [[tongue]],&lt;ref name="pmid11115314"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pérez-Alonso P, Sánchez-Simón R, Contreras F, Patrón-Romero M |title=Special feature: pathological case of the month.

[[Malignant]] skeletal muscle tumors are referred to as [[rhabdomyosarcoma]]. Only rare cases of possible malignant change have been reported in fetal rhabdomyoma. The differential diagnosis in the tongue includes [[ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith BC, Ellis GL, Meis-Kindblom JM, Williams SB |date=May 1995  |title=Ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor of the anterior tongue.

Rubella is usually [[airborne disease|spread through the air]] via coughs of people who are infected.&lt;ref name=Lambert15/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2014Rub&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubella (German Measles, Three-Day Measles)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/index.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=30 March 2015|date=December 17, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402175306/http://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/index.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Only humans are infected.&lt;ref name=Lambert15/&gt; Insects do not spread the disease.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Once recovered, people are immune to future infections.&lt;ref name=Lambert15/&gt; Testing is available that can verify immunity.&lt;ref name=Lambert15/&gt; Diagnosis is confirmed by finding the virus in the blood, throat, or urine.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt; Testing the blood for [[antibodies]] may also be useful.&lt;ref name=CDC2012Pink/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;

[[File:Rubella.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Generalized rash on the abdomen due to rubella]]

Rubella has symptoms that are similar to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical [[lymphadenopathy]]), [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[headache]], and [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name="pmid16022642"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Edlich RF, Winters KL, Long WB, Gubler KD |title=Rubella and congenital rubella (German measles)|journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants|volume=15|issue=3|pages=319–28|year=2005|pmid=16022642|doi= 10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.v15.i3.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swollen [[gland]]s or [[lymph nodes]] can persist for up to a week and the [[fever]] rarely rises above 38&amp;nbsp;°C (100.4&amp;nbsp;°F). The rash of German measles is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red [[papule]]s on the area of the [[soft palate]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kliegman, Waldo E. Nelson, Hal B. Jenson, Karen J. Marcdante, M.D., Richard E. Behrman. ''Nelson Essentials of Pediatrics'', page 467. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-4160-0159-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubella can affect anyone of any age. Adult women are particularly prone to arthritis and joint pains.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990065894|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Jameson, J.

In children rubella normally causes symptoms which last two days and include:&lt;ref name=Healthline /&gt;

===Congenital rubella syndrome===
{{main|Congenital rubella syndrome}}
[[File:Cataracts due to Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) PHIL 4284 lores.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Cataracts due to congenital rubella syndrome]]
Rubella can cause [[congenital rubella syndrome]] in the newborn, the most severe sequela of rubella. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory defects.&lt;ref name="pmid15259032"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Atreya CD, Mohan KV, Kulkarni S |title=Rubella virus and birth defects: molecular insights into the viral teratogenesis at the cellular level|journal=Birth Defects Res. Part a Clin. Mol. Teratol.|volume=70|issue=7|pages=431–7|year=2004|pmid=15259032|doi=10.1002/bdra.20045}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also cause prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. The risk of major defects or [[organogenesis]] is highest for infection in the [[Pregnancy#First trimester|first trimester]]. CRS is the main reason a vaccine for rubella was developed.&lt;ref name="pmid16580940"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=De Santis M, Cavaliere AF, Straface G, Caruso A |title=Rubella infection in pregnancy|journal=Reprod. Toxicol.|volume=21|issue=4|pages=390–8|year=2006|pmid=16580940|doi=10.1016/j.reprotox.2005.01.014|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0890-6238(05)00073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mothers who contract rubella within the first critical trimester either have a miscarriage or a stillborn baby. If the fetus survives the infection, it can be born with severe heart disorders ([[patent ductus arteriosus]] being the most common), blindness, deafness, or other life-threatening organ disorders. The skin manifestations are called "blueberry muffin lesions".&lt;ref name="pmid16580940"/&gt; For these reasons, rubella is included on the [[TORCH complex]] of perinatal infections.

About 100,000 cases of this condition occur each year.&lt;ref name=Lambert15/&gt;

==Cause==
{{main|Rubella virus}}
[[File:Rubella virus TEM B82-0203 lores.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Transmission electron micrograph of rubella viruses]]
The disease is caused by rubella virus, a [[togavirus]] that is enveloped and has a single-stranded RNA genome.&lt;ref name="pmid7817880"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frey TK|title=Molecular biology of rubella virus|journal=Adv. Virus Res.|volume=44|issue=|pages=69–160|year=1994|pmid=7817880|doi=10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60328-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the [[nasopharynx]] and [[lymph nodes]]. The virus is found in the blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. The virus has [[teratogenic]] properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them.&lt;ref name="pmid16022642"/&gt; During this incubation period, the patient is contagious typically for about one week before he/she develops a rash and for about one week thereafter.

Increased susceptibility to infection might be inherited as there is some indication that [[HLA-A1]] or factors surrounding A1 on [[HLA A1-B8 haplotype|extended haplotype]]s are involved in virus infection or non-resolution of the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid12463994"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forrest JM, Turnbull FM, Sholler GF, etal |title=Gregg's congenital rubella patients 60 years later |journal=Med.

==Diagnosis==
Rubella virus specific [[IgM]] antibodies are present in people recently infected by rubella virus, but these antibodies can persist for over a year, and a positive test result needs to be interpreted with caution.&lt;ref name="pmid17337363"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Best JM|title=Rubella|journal=Semin Fetal Neonatal Med|volume=12|issue=3|pages=182–92|year=2007|pmid=17337363|doi=10.1016/j.siny.2007.01.017|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1744-165X(07)00018-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these antibodies along with, or a short time after, the characteristic rash confirms the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="pmid12150751"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stegmann BJ, Carey JC |title=TORCH Infections.

==Prevention==
{{Further|MMR vaccine}}
Rubella infections are prevented by active [[immunisation]] programs using live attenuated virus [[vaccine]]s. Two live attenuated virus vaccines, RA 27/3 and Cendehill strains, were effective in the prevention of adult disease. However their use in prepubertal females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of CRS in the UK. Reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=SE|last2=Cutts|first2=FT|last3=Samuel|first3=R|last4=Diaz-Ortega|first4=JL|title=Control of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in developing countries, Part 2: Vaccination against rubella.|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=1997|volume=75|issue=1|pages=69–80|pmid=9141752|pmc=2486979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vaccine is now usually given as part of the [[MMR vaccine]]. The [[WHO]] recommends the first dose be given at 12 to 18 months of age with a second dose at 36 months. Pregnant women are usually tested for immunity to rubella early on. Women found to be susceptible are not vaccinated until after the baby is born because the vaccine contains live virus.&lt;ref name="pmid9639369"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Watson JC, Hadler SC, Dykewicz CA, Reef S, Phillips L|title=Measles, mumps, and rubella—vaccine use and strategies for elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome and control of mumps: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|journal=MMWR Recomm Rep|volume=47|issue=RR-8|pages=1–57|year=1998|pmid=9639369|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918215818/http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/MMWRhtml/00053391.htm|archivedate=2009-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Immunization (medicine)|immunisation]] program has been quite successful.

Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by [[serology]] is recommended in the United States for all women of childbearing age at their first [[preconception counseling]] visit to reduce incidence of [[congenital rubella syndrome]] (CRS).&lt;ref name=icsi2010&gt;[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care.

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for rubella; however, management is a matter of responding to symptoms to diminish discomfort. Treatment of newborn babies is focused on management of the complications. [[Congenital heart defects]] and [[cataracts]] can be corrected by direct surgery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17197734"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Khandekar R, Sudhan A, Jain BK, Shrivastav K, Sachan R|title=Pediatric cataract and surgery outcomes in Central India: a hospital based study|journal=Indian J Med Sci|volume=61|issue=1|pages=15–22|year=2007|pmid=17197734|doi=10.4103/0019-5359.29593|url=http://www.indianjmedsci.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5359;year=2007;volume=61;issue=1;spage=15;epage=22;aulast=Khandekar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030083826/http://www.indianjmedsci.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5359%3Byear%3D2007%3Bvolume%3D61%3Bissue%3D1%3Bspage%3D15%3Bepage%3D22%3Baulast%3DKhandekar|archivedate=2007-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management for ocular [[congenital rubella syndrome|congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)]] is similar to that for age-related [[macular degeneration]], including counseling, regular monitoring, and the provision of low vision devices, if required.&lt;ref name="pmid12365660"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Weisinger HS, Pesudovs K |title=Optical complications in congenital rubella syndrome|journal=Optometry|volume=73|issue=7|pages=418–24|year=2002|pmid=12365660|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Rubella infection of children and adults is usually mild, self-limiting and often asymptomatic. The prognosis in children born with CRS is poor.&lt;ref name="pmid3288422"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Freij BJ, South MA, Sever JL |title=Maternal rubella and the congenital rubella syndrome|journal=Clin Perinatol|volume=15|issue=2|pages=247–57|year=1988|pmid=3288422|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Rubella occurs worldwide. The virus tends to peak during the spring in countries with temperate climates. Before the vaccine against rubella was introduced in 1969, widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 6–9 years in the United States and 3–5 years in Europe, mostly affecting children in the 5-9 year old age group.&lt;ref name="pmid11798368"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reef SE, Frey TK, Theall K, et al. |title=The changing epidemiology of rubella in the 1990s: on the verge of elimination and new challenges for control and prevention|journal=JAMA|volume=287|issue=4|pages=464–72|year=2002|pmid=11798368|doi=10.1001/jama.287.4.464|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11798368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of vaccine, occurrences have become rare in those countries with high uptake rates.

In the UK, there remains a large population of men susceptible to rubella who have not been vaccinated. Outbreaks of rubella occurred amongst many young men in the UK in 1993 and in 1996 the infection was transmitted to pregnant women, many of whom were immigrants and were susceptible. Outbreaks still arise, usually in [[developing country|developing countries]] where the vaccine is not as accessible.&lt;ref name="pmid16989272"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reef S|title=Rubella mass campaigns|journal=Curr.

==History==
{{see also|Eradication of infectious diseases#Rubella}}
Rubella was first described in the mid-eighteenth century.

In 1814, George de Maton first suggested that it be considered a disease distinct from both measles and [[scarlet fever]]. All these physicians were German, and the disease was known as Rötheln (contemporary German ''Röteln''), hence the common name of "German measles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Best |first=J.M. |last2=Cooray |first2=S. |last3=Banatvala |first3=J.E. |chapter=45.

He described a variety of problems now known as [[congenital rubella syndrome]] (CRS) and noticed that the earlier the mother was infected, the worse the damage was. Since no  vaccine was yet available, some popular magazines promoted the idea of "German measles parties" for infected children to spread the disease to other children (especially girls) to immunize them for life and protect them from later catching the disease when pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPWQCkzPYO8C&amp;pg=PA84 |page=84 |title=Dangerous Pregnancies: Mothers, Disabilities, and Abortion in Modern America |first=Leslie J. |last=Reagan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus was isolated in tissue culture in 1962 by two separate groups led by physicians Paul Douglas Parkman and [[Thomas Huckle Weller]].&lt;ref name=Lee2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=MoHNZ/&gt;

There was a pandemic of rubella between 1962 and 1965, starting in Europe and spreading to the United States.&lt;ref name=MoHNZ/&gt; In the years 1964–65, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases. This led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Of these, 2,100 died as neonates, 12,000 were deaf, 3,580 were blind, and 1,800 were mentally retarded. In New York alone, CRS affected 1% of all births.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Hanshaw, J.A.

In 1969 a live attenuated virus vaccine was licensed.&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt; In the early 1970s, a triple vaccine containing attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) viruses was introduced.&lt;ref name=MoHNZ/&gt;  By 2006, confirmed cases in the Americas had dropped below 3000 a year.  However, a 2007 outbreak in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile pushed the cases to 13,000 that year.&lt;ref name=eliminated/&gt;

On January 22, 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Pan American Health Organization]] declared and certified Colombia free of rubella and became the first Latin American country to eliminate the disease within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/vida-de-hoy/salud/colombia-libre-de-sarampion-y-rubeola_13396295-4|title=Colombia, libre de sarampión y rubéola - Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 - eltiempo.com|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202092818/http://www.eltiempo.com/vida-de-hoy/salud/colombia-libre-de-sarampion-y-rubeola_13396295-4|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/colombia-fue-declarada-libre-de-sarampion-y-rubeola-articulo-470243|title=Colombia fue declarada libre de sarampión y rubéola|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523025604/http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/colombia-fue-declarada-libre-de-sarampion-y-rubeola-articulo-470243|archivedate=2015-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, 2015, the Americas became the first WHO region to officially eradicate the disease. The last non-imported cases occurred in 2009 in Argentina and Brazil.

Rubella is still common in some regions of the world and Susan E. Reef, team lead for rubella at the C.D.C.’s global immunization division, who joined in the announcement, said there was no chance it would be eradicated worldwide before 2020.&lt;ref name=eliminated /&gt; Rubella is the third disease to be eliminated from the western hemisphere with vaccination after [[smallpox]] and [[poliomyelitis|polio]].&lt;ref name=eliminated/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAHO2015/&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''rubella'' is sometimes confused with ''rubeola'', an alternative name for [[measles]] in English-speaking countries; the diseases are unrelated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rubeola Merriam-Webster:Rubeola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421141306/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rubeola |date=2009-04-21 }} Accessed 2009-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=T. E. C.

A '''screen filter''' is a type of [filtration of water] using a rigid or flexible screen to separate [[sand]] and other fine particles out of water for [[irrigation]] or industrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=Joanne E. Drinan ; associate editor, Nancy E.|title=Water and Wastewater Treatment a Guide for the Nonengineering Professionals|date=2000|publisher=CRC Press|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781420031799|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2z24NRadPMkC&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are generally not recommended for filtering out organic matter such as [[algae]], since these types of contaminants can be extruded into [[spaghetti]]-like strings through the filter if enough pressure drop occurs across the filter surface.  Typical screen materials include [[stainless steel]] ([[mesh]]), [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]] and [[polyester]].

==Use==
Self-cleaning screen filters incorporate an automatic backwash cycle to overcome these limitations. Backwash cycles are far more frequent when compared to a media filter with similar capacity, and each backwash requires far less water to perform. Their ability to quickly remove contaminants from water before they leach their nutrients make such filters popular choices for recirculating aquaculture systems. They have also become popular in closed loop industrial systems such as cooling tower, heat exchanger, and other equipment protection applications. Similar devices with larger openings designed only to keep out large objects are called [[strainer]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Stainless-steel strainers are used in industrial, municipal, and [[irrigation]] applications, and can be designed for very high flow rates. When paired with a controller and flush valve, a strainer can be fully automated. Suspended particles collect on the inside of the screen, and the flush valve opens to expel the buildup. This eliminates the need for manual cleaning of the strainer element.

A '''surrogate decision maker''', also known as a [[health care proxy]] or as agents, is an [[advocate]] for incompetent [[patient]]s. If a patient is unable to make decisions for themselves about personal care, some agent must make decisions for them. If there is a durable [[power of attorney]] for health care, the agent appointed by that document is authorized to make health care decisions within the scope of authority granted by the document. If people have court-appointed guardians with authority to make health care decisions, the guardian is the authorized surrogate.&lt;ref name="Sabatino"&gt;{{cite web

| last        =Sabatino

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the 1991 Annual Meeting of the [[American Medical Association]], the AMA adopted the report of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs known as, "Decisions to Forgo Life-Sustaining Treatment for Incompetent Patients." The recommendations of the report were the basis for amendments to Opinion 2.20 known as, "Withholding or Withdrawing Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment." The report itself provides guidelines for [[physician]]s who may have to identify a surrogate decision maker, assist a surrogate ([[Agent (law)|proxy]]) in making decisions for [[Competence (law)|incompetent]] patients, and resolve conflicts that may arise between decision makers, or between the decision maker's choice and medically appropriate options. Since the first incorporation of these guidelines to the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, the council has deferred to Opinion 2.20 to address [[inquiries]] involving surrogate decision making, even though the guidelines presented in this Opinion refer only to decisions made near the end of life.

With continued discussion concerning health care preferences for all patients, including those who are incompetent, greater options have been made available to secure health care directives. The involvement of third parties in a patient's [[health]] becomes more likely in decisions that may occur in instances other than the end of life.

In addition, the council recognizes that there is a spectrum of decision-making capacity ranging from [[Maturity (psychological)|immaturity]], to [[mental illness]], to serious [[brain damage]], and that health care decisions often must be made for individuals with diminished decisional faculties over extended periods of time. The council offers the following report to expand on its previous guidelines and to identify features related to a meaningful and effective [[physician]]-proxy relationship.

The report begins by defining a number of terms related to health care directives before presenting theoretical frameworks used in making decisions for incompetent patients. It then provides a protocol for identifying a surrogate decision maker as well as guidance for physicians who may run into conflict either assisting the surrogate in coming to a decision or with the decision itself. Finally, the report offers guidelines for nurturing an effective [[physician]]-proxy relationship.&lt;ref name="Sabatino"/&gt;

A study was conducted aiming to describe physicians' experiences with surrogate communication and decision making for hospitalized adults. It was concluded that physician-surrogate decision making may be enhanced if patients discuss their preferences in advance and if physician contact with surrogate decision makers is facilitated.&lt;ref name=torke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torke|first=AM|author2=Siegler M, Abalos A, Moloney RM, Alexander GC|title=Physicians' Experience with Surrogate Decision Making for Hospitalized Adults|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=September 2009|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1023–1028|pmid=19633896|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-1065-y|pmc=2726893}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study by the same group of researchers was conducted exploring the degree to which physicians report reliance on patient preferences when making medical decisions for hospitalized patients lacking decisional capacity. Although a majority of physicians identified patient preferences as the most important general ethical guideline for surrogate decision-making, they relied on a variety of factors when making treatment decisions for a patient lacking decisional capacity.&lt;ref name=torke2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torke|first=AM|author2=Moloney R, Siegley M, Abalos A, Alexander GC|title=Physicians' views on the importance of patient preferences in surrogate decision-making|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=March 2010|volume=58|issue=3|pages=533–538|pmid=20158556|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02720.x|pmc=3513265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designating a surrogate decision maker==
The Patient Self-Determination Act guarantees a patient's right to formally designate a surrogate to make treatment decisions for the patient if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions. A surrogate decision-maker, or durable power of attorney for health care (DPA/HC), must be documented. A common form that is valid in 40 states is [[Five Wishes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         =http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/patient_self_determination_act.html
| title       =American Bar Association

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

When filing an [[advance directive]], an alternate health care agent should be identified. The surrogate decision maker must be a trusted individual that is able to make crucial decisions on behalf of the advance directive client. The advance directive should also indicate specific instructions for when a patient is incapacitated. Treatment options should be examined and discussed with a physician, [[lawyer|attorney]], and family members. Common instructions might include instruction surrounding the use of a [[feeding tube]]. The client's inclinations must be clearly written, and the health care agent should fully understand the instructions given as well as how to execute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

When drafting a [[health care proxy]], it is best to consult a [[physician]] and attorney. The forms are available through [[lawyers]], [[hospitals]], and websites dedicated to health care ethics. The proxy must identify the client and the client's agent, also including all contact information. The advance directive must state that the designated agent has authority to make health care decisions on the patient's behalf and what limitations, if any, are imposed on the agent's authority. The document should clearly state that the agent's [[authority]] begins only when the patent is unable to make health care decisions. When the document is finished, it must be signed and have been witnessed by two individuals who are not the agents, [[caregivers]], or relatives to the patient. The completed document should be signed by the witnesses and the client of the advance directive. The document should be given to the patent's physician, [[lawyer]], spouse/partner, and family. The advance directive should be reviewed regularly and reflect changes in the client's current marital situation (e.g. [[marriage]] or [[divorce]]). For the agent to view the medical records of the client, the client should sign a [[HIPAA]] (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) release form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Criteria for being a surrogate agent==
In the event that a surrogate decision maker has not been identified through either a medical power of attorney or a court-appointed legal guardian, such an agent is selected by [[medical personnel]].  A [[patient]] must meet a certain set of criteria prior to the legal selection of a health care surrogate agent.  The patient must have a disabling condition such as a mental illness or infirmity, an impairment in the ability to complete activities of [[Daily living skills|daily living]], [[cognitive impairment]], and a lack of any previously indicated alternative to [[guardianship]].  This person is chosen by either the [[attending physician]] or their advance practice [[nurse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume  = 25
| issue   = 3
| pages   = 339–353
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care surrogates are selected in the following order of priority:
#The client's guardian
#The client's spouse
#Any adult son or daughter of the client
#Either parent of the client
#Any adult [[Sibling|brother or sister]] of the client
#Any adult grandchild of the client, or an adult relative who has exhibited special care and concern, who has maintained close contact, and who is familiar with the patient's activities, health, and religious or moral beliefs
#A close friend of the client
#The client's guardian of the estate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url    = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2111&amp;ChapAct=755%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B40%2F&amp;ChapterID=60&amp;ChapterName=ESTATES&amp;ActName=Health+Care+Surroga

| title  = The 2009 Florida Statutes: Health Care Advance Directives
| author = The Florida Senate
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there are multiple candidates at the same level of priority in the hierarchal structure, it becomes their duty to reach an agreement in regard to decisions and care of the patient.  If such surrogate agents are unable to develop a consensus, the physician looks to the majority of agents in that category.&lt;ref name="Illinois General Assembly"&gt;Illinois General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

If an agent of greater [[hierarchy]] becomes available than the current identified agent, the person of higher precedence has priority.  If any agent becomes unavailable, the [[physician]] returns to the hierarchal structure to indicate the next candidate.&lt;ref name="Illinois General Assembly"/&gt;

A prime example of this would be [[Nancy Cruzan]]. This case has helped to establish some principles of surrogacy, such as using the person who best knows the patient rather than just the [[next of kin]].

===Controversial agents===
Any health care surrogate agent is granted the same rights in regard to access of medical information and decision-making as would the alert and competent patient.  These rights remain until such time as the client regains [[decisional capacity]], a guardian is appointed, or the patient's death occurs.  All health care surrogates are expected to follow the same set of standards: patient's known wishes, substituted judgments, and patient's best interests.&lt;ref name="Illinois General Assembly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following people are denied the ability to act as a health care surrogate:

# The client's treating health care provider
# An employee of the treating health care provider, unless that employee is a relation of the patient
# Owner, [[Management|operator]], or administrator of the patient's current health care facility
# An employee of an owner, operator, or administrator of the patient's current health care facility, unless that employee is a relation of the patient &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| first = Appalachian Legal Services
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and limitations of a surrogate==
A surrogate decision-maker must use the [[doctrine]] of substituted judgment in consenting to or refusing health care on behalf of an incompetent individual. All surrogates, whether appointed by the person, by default, or by the court, have an [[obligation]] to follow the expressed wishes of the adult person and to act in the person's best interests, taking into account the person's values if known.  If no advance directives are available, the proxy should use the principle of substituted judgment by considering what the patient would want in the given situation.  This may require further discussion with others who knew the patient prior to the current period of incapacity.&lt;ref name="Sabatino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         =http://www.wsha.org/page.cfm?ID=EOL-SurrogateDecisions
| title       =End of Life Care Manual
| first       =Washington State Hospital Association
| year        =2005
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, there is simply no information available about this patient's wishes and a "reasonable person" or [[best interest]] standard is applied by the hospital care team.  This standard is used when the patient's values are unknown.  The best interest's standard is the least preferred standard because surrogates use their own values to decide what is in the patient's best interests—which places a heavy burden on the surrogate.  The agent should not be given the power to make decisions against the patient's will, and does not take away the right to make decisions from the patient. This is no longer effective when the agent knows that the patient has died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Conflicts of interest==
A [[conflict of interest]] occurs when an individual or organization is involved in multiple interests, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation for an act in the other.  For example, a woman marries a wealthy man. In his final will, the man wants to leave his multi-million dollar estate to his wife. Soon after this occurs, the man becomes ill and falls into an unconscious [[persistent vegetative state]]. The wife believes that the care team should take her husband off [[life support]] and allow him to die. In this situation, the care team would have to take into account that a [[conflict of interest]] could be present. There are other examples of cases following the links listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Best interests standard===
The [[best interest]] standard is defined as the best possible outcome for patient in a given situation, the outcome that provides the most benefit to the patient. The values of the client must be taken into account. Religion, any beliefs related to life and death. What are the patient's best interests? Some best interests in order of their standards include life at any cost, freedom from pain, [[rationality]], and [[dignity]]. It is all in what the patient chooses to be of utmost importance to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Bioethics: A Reader with Cases|author=Pierce, J., Randels, G. |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=0-19-531382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws related to surrogacy in the US==
To decide for themselves, the patient must be competent to decide. This means that the patient must be [[conscious]] and able to choose the option they feel is best for their [[health]] and well-being. This must be fulfilled first under any circumstance. However, there are some exceptions. Some states have passed laws allowing incompetent patients with certified [[mental illness]] to speak for themselves regarding decision-making. [http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/sections.cfm?Title=18&amp;Chapter=231]

===Current status of the law===
Adults that are considered [[Competence (law)|competent]] have the right to refuse treatment. As stated above, some states allow incompetent adults to refuse treatment. There can also be recommended termination of medical treatment for incompetent adults by a physician. Two tests for competency are the substituted judgment test and the best interests test.

Current statutory solutions include living wills or [[advance directives]] that explain the patient's wishes in certain medical situations. A durable [[power of attorney]] for health care (DPA/HC) and is another way of identifying a patient's final wishes through an attorney. The patient self-determination act states that hospitals and health care facilities must provide information about [[advance directives]] and DPA/HC. Also, a [[Agent (law)|proxy]] or surrogate decision-maker can provide these final wishes to the doctor or care team if a DPA/HC or AD is not present.

Some [[fictional]] assumptions underlying judicial decisions include the following misconceptions:{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

1. '''''It is better to make a mistake in favor of preserving the patient's [[life]].''''' This is an all too common misconception about surrogate decision-making, and another reason why it is so important to have a DPA/HC or AD. In most cases, patients wish to have a death free from pain, and wish to be only provided with comfort care during the remaining hours of their [[life]].

2. '''''The state has an interest in preserving [[life]].''''' Although [[euthanasia]] is illegal in the US, Physician [[assisted suicide]] has been passed in some states.

3. '''''Most people want to be kept "alive" by [[machines]].''''' Most people don't want to drain their family's funds to keep them alive especially when they are in a [[persistent vegetative state]] with no possible chance for [[Healing|recovery]]. In these cases, it is often weighing the risks and benefits of keeping the patient breathing, when they are clearly not living their life to its full potential.

4. '''''There is no harm in postponing the decision.''''' Often postponing the decision to keep a person on [[life support]] drains [[resources]] and funds.

5. '''''[[Youth]] withdraw medical treatment from the elderly.''''' Usually the next of [[Kinship|kin]] to the elderly are younger, and know what the best interests of the elderly are and have discussed. Although at times it is difficult to explain the wishes of the patient to the [[physician]] or care team when the [[Agent (law)|proxy]] disagrees with the patient they are representing.

6. '''''The [[family]] may terminate medical treatment for financial reasons.'''''It is difficult for a family member to see another family member suffer from illness or in pain, which is often why family members refrain from life support or a [[feeding tube]].

7. '''''Removal of life-sustaining treatment is a step toward [[euthanasia]].''''' [[Euthanasia]] and sustaining from treatment are completely different aspects of death. [[Euthanasia]] is usually taking an active approach to the death of a patient while removing treatment simply allows the patient to die from their illness while providing them comfort care.

8. '''''The religious oppose termination of life-sustaining treatment.''''' Freedom from pain and comfort care is most often the humane way and accepted by most all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|Prior to 1960||Pre-Revolution era. Health services and facilities are concentrated in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. William Keck, Gail A. Reed |date= |title=The Curious Case of Cuba |journal= Am J Public Health|publisher= |volume= 102|issue= |pages= e13–22|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300822 |pmc=3464859 |pmid= 22698011 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provision of medical supplies is heavily dependent on imports from other countries, mostly the U.S. Private sector healthcare is primarily for the wealthy. A poorly funded and staffed public sector responds for the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="Whiteford-Branch"&gt;Primary Health Care in Cuba, The Other Revolution, by Linda M. Whiteford and Laurence G. Branch&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|1960s||Soon after the revolution, [[universal healthcare]] is adopted and becomes a priority of state planning. U.S. government imposes embargo against Cuba, which would lead to an increase in disease and infant mortality during this decade.&lt;ref name="bethell"&gt;Dominguez, Jorge (1993), "Cuba since 1959", in Bethell, Leslie (ed., 1993), ''Cuba: a short history'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately half the physicians in Cuba emigrate.&lt;ref name=healthcare-in-the-nineties/&gt;
|-
|1970s||The polyclinic model of primary care is reinforced and expanded, focusing on health education, prevention and environmental monitoring. The number of medical graduates increase, thus enlarging the [[Cuban medical internationalism]] program.&lt;ref name=healthcare-in-the-nineties/&gt;  
|-
|1980s||Cuban healthcare system consolidates. Primary care is given impetus with the introduction of the [[Cuba's Family Doctor-and-Nurse Program|Family Doctor-and-Nurse Program]]. Biotechnology industry takes off.&lt;ref name=healthcare-in-the-nineties/&gt;
|-
|1990s||Post Soviet era, starts with Cuba's [[Special Period]] of socioeconomic collapse, due to loss of funding from the dissolved U.S.S.R. Cuba starts to accept U.S. donations of food, medicines and cash. At the same time, U.S. embargo tightens.&lt;ref name="cmaj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2474886|title=Health consequences of Cuba's Special Period|publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases rise while infant mortality continues to decline.&lt;ref name=healthcare-in-the-nineties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicc.org/resources/documents/embargo/Chapter%20Two.pdf|title=Cuban healthcare in the nineties}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|2000s–present|| Cuba's health indices rank extraordinarily at a developed country level, considering that Cuba is a country of poor resources and economic underdevelopment. Cuba also boasts one of the highest physician-per-inhabitant ratios in the world, though massive deployment of doctors on foreign missions can leave gaps in the country's domestic primary healthcare programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1129995/Health_and_Health_Care_Revolutionary_Period_Cuba_|title=Health and Health Care: Revolutionary Period (Cuba)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical tourism is also a thriving and growing industry today in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html Commentary: A Novel Tourism Concept] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=2010-01-28 }} Caribbean Net News&lt;/ref&gt; So far, it is widely believed that medical workers are Cuba's most important export commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Affairs July/August 2010. page 69&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba also successfully exports many medical products, such as [[vaccines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm Cuba sells its medical expertise] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tohunga Suppression Act 1907''' was an Act of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] aimed at replacing [[tohunga]] as traditional Māori healers with "modern" medicine.

It was introduced by [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]] who expressed "impatience with what he considered regressive Maori attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Carroll| url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2c10/carroll-james| website=The Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials had been concerned for years about the sometimes dangerous practices of tohunga.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Archives New Zealand file ACGS 16211 J1	506/r 1893/1233, 'Hare Matenga, Hariru,Te Ahuahu Date: 9 August 1893 Subject: Regarding treatment of sick natives by Maori Tohunga'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TT18930809.2.17&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-06-1893---1893--50--1--on--0tohunga-ARTICLE- "The Maori superstition in the north"] Tuapeka Times, 9 Aug 1893, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have claimed&lt;ref&gt;Raeburn Lange et al, cited in [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40111392 "Pruned of its dangers: The Tohunga Suppression Act 1907"],    by Derek A Dow, Health and history vol 3 no. 1, Maori Health (2001) pp. 41-64&lt;/ref&gt; that the Act was introduced to target [[Māori people|Māori]] prophet, faith healer and land rights activist [[Rua Kenana]], but it was never used against him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rongoa-medicinal-use-of-plants/5 "Rongoā – medicinal use of plants"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act==
The Act contained only four clauses, the first of which simply gave the short title. The second clause stated that "Every person who gathers Maoris around him by practising on their superstition or credulity, or who misleads or attempts to mislead any Maori by professing or pretending to possess supernatural powers in the treatment or cure of any disease, or in the foretelling of future events, or otherwise" was liable for prosecution. The first offence could be subject to a fine of up to 25 pounds or up to six months imprisonment. Subsequent offences could lead to a prison term of up to a year. However, no prosecution under the Act could be commenced without the consent of the [[Minister of Native Affairs]].

The third section enabled the [[Governor of New Zealand]] to gazette regulations to enable the intention of the Act to be carried out. The fourth section repealed subsection 5 of section 16 of the [[Maori Councils Act]], which allowed Maori Councils to license tohunga.

==Background==

Parliament debated the Act. Members portrayed traditional practices in curing smallpox (and other introduced diseases) as ineffectual and sometimes dangerous. This led to characterisations of some tohunga as "charlatans" exploiting their fellow Māori.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroa, Te Rangi [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BucMedi-t1-body-d3-d11.html "Medicine amongst the Maoris, in ancient and modern times"], 1910, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Āpirana Ngata]] supported the Bill, though he said that current tohunga were a bastardized version of the traditional healer. Speakers in favour of the Act referred to "Second-class Tohunga", who did not possess traditional knowledge or authority and just preyed on the superstition of local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rongoa - medicinal use of plants | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rongoa-medicinal-use-of-plants/page-5 | website=The Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that tohunga provided the only medical care available in many districts, and said that the Government would never be able to suppress tohunga unless they could provide a substitute. [[Hone Heke Ngapua]], member of Parliament and great- nephew of the famous Hone Heke, thought that the Bill went in the right direction, but did not go far enough as there was no provision for prosecution of [[Pākehā]] tohunga or ‘quacks’&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19070720.2.61&amp;cl=search Evening Post, 20 July 1907, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; (this omission was addressed by the [[Quackery Prevention Act, 1908]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/qpa19088ev1908n247335/qpa19088ev1908n247335.html |title= Quackery Prevention Act, 1908 |publisher= New Zealand Law online |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

Tohunga were the holders of knowledge of most rites, and knowledge in general in [[wānanga]]. This included health matters, or rongoā, as tohunga were experts in the use of medicinal plants and herbs. European settlers noted the good health and fitness of Māori when they arrived but the diseases that arrived with them were impervious to traditional healing practices. The perceived loss of power of the tohunga, along with the missionary preachings, led many Māori to accept the new religion of the Pākehā in what was to become yet another destabilising factor to the traditional Māori lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Murdoch|title=Maori Healing and Herbal|year=1994|publisher=Viking Sevenseas N.Z. Ltd|location=Paraparaumu, New Zealand|isbn=0-85467-095-5|pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many tohunga declined to pass on their oral traditions leaving Māori bereft of much of their traditional base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/handle/10292/4469 |title=Nga Maumahara: Memory Loss |work=AUT University |year=2011 |accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the overt intentions, there was a paradigm of the time amongst colonial administrators and the general non-Māori populace that Māori were a "lost race", the effect of banning the practices of spiritual and cultural leaders was that it hastened assimilation.

The Act was repealed by the Maori Welfare Act, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1962/0133/latest/whole.html |title=Maori Community Development Act 1962 No 133 (as at 07 July 2010), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tripler Army Medical Center''' is the headquarters of the Pacific Regional Medical Command of the armed forces administered by the [[United States Army]] in the [[Hawaii|state of Hawaii]].  It is the largest military hospital in the [[Asia]]n and [[Pacific Rim]] region and serves a military sphere of jurisdiction that spans over 52% of the Earth's surface.  Located on the slopes of Moanalua Ridge overlooking the [[Honolulu]] neighborhoods of [[Moanalua]] and [[Salt Lake, Hawaii|Salt Lake]], Tripler Army Medical Center's massive coral pink structure can be seen from any point in the [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu District]].

==Establishment==
Tripler Hospital was established in 1907, housed in several wooden structures within [[Fort Shafter]] on the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]].  In 1920 it was named after a legendary [[American Civil War]] medic, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Charles Stuart Tripler]] (1806-1866), who made significant contributions to the development of military medicine.

Tripler Army Medical Center was commissioned by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. General]] [[Robert C. Richardson Jr.]], who was [[Governor|Military Governor]] of the [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i]] during World War II. General Richardson hired the [[New York City]] based architectural firm of [[York &amp; Sawyer]] to design the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] medical complex. The noted local landscape architect [[Robert O. Thompson]] designed the landscape to work in concert with the Modernist architecture to create a "place of solace" for US military soldiers to recuperate both emotionally and physically. At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Tripler Army Medical Center had a 450-bed capacity which then expanded to 1,000 beds through the addition of barracks-type buildings. Plans for the new Tripler Army Medical Center on Moanalua Ridge were drawn in 1942 and construction was completed in 1948.  It was officially dedicated on September 10, 1948.

==Coral pink==
According to the contract documents from 1944, the signature [[Coral (color)#Coral pink|coral pink]] color of Tripler Army Medical Center was a personal choice of General Richardson, who borrowed the color and many other design elements of the complex from the [[Royal Hawaiian Hotel]] in [[Waikiki|Waikīkī]]. The Royal Hawaiian was one of the primary recreational sites for US military personnel during [[World War II]] and was also a design of the landscape architect, Robert O. Thompson. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

According to Tripler spokeswoman Margaret Tippy, an alternate reason for the pink paint job was supplied by retired Col. Robert B. "Woody" Wood, who was the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] area engineer when Tripler was built, and Sophie Frandsen, who had been the secretary to the chief architect of Tripler.

The architect came into Wood's office one day and said it was time to select the color for the hospital. Wood said he looked out his window at the red dirt on the then-undeveloped Moanalua Ridge and said, "You've got to get it as close to that color as you can because that's the color it will be when you're through."

==United Nations==
Tripler Army Medical Center is home to the [[Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance]].  The Center for Excellence works with the [[United States Pacific Command]], [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i at Mānoa]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and Pacific Regional Medical Command for research, education and training.

[[United Nations]] Department of Peacekeeping Operations has designated the Center for Excellence as a ''Peace Operations Institute'', the only United Nations designated ''Peace Operations Institute'' currently in the United States.  The Center for Excellence engages in the training of peace operations skills to United States and foreign military personnel assigned to peacekeeping duties for the United Nations.

'''Trophallaxis''' ({{IPAc-en|,|t|r|oʊ|f|ə|'|l|æ|k|s|ɪ|s|}}) is the transfer of food or other fluids among members of a [[community]] through mouth-to-mouth ([[stomodeum|stomodeal]]) or anus-to-mouth ([[proctodeum|proctodeal]]) feeding.  Along with nutrients, trophallaxis can involve the transfer of molecules such as pheromones, organisms such as [[Symbiosis|symbionts]], and information to serve as a form of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E.|first=Suárez, Mark|last2=L.|first2=Thorne, Barbara|date=2000-01-01|title=Rate, Amount, and Distribution Pattern of Alimentary Fluid Transfer via Trophallaxis in Three Species of Termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae, Termopsidae)|url=https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article-abstract/93/1/145/23789?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|language=en|volume=93|issue=1|doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2000)093[0145:RAADPO]2.0.CO;2|issn=0013-8746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trophallaxis is most highly developed in [[social insect]]s such as [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s, [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s.

== Etymology ==
Tropho- (prefix or suffix) is derived from the Greek trophé, meaning 'nourishment'. The Greek 'allaxis' means 'exchange'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/trophallaxis|title=trophallaxis {{!}} Definition of trophallaxis in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was introduced by the entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wheeler |first=W.

In termites,&lt;ref name="Kitade 2004 215–220"/&gt; proctodeal trophallaxis is crucial for replacing the gut [[endosymbionts]] that are lost after every molt. Gut symbionts are also transferred by anal trophallaxis in wood-eating termites and cockroaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klass|first=Klaus-Dieter|last2=Nalepa|first2=Christine|last3=Lo|first3=Nathan|date=March 2008|title=Wood-feeding cockroaches as models for termite evolution (Insecta: Dictyoptera): Cryptocercus vs. Parasphaeria boleiriana|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=46|issue=3|pages=809–817|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2007.11.028|issn=1055-7903|pmid=18226554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer of gut symbionts in these species is essential to digest wood as their food source. [[Carpenter ant]]s transfer immunity through trophallaxis by the direct transfer of antimicrobial substances, increasing disease resistance and social immunity of the colony.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Honey bee foragers use trophallaxis in associative learning to form long-term olfactory memories, in order to teach nest mates foraging behaviour and where to search for food.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Vertebrates ==
[[File:Pygoscelis antarctica feeding a chick.jpg|thumb|Food sharing between parent and chick ''Pygoscelis antarctica'' penguins.]]
[[Vertebrate]]s such as some bird species, [[Gray wolf#Reproduction and development|gray wolves]], and [[vampire bat]]s also feed their young through reguritation of food as a form of trophallaxis. Food sharing in vertebrates is a form of reciprocity demonstrated by many social vertebrates.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Gerald|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Gerald|date=2013-11-01|title=Does food sharing in vampire bats demonstrate reciprocity? |journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology|volume=6|issue=6|doi=10.4161/cib.25783 |pmc=3913674|pmid=24505498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds regurgitate food and directly transfer it into the mouths of their offspring as a part of parental care, such as the "crop milk" that is transferred by mother ring doves into the mouths of their young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrman|first=Daniel S.|date=1955-01-01|title=The Physiological Basis of Parental Feeding Behavior in the Ring Dove (Streptopelia Risoria)|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853955x00094|journal=Behaviour|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=241–285|doi=10.1163/156853955X00094|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cuckoo brood parasite is another bird species that engages in trophallaxis. The cuckoo bird uses mimicry, such as mimicking the egg shell colours and patterns of the host's eggs, to place their young in the nest of host species where they will be fed and reared at no expense to the cuckoo mother.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The cuckoo young can often mimic the begging call of an entire nest of the host species' young and have evolved intensely coloured gaits; both of which act as [[Supernormal stimulus|supernormal stimuli]], inducing the host bird to deliver food to them over their own young via trophallaxis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''WorkSafe Victoria''' is the trading name of the '''Victorian WorkCover Authority''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABN Lookup - Historical details for ABN: 90 296 467 627|url=http://www.abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbnHistory.aspx?abn=90296467627|publisher=business.gov.au|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au|title=WorkSafe Victoria web site|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a statutory authority of the state government of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

After being renamed in 2014 as Victorian Workcover Authority - its official name - by then Minister Gordon Rich-Phillips, it returned to the WorkSafe trading name after the election of the Labor Government in November 2014. Previous to this it has had a number of different names including VWA, WorkCare and the Department of Labour. The name WorkSafe became the trading name for the workplace health and safety and workers compensation divisions in mid-2008 as it reflected its objective of encouraging people to work safely and reduce the personal and commercial effect of workplace injuries.

The organisation reports to a Minister, Robin Scott (since November 2014) and has a [http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/about-vwa/about-vwa/board Board of Management] (Chairperson Paul Barker. Previously, John Walter - acting since his predecessor, David Krasnostein, resigned in March 2015 along with CEO Denise Cosgrove who had only [http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/about-vwa/about-vwa/board joined the organisation in 2012.]) The Chief Executive is Clare Amies.

A [http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/review-of-worksafe-and-the-tac review] of WorkSafe and the [[Geelong]]-based [[Transport Accident Commission]] was announced in February 2015 by the Victorian Government. It is being carried out by a former WorkSafe and TAC Chair, businessman James MacKenzie. In announcing the review, the government confirmed its commitment to moving WorkSafe to Geelong. From July 2018, WorkSafe's headquarters will be 1 Malop Street Geelong.

'''Sudden departure'''
Mr Krasnostein and [http://www.worksafenews.com.au/component/k2/item/265-worksafe-victoria-appoints-new-chief-executive.html Ms Cosgrove] were appointed by the previous Liberal Government and were charged with the responsibility of restructuring the organisation. This led to substantial job losses which resulted in the loss of many senior managers and experienced staff. Ms Cosgrove announced the start of the restructure program in June 2012 after the Queens Birthday long weekend in an email to staff which describes how she had had a pleasant weekend at the spa town of [http://www.travelvictoria.com.au/daylesford/ Daylesford] in regional Victoria and that job losses would be the product of restructuring that would begin immediately. It took some weeks for the [http://www.afr.com/p/national/daylesford_great_oh_and_we_re_making_RPNT3l3MQhzbOeH8hHoY6O story to be reported.] Their sudden resignations on 3 March 2015 were announced in a State Government [http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/labor-government-acts-to-restore-public-confidence news release] were said to have been due to the loss of confidence in WorkSafe's leadership and the handling of chemical contamination of the soil and a cancer cluster at the [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-03/new-health-scare-closes-fiskville-fire-training-facility/6275866 Country Fire Authority's Fiskville training facility] near Ballarat, however there had been a number of other senior officials who had also resigned since the government's election including Country Fire Authority [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-09/cfa-chief-executive-mick-bourke-stands-down/6081096 CEO Mick Bourke], and the [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-05/ambulance-victoria-board-resigns-after-daniel-andrews-request/5946838 board of Ambulance Victoria].  
In an unusual move after the resignations of Ms Cosgrove and Mr Krasnostein, Minister Robin Scott spoke to staff at WorkSafe's headquarters and re-affirmed the government's support for WorkSafe's health and safety priorities which was widely seen as having been undermined under by the previous government.

'''Corporate objectives'''
WorkSafe's corporate aims are to take a constructive, accountable, transparent, effective and caring approach to all its operations.&lt;ref name="vmv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/wsinternet/WorkSafe/SiteTools/About+WorkSafe/About+WorkSafe/Vision%2C+mission+and+values/Vision+mission+and+values|title=Vision, Mission, and Values - worksafe.gov.au|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is active in carrying out workplace safety inspections across the state and prosecuting breaches of workplace health, safety and workers compensation laws, a significant focus of WorkSafe's activity includes communication with internal and external stakeholders, media (including publishing details of significant incidents and prosecutions)and the wider community.

WorkSafe runs advertising and social media campaigns, an annual small/medium business road show (May–June) and events such as Work Safe Week (last week of October each year), farming sector field days and conferences  where speakers from WorkSafe present information on general and specialist topics.

'''Workplace health and safety'''
WorkSafe employs safety inspectors based at 12 offices in Melbourne (City, Dandenong, Essendon Fields, Mulgrave) and regional Victoria (Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Mildura, Shepparton, Traralgon, Wangaratta and Warrnambool) and conduct targeted visits based on identified high-risk industries and in response to calls where dangers are identifeid. There is also a 24/7 emergency response service.

'''Workers compensation and return to work'''

WorkSafe oversees Victoria's workers compensation system which provides financial as well as health and related support to people who have been hurt in the course of their work. The system is funded by Victorian employers who pay a percentage of their total remuneration which provides the insurance cover. In 2011 with increases to the average premium rates in other jurisdictions, the Victoria premium became Australia's lowest at 1.338%.

With the Victorian state budget in May 2012, this position was further reinforced for 2012-13 (June to June) with a further reduction to 1.229%. The amount paid by individual employers varies depending on their personal claims performance and that of their industry - i.e. a 'good' performing employer in an industry with many claims may pay rather less than others, while conversely a poorly performing employer will pay more. Around 29,000 people a year make a workers compensation claim (10.58/1000 employees in Victoria in 2010/11).

WorkSafe promotes to employers, injured workers and the people who treat them, the idea of an early and sustainable return to work. This helps keep business and premium costs down and benefits injured workers. Where it is not possible for a worker to return to their old workplace, WorkSafe's support program, WISE, which encourages other employers to step in and take advantage of their skills.

'''Legislation and regulation'''
 
WorkSafe is regulator of a wide range of Acts of Parliament including the Accident Compensation Act 1985; Accident Compensation (Occupational Health and Safety) Act 1996; 
Accident Compensation (WorkCover Insurance) Act 1993; Workers Compensation Act 1958; 
Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985; Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004;
Dangerous Goods Act 1985; Equipment (Public Safety) Act 1994; Road Transport (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995; Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 (Commonwealth) 
Mines Act 1958.

Regulations set out mandatory requirements under the Acts and are linked to copies held at Victorian Law Today.

== Occupational Health and Safety Act ==
The Occupational Health and Safety Act was enacted in 1985 as a major reform of the Labor government of [[John Cain II]].

The Act was reviewed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/CA25713E0002EF43/WebObj/MaxwellReport_06Apr04/$File/MaxwellReport_06Apr04.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2011|title=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Chris Maxwell (jurist)|Chris Maxwell]] QC (Queens Counsel) now a Judge of the Court of Appeal becoming the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004.&lt;ref name="vlta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/95c43dd4eac71a68ca256dde00056e7b/e9579446a7787f37ca25728900169aab!OpenDocument|title=Victorian Law Today Act|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'new' Act broadly reflected the requirements of the OHS Act 1985.

The most basic of duties requires employers to provide a safe workplace for employees  and people other than employees (Sections 23and 24).

The 2004 Act greatly increased potential fines from a maximum of $250,000 to more than $900,000. The highest fine yet was imposed in August 2008 when the brewer, Fosters was convicted and fined $1.125 million for two breaches of the Act.&lt;ref name="fffwd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/fosters-fined-for-workplace-death-20080805-3qjd.html|title=Foster's fined for workplace death - The Age|accessdate=8 April 2011 | location=Melbourne|date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of alternate penalties have also been introduced and are sought in some cases. These include adverse publicity orders (Section 135), safety improvement projects (Section 136), and enforceable undertakings (Section 137).

The Duties of Directors and company officers (Section 144) have also been included  along with  new  powers to  obtain information (Section 9), the creation of ARREOs (Authorised Representatives of Employee Associations)(Sections 87-94), a duty to consult on matters affecting health and safety(Sections 35 and 36) and a significant change which allow for the internal review of inspectors decisions (Sections 127 to 129).
