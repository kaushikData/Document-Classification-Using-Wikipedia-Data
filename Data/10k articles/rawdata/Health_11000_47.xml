Acesur was founded in 1840 and nowadays, more than 600 employees are distributed among its main facilities in [[Dos Hermanas]], [[La Roda de Andalucia]] ([[Sevilla]]), [[Tarancón]] ([[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]]), [[Madrid]], Mora de Toledo ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]), [[Vilches, Spain|Vilches]], Puente del Obispo and [[Jabalquinto]] ([[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]]).

Despite the more than 20 brands Acesur offers to fit in each and every market, the star ones are “La Española” and “Coosur”. Acesur also created its own division of [[renewable energies]], ENERSUR, with three main branches: [[Biomass]], Electric Cogeneration and [[biodiesel]]. In 2010, the President of the company endowed Acesur with the Juan Ramón Guillen Foundation as part of the company’s strategies in terms of [[social responsibility]]. This foundation focuses on the promotion and boosting of the rural environment and particularly, of the olive fields. The Foundation’s main aim is to declare the olive field as a heritage of humanity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10724">'''Agricultural communication''' (or agricultural communications) is a field that focuses on communication about agriculture-related information among agricultural stakeholders and between agricultural and non-agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture is broadly defined in this discipline to include not only [[farming]], but also food, [[fiber]] (e.g., cotton), animals, rural issues, and [[natural resources]].&lt;ref&gt;Doerfert, D. L. (Ed.) (2011). National research agenda: American Association for Agricultural Education’s research priority areas for 2011-2015. Lubbock, TX: Texas Tech University, Department of 
Agricultural Education and Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural communication is done formally and informally by [[agricultural extension]] and is considered related to [[science communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Treise, D., &amp; Weigold, M. F. (2002). Advancing science communication: A survey of science communicators. ''Science Communication, 23''(3), 310-322.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has evolved into its own professional field.

By definition, agricultural communicators are science communicators that deal exclusively with the diverse, applied science and business that is agriculture. An agricultural communicator is "expected to bring with him or her a level of specialized knowledge in the agricultural field that typically is not required of the mass communicator".&lt;ref&gt;Boone, K., Meisenbach, T., &amp; Tucker, M. (2000). ''Agricultural communications: Changes and challenges'', Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural communication also addresses all subject areas related to the complex enterprises of food, feed, fiber, renewable energy, natural resource management, rural development and others, locally to globally. Furthermore, it spans all participants, from scientists to consumers - and all stages of those enterprises, from agricultural research and production to processing, marketing, consumption, nutrition and health.

A growing market for agricultural journalists and broadcasters led to the establishment of agricultural journalism and agricultural communication academic disciplines.

The job market for agricultural communicators includes:
*Farm broadcasting
*Journalists and editors of agricultural/rural magazines and newspapers
*Communication specialist or [[public relations]] practitioner for agricultural commodity organizations, businesses, non-profits
*Sales representative for agricultural business
*Science journalist
*[[Land-grant university]] communication specialist
*Public relations or advertising for firms that specialize in or have agricultural clients

== History ==
The academic field originated from communication courses that taught students in the agricultural sciences how to communicate. Originally, agricultural journalists were needed to report farm news for a much larger agricultural and rural audience. As people moved from the farm to cities and suburbs, a much greater proportion of the population had less direct knowledge and experience regarding agriculture. While a need still exists for agricultural journalists, an equal, if not greater need exists for agricultural communicators who can act as liaisons between an industry with deeply rooted traditions and values and a public with little to no understanding of how agriculture operates and why it is the way it is.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J. (2008). Agricultural Communication Oral History Project. ''Agricultural Communications Documentation Center.'' http://www.library.illinois.edu/funkaces/acdc/oralhistory/podcasts.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002073631/http://www.library.illinois.edu/funkaces/acdc/oralhistory/podcasts.html |date=2012-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The key journal in the field is the Journal of Applied Communications.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Applied Communications. http://journalofappliedcommunications.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have focused on a variety of areas examining consumer attitudes toward agricultural products and practices including [[genetic engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;Irani, T., Sinclair, J., &amp; O'Malley. (2002). The Importance of Being Accountable The Relationship between Perceptions of Accountability, Knowledge, and Attitude toward Plant Genetic Engineering. ''Science Communication, 23''(3). {{doi|10.1177/107554700202300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetically modified food]],&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, C. A., &amp; Miller, J. D. (2007). Selected Consumers’ Evaluations of Genetically Modified Food Labels. ''Journal of Applied Communications, 91''(1-2).&lt;/ref&gt; natural and [[organic food]] and production,&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, K.

''Journal of Agriculture and Human Values'' [in press]. {{doi|10.1007/s10460-009-9234-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and food-related risks.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, M., Whaley, S., &amp; Sharp, J. (2006). Consumer perceptions of food-related risks. ''International Journal of Food Science and Technology, 41''(2), 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of research has been media coverage of agriculture and agricultural issues. Topics have included media coverage of [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease),&lt;ref&gt;Ruth, A., Eubanks, E., &amp; Telg, R. (2005). Framing of Mad Cow Media Coverage.

The Agricultural Communications Documentation Center,&lt;ref&gt;Agricultural Communications Documentation Center. http://www.library.illinois.edu/funkaces/acdc&lt;/ref&gt; maintained by the [[University of Illinois]], compiles research and articles related to agriculture and communications as well.

==Agricultural press and media==

There is a wide variety of [[:Category:Agricultural magazines|agricultural newspapers and magazines]] throughout the world. Radio programmes are frequently used for agricultural communication and [[Farm Radio International]] is a leading organization in providing programming to developing countries.

== Approaches to Agricultural Communication ==
Theoretically speaking, agricultural communication is an applied theoretical field. The academic curriculum and scholarly endeavors typically stay within the context of agriculture, natural resources, and occasionally, the life sciences. It examines communication and human dimension issues as they relate to a variety of issues in agriculture and natural resources. Agricultural journalism is not always differentiated from agricultural communications in research. One could argue that when research focuses on media coverage of agricultural issues or when it examines issues within agricultural journalism specifically (i.e., what influences editors of agriculture magazines to publish risk information), then it is more within the realm of agricultural journalism. Journalism is often seen as a subset of communication that is supposed to be fair and balanced like traditional journalism, whereas the broader field of agricultural communication could potentially be viewed as advocacy communication.

Agricultural communicators are expected to have a certain amount of knowledge and familiarity with agriculture. One could also add to that definition and say the communicator also brings with him or her an appreciation, or even affection, for the agriculture industry. While this is also probably true of agricultural journalists, they at least need to be cognizant of their potential bias to ensure they ask critical questions and present unbiased information. Agricultural journalists are trained like traditional journalists, but bring with them an understanding of agricultural systems and science either through experience and/or academic training.

'''Amastia''' refers to a condition where breast tissue, nipple, and areola is absent, either congenitally or iatrogenically. Amastia in girls can be treated with [[augmentation mammoplasty]].

Amastia differs from [[amazia]] (which involves only the absence of breast tissue; the nipple and areola remain present), although the two conditions are often (erroneously) thought to be identical. The terms "amastia" and "amazia" are thus often used interchangeably, even though the two conditions are medically different.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9972">'''Auditory arrhythmia''' is the inability to rhythmically perform music, to [[Meter (music)|keep time]], and to replicate musical or rhythmic patterns. It has been caused by damage to the [[cerebrum]] or rewiring of the brain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modelling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke|last = Wilson|first = Sarah J|date = 2002|journal = Neuropsychologia|doi = 10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00198-1|pmid = 11931954|last2 = Pressing|first2 = Jeffrey L|last3 = Wales|first3 = Roger J|volume=40|pages=1494–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
An individual with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining a steady beat, and even has difficulty following along to a steady rhythm. Before it was a known disorder, it was thought that these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in [[Schizophrenia]], [[Parkinson's]], and [[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder]] are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Arrhythmic Song Exposure Increases ZENK Expression in Auditory Cortical Areas and Nucleus Taeniae of the Adult Zebra Finch|date = September 26, 2014|journal = US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0108841|pmid = 25259620|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first = Brenton G.|pmc=4178233|volume=9|pages=e108841 | last1 = Lampen | first1 = J | last2 = Jones | first2 = K | last3 = McAuley | first3 = JD | last4 = Chang | first4 = SE | last5 = Wade | first5 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological bases of music ==
The [[cerebellum]] houses the center for fine motor skills. These are needed in order to play the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[temporal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]] are necessary for listening and recalling different musical aspects from lyrics, reading the music, and performing.

Memory centers are primarily located in the [[hippocampus]], and the process of listening to music originates there.

[[Neuroplasticity]] allows the brain to grow and change, especially in the [[Auditory cortex|auditory]] and [[motor cortex]]. Listening and playing music helps both of these areas of the brain to develop more, which was found to be correlated to having an improves auditory imagery in many performers in a study conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://brainworldmagazine.com/music-rhythm-and-the-brain-2/|title = Music, Rhythm and the Brain|date = March 7, 2011|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = Brain World|publisher = Brain World|last = Jun, M.D.|first = Passion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar diagnoses ==
Auditory arrhythmia can also be confused with something called [[beat deafness]]. Beat deafness is a form of congenital [[amusia]], which is a person's inability to move in time to the music, or feel a musical rhythm. It is believed by researchers that beat deafness stems from a connection problem between the brain's auditory cortex and inferior frontal lobe. A postdoctoral researcher with the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal studied a case where a man could not feel a rhythm in any sense. Not only did he have difficulty dancing, but he was unable to tap his foot or snap his fingers along with the beat of the music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major difference between beat deafness and auditory arrhythmia, however, is that beat deafness is most likely something you are born with, whereas the arrhythmia most likely comes from damage, which was the case in the research done on "Mathieu," the first known case of beat-deafness.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/03/15/6247114-cant-feel-the-rhythm-you-may-be-beat-deaf?lite|title = Can't feel the rhythm? You may be 'beat-deaf'|date = Mar 15, 2011|accessdate = February 19, 2015|website = The Body Odd|publisher = NBC News|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, a former musician known as H.J. suffered damage from a [[Temporoparietal junction|temporoparietal infarct]], which is an area of dead tissue due to lack of adequate blood supply. The infarct was believed to have been caused by a problem during a coronary angiography, which is a test to show the insides of an individual's coronary arteries. H.J. suffered difficulties with creating a steady beat, an inability to distinguish between different sets of rhythms, and also experienced difficulties when playing his instruments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Rhythmic problems in animals other than humans ==
Research was conducted on birds such as the Zebra Finch because this species has parallels to humans' vocal learning patterns and neurological structures. Adult zebra finches were placed in similar conditions, all exposed to nine rhythmic and nine arrhythmic songs for 30 second increments. After the stimulus was presented, the brains were studied for areas of high ZENK concentration, ZENK being an [[immunohistochemical]] used to detect neural activation. It was found in the finches that those exposed to the arrhythmic music had much higher levels of the ZENK gene, and it has been discovered that there is a correlation with humans having higher brain activity in these locations with arrhythmic functioning. Gaining an understanding of how to change the deficiencies in these animals can help lead to changes in the future for humans with auditory arrhythmia and other serious psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Auditory processing in those with autism ==
Those diagnosed with [[autism]] tend to have many difficulties processing auditory stimuli. For example, they most often endure language and speech delays, [[hyperacusis]], have difficulties communicating in large social groups, and may experience difficulties hearing certain voices in a noisy environment. These qualities make quality of life difficult, by inhibiting their ability to fully participate in social and educational circumstances in various parts of their lives. As shown in research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology, [[efferent pathways]] throughout the brain help to control various functions throughout the body. For example, in those with autism, pathways running through to the [[middle ear]] muscles make it difficult for the person to focus on a single voice when there is a lot of background noise. Raising eyelids was also found to hinder the [[stapedius]] muscle by tensing it, which in turn makes it difficult for these individuals to hear other talking when there is background noise present. The laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles located in the throat make [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] difficult to understand for people with autism. During research, tasks and tests were conducted to see if there is a correlation between [[cardiac rhythm]]s, [[respiratory sinus arrhythmias]], and [[auditory processing]], or auditory arrhythmia. Because these symptoms tend to go hand in hand, researchers were looking to see if there was a possibility of improving auditory processing. If researchers learn how to effectively improve auditory sensations in people diagnose with autism, then there is a possibility that they can then begin finding the improvement for those only suffering from auditory arrhythmia.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and auditory processing in autism: Modifiable deficits of an integrated social engagement system?|last = Porges|first = Stephen W.|date = November 29, 2012|journal = Psychophysiology of Relationships|doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2012.11.009|pmid = 23201146|last2 = Macellaio|first2 = Matthew|last3 = Stanfill|first3 = Shannon D.|last4 = McCue|first4 = Kimberly|last5 = Lewis|first5 = Gregory F.|last6 = Harden|first6 = Emily R.|last7 = Handelman|first7 = Mika|last8 = Denver|first8 = John|last9 = Bazhenova|first9 = Olga V.|pmc=3610863|volume=88|pages=261–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research ==
The Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago Therapeutic School and Center for Autism Research has conducted studies on auditory processing in individuals with autism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal has found that beat and tone deafness are likely genetic, and believe that it is because of a miswiring between the auditory cortex and inferior frontal cortex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They were also major researchers on Mathieu's case of beat deafness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands show that there is an association with an improves ability for auditory imagery and music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; McGill University also studied Mathieu's case, along with another individual known as Marjorie. The studies conducted show that true beat deafness is an extremely rare disorder, because out of all the individuals who applied thinking they were beat deaf, Marjorie and Mathieu were the only two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/11/12/why-some-people-just-cant-dance-or-clap-to-the-beat/|title = Why some people just can’t dance or clap to the beat|date = November 12, 2014|accessdate = February 21, 2015|website = The Washington Post|publisher = |last = Philip|first = Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.J.'s case has been studied in Victoria, Australia at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University. The data collected caused researchers to believe that the right temporal auditory cortex plays a large role in an individual's ability to maintain a steady rhythm, and has provided a platform for future [[neuropsychological]] research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

blu eCigs were used in a health study involving other [[list of electronic cigarette brands|e-cigarette brands]]. The study found that e-cigarette smoking and exposure to [[e-cigarette aerosol]] has risks of inducing gene-expression changes in bronchial airway epithelium ''[[in vitro]]'' although less severe than those of smoking [[analog cigarette]]s. It further found that these changes were more pronounced in products containing nicotine than those without nicotine.&lt;ref name=Moses&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfw198| issn = 1096-6080| volume = 155| issue = 1| pages = 248–257| last1 = Moses| first1 = Elizabeth| last2 = Wang| first2 = Teresa| last3 = Corbett| first3 = Sean| last4 = Jackson| first4 = George R.| last5 = Drizik| first5 = Eduard| last6 = Perdomo| first6 = Catalina| last7 = Perdomo| first7 = Claudia| last8 = Kleerup| first8 = Eric| last9 = Brooks| first9 = Daniel| last10 = O’Connor| first10 = George| last11 = Dubinett| first11 = Steven| last12 = Hayden| first12 = Patrick| last13 = Lenburg| first13 = Marc E.| last14 = Spira| first14 = Avrum| title = Molecular Impact of Electronic Cigarette Aerosol Exposure in Human Bronchial Epithelium| journal = Toxicological Sciences| accessdate = 2018-10-04| date = January 2017| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216655/| pmid = 27701119| pmc = 5216655 |quote=Importantly, we found that similar to TCIG smoke, ECIG aerosol exposure induces xenobiotic, oxidative, and additional stress pathways, and potentially impairs ciliated epithelium.

'''Bon Secours DePaul Medical Center''' is a historical, general medical and surgical hospital located in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and affiliated with [[Bon Secours Health System (USA)]].

==History==
Founded in 1855, as the Hospital of St. Vincent de Paul, Depaul was Norfolk's first civilian and [[public hospital]]. The hospital was originally located on Church and Wood St. in the [[downtown Norfolk]] in the home of the late Miss Ann Plume Behan Herron.&lt;ref name="Virginia Historical Marker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital St. Vicent De Paul Marker , KN-1|url=http://www.markerhistory.com/hospital-of-saint-vincent-depaul-marker-kn-1/|work=MarkerHistory.Com|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Herron died of [[yellow fever]] in 1855, being a wealthy patron, she willed the house to the sisters for the purpose of founding a hospital. The Hospital of St. Vincent DePaul was incorporated in 1856 by eight [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]] during the yellow fever epidemic. The Sisters of the Daughters of Charity came to Norfolk in 1839 to run St. Mary's Orphan Asylum and care for the sick and dying during the yellow fever epidemic in Norfolk.&lt;ref name="Norfolk Church St."&gt;{{cite book|last=Yarsinske|first=Amy|title=Norfolk's Church Street: Between Memory and Reality|year=1999|publisher=Arcadia Publishers|isbn=978-0-7385-0103-1|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norfolk St. Vincent Depaul"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parramore|first=Thomas|title=Norfolk: The First Four Centuries|year=2000|publisher=Norfolk: The First Four Centuries|isbn=978-0-8139-1988-1|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with just eight rooms, a clinic for the poor was added in 1892, and a [[nursing school]] began in 1893. In 1899, a fire nearly destroyed the hospital that had grown to 150 rooms, but it was rebuilt and enlarged in 1901.&lt;ref name="Local Hospital History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Depaul Hospital|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2010/03/depaul-hospital|accessdate=7 July 2012|author=George Tucker|authorlink=Local hospitals have history|date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 the hospital was renamed Depaul Hospital and moved to its present location at Kingsley Lane and [[Granby St.]] in the city of [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. After, the hospital moved the basement and annexes of the old hospital, and housed classes for the Norfolk Division of the Virginia State College (now [[Norfolk State University]]) until 1958. Depaul is the oldest [[Catholic]] public hospital in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Seargant Memorial Room Photo Depaul Hospital"&gt;{{cite web|title=Depaul Hospital|url=http://www.npl.lib.va.us/absoluteig/gallery.asp?action=viewimage&amp;categoryid=103&amp;text=&amp;imageid=217&amp;box=&amp;shownew=|work=Norfolk Public Library|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=4 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Bon Secours Sisters|Sisters of Bon Secours]] extended the Daughters of Charity ministry by assuming the sponsorship for DePaul.

==Formation==
The Canadian Society of Safety Engineering’s Education &amp; Research Committee reported a need for a generalist certification for Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) practitioners. In November 1974, a steering committee was formed to implement recommendations and establish the first Board of Governors. A meeting was held March 3, 1975 and the  proposed name was Canadian Registered Safety Professional. Consumer and Corporate Affairs issued a Letters Patent on February 10, 1976.

==Reciprocal Agreements==
BCRSP has Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (USA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcsp.org/pdf/ASPCSP/MOU_BCRSP.pdf ''Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (USA)'', May 20, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704162037/http://www.bcsp.org/pdf/ASPCSP/MOU_BCRSP.pdf |date=July 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (UK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About%20membership/Membership%20FAQs#eight ''Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health'', May 20, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOUs allow either CSPs (USA designation) or CMIOSHs (UK designation) to apply for the CRSP/PSAC certification through a streamlined application process.

The [[Certified Safety Professional]] (CSP) is a certification offered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (BCSP). The CSP is accredited in the United States by the [[National Commission for Certifying Agencies]] and internationally by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (ISO/IEC 17024) (see [[ANSI]]).

The requirements to become a CSP are:
*an associate's degree in safety and health, or an accredited bachelor's degree in any field
*four or more years of professional safety experience
*passing the Safety Fundamentals and/or Comprehensive Practice examinations
*CSPs are further required to provide BCSP with proof that they are maintaining a high level of competency in safety work by re-certifying every five years.
*The Charter Member IOSH (CMIOSH)  is a designation offered by the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH). Chartered Members of the Institution are entitled to use the designation Chartered Safety and Health Practitioner and the designatory letters CMIOSH. Chartered Member status requires approved educational qualifications and experience. All Chartered Members are required to maintain a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) record. IOSH (CMIOSH) has a reciprocal agreement with the CRSP designation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iosh.co.uk/~/media/Documents/Membership/CSP%20and%20CRSP%20to%20CMIOSH%20ed%20NEW12.ashx ''IOSH Chartered membership for Certified Safety Professionals and Canadian Registered Safety Professionals'',CSP and CRSP to CMIOSH, June 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caregiver syndrome''' or '''caregiver stress''' is a condition that strongly manifests exhaustion, anger, rage, or guilt resulting from unrelieved [[Caregiver|caring]] for a chronically ill patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2007/08/23/caregiver-syndrome-reality-for-many-caregivers-dealing-with-dementia/ |title=Caregiver Syndrome: Reality for many caregivers dealing with Dementia |author=Christine Anne Piesyk |date=2009-08-23 |work=Clarksvilleonline.com |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not listed in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]],'' the term is often used by many healthcare professionals. 

Almost 66 million Americans are providing care to those who are ill, aged, and/or disabled for an average of 39.2 hours per week. Over 13 million caregivers provide care for their own children as well. Caregiver syndrome is acute when caring for an individual with behavioral difficulties, such as: [[fecal incontinence]], [[memory]] issues, sleep problems, [[wandering (dementia)|wandering]], and [[aggression]]. Typical symptoms of the caregiver syndrome include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]] and stomach complaints with the most common symptom being [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Roughly 70% of caregivers suffer from depression. 

==Signs and symptoms==
Those who are providing care for a friend or family member with a long-term illness undergo what is known as [[chronic stress]]. Caregiving has been shown to affect the [[immune system]]. It was found that caregivers to Alzheimer's patients were more depressed, and they showed lower life satisfaction than the comparison samples. The caregivers also had higher EBV antibody titres and lower percentages of [[T cells]] and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Esterling |first1=B. A. |last2=Kiecolt-Glaser |first2=J. K. |last3=Glaser |first3=R. |date=May 1996 |title=Psychosocial modulation for cytokine-induced natural killer cell activity in older adults |work=[[Psychosomatic Medicine (journal)|Psychosomatic Medicine]] |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=264–272 |pmid=8771626 |url=http://pni.osumc.edu/KG%20Publications%20(pdf)/101.pdf |doi=10.1097/00006842-199605000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caregiving has also been shown to have adverse effects on wound repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kiecolt-Glaser |first1=J. K. |last2=Marucha |first2=P. T. |last3=Malarkey |first3=W. B. |last4=Mercado |first4=A. M. |last5=Glaser |first5=R. |date=November 1995 |title=Slowing of wound healing by psychological stress |work=[[The Lancet]] |volume=346 |issue=8984 |pages=1194–1196 |pmid=7475659 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)92899-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms include [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[anger]]. Chronic stress can create medical problems including [[high blood pressure]], [[diabetes]], and a compromised immune system.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; The impact may reduce the care-giver's [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref name="SchulzBeach1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulz |first1=Richard |last2=Beach |first2=Scott R. |title=Caregiving as a Risk Factor for Mortality |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=282 |issue=23 |year=1999 |pages=2215 |issn=0098-7484 |doi=10.1001/jama.282.23.2215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In severe cases of Alzheimer's, caregivers may also take on the symptoms of the patients whom they are taking care of. An example of this is progressive memory loss. Caregiver syndrome affects people at any age. For example, elderly caregivers are at a 63 percent higher risk of mortality than non-caregivers who are in the same age group. This trend may be due to elevated levels of stress hormones circulating throughout the body. These levels are similar to someone with [[PTSD]]. Because caregivers have to be so immersed in their roles, with day/night hours, they often have to neglect their own health. They are experiencing high amounts of stress along with grief since the health of their loved one is declining. Since their roles are changing from a partnership or mother/daughter, mother/son, etc. relationship to a caregiver and patient relationship, caregivers are turning to online forums such as the [[Alzheimer's Association]] for support. This role change is difficult for many people to make, causing them to experience [[anger]], [[resentment]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. It is difficult to provide quality care in this state of stress.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Exhaustion, anger of caregiving get a name |first=Andree |last=LeRoy |work=Health |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 13, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/08/13/caregiver.syndrome/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Caregiver syndrome is caused by the overwhelming duty of caring for a disabled or chronically ill person. Caregiver stress is caused by an increased stress hormone level for an extended period of time. Caregivers also suffer the grief of a declining loved one, as causing a depressive exhaustive state, deteriorating emotional and mental health. "Double-duty caregivers" are those already working in the healthcare field who feel obligated to also care for their loved ones at home. This over-exhaustion and constant caregiving role can cause an increase in physical and mental health deterioration. It is actually being thought that a part of the stress of being a caregiver is from how they feel about the job. In other words if a caregiver does not like or want to be a caregiver, they will inflict more stress on themselves by accepting the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tunajek |first=Sandra |title=Understanding Caregiver Stress Syndrome |work=Wellness Milestones |publisher=[[American Association of Nurse Anesthetists]] |date=October 2010 |url=http://www.aana.com/resources2/health-wellness/Documents/nb_milestone_1010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
The American Academy of Geriatric Psychiatrists reports one out of four American families provide care for a family member over the age of 50. By 2030, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates a population of 71 million Americans over 65.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; In the U.K., over 450,000 dementia patients are cared for at home.

The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] and the National Center on Caregiving both believe all caregivers should be screened for stress and depression and recommend providing caregivers with their own resources to help them cope.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Since family members most often assume the primary caregiver role, these strains fall upon them. Care for those that are chronically ill is irregular, so there are not many facilities that can provide adequate care. This caregiving role is more commonly assumed by women than men. Since there are some illnesses that create a more intense need for caregiving, the caregiver is responsible for almost every aspect in the patient's life. One of the positive aspects of caregiving for a loved one though is that it can improve their quality of life but when the caregiver is depleted of confidence, the recovery may be fostered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Molloy |first=G. J. |last2=Jonhston |first2=M. |last3=Johnston |first3=D.

Parents of children with CHD experience [[Mental distress|psychological distress]]&amp;nbsp;such as high levels of&amp;nbsp;caregiver stress, [[anxiety]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soulvie|first=M. Amber|last2=Desai|first2=Priti P.|last3=White|first3=Carmel Parker|last4=Sullivan|first4=Brittany N.|date=2012-07-01|title=Psychological Distress Experienced by Parents of Young Children With Congenital Heart Defects: A Comprehensive Review of Literature|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01488376.2012.696410|journal=Journal of Social Service Research|volume=38|issue=4|pages=484–502|doi=10.1080/01488376.2012.696410|issn=0148-8376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caregiving for military service members who have experienced a [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[PTSD]] can be very challenging as well. On April 21, 2010, the U.S. Congress passed what is known as the "[[Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010]]". This act recognizes the importance of caregivers who are caring for Veterans, and established a program of assistance for them with benefits including covering counseling and mental health services under the benefits of [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]].&lt;ref name="Care for Caregivers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hnfs.net/content/hnfs/home/tn/prov/provider_news/care_caregivers.html |title=Care for Caregivers |publisher=[[Health Net]] |accessdate=2013-02-27}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in health care==
Since this term, "Caregiver syndrome" is widely used among physicians, but is not mentioned in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM) or in medical literature, physicians are not always sure how to approach the issues that arise with this syndrome. Therefore, this is not addressed frequently. In a survey given by the American Academy of Family Physicians, they found that fewer than 50 percent of caregivers were asked by their doctors whether or not they were experiencing caregiver stress. If this was listed in the DSM with an official diagnosis, it could possibly stigmatize those that have it. Many believe it would be beneficial for this to receive a clinical name though, so caregivers would be able to receive the appropriate resources they need. This would encourage health care professionals to develop better strategies for treatment of Caregiver Syndrome, as well as requiring health insurance agencies to pay for appropriate treatment. Some ways to improve this syndrome have been agreed upon by experts and include the following suggestions:
*Expanding the support system for the caregiver
*Finding help in various sources for caregiver tasks
*Educating caregivers&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;
*Paying caregivers salaries competitive with those paid to professional healthcare providers doing similar tasks, thus allowing them to retire from salaried jobs for companies where management is willfully ignorant of or unsympathetic to their workers' family caregiving burdens
*Encouraging the growth of telecommuting jobs that enable caregivers to work at home while caring for their patients
*Providing full medical benefits for caregivers and their patients
*Providing nursing and medical advice when needed, including home visits
*Providing respite services on demand
*Providing psychological counseling or psychiatric intervention for stress management
*Collecting data documenting savings for the national healthcare system made possible by home caregivers

==Prevention==

Effective [[coping strategies]] such as sleep, exercise and relaxation can help prevent stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caring for Yourself |publisher=Assurance Home Care |date=May 11, 2016 |url=http://assurancehomecare.ca/blog/2016/5/11/caring-for-yourself}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caregivers fare better when they have active coping skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aschbacher |first1=K. |last2=Patterson |first2=T. L. |last3=von Kanel |first3=R. |last4=Dimsdale |first4=J. E. |last5=Mills |first5=P. J. |last6=Adler |first6=K.

* [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]]
* [[Writing therapy]]
* Coping effectiveness training
* [[Stress management]] 
* Relaxation training

Nearly 15 million Americans provide care that is unpaid to a person living with [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[dementia]]. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are often used as interchangeable words, but they aren't the same thing. Increasing evidence has shown that changes in the brain occur 15 years prior to when symptoms are first demonstrated in a person with Alzheimer's disease.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} This is often called a "family disease", because the stress associated with watching a loved one decline rapidly in their health affects everyone involved with their care. In order to maintain their own well being, caregivers need to focus on their own needs. They need to take time for their own health, and get the appropriate support that they need such as respite from their care-giving duties. Through training, caregivers can learn how to handle the behaviors that are challenging them, and improve their own communication skills. The most important thing the caregiver can do is keep the person with Alzheimer's safe. Research has shown that caregivers experience lower stress and better health when they learn skills through this caregiving training and participate in support groups. Participating in these groups allows caregivers to care for their family members longer in their homes.&lt;ref name="FCA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Caregiving |publisher=[[Family Caregiver Alliance]] |accessdate=February 27, 2013 |url=http://www.caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Support==
Services that may be helpful to caregivers include: 
* health services in the home
* companion or chore services
* day care centers for adults
* respite care, time out at nursing homes, or assisted living facilities
* counseling
* legal advice
* money management
* support groups
* educational programs&lt;ref name="cleveland caregiver handbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrgec.org/FileLib/Cleveland%20Caregiver%20handbook%20II.pdf |title=A Guide for Individuals Who Care for Persons with Dementia: Preventing Stress from Becoming Harmful |publisher=Alzheimer’s Association, Cleveland Area Chapter |accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===REACH Program===
The Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) Project was created in 1995. This project was designed to enhance family caregiving for those who were taking care of relatives that have Alzheimer's disease and other related dementia (ADRD). This program includes:
* Support groups
* Behavioral skills training programs
* Family-based systems interventions

This program was designed specifically for people who are caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia at home, and makes it possible for those with dementia to live in the own homes longer by addressing these problems of caregiver health that force the caregiver to move their loved ones to assisted-living facilities. If they can manage the challenges that come along with caregiving better, both will benefit from this. Special one-on-one training is provided for the caregiver, as well as counseling. This allows them to be more effective in their caregiving roles. They receive help directly from dementia care specialists who work with the client on an individual basis to find solutions to problems such as:
* Caregiver stress
* Challenging behaviors
* Home safety 
* Depression
* Self care
* Social support&lt;ref name="Alz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alz.org/northcentraltexas/in_my_community_reach.asp |title=Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health (REACH) |publisher=Alzheimer's Association |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of caregiving==
Caregiving can actually provide a health advantage as well for some caregivers. Caregivers maintained higher physical performance when compared to non-caregivers. They declined less in tasks than the low-intensity caregivers and non-caregivers such as: walking pace, grip strength, and the speed with which they could rise from a chair. Caregivers also did significantly better on memory tasks than did non-caregivers over a 2-year time frame. Caregivers scored at the level of someone 10 years younger than them, although both groups (caregivers vs. non-caregivers) were both in their eighties.&lt;ref name="Benefits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/caregivings-hidden-benefits/ |title=Caregiving's Hidden Benefits |first=Paula |last=Span |work=The New York Times |date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this role brings with it high costs, high rewards are also there too. This is known as "Caregiver gain". These rewards are emotional, psychological, and spiritual such as:
* Growing confidence in one's ability
* Feelings of personal satisfaction
* Increased family closeness&lt;ref name="Benefits"/&gt;

Women who become caregivers are healthy enough to take on the task, therefore it makes sense that they would be stronger than their non-caregiver counterparts, and remain stronger than them. The demands of caregiving cause caregivers to move around a lot, and stay on their feet. Therefore, exercise can improve both physical health and [[cognition]]. The complex thought as required by caregiving can ward off cognitive decline. This includes activities such as: 
* Monitoring medications
* Scheduling
* Financial responsibilities&lt;ref name="Benefits"/&gt;

Other benefits mentioned by caregivers are that it gives their life meaning, and produces pride in their success as a caregiver. They are also able to give back to someone else. It has also been noted that psychological [[benefit finding]] can be an important way of dealing with stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Folkman |first1=S. |last2=Moskowitz |first2=J.

'''Crisscross heart''' is a type of [[Congenital heart defect|congenital]] heart defect where the [[right atrium]] is closely associated with the [[left ventricle]] in space, and the [[left atrium]] is closely associated with the [[right ventricle]].&lt;ref name="pmid2312210"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fontes VF, de Souza JA, Pontes Jùnior SC | title = Criss-cross heart with intact ventricular septum | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 382–5 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2312210 | doi = 10.1016/0167-5273(90)90102-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is classified as a defect, the criss-cross is more of a spatial anomaly than a functional one, and it is possible for the heart to have relatively normal functioning. The ventricles are rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise resulting in the twisting of their connection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Angelini P | title = Left ventricle on top versus right ventricle on top in superoinferior ventricles: what are we talking about? | journal = Texas Heart Institute Journal | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 442–4 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20844618 | pmc = 2929877 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The actual blood flow stream through the ventricles is not interrupted. 

== Properties of an anatomically correct heart ==
In an anatomically correct heart the [[Atrium (heart)|right atrium]] and [[Ventricle (heart)|right ventricle]] are working together to supply blood to the [[Artery|pulmonary artery]], similarly to how the left atrium and the left ventricle work simultaneously to supply blood to the [[aorta]]. During the process of the heart contracting and releasing the right atrium and left atrium contract at the same time, while the left ventricle and right ventricle relax. In opposition, when the left atrium and right atrium are relaxed the left ventricle and right ventricle contract pushing blood to either the aorta or pulmonary artery. In an anatomically correct heart the atria are smaller than the ventricles. The ventricles include more muscle in order to push high quantities of blood throughout the body. Normal blood flow throughout the heart begins at the [[superior vena cava]] coming from the upper half of the body and the [[inferior vena cava]] coming from the lower half of the body. Next blood will be in the right atrium and will flow uninterrupted through the [[tricuspid valve]] through to the right ventricle. The blood from the right ventricle should go to the pulmonary artery via the pulmonary valve.The blood from the pulmonary vein enters the left atrium, then flows through the mitral valve to the left ventricle. After the left ventricle is filled with blood the aortic valve opens allowing blood to go through, which the blood then enters the aorta and goes to the rest of the body&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chop.edu/pages/how-normal-heart-works|title=How the Normal Heart Works|last=Philadelphia|first=The Children's Hospital of|date=2014-08-10|website=www.chop.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Symptoms ==
Crisscross heart is a very rare congenital heart defect, and results in many different symptoms, even though the heart still has the ability to perform its major function of pumping blood throughout the body. Individuals who have this disease will experience [[cyanosis]] which is a blue tint to the skin because of inadequate blood flow to the body, this symptom will be seen especially around the mouth. Other symptoms include [[pallor]], extreme [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis]], [[Heart murmur|cardiac murmurs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA358238281&amp;docType=Case+study&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA358238281&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=colu91149&amp;inPS=true#|title=Gale - Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a deviated ventricular septum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&amp;Expert=1461|title=Orphanet: Criss cross heart|last=RESERVED|first=INSERM US14 -- ALL RIGHTS|website=www.orpha.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Pallor can be described as a pale color of the skin, and dyspnea is difficulty breathing. Pulmonary valve stenosis is the narrowing of the pulmonary valve which leads to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary artery. Cardiac murmurs are sounds that can be heard when using a stethoscope that make a swooshing noise rather than a normal “lub-dup”. Lastly a deviated ventricular septum is when there is a hole between the ventricle walls resulting in blood between the ventricles flowing freely between each other&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taksande AM | title = Echocardiographic recognition of a criss-cross heart with double outlet right ventricle | journal = Images in Paediatric Cardiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 3–7 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23847656 | pmc = 3669543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Diagnosis and Treatment ==
Crisscross heart can be diagnosed by an [[Echocardiography|echocardiogram]], [[Angiocardiography|angiocardiogram]], and a [[Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging|cardiac MRI]]. To diagnose crisscross heart during embryonic development a [[Medical ultrasound|sonogram]] will be used, and it is very important identify the disease prenatally so the child can be treated immediately for better cardiac function in adulthood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li S, Luo G, Norwitz ER, Wang C, Ouyang S, Yao Y, Wen H, Chen C, Fu Q, Xia X, Bi J, Zhu J | title = Prenatal diagnosis of criss-cross heart: sonographical and pathological features of five cases | language = En | journal = Journal of Perinatology | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–102 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22555779 | doi = 10.1038/jp.2012.56 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jp.2012.56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Without treatment crisscross heart can be fatal. The treatment is aimed to fix a deviated septum and pulmonary valve stenosis rather than the rotated heart it self.

==History==
In the mid-1880s, an Ayurvedic practitioner Dr. S.K. Burman concocted medicines for diseases like cholera and malaria. He went on to set up Dabur India Ltd in 1884 to mass-produce his Ayurvedic formulations. His son, C.L. Burman, set up Dabur's first R&amp;D unit. The current chairman, Dr. Anand Burman, and vice-chairman Amit Burman, are part of the fifth generation of the Burman family. The Burmans were among the first business families in India to separate ownership from management when they handed over the management of the company to professionals in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/my-learnings/how-daburs-burmans-segregated-family-and-business/34203/1|title=How Dabur's Burmans Segregated Family and Business {{!}} Forbes India|website=Forbes India|language=en-US|access-date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dental professionals, in writing or speech, use several different '''dental notation''' systems for associating information with a specific tooth.  The three most common systems are the ISO System (ISO 3950, the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]]), [[Universal Numbering System]], and [[Palmer Notation Method|Palmer notation method]].  The ISO system is used worldwide, and the Universal is used widely in the United States. The ISO System can be easily adapted to computerized charting.

Another system is used by [[paleoanthropologist]]s.

== History ==
A committee of the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) recommended the use of the Palmer notation method in 1947.  Since this method required the use of symbols, its use was difficult on keyboards.  As a result, the association officially supported the Universal system in 1968.  The [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Fédération Dentaire Internationale]] officially uses the two-digit numbering system of the FDI system. However, in 1996, the ADA adopted the ISO System as an alternative to the Universal System.

== ISO System by the World Health Organization ==
[[File:Teeth model front FDI Notation.jpg|thumb|FDI Notation, teeth's quadrants]]

The International Standards Organization Designation System (ISO System) by the World Health Organization notation system is widely used by dental professionals internationally to associate information with a specific tooth.  Based on the Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI), it is also known as ISO 3950&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41835 ISO 3950:2009 ''Dentistry &amp;mdash; Designation system for teeth and areas of the oral cavity'']&lt;/ref&gt; notation.  Thus the ISO System uses a two-digit numbering system in which the first digit represents a tooth's quadrant and the second digit represents the number of the tooth from the midline of the face.  For permanent teeth, the upper right teeth begin with the number, "1".  The upper left teeth begin with the number, "2".  The lower left teeth begin with the number, "3".  The lower right teeth begin with the number, "4".  For primary teeth, the sequence of numbers goes 5, 6, 7, and 8 for the teeth in the upper right, upper left, lower left, and lower right respectively.  When speaking about a certain tooth such as the permanent maxillary central incisor, the notation is pronounced “one, one”. Beware of mixing up the teeth in written form such as 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 between the Universal and ISO systems.

For example: retention of a primary molar tooth in the otherwise regular intact lower right jaw, position 5, would be noted as: 41, 42, 43, 44, 85, 46, 47, 48.&lt;!-- Don't change "85" to "45"! -- it is a primary tooth. --&gt;

== Palmer notation method ==

{{main article|Palmer Notation Method}}

The Palmer notation is a system used by dentists to associate information with a specific tooth. Although supposedly superseded by the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], it overwhelmingly continues to be the preferred method used by dental students and practitioners in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0579.1998.tb00034.x | vauthors = Blinkhorn A, Choi C, Paget H | title = An investigation into the use of the FDI tooth notation system by dental schools in the UK. | journal = Eur J Dent Educ | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–41 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9588962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally termed the "Zsigmondy system" after the Hungarian dentist [[Adolf Zsigmondy]] who developed the idea in 1861, using a ''Zsigmondy cross'' to record quadrants of tooth positions.&lt;ref name="huszar"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Huszár G | title = [The role of the life and works of Adolf Zsigmondy and Ottó Zsigmondy in the history of dentistry][Article in Hungarian] | journal = Fogorv Sz | volume = 82 | issue = 12 | pages = 357–63 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2689240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NB not same as Richard Adolf Zsigmondy who won Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1925 --&gt; Permanent teeth (adult) were numbered 1 to 8, and the child primary dentition (also called deciduous, milk or baby teeth) were depicted with a quadrant grid using Roman numerals I, II, III, IV, V to number the teeth from the midline distally. Palmer changed this to A, B, C, D, E.

The Palmer notation consists of a symbol (┘└ ┐┌) designating the quadrant of the tooth and a number indicating the position from the midline. Adult teeth are numbered 1 to 8, with primary teeth indicated by a letter A to E. Hence the left and right maxillary central incisor would have the same number, "1", but the right one would have the symbol, "┘", underneath it, while the left one would have, "└".

== Universal numbering system ==
{{main article|Universal numbering system (dental)}}

Although it is termed "universal numbering system", it is most commonly used in the United States. It is also called the "American system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Histology: A Text and Atlas by Michael H. Ross • Wojciech Pawlina|url=https://www.inkling.com/read/histology-michael-ross-and-wojciech-pawlina-6th/chapter-16/folder-16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uppercase letters ''A'' through ''T'' are used for primary teeth and the numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth.  The tooth designated "1" is the maxillary right third molar ("[[wisdom tooth]]") and the count continues along the upper teeth to the left side.  Then the count begins at the mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along the bottom teeth to the right side.  Each tooth has a unique '''number''' or '''letter''', allowing for easier use on keyboards.

==Notation used by paleoanthropologists==
[[Paleoanthropologist]]s use a system suitable to other primates as well. The upper teeth are denoted I&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, Pm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Pm&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and M&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Left or right has to be specified. The lower teeth are I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, Pm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Pm&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The reason the premolars are labeled 3 and 4 is that in earlier primates there were two other premolars between them and the canines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Gentry Steele]] and [[Claud Bramblett]]|title=The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton|date=1988|isbn=9780890963265|pages=75, 82|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=WedKmN3X86kC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=pm3+premolar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aXxVtb_-mx&amp;sig=_c8CAgorUdcS9AhaL1Xnu5JMHy0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj99eeV3MzUAhXlCMAKHe01DtwQ6AEIWTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=pm3%20premolar&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters and numbers system==
In this system, also known as ''alpha-numeric notation'', the four quadrants are designated as follows:
* UR - upper right
* UL - upper left
* LR - lower right
* LL - lower left

Within each quadrant, the teeth are numbered as in the Palmer notation: 1-8 for permanent and A-E for deciduous, both starting at the midline. For example, the permanent left maxillary first molar is designated '''UL6'''.

To prevent uncertainty or ambiguity, teeth may be indicated using more than one notation, particularly when referring for an extraction; this makes it less likely for the incorrect tooth to be needlessly extracted. For instance, a dentist may give an instruction to "extract the 24 (UL4) upper left first premolar tooth."

'''eWater''' is a [[Nonprofit organization#Australia|non-profit]] organisation established by Australian Federal and State Governments. The role of eWater is to support integrated [[water resources management]] in Australia through development and implementation of the national hydrological modelling strategy (NHMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/archive/farrell/2012/pubs/mr20120529.pdf|title = $4 MILLION TO SUPPORT A  NATIONAL HYDROLOGIC MODELLING PLATFORM|date = 29 May 2012|accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = Australian Government - Department of the Environment|publisher = Australian Government|last = Farrell|first = Don}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eWater develops and supports a number of software tools for hydrological modelling. Some tools include Source, MUSIC, Rainfall Runoff Library, Stochastic Climate Library and SedNet.

== History ==

In 1992 the CRC for Catchment Hydrology (CRCCH) was formed to produce a decision support system able to predict movement of water, particulates and solutes from land to rivers followed in 1993 by the CRC for Freshwater Ecology (CRCFH).

Model for Urban Stormwater Improvement Conceptualisation (MUSIC) was launched in 2002
Development of The Invisible Modelling Environment (TIME) enabling development and integration of models, which is used by many tools made by eWater

In 2004 the Catchment modelling Toolit was released&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewater.com.au/products/ewater-toolkit/catchment-tools/ Catchment Modelling Toolkit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.mssanz.org.au/MODSIM03/Volume_04/C05/01_Argent.pdf|title = Building a Modelling Toolkit for Prediction of  Catchment Behaviour|author1=R.M.

Perry |date = 17 July 2003|journal = International Congress on Modelling and Simulation|accessdate = 15 July 2014|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

eWater Ltd was established in 2005 and CRCFE and CRCCH were merged and relaunched as eWater CRC

eWater CRC ends and eWater Ltd continues as a non-profit organisation

Minister for the Environment Senator Penny Wong announces eWater Source as the new COAG endorsed National Hydrological Platform and in 
2014 the Source Public modelling tool is launched as a free software package

== Source ==
'''Source,''' an integrated water resource management modelling tool, developed by eWater Ltd is used to create hydrological models used for integrated planning, management and operations for catchment and river systems, including demands fore water from urban areas, agriculture and the environment

The package has been used to build river and catchment models in every state of Australia as well as many other countries including India,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aid.dfat.gov.au/LatestNews/Pages/Australia-and-India-partner-to-manage-water-for-scarcity.aspx|title = Australia and India partner to manage water for scarcity|date = 26 April 2013|accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = Australian Government - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|publisher = Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan, China and the Mekong&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aid.dfat.gov.au/Publications/Documents/mekongwater-appr-2012-13.pdf,|title = Aid Program Performance Report 2012−13 Australian Mekong Water Resources Program|date = |accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = Australian Government - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|publisher = Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; River system

The [[Murray-Darling Basin Authority|MDBA]]''' ''' has implemented a Source management model of the Murray and Lower Darling River System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mdba.gov.au/what-we-do/managing-rivers/hydrological-modelling|title = Hydrological Modelling using eWater's Source|date = |accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = Australian Government - Murray Darling Basin Authority|publisher = Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queensland Government is now working with Source in five river basins: the Pioneer, Fitzroy, Condamine-Balonne, Cape, and Flinders and Gilbert. Over 30 earlier catchment Source models were implemented under the Great Barrier Reef Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/measuring-success/methods/assets/gbr-report-card-2011-pollutant-loads-methods.pdf|title = Great Barrier Reef Report Card 2011|date = 2011|accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = Reef Water Quality Protection Plan|publisher = Australian Government, Queensland Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New South Wales is implementing the Namoi River System&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/environmental-water-delivery-namoi-river|title = Environmental water delivery: Namoi River|date = |accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = Department of Environment|publisher = Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Murrimbidgee river system using Source.

Victoria is implementing the Loddon, Campaspe, Broken and Coliban components of a broader northern Victoria Source model centred on the Goulburn River system.

== TIME (The Invisible Modelling Environment) ==
The Invisible Modelling Environment (TIME) is a software development framework for creating, testing and delivering [[environmental simulation]] models. TIME includes support for the representation, management and visualisation of a variety of data types, as well as support for testing, integrating and calibrating simulation models.

TIME provides a framework for spatial and temporal data analysis. TIME has been developed under the sponsorship of eWater CRC and its predecessor CRC for Catchment Hydrology. As well as providing a modelling framework, TIME supports model users with a range of data analysis and management, model processing and visualisation tools.

TIME is a core component of a large range of formal software products, as well as numerous research programs. Currently the TIME code base is incorporated into approximately 23 eWater supported applications.

The eWater Source products are a major focus of this product range and are extensively used by government and private enterprise in addressing water quantity and quality policy questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP127296&amp;dsid=DS5|title = Review of The Invisible Modelling Environment (TIME)|date = 15 December 2012|accessdate = 15 July 2014|website = CSIRO Research Publications Repository|publisher = CSIRO|author1=Ross Searle |author2=David Penton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time is also integrated into a range of [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] specific products and projects such as the “[http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Flagships/Water-for-a-Healthy-Country-Flagship/Integrated-Water-Resources-Management/Hydrologists-workbench_CLW_Project.aspx Hydrologists Workbench]” and the [http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awra/ Australian Water Resources Assessment (AWRA)] system, a continental water balance monitoring system that is being developed jointly by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology.

== eWater Toolkit ==
The eWater Toolkit is a source of software tools and information related to the modelling and management of water resources, including [[Water quality modelling|water quality]] tools. It provides a web-based distribution point for hydrological, ecological and catchment management models, databases and other resources.

== MUSIC ==
MUSIC predicts the performance of stormwater quality management systems as an aid to decision-making. It is intended to help organisations [[Urban planning in Australia|plan]] and design (at a conceptual level) appropriate urban stormwater management systems for their catchments that meet [[Water-sensitive urban design|Water Sensitive Urban Design]] Standards

[[File:Raised toilet in Haiti (7281252188).jpg|thumb|Emergency [[toilet]] in [[Haiti]], suitable for areas where digging [[Pit latrine|pit latrines]] is not possible]]

'''Emergency sanitation''' is the management and technical processes required to provide [[sanitation]] in [[emergency]] situations. This can include man-made or [[Natural disaster|natural disasters]]. Emergency sanitation is also required during [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian relief]] operations for [[Refugee|refugees]] and [[Internally displaced person|Internally Displaced Persons]] (IDPs).   

Emergency situations are classified into three phases which are called the "immediate", "short-term" and "long-term" phases. In the immediate phase, the focus is on reducing [[open defecation]]. Toilets provided might include very basic [[Latrine|latrines]], [[pit latrines]], [[Bucket toilet|bucket toilets,]] [[Container-based sanitation|container-based toilets]] or [[Chemical toilet|chemical toilets]].  

Providing showers and [[Hand washing|handwashing]] facilities is also part of emergency sanitation during all phases. [[Fecal sludge management|Fecal sludge management]] becomes a priority during the long-term emergency management phase.

== Background==
The term "[[Emergency]]" is perceived differently by different people and organisations. In a general sense, an emergency may be considered to be a phenomenon originating from a man-made and/or [[natural disaster]] which results in a serious, usually sudden threat to the health or well-being of the affected community which relies on external assistance to easily cope up with the situation.&lt;ref name="Harveybook" /&gt; 

There are different categories of emergency depending on its time frame, whether it lasts for few weeks, several months or years.&lt;ref name="Harveybook"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/359|title=Excreta disposal in emergencies a field manual : an inter-agency publication|date=2007|publisher=Loughborough university. Water, engineering and development centre (WEDC)|year=|isbn=9781843801139|location=Loughborough|pages=250|last1=Peter Harvey|first1=with contrib. from Andy Bastable...[et al.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people who are and will be affected by catastrophes (human crisis and natural disasters), which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, is rapidly increasing. The affected people are subjected to such dangers as temporary homelessness and risks to life and health.&lt;ref&gt;BORDA (2010).

== Methods ==
[[File:Emergencysan unhcr.jpg|alt=Emergency pit latrines|thumb|Emergency pit latrines with bathing shelters built in the [[Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement|Bidi Bidi refugee settlement]] in northern [[Uganda]] ]]
To address the problem of [[public health]] and the spread of dangerous diseases that come as a result of lack of [[sanitation]] and [[open defecation]], humanitarian actors focus on the construction of, for example, [[pit latrines]] and the implementation of [[hygiene]] promotion programmes.&lt;ref name="Grange"&gt;Grange, C. (2016). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2455 Faecal Sludge Management - WASH in Emergencies, Problem Exploration Report]. HIF (Humanitarian Innovation Fund) Problem Exploration Report. Cardiff: ELRHA&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply of [[drinking water]] in an urban-setting emergency has been improved by the introduction of standardised, rapid deployment kits. 

In the immediate emergency phase, the focus is on managing open defecation, and toilet technologies might include very basic [[Latrine#Trench latrine|trench latrines]], [[pit latrines]], [[Bucket toilet|bucket toilets,]] [[Container-based sanitation|container-based toilets]], [[Chemical toilet|chemical toilets]]. The short term phase might also involve technologies such as [[urine-diverting dry toilets]], [[Septic tank|septic tanks]], [[Decentralized wastewater system|decentralized wastewater systems]].

In urban emergencies, the main focus is usually on a quick rehabilitation and extension of existing services such as [[Sanitary sewer|sewer-lines]] and [[Sewage treatment|waste-water treatment plants]]. This can also include the installation of [[Sewage pumping|sewerage pumping]] stations to improve or extend services.

== Settings ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The emergency response often has to differ greatly based on the setting it takes place.

=== Home based ===
Home based settings where people choose to stay in or close to their homes (or those of their relatives, neighbours or friends). While this setting offers the quickest way to (self-) recovery, it also poses a high risk of sanitation related impacts due to the common lack of access to outside help and inadequate public-health monitoring.

=== Host community ===
Host community settings with significant displacement into outside communities (usually [[Urban area|urban]]) with existing but maybe also effected sanitation infrastructure in private homes.

Existing infrastructure in such settings is usually quickly overloaded due to the increase in population density and improvements/repair is often hindered by access- and space-limitations. Intra-community conflicts over the sanitation waste management are thus fairly common.

=== Mass shelter ===
Mass shelter settings where the displaced population is housed in existing but often re-purposed building-complexes such as [[schools]], [[community centres]], [[places of worship]], [[Shopping mall|malls]], [[Warehouse|warehouses]] and [[Stadium|sport stadiums]]. In some disaster prone countries, dedicated large [[Emergency shelter|emergency shelters]] are build for this purpose.

Existing sanitation facilities are usually inadequate for full-time stay of a high number of people, and the non-emergency management structures are typically unable or unwilling to continue their services. Legal issues over the re-purposing are also fairly common, especially if occupation continues for a longer time.

Due to usually cramped living conditions there is a high risk of conflict and often also cases of sexual violence, both of which often are in some relation to the sanitation facilities. 

=== Emergency settlements ===
Emergency settlements (formal or informal) where previously sparsely populated areas are newly occupied by the displaced population in large numbers. Typically these are set up by governments, the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[humanitarian aid]] organisations.

Due to the typically short time frame of arrivals and the non-existing infrastructure, these kind of encampments pose maybe the greatest challenge in regards to providing adequate emergency sanitation facilities.

== Challenges ==
[[File:Emergency pit lining kits by Evenproducts (6619616743).jpg|thumb|Emergency pit lining kits, suitable for areas with high water table]]
The provision of sanitation programmes is usually more challenging than [[water supply]] as it provides a limited choice of technologies.&lt;ref name="Grange" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briantj"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urban-response.org/resource/19245|title=Urban Humanitarian Response Portal|website=urban-response.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the overwhelming and diverse needs of [[WASH]].&lt;ref name="Briantj" /&gt;

Challenges with excreta disposal in emergencies include:
* Building [[Latrines]] in areas where pits cannot be dug, desludging latrines, no-toilet options and the final treatment or disposal of the [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]].&lt;ref name="Bastable"&gt;Bastable, A., Russell, L. (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2452 Gap Analysis in Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion]. Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF), London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Weak community participation and finding hygiene promotion designs that are suitable for a given context to make the WASH interventions sustainable.
* Newly arriving [[Internally displaced person|IDP]] or [[refugee]] populations can usually only be settled in less than ideal areas, such as land that is prone to regular flooding or which is very dry and with rocky ground.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This makes the provision of safe sanitation facilities and other infrastructure very difficult.
* In long running emergencies, the safe decommissioning or desludging of previously quickly built sanitation facilities can also become a serious challenge.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
* [[Humanitarian aid|Humanitarian actors]] need to understand the importance of better preparation and [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]] and the need for exit strategies and have consideration on the environment.&lt;ref name="Bastable" /&gt;

In the field of [[molecular biology]], '''enterotoxin type B''', also known as '''Staphylococcal enterotoxin B''' ('''SEB'''), is an [[enterotoxin]] produced by the  [[gram-positive]] [[bacteria]] ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. It is a common cause of [[food poisoning]], with severe [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and intestinal cramping often starting within a few hours of ingestion.&lt;ref name="emedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/830715-overview|title=eMedicine - CBRNE - Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B|format= |work=eMedicine|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being quite stable,&lt;ref name="pmid17477998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nema V, Agrawal R, Kamboj DV, Goel AK, Singh L | title = Isolation and characterization of heat resistant enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus from a food poisoning outbreak in Indian subcontinent | journal = Int. J. Food Microbiol. | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17477998 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the toxin may remain active even after the contaminating bacteria are killed. It can withstand boiling at 100&amp;nbsp;°C for a few minutes.&lt;ref name="emedicine" /&gt; [[Gastroenteritis]] occurs because SEB is a [[superantigen]], causing the immune system to release a large amount of [[cytokine]]s that lead to significant inflammation.

Additionally, this protein is one of the causative agents of [[toxic shock syndrome]].

== Function==

The function of this protein is to facilitate the infection of the [[host (biology)|host]] organism. It is a [[virulence factor]] designed to induce [[pathogenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid3782090"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blomster-Hautamaa DA, Kreiswirth BN, Kornblum JS, Novick RP, Schlievert PM | title = The nucleotide and partial amino acid sequence of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 261 | issue = 33 | pages = 15783–6 |date=November 1986 | pmid = 3782090 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major virulence [[exotoxins]] is the [[toxic shock syndrome]] [[toxin]] (TSST), which is [[secreted]] by the [[organism]] upon successful [[infection|invasion]]. It causes a major [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] in the host via [[superantigen]]ic properties, and is the causative agent of toxic shock syndrome.  It functions as a superantigen through activation of a significant fraction of [[T-cell]]s (up to 20%) by cross-linking [[MHC class II]] molecules with [[T-cell receptor]]s. TSST is a multisystem illness with several [[symptoms]] such as high [[fever]], [[hypotension]], dizziness, rash and peeling skin.&lt;ref name="pmid3782090" /&gt;

== Structure ==

All of these toxins share a similar two-domain fold (N and C-terminal domains) with a long alpha-helix in the middle of the molecule, a characteristic beta-barrel known as the "oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide fold" at the N-terminal domain and a beta-grasp motif at the C-terminal domain. Each superantigen possesses slightly different binding mode(s) when it interacts with MHC class II molecules or the T-cell receptor.&lt;ref name="PUB00007937"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Acharya KR, Papageorgiou AC, Tranter HS |title=Crystal structure of microbial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B at 1.5 A resolution: implications for superantigen recognition by MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors |journal=J.

=== N-terminal domain ===

The [[N-terminal]] domain is also referred to as OB-fold, or in other words the oligonuclucleotide binding fold. This region contains a low-affinity major histocompatibility complex class II ([[MHC II]]) site which causes an [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]].&lt;ref name="pmid21535475"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brosnahan AJ, Schlievert PM |title=Gram-positive bacterial superantigen outside-in signaling causes toxic shock syndrome |journal=FEBS J. |volume=278 |issue=23 |pages=4649–67 |date=December 2011 |pmid=21535475 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08151.x |url= |pmc=3165073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The N-terminal [[protein domain|domain]] contains regions involved in Major Histocompatibility Complex class II association. It is a five stranded [[beta barrel]] that forms an OB fold.&lt;ref name="pmid8268150"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prasad GS, Earhart CA, Murray DL, Novick RP, Schlievert PM, Ohlendorf DH | title = Structure of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 50 | pages = 13761–6 |date=December 1993 | pmid = 8268150 | doi = 10.1021/bi00213a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8107781"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Acharya KR, Passalacqua EF, Jones EY, Harlos K, Stuart DI, Brehm RD, Tranter HS | title = Structural basis of superantigen action inferred from crystal structure of toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 | journal = Nature | volume = 367 | issue = 6458 | pages = 94–7 |date=January 1994 | pmid = 8107781 | doi = 10.1038/367094a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9194182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prasad GS, Radhakrishnan R, Mitchell DT, Earhart CA, Dinges MM, Cook WJ, Schlievert PM, Ohlendorf DH | title = Refined structures of three crystal forms of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and of a tetramutant with reduced activity | journal = Protein Sci. | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 1220–7 |date=June 1997 | pmid = 9194182 | pmc = 2143723 | doi = 10.1002/pro.5560060610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== C-terminal domain ===

The beta-grasp domain has some structural similarities to the beta-grasp motif present in immunoglobulin-binding domains, ubiquitin, 2Fe-2 S ferredoxin and translation initiation factor 3 as identified by the SCOP database.

[[File:Gefriersperma.JPG|250px|right|thumb|[[Ampule]]s of frozen bovine semen in [[liquid nitrogen]] canister]]
'''Frozen bovine semen''' is a method of preserving bovine [[semen]] for future [[artificial insemination]], even after the death of the donor.

==History==
The early artificial insemination organizations were largely farmer-owned cooperatives. The first such cooperative in America was organized at [[Clinton, New Jersey|Clinton]], [[New Jersey]], through efforts of Enos J. Perry, Extension Dairyman, [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], and began operations May 17, 1938. It began operations with 102 members and 1,050 cows enrolled.

Using [[frozen semen]] for dairy [[cattle]] has been done since the 1950s. The oldest semen believed to be in existence was from a sire named Cottonade Emmet, who was a member of the [[American Breeders Service]] sire battery in 1952.  Semen [[semen collection|was collected]] on Emmet in November 1952 and has been used several times to produce [[offspring]]. However, the last time any such offspring was born was in the mid-1980s. Osborndale Ivanhoe, who was probably the most famous [[Holstein]] bull of the early semen era, died in November 1963.  From time to time [[calf|calves]] will still be born from his frozen semen. Ivanhoe was a member of The Atlantic Breeder's Co-op Sire battery. His sons who have had considerable influence include, Penstate Ivanhoe Star, Provin Mtn Ivanhoe Jewel, and Fleetridge Monitor. His grandsons who have dominated the Holstein breed include Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell, and Round Oak Rag Apple Elevation.

==Types of semen packaging==
{{expand with relevant sources|1=https://www.google.com/#q=cattle+%22semen+packaging%22|date=December 2013}}
Semen in the early days of artificial insemination was delivered everyday to technicians by bull [[stud (animal)|stud]]s as semen was not frozen at this point.  It was not until the addition of [[glycerol]] to [[semen extender]]s that semen could be frozen. In those early days semen was extended by bulls stud into a type of bottle, or [[test tube]], kept at low temperatures, and delivered to technicians usually everyday.  The freezing process was discovered by a man named Polge.  It was placed in containers called glass [[ampule]]s, sealed, frozen in [[dry ice]] and alcohol and kept in that type of solution until it was needed for insemination.  Later the [[liquid nitrogen]] refrigerator was invented by [[Union Carbide]] with money given to them by [[John Rockefeller Prentice]], who used it exclusively for his bull stud before a number of years later giving it to the entire artificial insemination (A.I.) industry at no charge or royalty.  Liquid nitrogen boils at −195.79 °C (77 K; −320 °F), which allows very little deterioration of bovine semen.  The ampules were fastened to a cane which was placed inside the canister.  The process of insemination involves transferring the ampule to an water/ice bath.  The ampule thaws for several minutes and when opened, the semen is drawn up into a [[pipette]].  

Other semen packages that have been tried include the "Magic Wand" developed by Badger Breeders Co-op in the mid-1960s. This was a frozen pipette that contained about .75 cc of extended semen.  With the use of a connector and adapter which had a syringe or rubber bulb attached it was air thawed or thawed in the cow.  The frozen polybulb was another semen package that had some usage.  Semen was actually placed in a plastic polybulb and frozen on canes.  The polybulb was thawed, sealed end cut, and attached to a pipette.  The semen expelled through the pipette.  There were several size of ampules used during the early days.  The 1cc ampules were used by Curtiss Breeding Service, .75cc ampules were used by Tri-State Breeders Co-op, and the .50cc ampules were almost excursively used by American Breeders Service.  The .75 and 1cc ampules were usually attached six to a metal cane. The .50 cc ampules were attached eight per cane.

===Plastic straw packaging===
In the 1960s a straw package that utilized a plastic straw was invented by the Robert Cassou family business called IMV in France. This straw was made of PVC and had two cotton plugs with powder in between them (the "factory end") while the other end was open. Semen was sucked up into the straw and was placed directly onto a comb and semen was expelled to make an airspace. Then the straw was placed directly into a pile of PVC powder that sealed the straw. Then the straw was placed into a water bath for a period of time to plug the end sealed. Then dried with cloth towels and frozen on metal racks. After freezing the straws were placed in 95 °F water and thawed for 60 seconds before being placed into a stainless steel gun. A sheath was placed over the gun and locked into place by an o-ring. Then the cow was inseminated the usual way. 

In the early 1970s an automated machine was invented by IMV. This machine would seal the straws ([[ultrasound|ultrasonically]]) one by one. Then several years later a machine that would fill and seal straws three at a time came out. This greatly increased processing times for bull studs. In the mid-2000s a machine that would not only fill three straws at a time but also have the capability to print the desired information on the straw, became available.

==How semen is collected==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
Bull semen can be collected by using an [[artificial vagina]] (AV), [[electro-ejaculator]], or by massaging the ampule of the bull by hand. 

===Preparation of the AV===
The most desired use is the AV. The AV is made up of a piece of heavy rubber hose about {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter and up a {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} or more (in some cases less) in length. A small screw cap attachment is fitted or drilled preferably in the middle of the housing. A piece of [[latex]] or [[silicone rubber]] (usually rough inside, but some cases smooth) then is put through the hose and pulled up at both ends. Another latex or silicone cone shaped attachment is placed on one end of the AV an held by a rubber band. on thee end of the cone a glass or plastic centrifudge tube is attached usually 15ml size). Through the cap attachment water usually around 54°C is filled until the AV is 1/2 full (temperature may vary from bull to bull). This water is between the inside rubber and the inside hose wall of the AV. A small amount of [[K-Y jelly]] or [[Vaseline]] is placed just inside on the unconed end and then it is smeared with a pipette or greasing stick. Finally in most cases and AV jacket is tied or attached onto the cone end to cover the cone and tube. This will help prevent cold shock to the semen by keeping the cone and tube warm. The collector then goes cautiously to the side of the bull when he is in mount, directs the [[bull's penis]] inside the AV by grabbing the [[penile sheath|sheath]] directly behind the extended penis (never touching the penis itself). The bull then ejaculates after his penis slides through the AV. The bull should be ejaculating through the AV into the cone of the AV so there is very little chance of temperature shock to the semen. after the bull has dismounted the AV should be held in the upright position so the semen runs into the tube onto the end of the cone. Then the tube is detached and placed upright in a water bath of about 29-32°C.

===Preparation of the bull===
In a commercially or Custom Stud a bull is generally brought to a collection area where there are gates or other protection areas set up. In most cases of Dairy Bulls the bull has a halter or rope inserted into his nose ring. This is so he can be led and his handler can be a safe distance away, yet have some control over the animal. In the collection area there usually is a stall or stanchion where a mount animal is tied in. A mount animal can be a steer, a cow, or even another bull. Some bulls can be rather aggressive and have no problems or issues mounting another animal. Others are rather passive and may show little or no interest in mounting. Different scenarios are used to try to entice him to mount. Such scenarios may include a different breed of steer, a different bull, or even a cow. Sometimes a bull may be wary of the individual who is approaching him to collect. In which cases a blindfold may have to be put over his eye in that side. The bull mounts and semen is able to be collected as the bull doesn't worry about what is going on.

===Collection on farm===
A number of bulls are not collected in commercial or stud setups. These bulls may not be good enough to enter active AI service. However the owner may only elect to use him a small amount in his own herd or perhaps a syndicate may want to control the amount of breedings or services to him. In this case the bull may be sent to a custom stud or be collected on farm. The owner may elect to only collect a few hundred to several thousand units (straws) on the bull. In most of the custom studs the semen can be stored and sent out to other breeders. In some cases where there is not a significant population of females in a particular breed, a bull may have a designated supply of semen collected and then be sent to slaughter. However a bank or supply of his semen is kept in storage for many years, still breeding females for many years after he has departed.

While many beef bulls are collected in stud a good share are collected on farm or in custom studs. Many of the bulls will be used in the owners' herds during beef breeding season. However they have the genetic merit to be used in many others as well. A beef bull may only be able to service 20 to 30 head via natural service during the breeding season. He will be able to service many more during the breeding season via artificial insemination.  If he becomes hurt, disabled, or even dies, he can still sire hundreds or thousands of progeny.

[[Malaysia]]n [[HIV/AIDS]] cases have been reported since 1986 by the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Ministry of Health]]. Since then, the national surveillance system had reported a cumulative of 105,189 HIV cases, 21,384 AIDS and 17,096 deaths related to HIV/AIDS giving total reported PLHIV of 88,093 cases or 96% of estimated PLHIV.&lt;ref name="2015progressreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/MYS_narrative_report_2015.pdf |title=The Global AIDS Response Progress Report Malaysia 2015 |publisher=UN Aids |access-date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males still make up the majority of HIV cases (89%), but the number of women with positive status of HIV has been increasing. This is shown by the decreasing trend of male:female ratio of 10:1 in 2002 to 4:1 in 2014.&lt;ref name="2014ANNUAL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mac.org.my/v3/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Annual-Report-2014_A4_09022017-WEB-s.pdf |title=Annual Report 2014 |publisher=Malaysia Aids Council, Malaysia Aids Foundation |access-date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42% of HIV transmission by age group occurred in 30-39 bracket.&lt;ref name="2014ANNUAL"/&gt;

===Means of Transmission===
In 2013, heterosexuals transmission recorded the highest (51%), followed by Injecting Drug User (22%) and Homo/Bisexual transmission (22%). According to the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Ministry of Health]], in 2016, 70% of HIV transmission are transmitted through heterosexual relationships, mainly from female sex workers to male clients.&lt;ref name="2016heterotransmission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/07/14/hiv-mostly-spread-through-heterosexual-relations/ |title=HIV mostly spread through heterosexual relations|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2017, 90% of new HIV/AIDS infections were the result of sexual transmissions. [[Lee Boon Chye|Deputy Health Minister Dr Lee Boon Chye]] said of the 90% sexual transmissions, 51% were men-to-men sexual transmissions while 40% were heterosexual transmissions. &lt;ref name="2017newcases"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/01/sexual-transmissions-main-cause-of-hivaids-infections/ |title=Sexual transmissions main cause of HIV/AIDS infections|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |access-date=1 October 2018|date=1 October 2018|author=Loh Foon Fong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Malaysia becomes the first country in the Western Pacific region to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and syphilis, officially validated by the World Health Organization (WHO). &lt;ref name="eliminatemother-child"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.avert.org/news/malaysia-eliminates-hiv-transmission-mother-child |title=Malaysia eliminates HIV transmission from mother-to-child|publisher=Avert |access-date=21 November 2018|date=2 November 2018|author=Caitlin Mahon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At-risk group==
The HIV epidemic in Malaysia is concentrated in these key populations;&lt;ref name="2014ANNUAL"/&gt;
; [[Sex worker]]s
Sex worker accounts for 0.6% of total reported cases thus far. However, the number of cases reported among sex workers are grossly under reported.&lt;ref name="2014progressreport"/&gt; In 2014, Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) in female sex workers shows an increase of sex workers living with HIV to 7.3% from 4.2% in 2012.&lt;ref name="2015progressreport"/&gt;
; [[Transgender]] 
An IBBS done in 2009 found HIV prevalence among the group at 9.3%, and was decreased to 4.8% in 2012.&lt;ref name="2015progressreport"/&gt; However, in 2014, the IBBS shows an increase of HIV prevalence to 5.6%.&lt;ref name="2015progressreport"/&gt;
; [[Injecting Drug User]]s
At the beginning of the epidemic, injecting drug user (PWID) accounted for 70-80% of all new reported cases. This has started to decline since 2004. In 2011, PWID accounts for 39% of new reported cases.&lt;ref name="2014progressreport"/&gt; In 2014, 16.3% of the PWID are reported living with HIV.&lt;ref name="2015progressreport"/&gt;
; [[Men who have sex with men]] (MSM)
IBBS conducted in 2012 shows 7.1% of MSMs is living with HIV. In 2014, the figure has increased to 8.9%.&lt;ref name="2015progressreport"/&gt;

==Laws and regulations==
In 2001, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health developed a non-compulsory ‘Code of Practice on Prevention and Management of HIV and AIDS’ which supports the creation of a non-judgemental and non-discriminatory work environment. &lt;ref name="codeofpractice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/govt-to-draft-new-rules-to-curb-workplace-discrimination-against-people-wit#4u8EpDcH2Rio8yUg.97 |title=Govt to draft new rules to curb workplace discrimination against people with HIV, AIDS |publisher=Malay Mail |access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2011 Nineteenth [[ASEAN Summit]], Malaysia together with other [[ASEAN]] nations, adopted the "ASEAN Declaration of Commitment: Getting To Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-Related Deaths, Bali, Indonesia, 17 November 2011" to reaffirm their commitment in working towards realizing an ASEAN community with Zero HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination and Zero AIDS-related Deaths.&lt;ref name="aseansummit2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asean.org/?static_post=asean-structure-asean-summit |title=Nineteenth ASEAN Summit, Bali, Indonesia, 14-19 November 2011|publisher=ASEAN |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 2017, the then-[[Ministry of Human Resources (Malaysia)|Ministry of Human Resources]] Minister, [[Richard Riot Jaem|Datuk Seri Dr Richard Riot Jaem]] announced that the government wants to draft a new regulation in an effort to eliminate discrimination against people living with HIV or AIDS at the workplace. The ministry plans to legislate the HIV and AIDS in Workplace Policy by 2020. &lt;ref name="legislate2020"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/13/new-regulation-eliminate-discrimination-against-people-hiv-and-workplace-soon-update |title=New regulation to eliminate discrimination against people with HIV and at workplace soon (Updated)|publisher=The Sun Daily |access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, it is reported that the Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC) is currently working with the Ministry of Human Resources on a policy to ensure that people with HIV/AIDS including those receiving treatment are not discriminated when it comes to employment. &lt;ref name="thesunoct2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2018/10/16/no-more-discrimination-those-hivaids-employment-mac |title=No more discrimination of those with HIV/AIDS in employment: MAC|publisher=The Sun Daily |access-date=1 November 2018|date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
The first line of highly active antiretroviral therapy is provided for free in Malaysia by the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Ministry of Health]] since 2006.&lt;ref name="MOHHIVguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.gov.my/images/gallery/Garispanduan/HIVGUIDELINES.pdf |title=Guidelines for the Management of Adult HIV Infection with Antiretroviral Therapy |publisher=Ministry of Health |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 28% of HIV/AIDS patients seek consistent treatment as the awareness among patients to get treatment was still low because they were ashamed to seek treatment and did not know about the various types of treatment provided by the government to help them fight the disease.&lt;ref name="28percent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1762255 |title=Only 28% of HIV/AIDS patients seek consistent treatment: Dr Hilmi |publisher=The Sun Daily |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government hopes the figure will reach 90% in line with the National Strategic Plan Ending AIDS 2016-2030.&lt;ref name="28percent"/&gt;

In September 2018, "HIV Connect", a self–paced, online learning platform that is designed for primary care physicians and other healthcare practitioners in Malaysia was launched. The online learning platform is a joint effort between the Malaysian AIDS Foundation (MAF) and the Malaysian Society for HIV Medicine (MASHM) to educate doctors regarding care and management of HIV/AIDS patients. &lt;ref name="HIVconnect2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmgazette.com/hiv-connect-for-primary-care-physicians-and-healthcare-practitioners/ |title=HIV Connect for Primary Care Physicians and Healthcare Practitioners |publisher=The Malaysian Medical Gazette |access-date=1 November 2018|date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories in the time of cholera: Racial profiling during a medical nightmare. Univ of California Press, 2003 pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, the [[mortality rate]] was 318 per 100,000 population for diseases of the [cardiac system], 156 for [[cancers]], 634 for external causes (including drowning, self-harm, violence, falls, road accidents etc, 1126 for communicable diseases such as chest infections, [[syphilis]], [[meningitis]], and 654 for certain conditions originating before birth.&lt;ref&gt;GBD Profile Venezuela http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/country_profiles/GBD/ihme_gbd_country_report_venezuela.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several transmissible diseases, including [[dengue fever]], [[malaria]], [[measles]], and [[tuberculosis]], reappeared in Venezuela. In 1999 an estimated 62,000 Venezuelans were living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]); and in 2001 an estimated 2,000 people died from AIDS. At the end of 2003, the percentage of the population between the ages of 15 to 49 with [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV)/AIDS was 0.7. In 2000, 85% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population had access to improved water. Improved [[sanitation]] was available to 71% of the urban population and 48% of the rural population. In August 2001, President [[Hugo Chávez]] announced a national campaign to fight the dengue fever epidemic that had infected 24,000 and killed four. Child immunization for measles in 2002 (as a percentage of under 12 months) dropped to 78%, compared with 84% in 1999.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In August 2014, Venezuela was the only country in Latin America where the incidence of malaria was increasing, allegedly due to illegal mining and in 2013, Venezuela registered the highest number of cases of malaria in the past 50 years, with 300 of 100,000 Venezuelans being infected with the disease.

In April 2017 Venezuela’s health ministry reported that maternal mortality had jumped by 65% in 2016 and that the number of infant deaths rose by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/world-week/21721971-politics-week|title=Politics this week|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that the number of cases of malaria was up by 76%.&lt;ref&gt;. https://www.economist.com/news/world-week/21721971-politics-week&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry had not reported health data in two years, and none has been reported since.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt; In May, Maduro sacked the health minister, [[Antonieta Caporale]], for publishing the damning statistics.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;.

In November 2017 the Venezuelan Society of Public Health informed that a total of 857 cases of measles, from which 465 had been confirmed, had been registered. The [[Pan American Health Organization]] reported that at least 71% of the reported cases of measles in 2017 occurred in Venezuela&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/crisis-humanitaria/venezuela-acumula-465-casos-confirmados-sarampion_214036|title=Venezuela acumula 465 casos confirmados de sarampión|first=El|last=Nacional|date=4 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Hidradenitis suppurativa''' ('''HS'''), also known as '''acne inversa''', is a long term [[skin disease]] characterized by the occurrence of inflamed and swollen [[lesions|lumps]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012&gt;{{cite journal| title =Clinical Practice: Hidradenitis Suppurativa| journal =N Engl J Med| date =January 12, 2012| author =Gregor B.E.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The exact cause is usually unclear but believed to involve a combination of [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; About a third of people with the disease have an affected family member.&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; Other risk factors include [[obesity]] and [[smoking]].&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; The condition is not [[infectious]], related to [[hygiene]], or to the use of [[deodorant]].&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=GARD2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidradenitis suppurativa|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6658/hidradenitis-suppurativa|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|accessdate=27 October 2017|language=en|date=2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728010703/https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6658/hidradenitis-suppurativa/|archivedate=28 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying mechanism is believed to involve either a dysfunction of [[apocrine sweat glands]] or [[hair follicles]].&lt;ref name=NORD2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt; Diagnosis is based on the symptoms.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
There is no known cure.&lt;ref name=GARD2017/&gt; Warm baths may be tried in those with mild disease.&lt;ref name=GARD2017/&gt; Cutting open the lesions to allow them to drain does not result in significant benefit.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; While [[antibiotics]] are commonly used, evidence for their use is poor.&lt;ref name=GARD2017/&gt; [[Immunosuppressive medication]] may also be tried.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In those with more severe disease [[laser therapy]] or surgery to remove the affected skin may be carried out.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Rarely a skin lesion may develop into [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name=GHR2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
It is estimated to affect between 1% and 4% of people.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Females have the condition about three times more often than males.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Onset is typically in young adulthood and may become less common after 50 years old.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; It was first described some time between 1833 and 1839 by [[Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau|Alfred Velpeau]].&lt;ref name=NORD2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jemec|first1=Gregor|last2=Revuz|first2=Jean|last3=Leyden|first3=James J.|title=Hidradenitis Suppurativa|date=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540331018|page=5|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hpKFsXwcKlgC&amp;pg=PA5|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043436/https://books.google.ca/books?id=hpKFsXwcKlgC&amp;pg=PA5|archivedate=28 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The cause of HS remains unknown and experts disagree over proposed causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hidradenitissuppurativa.html |title=Hidradenitis suppurativa |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=19 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916230638/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hidradenitissuppurativa.html |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Lesions occur in any body areas with hair follicles, although areas such as the axilla, groin, and perianal region are more commonly involved. This theory includes most of the following potential indicators:&lt;ref name="Schawartzprinciples"&gt;Schawartz's principles of surgery, 8th edition, self assessment an board review, chapter 15, the skin and subcutaneous tissue, question 16&lt;/ref&gt;

* Postpubescent individuals are more likely to exhibit HS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hidradenitis-suppurativa/DS00818 |title=Definition |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=19 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910150727/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hidradenitis-suppurativa/DS00818 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plugged [[apocrine]] (sweat) gland or [[hair follicle]]
* [[Primary hyperhidrosis|Excessive sweating]]
* [[Androgen]] dysfunction
* [[Genetic disorder]]s that alter [[cell (biology)|cell]] structure
* Patients with more advanced cases may find exercise intolerably painful, which may increase the rate of obesity among sufferers.

The historical understanding of the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands&lt;ref name="dermnetnz" /&gt; or dysfunctional [[hair follicle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-foundation.org/abouths/what.htm |title=HSF – What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? What is HS? |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706084625/http://www.hs-foundation.org/abouths/what.htm |archivedate=6 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly triggered by a blocked gland, create [[inflammation]], [[pain]], and a swollen [[lesion]].

=== Triggering factors ===

Several [[triggering]] factors should be taken into [[consideration]]:

* [[Obesity]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Slade DE, Powell BW, Mortimer PS |title= Hidradenitis suppurativa: pathogenesis and management|journal=Br J Plast Surg|year= 2003|volume=56|pages=451–61|doi=10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00177-2|pmid=12890458|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[exacerbating]] rather than a triggering factor,&lt;ref name="Jemec GBE 1989. p. 375-6"&gt;Jemec GBE. Body weight in hidradenitis suppurativa. In: Marks R, Plewig G, editors. Acne and Related disorders. London: Martin Dunitz; 1989. pp. 375–6.&lt;/ref&gt; through mechanical [[irritation]], [[occlusion miliaria|occlusion]], and [[Pruning (maceration)|skin maceration]].
* Tight clothing,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and clothing made of heavy, non-breathable materials.
* &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koning A, Lehmann C, Rompel R, Happle R |journal= Dermatology|doi=10.1159/000018126|year= 1999|volume=198|pages=261–4|title= of Hidradenitis suppurativa|issue=3|pmid=10393449}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deodorants]], [[depilation]] products, [[shaving]] of the affected area – their association with hidradenitis suppurativa is still an ongoing debate amongst researchers.&lt;ref name="pmid509057"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morgan WP, Leicester G |title= The role of depilation and deodorants in hidradenitis suppurativa|journal=Br J Surg|year= 1979|volume=66|pages= 853–6|pmid=509057|issue=12|doi=10.1002/bjs.1800661206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drugs]], in particular [[oral contraceptives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stellon AJ, Wakeling M |title= Hidradenitis suppurativa associated with use of oral contraceptives|journal=Br Med J|year= 1989|volume=298|pages= 28–9|doi=10.1136/bmj.298.6665.28|issue=6665}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., oral hormonal birth control; "the pill") and [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gupta AK, Knowles SR, Gupta MA, Jaunkalns R, Shear NH |title= Lithium therapy associated with hidradenitis suppurativa: case report and a review of the dermatologic side effects of lithium|journal= J Am Acad Dermatol|year=1995|volume=32|pages= 382–6|doi=10.1016/0190-9622(95)90410-7|pmid=7829746|issue=2 Pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hot and especially [[Humidity|humid]] climates&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1073117|Hidradenitis Suppurativa}}&lt;/ref&gt; (dry/arid climates often cause remission).

=== Predisposing factors ===

* [[genetics|Genetic]] factors:&lt;ref name="Jemec GBE 1989. p. 375-6"/&gt; an [[autosomal dominant]] [[inheritance]] pattern has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Der Werth JM, Williams HC, Raeburn JA |title= The clinical genetics of hidradenitis suppurativa revisited|journal=Br J Dermatol|year=2000|volume=142|pages= 947–53|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2000.03476.x|pmid=10809853|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Endocrine]] factors: sex hormones, especially an excess of [[androgens]], are thought to be involved, although the apocrine glands are not sensitive to these [[hormones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Barth JH, Kealey T |title= Androgen metabolism by isolated human axillary apocrine glands in hidradenitis suppurativa|journal=Br J Dermatol|year=1991|volume=125|pages= 304–8|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1991.tb14162.x|pmid=1954117|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often have outbreaks before their [[menstruation|menstrual period]] and after [[pregnancy]]; HS severity usually decreases during pregnancy and after [[menopause]].

Some cases have been found to result from mutations in the [[NCSTN]], [[PSEN1]] or [[PSENEN]] genes. The genes produce proteins that are all components of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. This complex cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins, which is an important step in several chemical [[Signal transduction|signaling pathways]]. One of these pathways, known as [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch signaling]], is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal [[immune system]] function. Studies suggest that mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1, or PSENEN gene impair Notch signaling in hair follicles. Although little is known about the mechanism, abnormal Notch signaling appears to promote the development of nodules and lead to [[inflammation]] in the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hidradenitis-suppurativa|title=hidradenitis suppurativa|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905190522/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hidradenitis-suppurativa|archivedate=5 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
=== Stages ===
[[File:Hidradenitis.png|thumb|A case of hidradenitis suppurativa]]
HS presents itself in three stages.&lt;ref name="dermnetnz"&gt;{{DermNet|acne/hidradenitis-suppurativa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs-usa.org/hidradenitis_suppurativa.htm |title=HS-USA :: What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617013637/http://www.hs-usa.org/hidradenitis_suppurativa.htm |archivedate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large [[spectrum]] of clinical severity and the severe impact on [[quality of life]], a reliable method for evaluating HS severity is needed.

==== Hurley's staging system ====

This is historically the first classification system proposed, and is still in use for the classification of patients with skin/dermatologic [[diseases]] (i.e., [[psoriasis]], HS, [[acne]]). Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of [[Wound healing|cicatrization]] and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for [[clinical trials]] in the past and is a useful basis to approach [[therapy]] for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley's staging system, which is simple and relies on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] extent of the diseased [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] the patient has. Hurley's three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are:&lt;ref&gt;Hurley HJ. Axillary hyperhidrosis, apocrine bromhidrosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and familial benign pemphigus: surgical approach. In: Roenigk RK, Roenigk HH, editors. Dermatologic surgery. Marcel Dekker, New York, 1989, pp. 729–739.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage
! Characteristics
|-
| I
| Solitary or multiple isolated abscess formation without scarring or sinus tracts  (A few minor sites with rare inflammation; may be mistaken for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]].)
|-
| II
| Recurrent abscesses, single or multiple widely separated [[lesions]], with sinus tract formation.  (Frequent [[inflammation]] restrict movement and may require minor [[surgery]] such as [[incision and drainage]].)
|-
| III
| Diffuse or broad involvement across a regional area with multiple interconnected sinus tracts and abscesses  ([[Inflammation]] of sites to the size of golf balls, or sometimes baseballs; scarring develops, including [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] tracts of infection – see [[fistula]].  Obviously, patients at this stage may be unable to function.)
|}

==== Sartorius staging system ====

The Sartorius staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley's. Sartorius ''et al.'' suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess treatment effects in clinical trials during research. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the disease severity in individual patients. The elements of this staging system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sartorius K, Lapins J, Emtestam L, Jemec GB |title= Suggestions for uniform outcome variables when reporting treatment effects in hidradenitis suppurativa|journal=Br J Dermatol |year=2003|volume=149|issue=1|pages=211–213|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05390.x|pmid=12890229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Anatomic]] regions involved (axilla, groin gluteal, or other region or inframammary region left or right)
* Number and types of [[lesions]] involved (abscesses, [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], [[fistulas]] [actually sinuses], scars, points for lesions of all regions involved)
* The distance between lesions, in particular the longest distance between two relevant lesions (i.e., nodules and fistulas in each region or size if only one lesion present)
* The presence of normal skin in between lesions (i.e., are all lesions clearly separated by normal skin?)

Points are accumulated in each of the above categories, and added to give both a regional and total score. In addition, the authors recommend adding a visual analog scale for pain or using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI, or the Skindex) when assessing HS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Quality of life impairment in hidradenitis suppurativa: a study of 61 cases |pmid=17097366|year=2007|last1=Wolkenstein|first1=P|last2=Loundou|first2=A|last3=Barrau|first3=K|last4=Auquier|first4=P|last5=Revuz|first5=J|author6=Quality of Life Group of the French Society of Dermatology|volume=56|issue=4|pages=621–3|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.08.061|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment==
Treatment depends upon presentation and severity of the disease. Due to the poorly studied nature of the disease, the effectiveness of the drugs and therapies listed below is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingram|first1=JR|last2=Woo|first2=PN|last3=Chua|first3=SL|last4=Ormerod|first4=AD|last5=Desai|first5=N|last6=Kai|first6=AC|last7=Hood|first7=K|last8=Burton|first8=T|last9=Kerdel|first9=F|last10=Garner|first10=SE|last11=Piguet|first11=V|title=Interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa: a Cochrane systematic review incorporating GRADE assessment of evidence quality.|journal=The British Journal of Dermatology|date=May 2016|volume=174|issue=5|pages=970–8|pmid=26801356|doi=10.1111/bjd.14418|pmc=5021164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible treatments include the following:

=== Lifestyle ===
Warm baths may be tried in those with mild disease.&lt;ref name=GARD2017/&gt; Weight loss and stopping smoking is also recommended.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

=== Medication ===
* [[Antibiotics]]: taken by mouth, these are used for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than to treat infection. Most effective is a combination of [[rifampicin]] and clindamycin given concurrently for 2–3 months. A few popular antibiotics include [[tetracycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[clindamycin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Scheinfeld N |title=Hidradenitis suppurativa: A practical review of possible medical treatments based on over 350 hidradenitis patients|journal=Dermatology Online Journal |volume= 19|issue=4 |pages=1 |year=2013 |pmid= 24021361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topical clindamycin has been shown to have an effect in double-blind placebo controlled studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clemmenson OJ|title= Topical treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa with clindamycin|journal= Int J Dermatol|year= 1983|volume= 22|pages=325–8|pmid=6347922|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1983.tb02150.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corticosteroid]] injections. Also known as intralesional steroids: can be particularly useful for localized disease, if the drug can be prevented from escaping via the sinuses.
* [[Antiandrogen]] therapy: hormonal therapy with [[cyproterone acetate]] and [[ethinylestradiol]] proved effective in randomized, controlled trials. Dosages reported have been very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mortimer PS, Dawber RP, Gales MA, Moore RA |title= A double blind controlled cross-over trial of cyproterone acetate in females with hidradenitis suppurativa|journal= Br J Dermatol |year=1986|volume= 115|pages=263–8|pmid=2944534|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1986.tb05740.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]] or subcutaneous infusion of anti-inflammatory (anti-[[TNF-alpha]]) drugs such as [[infliximab]], and  [[etanercept]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Cusack C, Buckley C |title=Etanercept: effective in the management of hidradenitis suppurativa |journal=Br.

=== Surgery ===

When the process becomes chronic, wide surgical excision is the procedure of choice. Wounds in the affected area do not heal by [[secondary intention]], and immediate or delayed application of a split-thickness [[skin graft]] is an option.&lt;ref name="Schawartzprinciples" /&gt;
Another option is covering the defect with a so-called perforator flap. With this technique the (mostly totally excised) defect is covered with living tissue 'stolen' from the area nearby. For example, the axilla with a fully excised defect of 15 × 7&amp;nbsp;cm can be covered with a so-called TAP flap (thoracodorsal artery perforator flap)

=== Laser hair removal ===

The 1064 [[nanometer]] [[wavelength]] laser for hair removal may aid in the treatment of HS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5vw402nf |title=Hidradenitis suppurativa: A practical review of possible medical treatments based on over 350 hidradenitis patients. |accessdate=2014-03-04 |website=escholarship.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306231203/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5vw402nf |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A randomized control study has shown improvement in HS lesions with the use of an Nd:YAG laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xu LY, Wright DR, Mahmoud BH, Ozog DM, Mehregan DA, Hamzavi IH |title=Histopathologic study of hidradenitis suppurativa following long-pulsed 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser treatment |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=21–8 | date=January  2011 |pmid=20855672 |doi=10.1001/archdermatol.2010.245 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==

In stage III disease, fistulae left undiscovered, undiagnosed, or untreated, can lead to the development of [[squamous cell carcinoma]], a rare [[cancer]], in the [[anus]] or other affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Talmant JC, Bruant-Rodier C, Nunziata AC, Rodier JF, Wilk A |title=[Squamous cell carcinoma arising in Verneuil's disease: two cases and literature review] |language=French |journal=Ann Chir Plast Esthet|volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=82–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16488526 |doi=10.1016/j.anplas.2005.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Short KA, Kalu G, Mortimer PS, Higgins EM |title=Vulval squamous cell carcinoma arising in chronic hidradenitis suppurativa |journal=Clin.

== History ==

* From 1833 to 1839 in a series of three publications, [[Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau|Velpeau]] identified and described a disease we now know as hidradenitis suppurativa.&lt;ref&gt;Velpeau A. Aissele. In: Bechet Jeune Z: Dictionnaire de médecine, on Repertoire Générale des Sciences Medicals sous le Rapport Theorique et Pratique. 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1854, [[Aristide Auguste Stanislas Verneuil|Verneuil]] described hidradenitis suppurativa as ''hidrosadénite Phlegmoneuse''. This is how HS obtained its alternate name "Verneuil's disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verneuil AS |title=Etudes sur les tumeurs de la peau et quelques maladies de glandes sudoripares |trans-title=Studies on skin tumors; some diseases of the sweat glands |language=French |journal=Archives of General Medicine |year=1854 |volume=94 |pages=693–705}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1922, Schiefferdecker hypothesized a [[pathogenic]] link between "acne inversa" and human sweat glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schiefferdecker B |title=Die Hautdrüsen der Menschen und der Säugetiere, ihre histologische und rassenanatomische Bedeutung sowie die muscularis sexualis |trans-title=The skin glands of humans and mammals, their histological and anatomical racial meaning and muscularis sexualis |publisher=Schweizerbart E |location=Stuttgart |year=1922}}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, Pillsbury et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pillsbury DM, Shelley WB, Kligmann AM |chapter=Bacterial infections of the skin |editor=Pillsbury DM |title=Dermatoloy |edition=1st |location=Philadelphia |year=1956 |pages=482–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term ''[[Cellulitis#Differential diagnosis|follicular occlusion triad]]'' for the common association of hidradenitis suppurativa, [[acne conglobata]] and [[dissecting cellulitis of the scalp]]. Modern clinical research still employs Pillsbury's terminology for these conditions' descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;''Triads in Dermatology''; Prachi G Agrawal, Uday S Khopkar, [...], and Sunil N Mishra; ; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778772/#|Indian J Dermatol. 2013 Sep-Oct; 58(5): 346–351]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975, Plewig and Kligman, following Pillsbury's research path, modified the "acne triad", replacing it with the "acne tetrad: acne triad, plus [[pilonidal sinus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plewig |first1=Gerd |last2=Kligman |first2=Albert M. |chapter=Acne Conglobata |year=1975 |pages=168–203 |editor1-first=Gerd |editor1-last=Plewig |editor2-first=Albert M. |editor2-last=Kligman |title=Acne: Morphogenesis and Treatment |isbn=978-3-642-96246-2 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-96246-2_11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plewig and Kligman's research follows in Pillsbury's footsteps, offering explanations of the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.
* In 1989, Plewig and Steger's research led them to rename hidradenitis suppurativa, calling it "acne inversa" – which is not still used today in [[medical terminology]], although some individuals still use this outdated term.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Plewig G, Steger M |chapter=Acne inversa (alias acne triad, acne tetrad or hidradenitis suppurativa) |veditors=Marks R, Plewig G |title=Acne and Related Disorders |location=London |publisher=Martin Dunitz |year=1989 |pages=345–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A surgeon from Paris, Velpeau described an unusual inflammatory process with formation of superficial [[axilla]]ry, sub[[mammary]], and [[perianal]] abscesses, in a series of three publications from 1833 to 1839. One of his colleagues also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term ''hidrosadénite phlegmoneuse'' about 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former [[pathogenetic]] model of acne inversa, which is considered [[inflammation]] of sweat glands as the primary cause of hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922, Schiefferdecker suspected a pathogenic association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956 Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with [[acne conglobata]] and perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) as the "acne triad". Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, [[pilonidal sinus]]. Plewig ''et al.'' noted that this new "acne tetrad" includes all the elements found in the original "acne triad", in addition to a fourth element, pilonidal sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term "acne inversa", indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as "Verneuil disease".

=== Other names ===

Hidradenitis suppurativa has been referred to by multiple names in the literature, as well as in various cultures.  Some of these are also used to describe different diseases, or specific instances of this disease.&lt;ref name="HSUSA" /&gt;

* [[Acne conglobata]] – not really a [[synonym]] – this is a similar process but in classic [[acne]] areas of chest and back

* Apocrine acne – an outdated term based on the disproven concept that apocrine glands are primarily involved, though many do suffer with apocrine gland infection
* Apocrinitis – another outdate term based on the same thesis
* Fox-den disease – a term not used in medical literature, based on the deep [[fox]] den–like sinuses
* Hidradenitis supportiva – a misspelling

==Terminology==
Although hidradenitis suppurativa is often referred to as ''acne inversa'', it is not a form of [[acne vulgaris|acne]] and lacks the core defining features of acne such as the presence of closed [[comedone]]s and increased [[sebum]] production.&lt;ref name="Dessinioti2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dessinioti|first1=C|last2=Katsambas|first2=A|last3=Antoniou|first3=C|title=Hidradenitis suppurrativa (acne inversa) as a systemic disease|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|date=May–June 2014|volume=32|issue=3|pages=397–408|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2013.11.006|pmid=24767187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is based on the differential in atmospheric pressure, directly correlated with the observer's frequency of and level of experience in high-altitude metabolism. As the external pressure decreases, the difference in pressure between the gas within the body and the atmosphere outside is higher, and the urge to expel gas to relieve the pressure is greater. Consistent with [[Boyle's law]], controlling for dietary variance, the amount of gas produced is constant in mass, but the volume increases as the external pressure decreases.

The feeling of fullness or need to expel brought on by this differential in atmospheric pressure has been verified by studies involving military pilots subjected to pressure changes simulating flight.&lt;ref name="pmid5765206"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AJ, Allen TH, Bancroft RW |title=Abdominal gas volume at altitude and at ground level |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=177–81 |date=February 1969 |pmid=5765206 |doi= |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5765206 |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infectious disease''', also known as '''infectious diseases''', '''infectious medicine''', '''infectious disease medicine''' or '''infectiology''', is a [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] dealing with the diagnosis, control and treatment of infections. An infectious disease (ID) specialist's practice may consist largely of managing nosocomial ([[hospital-acquired infection|hospital-acquired]]) infections, or it may be out-patient based.

==Scope==
ID specialists typically serve as consultants to other physicians in cases of complex infections, and often manage patients with [[HIV/AIDS]] and other forms of immunodeficiency.&lt;ref name="IDSA What is"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IDSA : What is an ID Specialist|url = http://www.idsociety.org/ID_Specialist|website = www.idsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many common infections are treated by physicians without formal expertise in ID, the ID specialist may be consulted for cases where an infection is difficult to diagnose. They may also be asked to help determine the cause of a fever of unknown origin. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abmsdirectory.com/pdf/Resources_guide_physicians.pdf|title = ABMS Guide to Medical Specialties|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name="IDSA What is"/&gt;

ID specialists can practice both in hospitals (inpatient) and clinics (outpatient). In hospitals, ID specialists help ensure the timely diagnosis and treatment of acute infections by recommending the appropriate diagnostic tests to identify the source of the infection and by recommending the appropriate antibiotic to treat the infection. For certain types of infections, involvement of an ID specialists may improve patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Value of an Infectious Diseases Specialist {{!}} Safe HealthcareSafe Healthcare {{!}} Blogs {{!}} CDC|url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/safehealthcare/2013/10/25/the-value-of-an-infectious-diseases-specialist/|website = blogs.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinic, ID specialists can provide long-term care to patients with chronic infections such as HIV.

== History ==
ID is historically associated with [[travel medicine]] and [[tropical medicine]], as many diseases acquired in tropical and subtropical areas are infectious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrcptb.org.uk/trainingandcert/ST3-SpR/Pages/Infectious-Diseases.aspx |title=Infectious Diseases |author=Joint Royal Colleges Postgraduate Training Board |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
ID specialists employ a variety of diagnostic tests to help identify the pathogen that is causing an infection. Common tests include [[Gram staining]], [[blood cultures]], [[serology|serological tests]], [[genotyping]], and [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]].

==Treatments==
ID specialists employ a variety of antimicrobial agents to help treat infections. The type of agent used depends on the organism that is causing the infection. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections; antiviral agents treat viral infections; and antifungal agents treat fungal infections.

'''Integrated social work''' refers to the use of a [[holistic]] approach in the practice of [[social work]]. It is a method of using all the methods of social work in coming up with lasting solutions to the problems and situations of individuals.

An example occurs in working with [[child]]ren who are [[juvenile delinquency|in conflict with]] the [[law]]. A social worker, to ensure effective problem solving does not only deal with the [[Minor (law)|juvenile]], but also must involve the [[family]] or families involved and the community in which the child lives. To add to his or her knowledge base of solving such problems, the social worker thus needs to conduct [[social research]] and [[social administration|administration]].

In integrated social work, there is a need to use these social methods together with the theories, values, and [[ethics]] of social work practice.

The '''International Farming Systems Digital Collection''' within the [[University of Florida Digital Collections]] includes teaching, research, and extension resources related to the ''[[Farming Systems]]'' approach to international agricultural development.

The collection materials come from the personal library of [[Peter E. Hildebrand]] who is a founder of Farming Systems. The collection's focus includes materials that supported putting farmers first and increasing number of [[smallholder]] farmers and their heterogeneous livelihood systems on a global scale. One of the two core areas covered is the development over time of methods that help development professionals understand the livelihood of smallholder farming and its limited resource households. The second core area includes literature describing the diverse livelihood strategies of the households living in various parts of the world. These limited resource households represent nearly a billion people struggling to survive on a daily basis.

'''Isometric exercise''' or '''isometrics''' are a type of [[strength training]] in which the [[joint]] angle and [[muscle]] length do not change during contraction (compared to [[Concentric contraction|concentric]] or [[Eccentric contraction|eccentric]] contractions, called dynamic/isotonic movements). Isometrics are done in static positions, rather than being dynamic through a [[range of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/fitness/expert-answers/isometric-exercises/faq-20058186 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140601223042/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/fitness/expert-answers/isometric-exercises/faq-20058186 | title= Are isometric exercises a good way to build strength?|publisher=Mayoclinic.com|accessdate = 2014-06-01 | archivedate = 2014-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
An isometric exercise is a form of exercise involving the static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. The term "isometric" combines the Greek words "Isos" (equal) and "metria" (measuring), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle and the angle of the joint do not change, though contraction strength may be varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/isometric-exercises.html|title=Article on static strength training|publisher=Sport-fitness-advisor.com|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to ''[[isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic contractions]]'', in which the contraction strength does not change, though the muscle length and joint angle do.

==Overcoming versus yielding==
In an overcoming isometric, the joint and muscle work against an immovable object. In contrast, in a yielding isometric, the joint and muscle are held in a static position while opposed by resistance.

In the context of the [[bench press]], an example of a yielding isometric would be holding the bar at a given place even though it could be pressed higher, and an overcoming isometric would be pressing the bar up into the safety guards of a squat cage that prevent pushing the bar any higher.

The distinction is that in a yielding isometric, one is pressing roughly the exact amount of pressure needed to negate the resistance, neither dropping nor lifting it, whereas in an overcoming isometric, one can be exerting more force and simply unable to move it. The yielding wavers slightly into concentric and eccentric actions due to inexact control, whereas the overcoming isometric is more purely isometric and can involve more variation in the force used, since one can press harder without the bar moving.

===Unweighted===
In overcoming isometrics, subjects can safely do 100 percent effort, and continue with 100 percent available effort as strength is depleted, allowing longer time under (maximum volitional) tension.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; This article lacks reliable citations|date=June 2014}}

===Weighted===
Yielding isometrics allow measurable progress. Free-weight enthusiasts tend to believe the "back pressure" of real weight is superior for building strength, possibly triggering a productive "fight or flight" response. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; This article lacks reliable citations|date=June 2014}} However, the extremely heavy weights needed by advanced subjects can be an inconvenience, and present a risk of injury.

==Isometric resistance==
[[File:Plank.jpg|thumb|Plank]]
Resistance in isometric exercises typically involves contractions of the muscle using:
* The body's own structure and ground (e.g., yoga poses such as Plank or the Warrior variations)
* Structural items (e.g., pushing against a fence or ISOPHIT machine)
* Free weights, weight machines, or [[Strength training|elastic equipment]] (e.g., holding a weight in a fixed position)
* kBox type of [[isoinertial]] device
* Pressure-plate-type equipment that has a digital display of maximal force

Depending on the goal of the exercise, the exertion can be maximal or sub-maximal.

==History==
They were discovered/founded by Dr. Donald "Don" Salls in 1962. He is the oldest living Alabama football player, playing between 1940-42 playing before Paul "Bear" Bryant was even a coach, and got his PhD in Education. He still keeps up his strength today (2018) at 99 years old. 

Isometric exercises were first brought to the modern public's attention in the early days of [[physical culture]], the precursor to [[bodybuilding]]. Many of the great bodybuilders of the day incorporated isometric exercises into their training regimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spmessenger.com/strength/isometric.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080129094625/http://www.spmessenger.com/strength/isometric.html | title= Strength Training - Isometric Exercise|publisher=SPMESSENGER.com|accessdate = 2008-11-10 | archivedate = 2008-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of today's training protocols incorporate isometric exercises, which are often made into parts of normal, [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic exercises]]. For example, during a set of [[Row (weight-lifting)|seated rows]], a subject can hold their position when the handles are closest to their chest in order to "squeeze" the muscle, in an effort to further strain the muscle.

Contrary to popular opinion, The [[Charles Atlas]] "[[Dynamic Tension]]" course did not use any true isometric exercises but, rather, dynamic self-resistance; that is, pitting one muscle group against another, along with [[calisthenics]].

==Medical uses==
Isometric exercises can also be used at the bedside to differentiate various [[heart murmur]]s; the murmur of [[mitral regurgitation]] gets louder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pediatrics.uchicago.edu/chiefs/ClinicCurriculum/documents/WCEvaluationofMurmursintheClinicSetting.pdf | title = Evaluation of Cardiac Murmurs in the Clinic Setting | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Ching | first = W | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217153301/http://pediatrics.uchicago.edu/chiefs/ClinicCurriculum/documents/WCEvaluationofMurmursintheClinicSetting.pdf | archivedate = 2008-12-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the quieter murmur of [[aortic stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy J, Aronow WS, Prakash R |title=The effect of isometric exercise on the systolic murmur of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis |journal=Chest |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=395–397 |year=1975 |pmid=1168115 |doi=10.1378/chest.67.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be used to prevent disuse syndrome in a limb that has been immobilized by a cast following a fracture.

==Seated isometric exercises==
One benefit of isometric exercise is that it can be done pretty much anywhere using one's own body weight.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Comparison with dynamic exercises==
{{See also|Weight training#Weight training versus isometric training}}
Isometric training maximally increases strength over all joint angles the exercises are performed at, similar to how dynamic exercises increase strength throughout the full [[range of motion]], but with less risk of injury than weight training (no weights).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindh M |title=Increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles |journal=Scand J Rehabil Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–6 |year=1979 |pmid=419396 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has confirmed the finding that every skill has a specific strength component that must be practiced with the skill itself. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
When a subject performs a dynamic resistance movement, supportive muscle groups can work isometrically. For example, the abdominal musculature during a squat and the muscles of the forearm when gripping a dumbbell or barbell.

==NASA studies==
[[NASA]] has researched the use of isometrics in preventing [[muscle atrophy]] experienced by [[astronauts]] as a result of living in a [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] environment. Isometrics, [[Eccentric contraction|muscle lengthening]] and [[Concentric contraction|muscle shortening]] exercises were studied and compared. The outcome showed that while all three exercise types did indeed promote muscle growth, isometrics failed to prevent a decrease in the amount of [[Muscle contraction|contractile proteins]] found in the muscle tissue. The result was muscle degradation at a molecular level. As contractile [[proteins]] are what cause muscles to contract and give them their [[physical strength]], NASA concluded that isometrics may not be the best way for astronauts to maintain muscle tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/livingthings/10dec_muscles.html | title = Why do Workouts Work? | date = 2004-10-12 | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | publisher = [[NASA]] | last = Barry | first = PL |author2=Phillips, T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14854">[[File:An introduction to dermatology (1905) nodular leprosy.jpg|thumb|Man With Leprosy]] Although [[leprosy]], or [[Hansen's Disease]], was never an epidemic in [[The United States]], cases of leprosy have been reported in [[Louisiana]] as early as the 18th century. The first leprosarium in the continental United States existed in [[Carville, Louisiana]] from 1894-1999 and [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] is the home of the only institution in the United States that is exclusively devoted to leprosy consulting, research, and training.

==History==

===18th Century===
*The route of Leprosy into [[Louisiana]] has not been resolved. However, during the 18th century, while the Spanish controlled Louisiana, Spanish physicians and surgeons noted that many of the Africans brought to Louisiana during the slave trade were afflicted with Leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Z. (1989). Leprosy, Racism, and Public Health: Social Policy in Chronic Disease Control. Boulder: Westview Press, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to City Counsel records, in 1776, the Spanish governor of Louisiana, Antonio de Ulloa, tried to banish all lepers to the outskirt of the colony. Three years later, after much objection from citizens of the colony and a devastating hurricane, this project was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1785, under the rule of a new governor, Don Estevan Miro, the issue of what should be done about leprosy was raised again. The solution was to erect Louisiana's first leprosarium. According to the minutes of an April 1784 City Council meeting, it was announced that the governor built a hospital, "so that the lepers may be kept together." This leprosarium was known as "La Terre des Lepreux," or Leper's Land. In 1799, the leprosarium was the home of five lepers. Due to complaints, allegations of unsanitary conditions at the leprosarium, and allegations and findings that none of the five inmates had leprosy, the leprosarium was closed in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th Century===
*After the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the state had very few written records concerning leprosy until the mid-1800s.
*On the 1850 U.S. Census, leprosy was listed as a cause of death. Four deaths were recorded from Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Beginning in 1857, Annual reports from [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)]], indicated that the hospital freely admitted those with leprosy. The large number of cases at Charity Hospital remained unreported to the general public until 1888. Releasing this data made some New Orleans residents more conscious of leprosy that they had previously been. This data, known as the Blanc Data, which is named after the doctor that released this information, informed New Orleans citizens and public health officials that, contrary to popular belief, leprosy was an endemic in New Orleans, especially among white citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 1880s, the incidence rate of leprosy in Louisiana was 4.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;(2008). Leprosy (Hansen's Disease). Louisiana Office of Public Health – Infectious Disease Epidemiology Section – Annual Report, 1. Retrieved from: http://www.dhh.state.la.us/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/annual/LaIDAnnual_Leprosy.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
*By the 1890s, most accepted that leprosy existed in Louisiana, that no one knew how the disease was transmitted, and that there was no cure.  When a story in the Daily Picayune alerted residents that a physician, under state contract, was caring for leprosy patients in a "pest-house" near Bayou St. John in New Orleans, a clamor went up for new laws to be passed.
*The Louisiana Leper Home, an institution to quarantine lepers living in Louisiana, was opened in 1894 in [[Carville, Louisiana]]. The first seven patients of the leprosarium were from New Orleans and arrived at the leprosarium on December 1, 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, M. (2004). Carville: Remembering Leprosy in America. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the humble beginnings of the first in-patient hospital in the U.S. for the treatment of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to several name changes over the years, the treatment center was frequently referred to as "Carville" because of its location. The goal of this treatment center was to provide a place for patients to be isolated and treated humanely.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*By 1896, there were 31 patients at the leprosarium. Four Catholic sisters from the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul came to care for these patients.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
*In 1921, the U.S. Public Health Service took over the facility and funded a budget toward leprosy research.
*By the late 1920s, Louisiana's incidence rate of leprosy reached an all-time high of 12 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;(2008). Leprosy (Hansen's Disease). Louisiana Office of Public Health – Infectious Disease Epidemiology Section – Annual Report, 1. Retrieved from: http://www.dhh.state.la.us/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/annual/LaIDAnnual_Leprosy.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; However, leprosy never became an epidemic in Louisiana and at the most residents Carville ever had was about 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
*By the early 1990s, the leprosarium had a budget of $21 million in U.S. per year. However, with fewer patients in the hospital and medical advances for the treatment of leprosy, the leprosarium lost funding and subsequently shut down in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Boulard, G. (1993, November 29). Carville La Leper Colony. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-29/news/mn-62114_1_leper-colony&lt;/ref&gt;
*Out-patient care in several clinics around the United States supply primary treatment and medication to the 200 or so new cases diagnosed yearly in the US.

===21st Century===
*As of 2001, there were fifteen total leprosy, or Hansen's Disease, cases reported in Louisiana. Thirteen of those reported cases were endemic. These thirteen endemic cases came from thirteen different parishes in Louisiana. However, most of these cases were concentrated in the southern half of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeifer, L. A. (2002, August 27). Endemic Hansen's Disease in Louisiana -2001. Retrieved October 30, 2011, from National Hansen's Disease Programs website: http://www.hrsa.gov/hansensdisease/pdfs/hansens2001louisiana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life at Carville==
From 1894-1999, the leprosarium underwent several name changes: Louisiana Leper Home (1894), U.S. Marine Hospital No. 66 (1921), Gillis W. Long Hansen's (Leprosy) Disease Center (1986). Due to the various names, the leprosarium was commonly referred to as "Carville." Carville became known as the national leprosarium because all persons diagnosed with leprosy (Hansen's disease) in the U.S. were required, by law, to be quarantined and treated.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The leprosarium soon became a center for leprosy research.

===Identity===
Due to the social stigmas that surrounded leprosy in Louisiana, upon arriving at Carville, patients were encouraged to take on a new identity. As a result, many patients at Carville changed their names. Additionally, some patients had very limited contact with family members. Visitors were allowed, but the remote location made this difficult. Even the staff of the leprosarium seldom knew the patients' real names or knew what town they came from.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
*Numerous patients have written books, journals, and have done interviews about their times at Carville.
*Carville patients had an official publication called "The Star." &lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues dating from 1941 to 1999 can be found online at http://louisianadigitallibrary.org/islandora/object/lsuhsc-p15140coll52:collection&lt;nowiki/&gt;Louisiana Digital Library.

===Film===
*"Secret People" is a documentary that details personal accounts of men and women who were residents at Carville during the 20th century. It can be viewed online in its entirety at http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/secret_people.
*"The Triumph at Carville" premiered on PBS in March 2008. This film retells the history of Carville and provides insight into the lives of people affected by leprosy, including patients, family members of patients, and staff members.

===Leaving the leprosarium===
*Patients at Carville were often granted short leaves from the institution. However, they were not allowed to use public transportation and they had to return to Carville once their official leave period was over.
*Escapes and attempted escapes from Carville were reported. Most of the attempts and escapes were made by men. If apprehended, one type of punishment was a sentence in the Carville jail. A first time escape was usually punished with "30 days in jail". Most people escaped through holes in the barbed wire fence.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
When a resident of Carville died, he or she could be buried in the leprosarium's cemetery, if the family couldn't afford to bring the body home or the patient preferred to be buried at the hospital. Each patient received a tombstone that contained his or her name--either their real name or pseudonym--and case number.&lt;ref&gt;Triumph at Carville. (n.d.). Retrieved from PBS website: https://www.pbs.org/triumphatcarville/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personalities==
Many physicians in Louisiana have devoted their lives to researching leprosy. Additionally, numerous patients of Carville have worked to bring attention to the disease.
*In the 1940s, Dr. Guy Henry Faget, a physician at Carville, developed sulfone therapy to treat leprosy.
*During the 1950s, Dr. R. G. Cochrone, a consulting physician at Carville, developed the use of dapsone pills to treat leprosy.
*A patient, using the pseudonym Betty Martin while she was a resident of Carville, published an autobiography in 1950 entitled "Miracle at Carville." Her autobiography was on [[The New York Times Bestseller List]].  In 1959, also under the name Betty Martin, she published a follow-up titled "No One Must Ever Know".
*Stanley Stein, a resident of Carville published his autobiography in 1963. The book was titled "Alone No Longer"; his real name was Sidney Maurice Levyson and he died in the mid 1960s.  He was the founder and, for many years, the editor of "The Star".
*In the 1960s, Dr. Paul W. Brand began the first leprosy rehabilitation research program.

*On February 3, 1917, the United States Senate passed US Public Law 64-299, An Act to Provide for the Care and Treatment of Persons Afflicted with Leprosy and to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy in the United States.
*In 1920, the "Home" is sold by the State of Louisiana to the United States Federal Government for $35,000.
*1921, The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) takes operational control and the 'Home' becomes the United States Marine Hospital Number 66. . . The National Leprosarium of the United States.
*In 1982, The Health Resources and Services Administration: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, assumed responsibility for the management and operation of the leprosarium at Carville.
*In 1998, The U.S. Congress passed a bill to relocate the leprosarium to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

==Medical advances==
*The 1941 development of sulfone therapy, a type of chemotherapy, made leprosy non-contagious.&lt;ref&gt;Boulard, http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-29/news/mn-62114_1_leper-colony&lt;/ref&gt;
*Daspone pills became widely used for treating leprosy in the 1950s.
*In 1981, [[The World Health Organization]] recommended using a multi-drug treatment regimen to treat leprosy.
*In 2011, researchers at the National Hansen's Disease Program published their findings that leprosy in Louisiana and in other southern states may be linked to contact with armadillos. They came to this conclusion after finding that armadillos had the same strain of leprosy as some human patients in Louisiana did.
*Currently, researchers are trying to develop a leprosy vaccine and are trying to find new methods of detection.

'''Mary Elizabeth Switzer''' (February 16, 1900 - October 16, 1971) was an American [[Public administration|public administrator]] and [[social reformer]]. She is best remembered for her work on the 1954 [[Vocational Rehabilitation Act]], which provided a great expansion of [[vocational rehabilitation]] service for [[people with disabilities]]. She publicized the government's growing role in vocational rehabilitation and encouraged expansion of vocational rehabilitation projects among [[non-governmental organizations]].&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt;

==Education and career==
Switzer graduated from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1921 with a B.A. in international law and started working for the federal government: first as an assistant secretary to the Minimum Wage Board and then for [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]] under the [[Public Health Service]] and the [[Federal Security Agency]], becoming increasingly concerned with [[health care]] issues.&lt;ref name="elliott-headley"&gt;{{cite web |last=Elliott |first=Carol K. |author2=Joan L.

She retired in 1970 as the highest ranking female bureaucrat in the federal government&lt;ref name="aph"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tuttle |first=Dean |author2=Naomi Tuttle |title=Mary Elizabeth Switzer, inducted 2002 |work=Hall of fame: Leaders and legends of the blindness field |publisher=American Printing House of the Blind, Inc. |url=http://www.aph.org/hall/bios/switzer.html |accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became vice-president of the World Rehabilitation Fund until her death a year later.&lt;ref name="elliott-headley" /&gt;

Switzer was the first woman to serve on the Board of Directors at [[Georgetown University]] in 1969. She served as president of the National Rehabilitation Association from 1960 to 1961&lt;ref name="aph" /&gt; and as advisor to many American health organizations, including the [[Menninger Foundation]] and [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]].&lt;ref name="elliott-headley" /&gt; In recognition of her contributions to vocational rehabilitation, Switzer received the [[President's Certificate of Merit]] in 1948,&lt;ref name="elliott-headley" /&gt; the [[Albert Lasker Award]] in 1960 with [[Paul Wilson Brand]] and [[Gudmund Harlem]],&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt; the American Association of Workers for the Blind's Ambrose M. Shotwell Memorial Award in 1962,&lt;ref name="elliott-headley" /&gt; and the [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]] Award in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward Miner Gallaudet Award |url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/development_and_alumni_relations/alumni_relations/alumni_association_(guaa)/awards/gallaudet_award.html |work=Gallaudet University |publisher=Gallaudet University |accessdate=11 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020159/http://www.gallaudet.edu/development_and_alumni_relations/alumni_relations/alumni_association_(guaa)/awards/gallaudet_award.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzer received honorary degrees from [[Hofstra University]] in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honorary Degrees |url=http://www.hofstra.edu/about/about_hondegrees.html |work=Hofstra University |publisher=Hofstra University |accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gallaudet College]], [[Russell Sage College]], and five other universities.&lt;ref name="aph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15699">A '''medical animation''' is a short educational film, usually based around a physiological or surgical topic, that is rendered using 3D computer graphics. While it may be intended for an array of audiences, the medical animation is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients.

Early medical animations were limited to basic wire-frame models because of low processor speed. However, rapid evolution in microprocessor design and computer memory has led to animations that are significantly more intricate.

The medical animation may be viewed as a standalone visualization, or in combination with other sensory input devices, such as head-mounted displays, stereoscopic lenses, haptic gloves, interactive workstations, or [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]]s (CAVEs).

==History==
Though evolved from the field of realistic medical illustrations (such as those created by Flemish anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] in the 16th century), medical animations are also indebted to motion picture technology and computer-generated imagery.

The term ''medical animation'' predates the advent of computer-generated graphics by approximately three decades. Though the first computer animation was created at Bell Telephone Labs in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.arizona.edu/zajac/ZajacVideoPage.htm "The World's First Computer Animation: Created by Edward E. Zajac of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815112540/http://econ.arizona.edu/zajac/ZajacVideoPage.htm |date=2011-08-15 }} Eller College of Management. University of Arizona.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase "medical animation" appears in scholarly contexts as early as 1932 in the Journal of Biological Photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1517189 |year=1992 |last1=Bosse |first1=KK |title=The use of animated drawings in medical motion pictures |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=98–9 |journal=Journal of biological photography}}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed by Clarke and Hoshall, the term referred to two-dimensional illustrated motion pictures produced for inclusion in films screened for medical students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xJsvAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22medical+animation%22&amp;dq=%22medical+animation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BtO6TsG9IYXe0QGHhf3YCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBA ''Illustration: Its Technique and Application to the Sciences''.] Clarke CD and Hoshall EM. John D. Lucas Company. 1939. pp 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the computer-generated medical animation began in earnest in the early 1970s. The first description of the use of 3D computer graphics for a medical purpose can be found in an issue of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', dated 1975. Its authors, a team of researchers from the Departments of Chemistry and of Biochemistry and Biophysics at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], described the potential uses of medical animation for visualizing complex [[macromolecules]].

By the late 1980s, Angelo punzalan is hypebeast of physiological and surgical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1188383 |title=Protein crystal structures: Quicker, cheaper approaches |year=1975 |last1=Collins |first1=D. |last2=Cotton |first2=F. |last3=Hazen |first3=E. |last4=Meyer |first4=E. |last5=Morimoto |first5=C. |journal=Science |volume=190 |issue=4219 |pages=1047–53 |pmid=1188383}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that point, researchers had suggested that the 3D medical animations could illustrate physiological, molecular or anatomical concepts that might otherwise be infeasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0263-7855(89)80009-8 |title=Animation: A useful tool for protein molecular dynamicists, applied to hydrogen bonds in the active site of elastase |year=1989 |last1=Swanson |first1=Stanley M. |last2=Wesolowski |first2=Tomasz |last3=Geller |first3=Maciej |last4=Meyer |first4=Edgar F. |journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=240–2, 223–4 |pmid=2486826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's medical animation industry comprises one facet of the non-entertainment computer animation industry, which has annual revenues of $15 billion per year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Prayag A. [http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2005/10/14/stories/2005101402380800.htm "Medical animation gaining importance."] ''Hindu Business Line''. Bangalore. October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Patient Education===
A growing Gabb Pabalatess is the one of the greatest people in the world that explain surgical procedures or pharmaceutical mechanisms of action in terms simple enough for a layperson to understand. These animations may be found on hospital websites, in doctor's office workstations or via medical studios themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcaminohospital.org/Patient_Services/Health_Library/Medical_Animations "Medical animations."] El Camino Hospital. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Such animations may also appear on television shows and other popular entertainment venues as a way to educate an audience on a medical topic under discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OonrzhA0tDQ "Lip Cancer Surgery - 3D Medical Animation on Dr. Oz."] YouTube. December 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101012185709/http://www.amerra.com/patient-education-animation.php "Client: Memorial Hermann Healthcare System/University of Texas Medical School at Houston."] Amerra Advanced Medical Visualizations. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, this form of animation is used in-hospital. In this context, clips may be used in order to get fully informed consent from patients facing surgery or medical treatment. Likewise, studies have suggested that patient-educating medical animations may be able to reduce the rate of accidental wrong-site surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2010.11.018 |title=Animation program used to encourage patients or family members to take an active role for eliminating wrong-site, wrong-person, wrong-procedure surgeries: Preliminary evaluation |year=2011 |last1=See |first1=Lai-Chu |last2=Chang |first2=Yi-Hua |last3=Chuang |first3=Kai-Lan |last4=Lai |first4=Hui-Ru |last5=Peng |first5=Pei-I. |last6=Jean |first6=Wen-Chyi |last7=Wang |first7=Chao-Hui |journal=International Journal of Surgery |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=241–7 |pmid=21167326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical simulation===
Due to both the relative scarcity of cadavers to be used for surgical instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Agoreyo |first1=FO |url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/abs/article/view/40648 |title=Prosection In Place Of Human Dissection – Way Out Of Scarcity Of Cadaver – Review Article |journal=Annals of Biomedical Science |year=2003 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=69–73 |doi=10.4314/abs.v2i2.40648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the dwindling use of animals and patients who have not given consent, institutes may utilize medical animations as a way to teach doctors-to-be anatomical and surgical concepts. Such simulations may be viewed passively (as in the case of 3D medical animations included via CD-ROM in medical textbook packages) or using interactive controls. The stimulation of hand-eye skills using haptics is another possible use of medical animation technology, one that stems from the replacement of cadavers in surgical classrooms with task trainers and mannequins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcrc.2007.12.004 |title=The history of medical simulation |year=2008 |last1=Rosen |first1=Kathleen R. |journal=Journal of Critical Care |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=157–66 |pmid=18538206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of proportionally accurate virtual bodies is often accomplished using medical scans, such as [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Such techniques represent a cost- and time-saving move away from the creation of medical animations using sectioned cadavers. For instance, the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project created 3D medical animations of the male and female bodies by scanning cadavers using CT technology, after which they were frozen, shaved into millimeter-thick sections and recorded using high-resolution photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman MJ. [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/getting_data.html "Visible Human Project: Getting the Data."] U.S. National Library of Medicine. July 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, medical animations made using only scanned data can recreate the internal structures of live patients, often in the context of surgical planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00268-007-9329-3 |title=Patient-specific Surgical Simulation |year=2007 |last1=Soler |first1=Luc |last2=Marescaux |first2=Jacques |journal=World Journal of Surgery |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=208–12 |pmid=18066615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964554 |chapter=4D space-time techniques: a medical imaging case study |title=Proceedings Visualization, 2001. VIS '01 |year=2001 |last1=Tory |first1=M. |last2=Rober |first2=N. |last3=Moller |first3=T. |last4=Celler |first4=A. |last5=Atkins |first5=M.S. |isbn=0-7803-7200-X |pages=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cellular and molecular animation===
Medical animations are often employed as a method of visualizing the vast number of microscopic processes that occur in the human body. These may involve the interplay between organelles, the transcription of DNA, the molecular action of enzymes, the interactions between pathogens and white blood cells or virtually any other cellular or sub-cellular process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multimedia.mcb.harvard.edu/anim_innerlife.html "The Inner Life of the Cell."] BioVisions at Harvard University. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/ Virtual Cell Animation Collection.] Molecular and Cellular Biology Learning Center. North Dakota State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular animations are similar in that they depict structures that are too small for the human eye to see. However, this latter category is also capable of illustrating atomic structures, which are often too minute to be visualized with any clarity via microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.str.2010.09.001 |title=Workshop on Molecular Animation |year=2010 |last1=Bromberg |first1=Sarina |last2=Chiu |first2=Wah |last3=Ferrin |first3=Thomas E. |journal=Structure |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1261–5 |pmid=20947014 |pmc=3071847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceutical mechanism of action===
As a way to explain how medications work, pharmaceutical manufacturers may provide mechanism of action animations, often through websites dedicated to specific prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humira.com/psa/how-humira-works.aspx Psoriatic Arthritis: How HUMIRA Works.] Abbott Laboratories. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These medical visualizations typically do not represent cellular structures in a fully accurate or proportional way. Instead, mechanism of action animations may visually simplify the interaction between drug molecules and cells. These medical animations may also explain the physiological origins of the disease itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protopic.com/hcp/the-science-of-protopic/mechanism-of-action/ Mechanism of Action: Protopic (tacrolimus).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204233413/http://www.protopic.com/hcp/the-science-of-protopic/mechanism-of-action |date=2011-12-04 }} Astellas Pharma US, Inc. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have suggested that 3D medical animations may be used to instruct novices on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.10.023 |title=The effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation instruction: Animation versus dispatcher through a cellular phone |year=2008 |last1=Choa |first1=Minhong |last2=Park |first2=Incheol |last3=Chung |first3=Hyun Soo |last4=Yoo |first4=Sun K. |last5=Shim |first5=Hoshik |last6=Kim |first6=Seungho |journal=Resuscitation |volume=77 |pages=87–94 |pmid=18164119 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports usually suggest the use of pre-prepared, voice-narrated motion-capture animations that are viewed by means of a cellphone or other portable electronic device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2009.03.019 |title=Animation-assisted CPRII program as a reminder tool in achieving effective one-person-CPR performance |year=2009 |last1=Choa |first1=Minhong |last2=Cho |first2=Junho |last3=Choi |first3=Young Hwan |last4=Kim |first4=Seungho |last5=Sung |first5=Ji Min |last6=Chung |first6=Hyun Soo |journal=Resuscitation |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=680–4 |pmid=19410356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic reconstruction===
A number of applications for medical animations has been developed in the field of forensics. These include the so-called "virtutopsy," or MRI-assisted virtual autopsy, of remains that are too damaged to be otherwise inspected or reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15813556 |year=2005 |last1=Thali |first1=MJ |last2=Braun |first2=M |last3=Buck |first3=U |last4=Aghayev |first4=E |last5=Jackowski |first5=C |last6=Vock |first6=P |last7=Sonnenschein |first7=M |last8=Dirnhofer |first8=R |title=VIRTOPSY--scientific documentation, reconstruction and animation in forensic: Individual and real 3D data based geo-metric approach including optical body/object surface and radiological CT/MRI scanning |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=428–42 |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, medical animations can appear in courtrooms, be used as forensic  "reconstructions" of crime scenes or recreate the crimes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulcher |first1=KL |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/udlr22&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=The Jury as Witness: Forensic Computer Animation Transports Jurors to the Scene of a Crime or Automobile Accident |journal=University of Dayton Law Review |year=1996 |volume=55 |pages=56–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admissibility of such evidence is questionable.

===Electronic learning===
Researchers have suggested that medical animations can be used to disseminate medical education materials electronically, allowing them to be accessed and utilized by professional and amateur health practitioners alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/laban0609-202 |title=An introduction to electronic learning and its use to address challenges in surgical training |year=2009 |last1=Baran |first1=Szczepan W. |last2=Johnson |first2=Elizabeth J. |last3=Kehler |first3=James |journal=Lab Animal |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=202–10 |pmid=19455166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical training and planning===
Some institutes use animations both to teach medical students how to perform basic surgery, and to give seasoned surgeons the chance to expand their skill set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01421590050110777 |title=Patient safety and simulation-based medical education |year=2000 |last1=Ziv |first1=Stephen d. Small |journal=Medical Teacher |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=489–95 |pmid=21271963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have been conducted on the effectiveness and feasibility of medical animation-based surgical pre-planning. Experimental animation tools have been created as integral technology in image-guided surgery as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TVCG.2011.50 |title=DVV: A Taxonomy for Mixed Reality Visualization in Image Guided Surgery |year=2012 |last1=Kersten-Oertel |first1=M. |last2=Jannin |first2=P. |last3=Collins |first3=D.

'''Medical integration environment''' (MIE) are specialised tools designed to simplify the sharing of medical and related data between medical equipment and electronic health records.  Technically, they are similar to an [[Enterprise Service Bus]] but with several extra features allowing for legacy systems that do not use web services messaging. Typically, they use [[Java Message Service]]; most [[Enterprise Application Integration]] systems can be modified to be used as an MIE but may lack the crucial [[HL7]] and [[Arden syntax]] for storing medical knowledge.

== History and development ==

The MSQoL was funded by the [[Wellcome Trust|Wellcome Foundation]] and developed by Galen Research, as part of an international research study which was conducted in eight countries, with initial work conducted in the UK and US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patrick|first=Donald L.|author2=Hurst, Bryan C. |author3=Hughes, Janette |title=Further Development and Testing of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQOL) Measure|journal=Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain|date=July 2000|volume=40|issue=7|pages=550–560|doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.2000.00086.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-4610.2000.00086.x/abstract|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, 30 patients who suffer from migraine were interviewed, while 25 patients were interviewed in the US. A focus group was also held with 5 participants. Transcripts of these interviews were used to determine the questionnaire items.  The MSQoL was assessed for reliability and validity and was found to have good consistency and test-retest reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=T.H. |author2=Patrick, D.L. |author3=Galer, B.S. |author4=Berzon, R.A.|title=A New Instrument to Assess the Long-term Quality of Life Effects From Migraine: Development and Psychometric Testing of the MSQOL|journal=Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain|year=1996|volume=36|pages=484–492|doi=10.1046/j.1526-4610.1996.3608484.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-4610.1996.3608484.x/abstract|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scores on the MSQoL were also found to be consistent with another measure of well-being as well as the perceived severity of the affliction for the patients.

== International use ==

The MSQoL has been translated into several languages other than UK English: German, Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Passchier J. |author2=Mourik J. |author3=McKenna S. |author4=Van Den Berg M. |author5=Erdman R. | year = 2001 | title = Evaluation of the Dutch version of the migraine quality of life instrument (MSQOL) and its application in headache coping | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0333-1024.2001.00237.x/abstract | journal = Cephalalgia | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 823–829 | doi = 10.1046/j.0333-1024.2001.00237.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish, Spanish, Finnish, French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerbaud|first=L |author2=Navez, ML |author3=Couratier, P |author4=Lejeune, ML |author5=Vernay, D |author6=Aufauvre, D |author7=Preux, PM |author8=Metz, O |author9=Dazord, A |author10=Laurent, B |author11=Clavelou, P|title=Validation of the combined SF36/MSQOL test of evaluation of quality of life in migraine patients in France|journal=Revue neurologique|date=July 2002|volume=158|issue=6–7|pages=719–727|pmid=12486902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian, and USA English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSQoL|url=http://www.galen-research.com/measures-database/|work=Galen Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MSQoL has also been utilized by pharmaceutical companies in order to test whether a given therapy or medication is effective in treating migraines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4889">The '''Multi-barrier approach''' is a key paradigm for ensuring safe [[drinking water]] in jurisdictions such as [[Ontario]], elsewhere in Canada, and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry for the Environment, [http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/nes-draft-sources-human-drinking-water/html/page1.html Draft Users' Guide: National Environmental Standard for Sources of Human Drinking Water], Accessed 11-Aug-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as,&lt;ref&gt;Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water &amp; Water Quality Task Group (2002), [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/water-eau/tap-source-robinet/tap-source-robinet-eng.pdf From Source To Tap - The Multi-Barrier Approach To Safe Drinking Water], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;An integrated system of procedures, processes and tools that collectively prevent or reduce the contamination of drinking water from source to tap in order to reduce risks to public health.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Part 2 of his report on the [[Walkerton Tragedy]], Justice [[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|Dennis O'Connor]] discusses five elements of the multi-barrier approach:&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Hon. Dennis R. (2002), [http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/walkerton/part2/ ''Part 2: Report of the Walkerton Inquiry: Strategy for Safe Drinking Water''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122020206/http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/walkerton/part2/ |date=2010-01-22 }}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Source water protection]]—Taking action to minimize adverse impacts on source waters reduces the risk from pathogens and chemical pollutants in that water, and can also reduce the degree of treatment required.
# Robust [[water treatment]]—Having treatment trains with more than one step provides redundancy against treatment failure.
# A secure [[water supply network]]—Providing a disinfectant residual to the extreme points of the distribution system protects against water quality degradation and microbial intrusion.
# Monitoring programs—Monitoring water quality at each of the above points (source, treatment plant, and tap) allows the treatment process to be adjusted to deal with fluctuations in water quality and ensures that the drinking water is safe at the point of human consumption.
# Prepared responses to adverse conditions—Having response plans (for example, issuing a [[boil-water advisory]]) in place provides a final barrier to protect the public if harmful contaminants should make it through the other barriers.

The holistic perspective of the multi-barrier approach also incorporates many players into the goal of keeping drinking water safe. These include managers, researchers, regulators, legislators, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment |url=http://www.ccme.ca/sourcetotap/mba.html |title=Multi-Barrier Approach |accessdate=10 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716030951/http://www.ccme.ca/sourcetotap/mba.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4550">'''Nocturnal penile tumescence''' (abbreviated as '''NPT''') is a spontaneous [[erection]] of the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[sleep]] or when waking up.  All  men without physiological [[erectile dysfunction]] experience nocturnal penile tumescence, usually three to five times during the night, typically during [[REM sleep]].&lt;ref name="WebMD"&gt;{{cite web

==Diagnostic value==
The existence and predictability of nocturnal [[tumescence]] is used by [[sexual health]] practitioners to ascertain whether a given case of erectile dysfunction (E.D.) is [[psychological]] or [[physiological]] in origin.{{cn|date=January 2018}} A patient presenting E.D. is fitted with an elastic device to wear around his penis during sleep; the device detects changes in girth and relays the information to a computer for later analysis. If nocturnal tumescence is detected, then the E.D. is presumed to be due to a [[psychosomatic illness]] such as sexual anxiety; if not, then it is presumed to be due to a physiological cause.&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
The cause of NPT is not known with certainty. Bancroft (2005) hypothesizes that the [[norepinephrine|noradrenergic]] neurons of the [[locus ceruleus]] are [[Neuron#Action on other neurons|inhibitory]] to penile erection, and that the cessation of their discharge that occurs during REM sleep may allow [[testosterone]]-related excitatory actions to manifest as NPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bancroft |first1=J |last2= |first2= |year=2005 |title=The endocrinology of sexual arousal |journal=[[Journal of Endocrinology]] |volume=186 |issue= 3|pages=411–427 |publisher= |doi=10.1677/joe.1.06233  |url=http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/186/3/411.full |accessdate=September 25, 2013 |pmid=16135662}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence supporting the possibility that a full [[bladder]] can stimulate an erection has existed for some time and is characterized as a 'reflex erection'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nerves that control a man’s ability to have a reflex erection are located in the [[sacral nerves]] (S2-S4) of the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full bladder is known to mildly stimulate nerves in the same region.

The possibility of a full bladder causing an erection, especially during sleep, is perhaps further supported by the beneficial physiological effect of an erection inhibiting urination, thereby helping to avoid [[nocturnal enuresis]].  However, given females have a similar phenomenon called [[nocturnal clitoral tumescence]], prevention of nocturnal enuresis (bed-wetting) is not likely a sole supporting cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Norman's Cay''' is a small [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] island (a few hundred acres) in the [[Exumas]], a chain of islands south and east of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], that served as the headquarters for [[Carlos Lehder]]'s drug-smuggling operation from 1978 to around 1982.

==Drug smuggling history==
[[File:Carlos Leder Airplane Wreck Inside.JPG|thumb|The wreckage of a [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]] that crashed in shallow water at Norman's Cay during the 1980s (2006)]]
 
As part of the [[Medellín Cartel]], Lehder used the island as a [[transshipment]] base for smuggling [[cocaine]] into the United States. Lehder, before with his partner [[George Jung]] and later through Norman's Cay, is often credited with revolutionizing drug smuggling. The typical method of transporting small shipments, often carried by human [[drug mule]]s, either through ingestion or in their luggage, onto commercial airlines, was surpassed by the use of small aircraft shipping entire loads of [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name="PBS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/business/cay.html |title=Norman's Cay: Playground for Drug Smugglers |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lehder eventually constructed a {{convert|3300|ft|m|adj=on}} long runway for his fleet of aircraft. In order to protect the island, armed guards and attack dogs patrolled the beaches and runway, and radar was employed. Any pilot foolish enough to land there was quickly warned off by heavily armed guards. The island was a strategic point for Colombian drug flights to refuel and rest before proceeding to the United States.&lt;ref name="PBS1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotpub.com/page.aspx?type=area&amp;id=16 |title=Pilots' Guide |publisher=Bahamas and Caribbean Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The island became a location for partying. Carlos Toro remembers, "Norman's Cay was a playground. I have a vivid picture of being picked up in a [[Land Rover]] with the top down and naked women driving to come and welcome me from my airplane... And there we partied. And it was a [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]... drugs, sex, no police... you made the rules... and it was fun."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/toro.html PBS Interview with Carlos Toro]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Marine biologist Richard E. Novak, the island's former dive master, fought back, waging a heroic but ultimately futile one-man war to liberate Norman's Cay. Not until 1982, under pressure from US law enforcement, and despite years of turning a blind eye, did the Bahamian government begin to crack down on the island's drug-smuggling operations. In 1987, after Lehder was arrested in Colombia and extradited to stand trial in the U.S., his property was confiscated. It is now a tourist destination reachable by charter flight.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Recent years===
The island was again a subject of (minor) controversy when the newly elected Progressive Liberal government honored a pre-election in-principle agreement to sell the government-owned portion of the island, valued at $40.5&amp;nbsp;million, despite the objections of the local MP. The government believes it may encourage further foreign investment.&lt;ref name="BNB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/bzephyr2002/Exumas.html |title=Norman's Cay Exumas Bahamas "Sweet Deal" |publisher=Bahamas News Board|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/bzephyr2002/Exumas.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+16:47:42|archivedate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's consortium of local and foreign owners, including Bahamians Mark Holowesko, Martin Solomon, Greg Cleare, James Cole, US investor J. Steven Manolis and Jonathan Breene, had planned to include a resort chain [[Aman Resorts]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  The island has purportedly been sold to the Miami-based Fort Capital Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Norman's Cay, Exumas, Bahamas by Fort Capital Management Investments in Miami, Florida|url = http://fortcapital.com/portfolio/7/normans-cay-exumas-bahamas|website = fortcapital.com|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The island is served by [[Norman's Cay Airport]]. As of 2018, the airport has no commercial airline service.

==In popular culture==
Norman's Cay has been featured in multiple works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5572">An '''ophthalmotrope''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] roots ὀφθαλμοῦ, ''ophthalmos'', i.e. eye and -τροπή, -''tropē'', i.e. turning) is an apparatus for demonstrating the [[Eye movement (sensory)|movements of the eye]] and the action of the different [[Extraocular muscles|muscles]] which produce them, consisting essentially of a model eyeball to which are attached strings and pulleys to duplicate the line force of the muscles.
Movements of the eye are [[Kinematics|kinematically]] complex and can be described as a combination of rotations about changing rotation centers. But even when ocular mechanics are simplified to pure rotations about a head-fixed rotation center, their noncommutative property makes them difficult to visualize. [[Christian Georg Theodor Ruete|Ruete]], [[Johann Benedict Listing|Listing]], [[Franciscus Donders|Donders]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], [[Albrecht von Graefe|von Graefe]], [[Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann|Volkmann]] and many others have provided the broad outline of an answer to the question how the eye rotates during [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].

== History ==
[[File:Ruete's Ophthalmotrope 2nd model, 1857.jpg|thumb|Ruete's Ophthalmotrope 2nd model, 1857]]
Historically, mechanical representations of oculomotor mechanics have been used for visualization of eye movements and their interaction with visual geometry. Many mechanical models of eye movements have been constructed and studied in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simonsz|first=H. J.|author2=den Tonkelaar, I.|title=19th century mechanical models of eye movements, Donders' law, Listing's law and Helmholtz' direction circles|journal=Doc Ophthalmol|year=1990|volume=74|issue=1–2|pages=95–112|url=http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/40457/10.1007_BF00165667.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF00165667|pmid=2209371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=den Tonkelaar|first1=I.|last2=Henkes|first2=G. K. |last3=van Leersum| title=Eye and instruments. Nineteenth-century ophthalmological instruments in the Netherlands|year=1996|publisher=Batavian Lion|location=Amsterdam|pages=175–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ophthalmotrope was made by [[Christian Georg Theodor Ruete]] in 1845 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruete|first=Christian Georg Theodor|title=Das Ophthalmotrop, dessen Bau und Gebrauch. Göttinger Studien|year=1845|publisher=Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht|location=Göttingen|url=https://archive.org/details/dasophthalmotrop00ruet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was he who gave it the name “ophthalmotrope”. Ruete's first version ophthalmotrope had the eye mounted in nested gimbals, and his second model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruete|first=Christian Georg Theodor|title=Ein neues Ophthalmotrop, zur Erläuterung der Functionen der Muskeln und brechenden Medien des menschlichen Auges|year=1857|publisher=Druck und Verlag von B. G. Teubner|location=Leipzig|url=https://archive.org/details/einneuesophthalm00ruet}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emulated [[Listing's law]], mounted the rotation axis in a rotatable ring. Ruete’s second model of 1857 was an altogether more sophisticated model that demonstrates both the movements of the eye and, importantly, the action of the ocular muscles. Both Donders’s and Listing’s laws can be demonstrated on this model. The degree of muscle contraction or extension can be measured on a scale at the back of the model.
Other ophthalmotropes were designed lather by [[Edmund Landolt|Landolt]], [[Hermann Jakob Knapp|Knapp]], [[Franciscus Donders|Donders]], [[Hermann Snellen|Snellen]], [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]], and others. Recently, Schreiber and Schor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=K. M.|author2=Schor, C. M.|title=A virtual ophthalmotrope illustrating oculomotor coordinate systems and retinal projection geometry|journal=Journal of Vision|year=2007|volume=7|issue=10|pages=4 1–14|doi=10.1167/7.10.4|url=http://www.journalofvision.org/content/7/10/4.long#xref-ref-22-1|pmid=17997673}}&lt;/ref&gt; have published a modern software version of ophthalmotrope. They presented a virtual gimbaled model of the oculomotor system, which provides accurate visualization of the kinematics of the three major oculomotor coordinate systems and qualitative estimates of the effects of the different coordinate systems on ocular torsion.
The virtual ophthalmotrope presented by Schreiber and Schor is a modification and extension of Donders' design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donders|first=F.C.|title=Die Bewegungen des Auges, veranschaulicht durch das Phaenophthalmotrop|journal=Archiv für Ophthalmologie|year=1870|volume=16|pages=154–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; by adding Listing's extended law and displacement plane geometry to its basic visualization capabilities.

In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''ordered subset expectation maximization''' (OSEM) method &lt;!-- NOT algorithm --&gt;  is an [[iterative method]] that is used in [[computed tomography]].

In applications in [[medical imaging]], the OSEM method is used  for [[positron emission tomography]], for [[single photon emission computed tomography]], and for [[Computed tomography|X-ray computed tomography]].

The OSEM method is related to the [[expectation maximization]] (EM) method of statistics. The OSEM method is also related to methods of [[filtered back projection]].

'''Patient portals''' are [[healthcare]]-related [[web application|online application]]s that allow [[patient]]s to interact and communicate with their healthcare providers, such as [[physician]]s and [[hospital]]s. Typically, portal services are available on the Internet at all hours of the day and night. Some patient portal applications exist as stand-alone [[web site]]s and sell their services to healthcare providers.  Other portal applications are integrated into the existing web site of a healthcare provider. Still others are modules added onto an existing [[electronic medical record|electronic medical record (EMR)]] system.  What all of these services share is the ability of patients to interact with their medical information via the Internet. Currently, the lines between an [[electronic medical record|EMR]], a [[personal health record]], and a patient portal are blurring.  For example, Intuit Health and Microsoft [[HealthVault]] describe themselves as personal health records (PHRs), but they can interface with EMRs and communicate through the [[Continuity of Care Record]] standard, displaying patient data on the Internet so it can be viewed through a patient portal.

== Features and benefits ==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}
The central feature that makes any system a patient portal is the ability to expose individual patient health information in a secure manner through the Internet. In addition, virtually all patient portals allow patients to interact in some way with health care providers. Patient portals benefit both patients and providers by increasing efficiency and productivity. Patient portals are also regarded as a key tool to help physicians meet "meaningful use" requirements in order to receive federal incentive checks, especially for providing health information to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/technology/content/article/1462168/1890621 |last=Terry |first=Ken |title=Patient Portals: Beyond Meaningful Use |website=Physicians Practice |publisher=UBM Medica, LLC |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some patient portal applications enable patients to register and complete [[Form (web)|form]]s online, which can streamline visits to clinics and hospitals. Many portal applications also enable patients to request [[Medical prescription|prescription]] refills online, order [[eyeglass]]es and [[contact lenses]], access [[medical record]]s, pay bills, review lab results, and schedule medical appointments. Patient portals also typically allow patients to communicate directly with healthcare providers by asking questions, leaving comments, or sending e-mail messages.

== Disadvantages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
The major shortcoming of most patient portals is their linkage to a single health organization. If a patient uses more than one organization for healthcare, the patient normally needs to log on to each organization’s portal to access information. This results in a fragmented view of individual patient data.

== Practice portals ==
Portal applications for individual practices typically exist in tandem with patient portals, allowing access to patient information and records, as well as schedules, payments, and messages from patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://practiceportals.com/ |title=AuntMinnie.com Practice Portals |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715013534/http://practiceportals.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most patient portals require the practice to have some type of electronic medical record or patient management system, as the patient data needs to be stored in a data repository then retrieved by the patient portal.
While lauding its ease-of-use, some physicians note that it is hard to encourage patients to utilize online portals to benefit both themselves and the medical practice staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/blog/content/article/1462168/2026624 |last=Litton |first=J. Scott, Jr. |title=Encouraging Patients to Use Online Communication |website=Physicians Practice |publisher=UBM Medica, LLC |date=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}
Health care providers in the US are bound to comply with [[HIPAA]] regulations.  These regulations specify what patient information must be held in confidence.  Something as seemingly trivial as a name is viewed by HIPAA as [[protected health information]].  For this reason, security has always been a top concern for the industry when dealing with the adoption of patient portals.  While there may be systems that are not HIPAA compliant, certainly most patient and practice portals are secure and compliant with HIPAA regulations.  The use of [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] and [[access control]] patterns are commonplace in the industry.  Patient access is typically validated with a user name and password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cms.hhs.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/EducationMaterials/downloads//HIPAAChecklist.pdf |format=PDF | title=Provider HIPAA Checklist: Moving Toward Compliance | website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=March 2003 | accessdate=April 16, 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912155206/http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/EducationMaterials/Downloads/HIPAAChecklist.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}
Internet portal technology has been in common use since the 1990s.  The financial industry has been particularly adept at using the Internet to grant individual users access to personal information.  Possibly because of the strictness of [[HIPAA]] regulations, or the lack of financial incentives for the health care providers, the adoption of patient portals has lagged behind other market segments.

The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), in particular the HITECH Act within ARRA, sets aside approximately $19 billion for health information technology.  This funding will potentially offset the costs of [[electronic medical record]] systems for practicing physicians.  Because the conversion to electronic medical records is typically complex, systems often transition to patient portals first and then follow with a complete implementation of electronic medical records.

To attest to [[Meaningful Use]] Stage 2, eligible professionals must have 5 percent of their patients view, transmit or download their health information. Additionally, providers must implement notifications for follow up appointments and identify clinically relevant health information for more than 10 percent of their patients with two or more appointments in the preceding two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stage 2 |date=May 12, 2014 |website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Stage_2.html |access-date=25 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233434/http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Stage_2.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consequently, [[personal health record]] systems are becoming more common and available. In 2012, 57 percent of providers already had a patient portal in place.{{cn|date=April 2015}} At present, individual health data are located primarily on paper in physicians' files. Patient portals have been developed to give patients better access to their information.  Given the patient mobility and the development of clear interoperable standards, the best documentation of patient medical history may involve data stored outside physician offices.

== Future ==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
{{Speculation section|date=September 2017}}
}}
E-visits (remote use of medical services) may soon become one of the most commonly used options of patient portals.  The most likely demographic for uptake of e-visits are patients who live in remote rural areas, far from clinical services. An Internet session would be much cheaper and more convenient than traveling a long distance, especially for simple questions or minor medical complaints.

Providing a route that does not require in-person patient visits to a clinic may potentially benefit both patients and providers. Many organizations find that overall utilization drops when e-visits are implemented, in some places by as much as 25%.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} This makes e-visits a very interesting proposition for insurance companies, although few actually re-imburse for them currently. E-visits, with the proper functionality, also allow the patient to update their allergies, vital signs, and history information.

Providing e-visits allows the standard healthcare organization to offer a product that can compete on price with the retail clinics that are popping up in strip malls and [[Wal-mart]].

== Vendors ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Some vendors, such as [[athenahealth]], [[Epic Systems]] and [[Cerner]] offer patient portals as one module of a complete Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Other vendors, such as [[Allscripts]] and [[MedFusion]], offer patient portals that can be integrated with any EHR.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Recent market surveys{{Specify|date=September 2017}} have highlighted best of breed, or applications that excel at one or two functions, are losing ground to portals provided by large vendors. While best of breed portals are better equipped for [[interoperability]], portals supplied by larger vendors may be overall better equipped to handle the patient engagement requirements of Meaningful Use Stage 2.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

The '''Pharmaceutical Affairs Law''' ('''PAL''') of the [[Taiwan]] is a 
law regulating the manufacturing, importation, and sale of drugs and medical devices.

==Legislative history==
The law was first publicised on 17 August 1970 as the '''Pharmaceutical and Drug Manufacturer Administration Law''', with 90 articles. Thereafter it was amended eleven times (listed by date of publication):&lt;ref name="FullText"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fda.gov.tw/files/people_laws/%E8%97%A5%E4%BA%8B%E6%B3%95%E5%8F%8A%E6%96%BD%E8%A1%8C%E7%B4%B0%E5%89%87(95.05.30%EF%BC%9B94.02.16).pdf|title=藥事法|publication-place=Republic of China|publisher=Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health, Executive Yuan|date=2006-05-30|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 103 of the February 1993 version of the law removed [[herbalist]]s' rights to dispense drugs. In 1996, legislators from various parties are believed to have taken bribes from the National Union Chinese Medicine Association (中華民國中藥商業同業公會聯合會) in exchange for their support of an amendment reversing the February 1993 changes.&lt;ref name="TaiwanToday"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=117160&amp;CtNode=414|title=Taiwan High Court hands lawmakers stiff sentences|periodical=China Times|date=2010-09-09|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight legislators in question were indicted in January 2008. Among them, [[Jao Yung-ching]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]]) was simultaneously indicted in another bribery case regarding a 2003 amendment to the Oral Healthcare Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chang|first=Rich|date=2008-01-29|title=Lawmakers charged in dental association case|periodical=Taipei Times|accessdate=2011-07-26|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2008/01/29/2003399292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight legislators in question, [[Chiu Chuei-chen]] (DPP) and [[Liao Hwu-peng]] ([[Kuomintang|KMT]]) were found guilty in a lower court trial, while the remainder were found not guilty. However, the [[Judicial_Yuan#High_Courts|High Court]] reversed the lower court ruling in September 2010; [[Lin Kuang-hua]] and [[Jao Yung-ching]] (both DPP) received eight-year sentences, [[Feng Ting-kuo]] ([[People First Party (Republic of China)|PFP]]) got seven years and two months, while [[Chen Horng-chi]] (KMT) was sentenced to seven years.&lt;ref name="TaiwanToday"/&gt;

==Effects==
The PAL establishes labelling requirements for all items under its purview, requiring them to display an authorisation number, [[shelf life|expiration date]], usage instructions, and a list of [[side effect]]s. Such items are not limited to ingested medicines, but include other items such as [[condom]]s and face masks. The [[Department of Health (Republic of China)|Department of Health]] is tasked with inspections to ensure compliance with the law; private organisations such as the Consumers' Foundation have also been known to carry out clandestine checks. A February 2007 check of [[sex shop]]s found that 18 out of 25 condom brands did not label their ingredients clearly or at all, while 22 gave an incorrect authorisation number or none at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/02/13/2003348795|title=Majority of condoms sold in erotica stores 'not legal'|periodical=Taipei Times|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey, also by the Consumers' Foundation, looked at 41 face masks (17 N95 masks and 24 [[surgical mask]]s), and found that 90% did not meet the labelling and packaging requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=955435&amp;lang=eng_news&amp;cate_img=49.jpg&amp;cate_rss=news_Society_TAIWAN|title=90 percent face mask in Taiwan unqualified: Consumers' Foundation|periodical=Taiwan News|date=2009-05-21|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers of drugs and medical devices are required by article 27 of the PAL to obtain a license from the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="ChinaTimes20110224"&gt;{{citation|title=OK繃體脂計皆屬醫療器材　需有認証或執照 &amp;ndash; Band-aids, body fat monitors all medical devices, must have license or permit|url=http://health.chinatimes.com/contents.aspx?cid=5,68&amp;id=12991|periodical=China Times|date=2011-02-24|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, article 37 requires that sales of all drugs, though not of medical devices, be carried out by a licensed pharmacist (or assistant pharmacist, in the case of non-[[narcotic]] drugs).&lt;ref name="FullText"/&gt; Not just pharmacies, but various other types of stores including [[convenience store]]s and [[supermarket]]s, have been able to obtain the required licenses.&lt;ref name="ChinaTimes20110224"/&gt; However, many small online sellers bring covered items back from overseas and sell them on internet auction websites without knowing about this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/06/13/2003313290|title=Online drug sales banned|periodical=Taipei Times|date=2006-06-13|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under articles 27 and 92, fines could range from NT$30,000 to $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nownews.com/2010/07/30/11478-2631339.htm|author=吳順永|date=2010-07-30|title=網路販賣醫療器材屬無照藥商　依法可處3-15萬罰鍰 &amp;mdash; Online sales of medical devices is unlicensed drug dealing, under law could be assessed $30 to $150 thousand in fines|publisher=NOW News|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items covered under the law include not just those which consumers traditionally think of as pharmaceuticals, but some unexpected items such as make-up, [[tooth bleaching]] agents, [[hair removal]] products, band-aids, [[knee pad]]s, and [[body fat percentage]] monitors.&lt;ref name="ChinaTimes20110224"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sina"&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20101109/3941521.html|title=「宅經濟」發燒　線上購買化妝品要當心選購！|periodical=Sina News|date=2010-11-09|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Alexander Litvinenko]]'''  was a former officer of the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) and [[KGB]], who fled from court prosecution in Russia and received [[political asylum]] in the United Kingdom.

On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized. He died three weeks later, becoming the first confirmed victim of lethal [[polonium|polonium-210]]-induced [[radiation poisoning|acute radiation syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Muslim"/&gt; [[Alexander Litvinenko#Allegations|Litvinenko's allegations about the misdeeds of the FSB]] and his public deathbed accusations that Russian president Vladimir Putin was behind his unusual malady resulted in worldwide media coverage.

Subsequent investigations by British authorities into the circumstances of Litvinenko's death led to serious diplomatic difficulties between the British and Russian governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/we-know-kgb-spy-poisoner-445700 |title=We Know KGB Spy Poisoner |newspaper=Daily Mirror |first=Jeff |last=Edwards |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges were ever laid but a non-judicial public hearing was put on in 2014–2015, during which the [[Scotland Yard]] representative witnessed that "the evidence suggests that the only credible explanation is in one way or another the Russian state is involved in Litvinenko's murder". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Litvinenko inquiry: Russia involved in spy's death, Scotland Yard says|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/litvinenko-inquiry-russia-involved-spy-death-scotland-yard|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 2015-08-03|first = Jamie|last = Grierson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness stated that [[Dmitry Kovtun]] had been speaking openly about the plan to kill Litvinenko that was intended to "set an example" as a punishment for a "traitor". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/24/litvinenko-inquiry-told-dmitry-kovtun-planned-to-lure-him-to-finish-him-off | title=Litvinenko inquiry told Dmitry Kovtun planned to lure him to 'finish him off' | work=The Guardian | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main suspect in the case, a former officer of the Russian [[Federal Protective Service of Russia|Federal Protective Service (FSO)]], [[Andrey Lugovoy]], remains in Russia.

==Background==
{{Main|Alexander Litvinenko}}
Alexander Litvinenko was a former officer of the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Russian Federal Security service]] who escaped prosecution in Russia and received [[political asylum]] in the United Kingdom. In his books, ''[[Blowing up Russia: Terror from Within]]'' and ''[[Lubyanka Criminal Group]]'', Litvinenko described Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]]'s rise to power as a coup d'état organised by the FSB. He alleged that a key element of the FSB's strategy was to frighten Russians by [[Russian apartment bombings|bombing apartment buildings]] in Moscow and other Russian cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Hoover Institute]] scholar [[David Satter]] described this controversy in the [[United States House of Representatives]]: "With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For "Operation Successor" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution." [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SatterHouseTestimony2007.pdf (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065706/http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SatterHouseTestimony2007.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused Russian secret services of having arranged the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], through their Chechen [[agent provocateur]], and having organised the [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Russia Denies Involvement in 1999 Armenian Parliament Shooting | date = 12 May 2005| url = http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?26585-Russia-Denies-Involvement-in-1999-Armenian-Parliament-Shooting| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173102/http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?26585-Russia-Denies-Involvement-in-1999-Armenian-Parliament-Shooting| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 3 March 2016| accessdate =25 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that the terrorist [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] was under FSB control when he visited Russia in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cicentre.com/Documents/russia_islam_not_separate.html Russia and Islam are not Separate: Why Russia backs Al-Qaeda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219040336/http://cicentre.com/Documents/russia_islam_not_separate.html |date=19 December 2007 }}, by Konstantin Preobrazhensky. According to Preobrazhenskiy, "At that time, Litvinenko was the Head of the Subdivision for Internationally Wanted Terrorists of the First Department of the Operative-Inquiry Directorate of the FSB Anti-Terrorist Department. He was ordered to undertake the delicate mission of securing Al-Zawahiri from unintentional disclosure by the Russian police. Though Al-Zawahiri had been brought to Russia by the FSB using a false passport, it was still possible for the police to learn about his arrival and report to Moscow for verification. Such a process could disclose Al-Zawahiri as an FSB collaborator. In order to prevent this, Litvinenko visited a group of the highly placed police officers to notify them in advance."&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in [[London]], he continued to support the Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]] in exile, [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], in his media campaign against the Russian government.&lt;ref name="sakwa"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Putin, Russia's choice|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Sakwa|year=2008|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-40765-6|pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just two weeks before his death, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering the assassination of [[Anna Politkovskaya]].&lt;ref name="dissident"&gt;[[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko.

==Illness and poisoning==
On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill. Earlier that day he had met two former [[KGB]] officers, [[Andrey Lugovoy]] and [[Dmitry Kovtun]]. Lugovoy is a former bodyguard of Russian ex-Prime Minister [[Yegor Gaidar]] (also reportedly poisoned in November 2006) and former chief of security for the Russian TV channel [[Channel One (Russia)|ORT]].  Kovtun is now a businessman. Litvinenko had also had lunch at [[Itsu]], a [[sushi]] restaurant on [[Piccadilly]] in London, with an Italian officer and "[[nuclear physics|nuclear]] expert", [[Mario Scaramella]], to whom he reportedly made allegations regarding [[Romano Prodi]]'s connections with the KGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For several days after 1 November, Litvinenko experienced severe [[diarrhea]] and vomiting. At one point, he could not walk without assistance. As the pain intensified, Litvinenko asked his wife to call an ambulance for assistance.&lt;ref name="Alan Cowell, The Terminal Spy"&gt;Alan Cowell, The Terminal Spy&lt;/ref&gt; For several weeks, Litvinenko's condition worsened as doctors searched for the cause of the illness. Surrounded by friends, Litvinenko became physically weak, and spent periods unconscious. A photograph was taken of Litvinenko on his deathbed and released to the public. "I want the world to see what they did to me," Litvinenko said.&lt;ref name="Alan Cowell, The Terminal Spy"/&gt;

===Poison===
On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under the name of Edwin Carter) was admitted for further investigation at [[Barnet Hospital]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being moved from his local hospital in north London to [[University College Hospital]] in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples were sent to the UK's [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using [[gamma spectroscopy]]. No discernible gamma rays were initially detected; however, a small gamma ray spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV), barely visible above the background. The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom#Historical weapons programmes|early atomic bomb programme]] decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from the radioactive decay of polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha particles confirmed the result the following day.&lt;ref name=BBC20150728&gt;{{cite news|title=Litvinenko: A deadly trail of polonium|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33678717|accessdate=21 January 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most common radiation sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation (the low intensity gamma ray at an energy of 803 keV is the most prominent), but large amounts of [[alpha particle]]s which do not penetrate even a sheet of paper or the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of human skin, and is therefore relatively invisible to common radiation detectors such as [[Geiger counters]]. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and [[Scotland Yard]] at the hospital with [[Geiger counters]] were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as [[ionizing radiation]] which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon.&lt;ref name="Bomb"&gt;"Death of a Dissident", page 327&lt;/ref&gt; Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.&lt;ref name="Bomb"/&gt;

Shortly after his death, the UK's [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA) said tests had established that Litvinenko had significant amounts of the [[radionuclide]] [[polonium|polonium-210]] (&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po as a poison had never been documented before, and it was probably the first time anyone had been tested for the presence of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea.&lt;ref name="waiter"/&gt; Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have been exposed to radiation.&lt;ref name="HPA Press Release"&gt;

The head of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, [[Deputy Assistant Commissioner]] Peter Clarke, stated the police "will trace possible witnesses, examine Mr. Litvinenko's movements at relevant times, including when he first became ill and identify people he may have met.

===Polonium trails===
Detectives traced three distinct polonium trails in and out of London, at three different dates, which according to the investigation suggests [[Andrey Lugovoy]] and [[Dmitry Kovtun]] made two failed attempts to administer polonium to Litvinenko before the final and successful one. The first attempt took place on 16 October 2006, when radioactive traces were found in all places visited by the FSB operatives before and after their meeting with Litvinenko. They administered the poison to his tea, but he did not drink it.

Apparently, Lugovoy and Kovtun did not fully realize they were handling a radioactive poison. Journalist Luke Harding described their behaviour as "idiotic, verging on suicidal"; while handling a leaky container, they stored it in their hotel rooms, used ordinary towels to clean up leaks, and eventually disposed of the poison in the toilet. On 17 October, perhaps realizing they contaminated their rooms, they prematurely checked out, moved to another hotel, and left London the next day.

Another unsuccessful assassination attempt took place on 25 October, when Lugovoy and Kovtun flew to London again. They left radioactive traces again in their hotel prior to meeting Litvinenko, but did not administer the poison, perhaps due to security cameras in the meeting room. They again disposed of the poison via their room's toilet, and left London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/06/alexander-litvinenko-and-the-most-radioactive-towel-in-history|title=Alexander Litvinenko and the most radioactive towel in history|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2016-03-06|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third attempt to poison Litvinenko took place at around 5&amp;nbsp;pm of 1 November in the [[Millennium Hotel Mayfair|Millennium Hotel]] in [[Grosvenor Square]]. The bus he travelled in to the hotel had no signs of radioactivity – but large amounts had been detected at the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Millennium bar, Litvinenko stopped at the office of [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]. He used a fax machine, where radioactive contamination was found later. At 6&amp;nbsp;pm, [[Akhmed Zakayev]] picked Litvinenko up and brought him home to Muswell Hill. The amount of radioactivity left by Litvinenko in the car was so significant that the car was rendered unusable.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; Everything that he touched at home during the next three days  was contaminated. His family was unable to return to the house even six months later. His wife tested positive for ingesting polonium, but did not leave a secondary trail behind her. This suggested that anyone who left a trail could not have picked up the polonium from Litvinenko (possibly, including Lugovoy and Kovtun).&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The patterns and levels of radioactivity the assassins left behind suggested that Litvinenko ingested polonium, whereas Lugovoy and Kovtun handled it directly.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The human body dilutes polonium before excreting it in sweat, which results in a reduced radioactivity level. There were also traces of Po-210 found at the Hey Jo/Abracadabra bar, Dar Marrakesh restaurant, and Lambeth-Mercedes taxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The polonium trail: Key locations |publisher=BBC | date = 17 August 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/6267373.stm | accessdate =12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Litvinenko, only two people left polonium trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun, who were school friends and worked previously for Russian intelligence in the [[KGB]] and the [[GRU]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; They left more significant traces of polonium than Litvinenko, indicating that they handled the radioactive material directly, and did not ingest it.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium hotel bar twice, on 1 November (when the poisoning took place), and earlier, on 16 October. Trails left by Lugovoy and Kovtun started on 16 October, in the same sushi bar where Litvinenko was poisoned later, but at a different table. It was assumed that their first meeting with Litvinenko was either a rehearsal of the future poisoning, or an unsuccessful attempt at the poisoning.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

Traces left by Lugovoy were also found in the office of Berezovsky that he visited on 31 October, a day before his second meeting with Litvinenko. Traces left by Kovtun were found in Hamburg, Germany. He left them on his way to London on 28 October.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The traces were found in passenger jets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

British Airways later published a list of 221 flights of the contaminated aircraft, involving around 33,000 passengers, and advised those potentially affected to contact the UK [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] for help.

===British extradition request===
British authorities investigated the death and it was reported on 1 December that scientists at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] had traced the source of the polonium to a [[nuclear power plant]] in Russia.

===Litvinenko Inquiry===
In January 2016, a UK public inquiry, headed by [[Robert Owen (judge)|Sir Robert Owen]], found that Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun were responsible for the poisoning of Litvinenko.  The inquiry also found that there was a strong probability that Lugovoy and Kovtun were acting under the direction of the FSB, and that their actions were probably approved by both [[Nikolai Patrushev]], Director of the FSB, and President Vladimir Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35370819|title=President Putin 'probably approved Litvinkenko murder'|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=21 January 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/report|publisher=The Litvinenko Inquiry|title=Report|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2007, [[Paul Joyal]], a former director of security for the [[U.S. Senate]] intelligence committee, who the previous weekend alleged on national television that the Kremlin was involved in the poisoning of Litvinenko, was shot near his [[Maryland]] home. An [[FBI]] spokesman said the agency was "assisting" the police investigation into the shooting. Police would not confirm details of the shooting or of the condition of Joyal. A person familiar with the case said he was in [[critical condition]] in hospital. It was reported that while there were no indications that the shooting was linked to the Litvinenko case, it is unusual for the FBI to get involved in a local shooting incident.

As production of polonium-210 was discontinued in most countries in late 2000s, all of the world's legal polonium-210 (&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po) production occurs in Russia in [[RBMK]] reactors.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;"[[Death of a dissident]], pages 336–341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DombeySup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/06/AR2007010601491.html Poisoning Of Ex-Agent Sets Off Alarm Bells.

Polonium-210 has a [[half-life]] of 138 days and decays to the stable daughter isotope of lead, &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb. Therefore, the source is reduced to about one sixteenth of its original radioactivity about 18 months after production. By measuring the proportion of polonium and lead in a sample, one can establish the production date of polonium. The analysis of impurities in the polonium (a kind of "finger print") allows identification of the place of production.&lt;ref name="Guardian Unlimited"&gt;{{cite news

Nick Priest, a nuclear scientist and expert on polonium who has worked at most of Russia's nuclear research facilities, says that although the execution of the plot was a "bout of stupidity", the choice of polonium was a "stroke of genius." He says: "the choice of poison was genius in that polonium, carried in a vial in water, can be carried in a pocket through airport screening devices without setting off any alarms", adding, "once administered, the polonium creates symptoms that don't suggest poison for days, allowing time for the perpetrator to make a getaway." Priest asserts that "whoever did it was probably not an expert in radiation protection, so they probably didn't realize how much contamination you can get just by opening the top (of the vial) and closing it again. With the right equipment, you can detect just one count per second." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'The sadistic poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko'

Shortly after the incident, Russian government dismissed theories of FSB involvement in the assassination using the argument that Litvinenko was "not important" and "mentally unstable", implying that the government had no interest in killing such an insignificant figure. However, [[Eduard Limonov]] observed that the same argument was raised after [[assassination of Anna Politkovskaya]], and described Litvinenko death as "very public execution." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exile.ru/print.php?ARTICLE_ID=8393&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35|title=Print article|website=exile.ru|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Prego the needle was improperly disposed of by Dr. Fogel after being used on an AIDS patient.&lt;ref name=notebook /&gt; The defense contended that Dr. Prego had drawn the infected blood herself and had caused the accident on her own. &lt;ref&gt;Arnold H.

'''Preventive healthcare''' (alternately '''preventive medicine, preventative healthcare/medicine,''' or '''prophylaxis''') consists of measures taken for disease prevention, as opposed to disease treatment.&lt;ref name="Hugh"&gt;Hugh R.

Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primalprevention.org|title="New parents" secure a lifelong well-being for their offspring by refusing to be victims of societal stress during its primal period.|website=Primal Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primal Health Research Database, on {{cite web |url=http://www.birthworks.org/primalhealth |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828141450/http://birthworks.org/primalhealth/ |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many methods for prevention of disease. It is recommended that adults and children aim to visit their doctor for regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, to perform disease [[screening (medicine)|screening]], identify risk factors for disease, discuss tips for a healthy and balanced lifestyle, stay up to date with immunizations and boosters, and maintain a good relationship with a healthcare provider.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Vorvick, L. (2013). Preventive health care. In D. Zieve, D. R. Eltz, S. Slon, &amp; N. Wang (Eds.), The A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia. Retrieved from https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some common disease screenings include checking for [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), [[hyperglycemia]] (high blood sugar, a risk factor for [[diabetes mellitus]]), [[hypercholesterolemia]] (high blood cholesterol), screening for [[colon cancer]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[HIV]] and other common types of [[sexually transmitted disease]] such as [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], and [[gonorrhea]], [[mammography]] (to screen for [[breast cancer]]), [[colorectal cancer]] screening, a [[Pap test]] (to check for [[cervical cancer]]), and screening for [[osteoporosis]]. Genetic testing can also be performed to screen for mutations that cause [[genetic disorder]]s or predisposition to certain diseases such as breast or [[ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; However, these measures are not affordable for every individual and the cost effectiveness of preventive healthcare is still a topic of debate.&lt;ref name="Healthaffairs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

==Levels of prevention==
Preventive healthcare strategies are described as taking place at the primal, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels. 
In the 1940s, Hugh R. Leavell and E. Gurney Clark coined the term primary prevention. They worked at the Harvard and Columbia University Schools of Public Health, respectively, and later expanded the levels to include secondary and tertiary prevention.&lt;ref name="Goldston"&gt;Goldston, S. E. (Ed.). (1987). ''Concepts of primary prevention: A framework for program development''. Sacramento, California Department of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt; Goldston (1987) notes that these levels might be better described as "prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation",&lt;ref name="Goldston" /&gt; though the terms primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention are still in use today. The concept of primal prevention has been created much more recently, in relation to the new developments in molecular biology over the last fifty years &lt;ref&gt;Darnell, James, ''RNA, Life's Indispensable Molecule'', Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,2011&lt;/ref&gt;, more particularly in epigenetics, which point to the paramount importance of environmental conditions - both physical and affective - on the organism during its fetal and newborn life (or so-called primal life).&lt;ref&gt;Odent, M., ''Primal Health Research Database'' of the ''Primal Health Research Centre'' (London), on {{cite web |url=http://www.birthworks.org/primalhealth |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828141450/http://birthworks.org/primalhealth/ |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primal and primordial prevention===
A separate category of "[[health promotion]]" has recently been propounded. This health promotion ''par excellence'' is based on the 'new knowledge' in molecular biology, in particular on epigenetic knowledge, which points to how much affective - as well as physical - environment during fetal and newborn life may determine each and every aspect of adult health.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Bruce D, ''Maltreated Children: Experience, Brain Development and the Next Generation'', Norton Professional Books, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman et al., ''Effect of In Utero and Early-Life Conditions on Adult Health and Disease'', The New England Journal of Medcine, 359;1,2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scherrer et al., ''Systemic and Pulmonary Vascular Dysfunction in Children Conceived by Assisted Reproductive Technologies'', Swiss Cardiovascular Center, Bern, CH; Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biologia, Tarapaca, Arica, Chile: Hirslander Group, Lausanne, CH; Botnar Cemter for Extreme Medicine and Department of Internal Medicine, CHUV, Lausanne, CH, and Centre de Procréation Médicalement Assistée, Lausanne, CH, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Gollwitzer, Eva S., Marsland, Benjamin J., ''Impact of Early-Life Exposures on Immune Maturation and Susceptibility to Disease'', Published Online: October 20, 2015, Elsevier Ltd. Published by Elsevier Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;. This new way of promoting health is now commonly called primal prevention.&lt;ref&gt;see: http://www.primalprevention.org&lt;/ref&gt; It consists mainly in providing future parents with pertinent, unbiased information on ''primal health'' and supporting them during their child's ''primal period of life'' (i.e., "from conception to first anniversary" according to definition by the Primal Health Research Centre, London). This includes adequate parental leave&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Patricia, ''Why Silicon Valley’s Paid Leave Policies Need to Go Viral'', Vogue, culture, opinion, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; - ideally for both parents - with kin caregiving and financial help where needed.

Another related concept is primordial prevention which refers to all measures designed to prevent the development of risk factors in the first place, early in life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiolero A 2015"/&gt;

===Primary prevention===
Primary prevention consists of traditional "[[health promotion]]" and "specific protection."&lt;ref name="IOM" /&gt; Health promotion activities are current, non-clinical life choices. For example, eating nutritious meals and exercising daily, that both prevent disease and create a sense of overall well-being. Preventing disease and creating overall well-being, prolongs our life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IOM" /&gt; Health-promotional activities do not target a specific disease or condition but rather promote health and well-being on a very general level.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt; On the other hand, specific protection targets a type or group of diseases and complements the goals of health promotion.&lt;ref name="IOM" /&gt;

Food is very much the most basic tool in preventive health care. The 2011 National Health Interview Survey performed by the Centers for Disease Control was the first national survey to include questions about ability to pay for food.  Difficulty with paying for food, medicine, or both is a problem facing 1 out of 3 Americans. If better food options were available through food banks, soup kitchens, and other resources for low-income people, obesity and the chronic conditions that come along with it would be better controlled &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marucs|first1=Erin|title=Access to Good Food as Preventive Medicine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/04/access-to-good-food-as-preventive-medicine/360049|website=The Atlantic|publisher=Atlantic Media Company|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "food desert" is an area with restricted access to healthy foods due to a lack of supermarkets within a reasonable distance.  These are often low-income neighborhoods with the majority of residents lacking transportation .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Deserts|url=http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts|website=Food is Power.org|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several grassroots movements in the past 20 years to encourage urban gardening, such as the GreenThumb organization in New York City. Urban gardening uses vacant lots to grow food for a neighborhood and is cultivated by the local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GreenThumb|url= http://www.greenthumbnyc.org|website=NYC Parks|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mobile fresh markets are another resource for residents in a "food desert", which are specially outfitted buses bringing affordable fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income neighborhoods.  These programs often hold educational events as well such as cooking and nutrition guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's a Market on a Bus|url=http://www.wilder.org/Programs-Services/tcmm/Pages/default.aspx|website=Twin Cities Mobile Market|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs such as these are helping to provide healthy, affordable foods to the people who need them the most.

Scientific advancements in genetics have significantly contributed to the knowledge of hereditary diseases and have facilitated great progress in specific protective measures in individuals who are carriers of a disease gene or have an increased predisposition to a specific disease. Genetic testing has allowed physicians to make quicker and more accurate diagnoses and has allowed for tailored treatments or [[personalized medicine]].&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt; Similarly, specific protective measures such as water purification, sewage treatment, and the development of personal hygienic routines (such as regular hand-washing) became mainstream upon the discovery of infectious disease agents such as bacteria. These discoveries have been instrumental in decreasing the rates of communicable diseases that are often spread in unsanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt; Preventing [[#Sexually transmitted infections]] is another form of primary prevention.

===Secondary prevention===
Secondary prevention deals with latent diseases and attempts to prevent an asymptomatic disease from progressing to symptomatic disease.&lt;ref name="IOM" /&gt; Certain diseases can be classified as primary or secondary. This depends on definitions of what constitutes a disease, though, in general, primary prevention addresses the root cause of a disease or injury&lt;ref name="IOM" /&gt; whereas secondary prevention aims to detect and treat a disease early on.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;Module 13: Levels of Disease Prevention. (2007, April 24). Retrieved March 16, 2014, from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website: https://www.cdc.gov/excite/skincancer/mod13.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary prevention consists of "early diagnosis and prompt treatment" to contain the disease and prevent its spread to other individuals, and "disability limitation" to prevent potential future complications and disabilities from the disease.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt; For example, early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a syphilis patient would include a course of antibiotics to destroy the pathogen and screening and treatment of any infants born to syphilitic mothers. Disability limitation for syphilitic patients includes continued check-ups on the heart, cerebrospinal fluid, and central nervous system of patients to curb any damaging effects such as blindness or paralysis.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt;

===Tertiary prevention===
Finally, tertiary prevention attempts to reduce the damage caused by symptomatic disease by focusing on mental, physical, and social rehabilitation. Unlike secondary prevention, which aims to prevent disability, the objective of tertiary prevention is to maximize the remaining capabilities and functions of an already disabled patient.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt; Goals of tertiary prevention include: preventing pain and damage, halting progression and complications from disease, and restoring the health and functions of the individuals affected by disease.&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt; For syphilitic patients, rehabilitation includes measures to prevent complete disability from the disease, such as implementing work-place adjustments for the blind and paralyzed or providing counseling to restore normal daily functions to the greatest extent possible.&lt;ref name="Hugh" /&gt;

==Leading causes of preventable death==

===United States===
The leading cause of death in the United States was tobacco. However, poor diet and lack of exercise may soon surpass tobacco as a leading cause of death. These behaviors are modifiable and public health and prevention efforts could make a difference to reduce these deaths.&lt;ref name="Mokdad" /&gt;

==Child mortality==
In 2010, 7.6 million children died before reaching the age of 5. While this is a decrease from 9.6 million in the year 2000,&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu L., Johnson H.

Targeting efforts in these countries is essential to reducing the global child death rate.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

Child mortality is caused by a variety of factors including poverty, environmental hazards, and lack of maternal education.&lt;ref name="Leading"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones G, Steketee R, Black R, Bhutta Z, Morris S | year = 2003 | title = How many child deaths can we prevent this year? | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 362 | issue = | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13811-1 | pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization created a list of interventions in the following table that were judged economically and operationally "feasible," based on the healthcare resources and infrastructure in 42 nations that contribute to 90% of all infant and child deaths.

==Preventive methods==

===Obesity===
[[Obesity]] is a major risk factor for a wide variety of conditions including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes. In order to prevent obesity, it is recommended that individuals adhere to a consistent exercise regimen as well as a nutritious and balanced diet. A healthy individual should aim for acquiring 10% of their energy from proteins, 15-20% from fat, and over 50% from complex carbohydrates, while avoiding alcohol as well as foods high in fat, salt, and sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumanyika|first1=S|last2=Jeffery|first2=R|last3=Ritenbaugh|first3=C|last4=Antipatis|first4=VJ|title=Obesity prevention: the case for action|journal=International Journal of Obesity|date=2002|volume=26|issue=3|pages=425–436|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedentary adults should aim for at least half an hour of moderate-level daily physical activity and eventually increase to include at least 20 minutes of intense exercise, three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kumanyika S., Jeffery R. W., Morabia A., Ritenbaugh C., Antipatis V. J. | year = 2002 | title = Obesity prevention: the case for action | url = | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 425–436 | doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive health care offers many benefits to those that chose to participate in taking an active role in the culture. The medical system in our society is geared toward curing acute symptoms of disease after the fact that they have brought us into the emergency room. An ongoing epidemic within American culture is the prevalence of obesity.  Eating healthier and routinely exercising plays a huge role in reducing an individuals risk for type 2 diabetes. About 23.6 million people in the United States have diabetes. Of those, 17.9 million are diagnosed and 5.7 million are undiagnosed. Ninety to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the main cause of kidney failure, limb amputation, and new-onset blindness in American adults.&lt;ref&gt;"Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)." Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

===Sexually transmitted infections===

[[Sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), such as [[syphilis]] and [[HIV]], are common but preventable with [[safe-sex]] practices. STIs can be asymptomatic, or cause a range of symptoms. Preventive measures include the use of [[condoms]]&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2014. 2013 Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance. Retrieved from: https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/syphilis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[dental dams]], [[latex gloves]], and education on how to use them; [[Bareback (sex)#Fluid bonding|testing partners]] before having unprotected sex; receiving regular STI screenings, to both receive treatment and prevent spreading STIs to partners; and, specifically for HIV, regularly taking prophylactic antiretroviral drugs, such as [[Truvada]]. [[Post-exposure prophylaxis]], started within 72 hours (optimally less than 1 hour) after exposure to high-risk fluids, can also protect against HIV transmission.

===Thrombosis===
{{Main|Thrombosis prophylaxis}}
[[Thrombosis]] is a serious circulatory disease affecting thousands, usually older persons undergoing surgical procedures, women taking oral contraceptives and travelers. Consequences of thrombosis can be heart attacks and strokes. Prevention can include: exercise, anti-embolism stockings, pneumatic devices, and pharmacological treatments.

===Cancer===
In recent years, [[cancer]] has become a global problem. Low and middle income countries share a majority of the cancer burden largely due to exposure to carcinogens resulting from industrialization and globalization.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vineis P., Wild C. P. | year = 2014 | title = Global cancer patterns: causes and prevention | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 383 | issue = 9916| page = 487 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62224-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, primary prevention of cancer and knowledge of cancer risk factors can reduce over one third of all cancer cases. Primary prevention of cancer can also prevent other diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, that share common risk factors with cancer.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

====Lung cancer====
[[File:Lung cancer US distribution.gif|thumb|Distribution of lung cancer in the United States]]
[[Lung cancer]] is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and Europe and is a major cause of death in other countries.&lt;ref name="lung"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman G. E. | year = 2000 | title = Prevention of lung cancer | url = | journal = Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 187–197 | doi=10.1016/s1040-8428(99)00074-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tobacco]] is an environmental [[carcinogen]] and the major underlying cause of lung cancer.&lt;ref name="lung" /&gt; Between 25% and 40% of all cancer deaths and about 90% of lung cancer cases are associated with tobacco use. Other carcinogens include asbestos and radioactive materials.&lt;ref name="lung cancer"&gt;Risser, N. L. (1996). Prevention of Lung Cancer: The Key Is to Stop Smoking . Seminars in Oncology Nursing, 12, 260-269.&lt;/ref&gt; Both smoking and second-hand exposure from other smokers can lead to lung cancer and eventually death.&lt;ref name="lung" /&gt; Therefore, prevention of tobacco use is paramount to prevention of lung cancer.

Individual, community, and statewide interventions can prevent or cease tobacco use. 90% of adults in the US who have ever smoked did so prior to the age of 20. In-school prevention/educational programs, as well as counseling resources, can help prevent and cease adolescent smoking.&lt;ref name="lung cancer" /&gt; Other cessation techniques include group support programs, [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT), hypnosis, and self-motivated behavioral change. Studies have shown long term success rates (&gt;1 year) of 20% for hypnosis and 10%-20% for group therapy.&lt;ref name="lung cancer" /&gt;

[[Cancer screening]] programs serve as effective sources of secondary prevention. The Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering hospitals conducted annual x-ray screenings and sputum cytology tests and found that lung cancer was detected at higher rates, earlier stages, and had more favorable treatment outcomes, which supports widespread investment in such programs.&lt;ref name="lung cancer" /&gt;

Legislation can also affect smoking prevention and cessation. In 1992, Massachusetts (United States) voters passed a bill adding an extra 25 cent tax to each pack of cigarettes, despite intense lobbying and a $7.3 million spent by the tobacco industry to oppose this bill. Tax revenue goes toward tobacco education and control programs and has led to a decline of tobacco use in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koh H. K. | year = 1996 | title = An analysis of the successful 1992 Massachusetts tobacco tax initiative | url = | journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 220–225 | doi=10.1136/tc.5.3.220| pmc = 1759517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lung cancer and tobacco smoking are increasing worldwide, especially in China. China is responsible for about one-third of the global consumption and production of tobacco products.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang J., Ou J., Bai C. | year = 2011 | title = Tobacco smoking in China: Prevalence, disease burden, challenges and future strategies | url = | journal = Respirology | volume = 16 | issue = 8| pages = 1165–1172 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco control policies have been ineffective as China is home to 350 million regular smokers and 750 million passive smokers and the annual death toll is over 1 million.&lt;ref name="China" /&gt; Recommended actions to reduce tobacco use include: decreasing tobacco supply, increasing tobacco taxes, widespread educational campaigns, decreasing advertising from the tobacco industry, and increasing tobacco cessation support resources.&lt;ref name="China" /&gt; In Wuhan, China, a 1998 school-based program, implemented an anti-tobacco curriculum for adolescents and reduced the number of regular smokers, though it did not significantly decrease the number of adolescents who initiated smoking. This program was therefore effective in secondary but not primary prevention and shows that school-based programs have the potential to reduce tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chou C. P., Li Y., Unger J. B., Xia J., Sun P., Guo Q., Johnson C. A. | year = 2006 | title = A randomized intervention of smoking for adolescents in urban Wuhan, China | url = | journal = Preventive Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 280–285 | doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2006.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skin cancer====
[[File:Melanoma (2).jpg|thumb|An image of melanoma, one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer]]
[[Skin cancer]] is the most common cancer in the United States.&lt;ref name="skin"&gt;MMWR. Recommendations and Reports : Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Recommendations and Reports / Centers for Disease Control [2002, 51(RR-4):1-18]&lt;/ref&gt; The most lethal form of skin cancer, melanoma, leads to over 50,000 annual deaths in the United States.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Childhood prevention is particularly important because a significant portion of ultraviolet radiation exposure from the sun occurs during childhood and adolescence and can subsequently lead to skin cancer in adulthood. Furthermore, childhood prevention can lead to the development of healthy habits that continue to prevent cancer for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends several primary prevention methods including: limiting sun exposure between 10 AM and 4 PM, when the sun is strongest, wearing tighter-weave natural cotton clothing, wide-brim hats, and sunglasses as protective covers, using sunscreens that protect against both UV-A and UV-B rays, and avoiding tanning salons.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Sunscreen should be reapplied after sweating, exposure to water (through swimming for example) or after several hours of sun exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Since skin cancer is very preventable, the CDC recommends school-level prevention programs including preventive curricula, family involvement, participation and support from the school's health services, and partnership with community, state, and national agencies and organizations to keep children away from excessive UV radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

Most skin cancer and sun protection data comes from Australia and the United States.&lt;ref name="skin cancer"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stanton W. R., Janda M., Baade P. D., Anderson P. | year = 2004 | title = Primary prevention of skin cancer: a review of sun protection in Australia and internationally | url = | journal = Health Promotion International | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 369–378 | doi=10.1093/heapro/dah310}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international study reported that Australians tended to demonstrate higher knowledge of sun protection and skin cancer knowledge, compared to other countries.&lt;ref name="skin cancer" /&gt; Of children, adolescents, and adults, sunscreen was the most commonly used skin protection. However, many adolescents purposely used sunscreen with a low sun protection factor (SPF)in order to get a tan.&lt;ref name="skin cancer" /&gt; Various Australian studies have shown that many adults failed to use sunscreen correctly; many applied sunscreen well after their initial sun exposure and/or failed to reapply when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Broadstock M | year = 1991 | title = Sun protection at cricket | url = | journal = Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 154 | issue = | page = 430 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pincus M.

====Cervical cancer====
[[File:Adenocarcinoma on pap test 2.jpg|thumb|The presence of cancer (adenocarcinoma) detected on a Pap test]]
[[Cervical cancer]] ranks among the top three most common cancers among women in [[Latin America]], [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and parts of [[Asia]]. Cervical cytology screening aims to detect abnormal lesions in the cervix so that women can undergo treatment prior to the development of cancer. Given that high quality screening and follow-up care has been shown to reduce cervical cancer rates by up to 80%, most developed countries now encourage sexually active women to undergo a [[Pap test]] every 3–5 years. Finland and Iceland have developed effective organized programs with routine monitoring and have managed to significantly reduce cervical cancer mortality while using fewer resources than unorganized, opportunistic programs such as those in the United States or Canada.&lt;ref name="cervical"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sankaranarayanan R., Budukh A.

In developing nations in Latin America, such as Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Cuba, both public and privately organized programs have offered women routine cytological screening since the 1970s. However, these efforts have not resulted in a significant change in cervical cancer incidence or mortality in these nations. This is likely due to low quality, inefficient testing. However, Puerto Rico, which has offered early screening since the 1960s, has witnessed an almost a 50% decline in cervical cancer incidence and almost a four-fold decrease in mortality between 1950 and 1990.
Brazil, Peru, India, and several high-risk nations in sub-Saharan Africa which lack organized screening programs, have a high incidence of cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="cervical" /&gt;

====Colorectal cancer====
[[Colorectal cancer]] is globally the second most common cancer in women and the third-most common in men,&lt;ref name="World Cancer Report 2014"&gt;{{cite book | title=World Cancer Report 2014 | publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization | date=2014 | isbn=978-92-832-0432-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth most common cause of cancer death after [[lung cancer|lung]], [[stomach cancer|stomach]], and [[liver cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink =World Health Organization | title=Cancer | publisher=World Health Organization | date=February 2010 | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ | accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; having caused 715,000 deaths in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lozano R| author2=Naghavi M| author3=Foreman K| title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 | journal=Lancet | volume=380 | issue=9859 | pages=2095–128 | date=December 2012 | pmid=23245604 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also highly preventable; about 80 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Carol A. Burke| author2=Laura K.

Other methods of screening for polyps and cancers include [[fecal occult blood]] testing. Lifestyle changes that may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer include increasing consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing consumption of red meat (see [[Colorectal cancer]]).

==Health disparities and barriers to accessing care==
Access to healthcare and preventive health services is unequal, as is the quality of care received. A study conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)revealed [[health disparities]] in the United States. In the United States, elderly adults (&gt;65 years old)received worse care and had less access to care than their younger counterparts. The same trends are seen when comparing all racial minorities (black, Hispanic, Asian) to white patients, and low-income people to high-income people.&lt;ref name="AHRQ" /&gt; Common barriers to accessing and utilizing healthcare resources included lack of income and education, language barriers, and lack of health insurance. Minorities were less likely than whites to possess health insurance, as were individuals who completed less education. These disparities made it more difficult for the disadvantaged groups to have regular access to a primary care provider, receive immunizations, or receive other types of medical care.&lt;ref name="AHRQ"&gt;Disparities in Healthcare Quality Among Racial and Ethnic Groups: Selected Findings from the 2011 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports.

Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/nhqrdr11/nhqrdrminority11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, uninsured people tend to not seek care until their diseases progress to chronic and serious states and they are also more likely to forgo necessary tests, treatments, and filling prescription medications.&lt;ref name="HCAB"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carrillo J.

These sorts of disparities and barriers exist worldwide as well. Often, there are decades of gaps in life expectancy between developing and developed countries. For example, Japan has an average life expectancy that is 36 years greater than that in Malawi.&lt;ref name="WHOO"&gt;Fact file on health inequities. (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2014, from World Health Organization website: http://www.who.int/sdhconference/background/news/facts/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Low-income countries also tend to have fewer physicians than high-income countries. In Nigeria and Myanmar, there are fewer than 4 physicians per 100,000 people while Norway and Switzerland have a ratio that is ten-fold higher.&lt;ref name="WHOO" /&gt; Common barriers worldwide include lack of availability of health services and healthcare providers in the region, great physical distance between the home and health service facilities, high transportation costs, high treatment costs, and social norms and stigma toward accessing certain health services.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, B., Ir, P., Bigdeli, M., Annear, P.

== Economics of lifestyle-based prevention ==
With lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise rising to the top of preventable death statistics, the economics of healthy lifestyle is a growing concern.  There is little question that positive lifestyle choices provide an investment in health throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53914/|title=Missed Prevention Opportunities|last=Medicine|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Roundtable on Evidence-Based|last2=Yong|first2=Pierre L.|last3=Saunders|first3=Robert S.|last4=Olsen|first4=LeighAnne|date=2010-01-01|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To gauge success, traditional measures such as the quality years of life method [[Quality-adjusted life year|(QALY),]] show great value.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Arenas, Daniel J., et al.

In addition to efficacy, prevention is considered a cost-saving measure.  [[Cost-effectiveness analysis]] of prevention is achievable, but impacted by the length of time it takes to see effects/outcomes of intervention.

==Effectiveness==
'''Overview'''

There is no general consensus as to whether or not preventive healthcare measures are cost-effective, but they increase the [[quality of life]] dramatically. There are varying views on what constitutes a "good investment." Some argue that preventive health measures should save more money than they cost, when factoring in treatment costs in the absence of such measures. Others argue in favor of "good value" or conferring significant health benefits even if the measures do not save money&lt;ref name="Healthaffairs"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maciosek Michael V., Coffield Ashley B., Flottemesch Thomas J., Edwards Nichol M., Solberg Leif I. | year = 2010 | title = Greater Use Of Preventive Services In U.S. Health Care Could Save Lives At Little Or No Cost | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 29 | issue = 9| pages = 1656–1660 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2008.0701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Russell Louise B| year = 1993 | title = The role of prevention in health reform | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 329 | issue = 5| pages = 352–354 | doi=10.1056/nejm199307293290511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, preventive health services are often described as one entity though they comprise a myriad of different services, each of which can individually lead to net costs, savings, or neither. Greater differentiation of these services is necessary to fully understand both the financial and health effects.&lt;ref name="Healthaffairs" /&gt;

A 2010 study reported that in the United States, vaccinating children, cessation of smoking, daily prophylactic use of aspirin, and [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] of breast and colorectal cancers had the most potential to prevent premature death.&lt;ref name="Healthaffairs" /&gt; Preventive health measures that resulted in savings included vaccinating children and adults, smoking cessation, daily use of aspirin, and screening for issues with alcoholism, obesity, and vision failure.&lt;ref name="Healthaffairs" /&gt; These authors estimated that if usage of these services in the United States increased to 90% of the population, there would be net savings of $3.7  billion, which comprised only about -0.2% of the total 2006 [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] expenditure.&lt;ref name="Healthaffairs" /&gt; Despite the potential for decreasing healthcare spending, utilization of healthcare resources in the United States still remains low, especially among Latinos and African-Americans.&lt;ref name="aspirin"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maciosek MV, Coffield AB, Edwards NM, Flottemesch TJ, Goodman MJ, Solberg LI | year = 2006 | title = Priorities among effective clinical preventive services: results of a systematic review and analysis | url = | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 52–61 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2006.03.012| pmid = 16777543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, preventive services are difficult to implement because healthcare providers have limited time with patients and must integrate a variety of preventive health measures from different sources.&lt;ref name="aspirin" /&gt;

While these specific services bring about small net savings not every preventive health measure saves more than it costs. A 1970s study showed that preventing heart attacks by treating hypertension early on with drugs actually did not save money in the long run. The money saved by evading treatment from [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] only amounted to about a quarter of the cost of the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein MC, Stason WB.

Cohen et al. (2008) outline a few arguments made by skeptics of preventive healthcare. Many argue that preventive measures only cost less than future treatment when the proportion of the population that would become ill in the absence of prevention is fairly large.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cohen J.T., Neumann P.J., Weinstein M.C. | year = 2008 | title = Does Preventive Care Save Money?

They argue that while many treatments of existing diseases involve use of advanced equipment and technology, in some cases, this is a more efficient use of resources than attempts to prevent the disease.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Cohen et al. (2008) suggest that the preventive measures most worth exploring and investing in are those that could benefit a large portion of the population to bring about cumulative and widespread health benefits at a reasonable cost.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

;Cost-Effectiveness of Childhood Obesity Interventions
There are at least four nationally implemented [[childhood obesity]] interventions in the United States: the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage excise tax (SSB), the TV AD program, active physical education (Active PE) policies, and early care and education (ECE) policies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cost Effectiveness of Childhood Obesity Interventions|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379715001543|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|pages = 102–111|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.03.032|first = Steven L.|last = Gortmaker|first2 = Michael W.|last2 = Long|first3 = Stephen C.|last3 = Resch|first4 = Zachary J.|last4 = Ward|first5 = Angie L.|last5 = Cradock|first6 = Jessica L.|last6 = Barrett|first7 = Davene R.|last7 = Wright|first8 = Kendrin R.|last8 = Sonneville|first9 = Catherine M.|last9 = Giles|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They each have similar goals of reducing childhood obesity.

Gortmaker, S.L. et al. (2015) states: "The four initial interventions were selected by the investigators to represent a broad range of nationally scalable strategies to reduce childhood obesity using a mix of both policy and programmatic strategies... 1. an excise tax of $0.01 per ounce of [[sweetened beverage]]s, applied nationally and administered at the state level (SSB), 2. elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising costs of TV advertisements for "nutritionally poor" foods and beverages seen by children and adolescents (TV AD), 3. state policy requiring all public elementary schools in which physical education (PE) is currently provided to devote ≥50% of PE class time to moderate and vigorous physical activity (Active PE), and 4. state policy to make early child educational settings healthier by increasing physical activity, improving nutrition, and reducing screen time (ECE)."

The CHOICES found that SSB, TV AD, and ECE led to net cost savings.  Both SSB and TV AD increased quality adjusted life years and produced yearly tax revenue of 12.5 billion US dollars and 80 million US dollars, respectively.

Some challenges with evaluating the effectiveness of child obesity interventions include:
# The economic consequences of childhood obesity are both short and long term.  In the short term, obesity impairs cognitive achievement and academic performance.

;The Economics of Preventive Care in the US
The cost-effectiveness of preventive care is a highly debated topic. While some economists argue that preventive care is valuable and potentially cost saving, others believe it is an inefficient waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2009/rwjf46045/subassets/rwjf46045_1|title=The cost savings and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventative care. Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|last=Cohen|first=Joshua|date=|website=THE SYNTHESIS PROJECT|publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventive care is composed of a variety of clinical services and programs including annual doctor’s check-ups, annual immunizations, and wellness programs. Recent models show that these simple interventions can have significant impacts.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

''Clinical Preventive Services &amp; Programs''

Research on preventive care addresses the question of whether it is cost saving or cost effective and whether there is an economics evidence base for health promotion and disease prevention.  The need for and interest in preventive care is driven by the imperative to reduce health care costs while improving quality of care and the patient experience. Preventive care can lead to improved health outcomes and cost savings potential. Services such as [[health assessment]]s/screenings, [[prenatal care]], and [[telehealth]] and [[telemedicine]] can reduce morbidity or mortality with low cost or cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;Merkur, S., Sassi, F., &amp; McDaid, D.

''Understanding the Economics for Investment''

There are benefits and trade-offs when considering investment in preventive care versus other types of clinical services. Preventive care can be a good investment as supported by the evidence base and can drive population health management objectives.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The concepts of cost saving and cost-effectiveness are different and both are relevant to preventive care.  For example, preventive care that may not save money may still provide health benefits. Thus, there is a need to compare interventions relative to impact on health and cost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. (2009). The cost savings and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. ''The Synthesis Project: New Insights from Research Results.'' Research Synthesis Report No. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventive care transcends demographics and is applicable to people of every age. The Health Capital Theory underpins the importance of preventive care across the lifecycle and provides a framework for understanding the variances in health and health care that are experienced. It treats health as a stock that provides direct utility.  Health depreciates with age and the aging process can be countered through health investments.  The theory further supports that individuals demand good health, that the demand for health investment is a derived demand (i.e. investment is health is due to the underlying demand for good health), and the efficiency of the health investment process increases with knowledge (i.e. it is assumed that the more educated are more efficient consumers and producers of health).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Galama T. J., van Kippersluis H. | year = 2013 | title = Health Inequalities through the Lens of Health Capital Theory: Issues, Solutions, and Future Directions | url = http://doi.org/10.1108/S1049-2585(2013)0000021013 | journal = Research on Economic Inequality | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 263–284 | doi=10.1108/S1049-2585(2013)0000021013| pmid = 24570580 | pmc = 3932058 | series = Research on Economic Inequality | isbn = 978-1-78190-553-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence elasticity of demand for prevention can also provide insights into the economics.  Demand for preventive care can alter the prevalence rate of a given disease and further reduce or even reverse any further growth of prevalence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reduction in prevalence subsequently leads to reduction in costs.

''Economics for Policy Action''

There are a number of organizations and policy actions that are relevant when discussing the economics of preventive care services. The evidence base, viewpoints, and policy briefs from the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]], and efforts by the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)]] all provide examples that improve the health and well-being of populations (e.g. preventive health assessments/screenings, prenatal care, and telehealth/telemedicine). [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, ACA)]] has major influence on the provision of preventive care services, although it is currently under heavy scrutiny and review by the new administration.  According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], the ACA makes preventive care affordable and accessible through mandatory coverage of preventive services without a deductible, copayment, coinsurance, or other cost sharing.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013). Preventive Health Care. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/preventivehealth.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a panel of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine, works to improve health of Americans by making evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). (2017, Jan). USPSTF A and B Recommendations. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  They do not consider the cost of a preventive service when determining a recommendation. Each year, the organization delivers a report to Congress that identifies critical evidence gaps in research and recommends priority areas for further review.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). (2016, Dec). ''Reports to Congress.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/reports-to-congress&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Network of Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (NNPQC), sponsored by the CDC, supports state-based perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs) in measuring and improving upon health care and health outcomes for mothers and babies.  These PQCs have contributed to improvements such as reduction in deliveries before 39 weeks, reductions in healthcare associated blood stream infections, and improvements in the utilization of antenatal corticosteroids.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2017, Feb. 27). Perinatal Quality Collaboratives. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pqc.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Telehealth and telemedicine has realized significant growth and development recently.  The Center for Connected Health Policy (The National Telehealth Policy Resource Center) has produced multiple reports and policy briefs on the topic of Telehealth and Telemedicine and how they contribute to preventive services.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Connected Health Policy. The National Telehealth Policy Resource Center. Reports and Policy Briefs. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.telehealthpolicy.us/reports-and-policy-briefs&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy actions and provision of preventive services do not guarantee utilization.   Reimbursement has remained a significant barrier to adoption due to variances in payer and state level reimbursement policies and guidelines through government and commercial payers.  Americans use preventive services at about half the recommended rate and cost-sharing, such as deductibles, co-insurance, or copayments, also reduce the likelihood that preventive services will be used.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Further, despite the ACA’s enhancement of Medicare benefits and preventive services, there were no effects on preventive service utilization, calling out the fact that other fundamental barriers exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jensen G.A., Salloum R.G., Hu J., Ferdows N.B., Tarraf W. | year = 2015 | title = A slow start: Use of preventive services among seniors following the Affordable Care Act's enhancement of Medicare benefits in the U.S | url = | journal = Preventive Medicine | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 37–42 | doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.023| pmid = 25895838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Health insurance and Preventive Care''&lt;br /&gt;
Healthcare insurance companies are willing to pay for preventive care despite the fact that patients are not acutely sick in hope that it will prevent them from developing a chronic disease later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The economics of health and health care|last=Folland|first=S|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2010|isbn=|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, health insurance plans offered through the Marketplace, mandated by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] are required to provide certain preventive care services free of charge to patients. [https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/aca_implementation_faqs12.html Section 2713] of the Affordable Care Act, specifies that all private Marketplace and all employer-sponsored private plans (except those grandfathered in) are required to cover preventive care services that are ranked A or B by the US Preventive Services Task Force free of charge to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complianceadministrators.com/ppaca-preventive-care-coverage-requirements/|title=ACA: Preventive Care Coverage Requirements  —  Compliancedashboard: Interactive Web-Based Compliance Tool|website=complianceadministrators.com|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/preventive-services-covered-by-private-health-plans/#endnote_link_160040-3.|title=Preventive Services Covered by Private Health Plans under the Affordable Care Act|website=kff.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UnitedHealthcare insurance company has published patient guidelines at the beginning of the year explaining their preventive care coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedhealthcareonline.com/ccmcontent/ProviderII/UHC/en-US/Assets/ProviderStaticFiles/ProviderStaticFilesPdf/Tools%20and%20Resources/Policies%20and%20P|title=Preventative care services|last=|first=|date=|website=UnitedHealthcare|publisher=|access-date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Evaluating Incremental Benefits of Preventive Care''&lt;br /&gt;
Evaluating the incremental benefits of preventive care requires longer period of time when compared to acute ill patients. Inputs into the model such as, discounting rate and time horizon can have significant effects of the results.  One controversial subject is use of 10-year time frame to assess cost effectiveness of diabetes preventive services by the Congressional Budget Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/sites/default/files/docs/PFCD_whitepaper5.21.09_0.pdf|title=Health-Care Cost Projections for Diabetes and other Chronic Diseases: The Current Context and Potential Enhancement.|last=O'Grady|first=M|date=|website=Fight Chronic Disease|publisher=|access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An Economic Case for Preventive Health'''

''Mortality from Modifiable Risk Factors''

Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity and cancer have become the most common and costly health problems in the United States. In 2014, it was projected that by 2023 that the number of chronic disease cases would increase by 42%, resulting in $4.2 trillion in treatment and lost economic output.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Milken Institute.  (January 2014). Checkup Time, Chronic Disease and Wellness in America: Measuring the Economic Burden in a Changing Nation.

CDC National Health Report Highlights. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://www.cdc.gov/healthreport/publications/compendium.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic diseases are driven by risk factors that are largely preventable.

(2017). Chronic Diseases Overview. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/index.htm#ref2&lt;/ref&gt; Modifiable risk factors are also responsible for a large morbidity burden, resulting in poor quality of life in the present and loss of future life earning years2. It is further estimated that by 2023, focused efforts on the prevention and treatment of chronic disease may result in 40 million fewer chronic disease cases, potentially reducing treatment costs by $220 billion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''Childhood Vaccinations Reduce Health Care Costs''

Childhood immunizations are largely responsible for the increase in life expectancy in the 20th century. From an economic standpoint, childhood vaccines demonstrate a very high return on investment.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; According to Healthy People 2020, for every birth cohort that receives the routine childhood vaccination schedule, direct health care costs are reduced by $9.9 billion and society saves $33.4 billion in indirect costs.&lt;ref&gt;Healthy People 2020.

''Prevention and Health Capital Theory''
 
The burden of preventable illness extends beyond the healthcare sector, incurring significant costs related to lost productivity among workers in the workforce. Indirect costs related to poor health behaviors and associated chronic disease costs U.S. employers billions of dollars each year.

According to the [http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/36/4/1033.long American Diabetes Association (ADA)], medical costs for employees with diabetes are twice as high as for workers without diabetes and are caused by work-related absenteeism ($5 billion), reduced productivity at work ($20.8 billion), inability to work due to illness-related disability ($21.6 billion), and premature mortality ($18.5 billion). Reported estimates of the cost burden due to increasingly high levels of overweight and obese members in the workforce vary,&lt;ref&gt;Goettler, A., Grosse, A., &amp; Sonntag, D. (2017). Productivity loss due to overweight and obesity: a systematic review of indirect costs. BMJ Open, 7:e014632. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640019/pdf/bmjopen-2016-014632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with best estimates suggesting 450 million more missed work days, resulting in $153 billion each year in lost productivity, according to the [https://www.cdcfoundation.org/businesspulse/healthy-workforce-infographic CDC Healthy Workforce].

In the field of economics, the Health Capital model explains how individual investments in health can increase earnings by “increasing the number of healthy days available to work and to earn income.”&lt;ref&gt;Folland, S., Goodman, A.C., &amp; Stano, M. (2016). Demand for Health Capital. The Economics of Health and Healthcare, 7th ed. (p. 130). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, health can be treated both as a consumption good, wherein individuals desire health because it improves quality of life in the present, and as an investment good because of its potential to increase attendance and workplace productivity over time. Preventive health behaviors such as healthful diet, regular exercise, access to and use of well-care, avoiding tobacco, and limiting alcohol can be viewed as health inputs that result in both a healthier workforce and substantial cost savings.

''Preventive Care and Quality Adjusted Life Years''

Health benefits of preventive care measures can be described in terms of [[Quality-adjusted life year|quality-adjusted life-years]] (QALYs) saved. A QALY takes into account length and quality of life, and is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical and preventive interventions. Classically, one year of perfect health is defined as 1 QALY and a year with any degree of less than perfect health is assigned a value between 0 and 1 QALY.&lt;ref&gt;The Synthesis Project, Policy Brief No. 18. (September 2009). Cost savings and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2009/rwjf46045&lt;/ref&gt; As an economic weighting system, the QALY can be used to inform personal decisions, to evaluate preventive interventions and to set priorities for future preventive efforts.

Cost-saving and cost-effective benefits of preventive care measures are well established. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation evaluated the prevention cost-effectiveness literature, and found that many preventive measures meet the benchmark of &lt;$100,000 per QALY and are considered to be [https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2009/09/cost-savings-and-cost-effectiveness-of-clinical-preventive-care.html favorably cost-effective]. These include screenings for HIV and chlamydia, cancers of the colon, breast and cervix, vision screening, and screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in men &gt;60 in certain populations. Alcohol and tobacco screening were found to be cost-saving in some reviews and cost-effective in others. According to the RWJF analysis, two preventive interventions were found to save costs in all reviews: childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of aspirin.

''Prevention in Minority Populations''

Health disparities are increasing in the United States for chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Populations at heightened risk for health inequities are the growing proportion of racial and ethnic minorities, including African Americans, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, Asian Americans, Alaska Natives and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. (2012). The economic case for health equity. Accessed 3/18/18 from http://www.astho.org/Programs/Health-Equity/Economic-Case-Issue-Brief/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/reach/ Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH)], a national CDC program, Non-Hispanic blacks currently have the highest rates of obesity (48%), and risk of newly diagnosed diabetes is 77% higher among non-Hispanic blacks, 66% higher among Hispanics/Latinos and 18% higher among Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. Current U.S. population projections predict that more than half of Americans will belong to a minority group by 2044.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, S.L., &amp; Ortman, J.M. (March, 2015). Projections of the size and composition of the U.S. population: 2014-2060. United States Census Bureau: Current Population Reports, pp. 25-1143. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1143.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Without targeted preventive interventions, medical costs from chronic disease inequities will become unsustainable. Broadening health policies designed to improve delivery of preventive services for minority populations may help reduce substantial medical costs caused by inequities in health care, resulting in a return on investment.

''Policies of Prevention''
 
[[Community health|Chronic disease]] is a population level issue that requires population health level efforts and national and state level public policy to effectively prevent, rather than individual level efforts. The United States currently employs many public health policy efforts aligned with the preventive health efforts discussed above. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support initiatives such as Health in All Policies and HI-5 (Health Impact in 5 Years), collaborative efforts that aim to consider prevention across sectors&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (9 June 2016). Health in All Policies.

''Policy Prevention of Obesity''

Policies that address the obesity epidemic should be proactive and far-reaching, including a variety of stakeholders both in healthcare and in other sectors. Recommendations from the Institute of Medicine in 2012 suggest that “…concerted action be taken across and within five environments (physical activity (PA), food and beverage, marketing and messaging, healthcare and worksites, and schools) and all sectors of society (including government, business and industry, schools, child care, urban planning, recreation, transportation, media, public health, agriculture, communities, and home) in order for obesity prevention efforts to truly be successful.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chriqui J.F. | year = 2013 | title = Obesity prevention policies in U.S. states and localities: lessons from the field | url = | journal = Curr Obes Rep | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 200–210 | doi = 10.1007/s13679-013-0063-x | pmc = 3916087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are dozens of current policies acting at either (or all of) the federal, state, local and school levels.  Most states employ a physical education requirement of 150 minutes of physical education per week at school, a policy of the National Association of Sport and Physical Education.  In some cities, including Philadelphia, a sugary food tax is employed. This is a part of an amendment to Title 19 of the Philadelphia Code, “Finance, Taxes and Collections”; Chapter 19-4100, “Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax, that was approved 2016, which establishes an excise tax of $0.015 per fluid ounce on distributors of beverages sweetened with both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners.&lt;ref&gt;City of Philadelphia. Bill No. 160176. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://beta.phila.gov/media/20170209150802/CertifiedCopy16017601-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Distributors are required to file a return with the department, and the department can collect taxes, among other responsibilities.

These policies can be a source of tax credits. For example, under the Philadelphia policy, businesses can apply for tax credits with the revenue department on a first-come, first-served basis. This applies until the total amount of credits for a particular year reaches one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Healthy Food Policy Project. (2017).

Recently, advertisements for food and beverages directed at children have received much attention. The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) is a self-regulatory program of the food industry. Each participating company makes a public pledge that details its commitment to advertise only foods that meet certain nutritional criteria to children under 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Council for Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (2018). Accessed 3/18/18 from https://bbbprograms.org/programs/CFBAI/&lt;/ref&gt; This is a self-regulated program with policies written by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded research to test the efficacy of the CFBAI. The results showed progress in terms of decreased advertising of food products that target children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, W.C. &amp; Harris, J.L. (June 2017). Trends in television food advertising to young people: 2016 update. Accessed 3/18/18 from http://www.uconnruddcenter.org/files/TVAdTrends2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''Childhood Immunization Policies''

Despite nationwide controversies over childhood vaccination and immunization, there are policies and programs at the federal, state, local and school levels outlining vaccination requirements.  All states require children to be vaccinated against certain communicable diseases as a condition for school attendance. However, currently 18 states allow exemptions for “philosophical or moral reasons.” Diseases for which vaccinations form part of the standard ACIP vaccination schedule are diphtheria tetanus pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis (polio), measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal infections.&lt;ref&gt;Immunization Action Coalition. (2018). State mandates on immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases. Accessed 3/18/18 from http://www.immunize.org/laws/&lt;/ref&gt; These schedules can be viewed on the CDC website.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2018). Recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger, United States, 2018. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/child-adolescent.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC website describes a federally funded program, Vaccines for Children (VFC), which provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Additionally, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Accessed 3/18/18 from https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; is an expert vaccination advisory board that informs vaccination policy and guides on-going recommendations to the CDC, incorporating the most up-to-date cost-effectiveness and risk-benefit evidence in its recommendations.

''An Economic Case Conclusion''

There are economic and health related arguments for preventive healthcare. Direct and indirect medical costs related to preventable chronic disease are high, and will continue to rise with an aging and increasingly diverse U.S. population. The government, at federal, state, local and school levels has acknowledged this and created programs and policies to support chronic disease prevention, notably at the childhood age, and focusing on obesity prevention and vaccination. Economically, with an increase in QALY and a decrease in lost productivity over a lifetime, existing and innovative prevention interventions demonstrate a high return on investment and are expected to result in substantial healthcare cost-savings over time.

He was the brother of [[Leonard Fein|Leonard J.

Fein served on the Advisory Committee of the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action&lt;ref name="jta.org"/&gt; He died of [[melanoma]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/us/rashi-fein-economist-who-urged-medicare-dies-at-88.html|title=Rashi Fein, Economist Who Urged Medicare, Dies at 88|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=13 September 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He began his service to the [[United States]] during [[World War II]] in the [[US Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keywiki.org/Rashi_Fein|title=Rashi Fein - KeyWiki|website=keywiki.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent much of his time after that thinking and writing about [[health care reform]]. He was a member of the [[Truman Committee|Truman Commission on the Health Care Needs of the Nation]], which, as early as 1952, had supported [[national health insurance]] and the regionalization of [[health care delivery]]. Later, he served on President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Council of Economic Advisors]] as a senior staff member (1961-1963). There, he helped to develop the initial legislation for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], a healthcare model that he continued to advocate throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/ssa/lbjexternal3.html|title=Social Security History|website=www.socialsecurity.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/archives/cohenguide.htm|title=Papers of Wilbur J.

He had authored nine books, the most recent of which was ''Lessons Learned: Medicine, Economics and Public Policy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Gerald F.|date=22 September 2010|title=Learning Lessons: Medicine, Economics, and Public Policy|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=186595|journal=JAMA|volume=304|issue=12|pages=|doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1380|via=jamanetwork.com|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthpolicyscholars.org/rashi-fein Profile Page for Rashi Fein, Scholars in Health Policy Research, Robert Wood Johnson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195154/http://healthpolicyscholars.org/rashi-fein |date=2014-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the Harvard faculty of the [[Harvard Medical School|school of medicine]] and the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] in 1968.  He also served as senior fellow in the [[economics]] program at the [[Brookings Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

His 1982 paper "What Is Wrong with the Language of Medicine?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM198204083061409|title=What Is Wrong with the Language of Medicine?|first=Rashi|last=Fein|date=8 April 1982|publisher=|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=306|issue=14|pages=863–864|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1056/NEJM198204083061409|pmid=7062966}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A new language is infecting the culture of American medicine. It is the language of the marketplace, of the tradesman, and of the cost accountant. It is a language that depersonalizes both patients and physicians and describes medical care as just another commodity. It is a language that is dangerous.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A decent medical-care system that helps all the people cannot be built without the language of equity and care. If this language is permitted to die and is completely replaced by the language of efficiency and cost control, all of us — including physicians — will lose something precious.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He served as chair of the National Advisory Committee (NAC) for the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]]'s Scholars in Health Policy Research Program from 1994 to 2002 and was its Chair Emeritus until his death.  His work included [[benefit-cost analysis]], [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|health care financing]], [[health workforce|health care workforce policy]], [[Health maintenance organization#cost containment|cost containment]], the [[Medicare (United States)#Graduate Medical Education|financing]] of [[medical education]], and [[health care reform]]. His first book was ''Economics of Mental Illness'' (1958). His last (2010) book, ''Lessons Learned: Medicine, Economics and Public Policy'', was built on the various lessons and stories that, as Chair of the NAC, he had presented over the years at the Scholars’ Annual Meeting in Aspen.

As an invited speaker, he presented his soon-to-be-piblished book at the "Health Care Reform 2009: Politics and Paranoia" in [[Boston]] on October 21, 2009, sponsored by the Boston [[Democratic Socialists of America]] and Mass-Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openmediaboston.org/content/health-care-reform-2009-politics-and-paranoia|title=Health Care Reform 2009: Politics and Paranoia - Open Media Boston|website=openmediaboston.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among colleagues, Fein was admired for his wry, often-humorous [[anecdotes]] drawn from [[Jewish culture]] and over 50 years of experience in the policy arena, which he brought together in his final book, ''Learning Lessons: Medicine, Economics, and Public Policy'' (Transaction Publishers, 2010).&lt;ref name="mazon.org"/&gt;

He also had served as a Director at Newbridge on the Charles, a senior living facility, an affiliate of the [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewseniorlife.org/newbridge-leadership-team|title=The NewBridge Leadership Team - Here for You - NewBridge on the Charles|website=www.hebrewseniorlife.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.equilar.com/bio/newbridge-on/school/23062#.VA9DiYbF-2d|title=NEWBRIDGE ON THE CHARLES INC - Alumni and Associates - Equilar BoardEdge|website=people.equilar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aqueduct of Santa Clara''' is the second largest [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] system. Built between 1626 and 1714, it includes 999 arches stretching for {{convert|4|km|mi}} from the spring of Terroso in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Póvoa de Varzim]] to the [[Convent of Santa Clara, Vila do Conde|Convent of Santa Clara]] in the municipality of [[Vila do Conde]].

==History==
[[File:Igreja de Santa Clara vila do conde aqueduto (2).JPG|thumb|235px|left|Segment of the aqueduct as it meets the convent]]
[[File:Aqueduto de Vila do Conde.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Part of the pillars of the 999 arches]]
Founded at the beginning of the 14th century, the monastic community of Santa Clara always debated the problems with water supply to the monastery in the territory of Vila do Conde.&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/en/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/71209 |title=Aqueduto de Vila do Conde |publisher=Direção-Geral de Património Cultural |editor=GIF/IPPAR |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |accessdate=16 April 2015 |first=Catarina |last=Oliveira |date=28 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time a tank (the ''arca de água'') was constructed within the monastery, which quickly became insufficient to the communities needs.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; In 1626, the abbey D. Maria de Meneses, from the House of Pentieiros, purchased lands and contracted a master-builder to construct an aqueduct to bring waters from a spring in Terroso, in Póvoa de Varzim, to support the convent.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3904 |title=Aqueduto de Vila do Conde/Aqueduto de Santa Clara (IPA.00003904/PT011316280006) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Isabel |last=Sereno |first2=Paula |last2=Noé |year=1997 |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction was interrupted by abbey D. Catarina Lima in 1636, owing to the discovery of a significant slope, making the prior work useless.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 19 December 1705, the project was restarted, under abbess D. Bárbara Micaela de Ataíde, from the House of Honra e Barbosa, in Penafiel.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; The abbess put the project under the direction of captain Domingos Lopes, from Porto and artillery lieutenant-general Manuel de Villa Lobos.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Further support for the project was obtained by D. Bárbara de Ataíde, who (along with sisters D. Maria Ângela and D. Maria António) and brother D. Manuel de Azevedo de Ataíde (Military Governor of the Province of Minho) petitioned the King to provide a private judge and exempt the workers from military service.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Although the project was tendered to masterbuilder João Rodrigues (from Ponta de Lima), but failed to complete the project.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; It was then passed to Domingos Moreira (from Moreira da Maia), who was tasked to complete the project and paid 4400$00 [[Portuguese real|réis]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first waters reached the convent's cloister on 20 October 1714.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

By 2 October 1739, the Congregation of Rites confirmed the excommunication of people caught stealing water from the aqueduct.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Somewhere around Casal do Monte, during a storm on 10 June 1794, 46 arches were knocked down.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 1929 and 1932, there was an intentional deconstruction of five arches, during the restoration of the Church of Santa Clara, in order to improve the view of the apse.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A tender was issued in January 2004, in order promote the conservation and consolidate the structure.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 25 November 2006, the spaces surrounding the aqueduct were requalified (between the monastery of Santa Clara and ''Rua da Lada''), authored by architect Manuel Maia Gomes, who received the ''Alexandre Herculano National Architecture Award'' by the ''Associação Portuguesa dos Municípios'' (APMCH), the ''Portuguese Municipal Association''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Yet, although the structure was legally protected in 1910, several arches fell as recently as December 2009 and the destroyed arches were not recovered.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This problem mostly affects the area of the monument located in Póvoa de Varzim, due to lack of maintenance, a responsibility of the national government.

==Architecture==
The aqueduct is located in a rural environment, isolated and elevated position, annexed to existing structures; some parts of the aqueduct are connected to the Convent of Santa Clara and the Convent of Nossa Senhora da Encarnação.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The artificial canal extends from the convent to the spring, an extension formed by 999 arches.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Of the original structure, a great part of the early aqueduct has been weakened over time, not including the segment from the Church of Santa Clara until the municipal limits, an extension of {{convert|500|m|ft}} of {{convert|4|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The aqueduct has a decreasing arcade span and height, with pointed arches and a rounded upper channel profile.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

'''Total conversation''' is an ITU standard of simultaneous video, voice and text service in telecommunications. Total conversation allows people in two or more locations to: (a) see each other, (b) hear each other, and (c) conduct a text interaction ([[real-time text]]) with each other, or choose to communicate with any combination of those three modes and to do so in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realtimetext.org/index.php?pagina=61 Total Conversation explained at realtimetext.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard was defined in [[ITU-T]] recommendation F.703&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-F.703-200011-I/en F.703 : Multimedia conversational services]&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000 as "an audiovisual conversation service providing bidirectional symmetric real-time transfer of motion video, text and voice between users in two or more locations".

== Application ==

* Conference call for businesses will need to use audio and text and may use video to share documents.
* Deaf people using [[sign language]] would be more than satisfied to call each other with video.
* Deaf people using sign language can also call, and be called by hearing people using [[Video Relay Service]].
* Hard of hearing people to call each other directly with voice and text and even video for lip-reading. 
* Hard of hearing and  deaf people who do not use sign language (orally and late deafened) need to access a [[Text Relay Service]] with an audio plus text call in order to be able to speak but also to receive captions.
* Text-only call is the only way to make a call for deaf-blind user using [[Braille]] display.
* Text call mixed to audio feedback is the only way to make a call for speech disabled user
* video, text and audio combined call is the only suitable way to make a call for cognitive disabled user.
* Text only call might be convenient in situation when audio communication is not permitted, available or dangerous (noisy situation, low bandwidth).
* Support and hot line might be contacted with an audio-only call and add a video stream if the user needs to show the actual issue he or she is facing on a device.

== Universal design ==

Total conversation is a straightforward application of [[universal design]] principles applied to telecommunication field. This standard brings communication services to the broadest range of population including deaf people, hard or hearing people but also people who have speech impairment, people with cognitive impairment, elderly people, children,  and also ... regular users. It is an enhancement of call services that provides a better experience to all. Total conversation uses video, text and audio. These media can be combined or not depending on the type of profile used : many user profiles have to be taken into account. Such methodology is named Universal Design.

== Implementation of the standard ==

=== Available implementations ===

A number of European companies including 4CTel, Aupix, IVèS, nWise, Omnitor, and Orange Labs produced implementations. These are mostly used to provide user-to-user calls and [[relay services]] for deaf and hard of hearing people.

Total conversation was piloted in a European project called REACH112,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reach112.eu Reach112 project website]&lt;/ref&gt; named after the [[1-1-2]] European emergency number, whose purpose was to carry out test deployment of total conversation in a live environment with several thousands users and for three usages:

* European wide person to person calls
* Total Conversation Relay Services for deaf people
* Total Conversation used for emergency calls.

=== Specifications ===

Total conversation specifications describe:

* An interconnection interface between total conversation service providers including relay services.
* A user to network interface for videophone manufacturers.
* A call interface for Next Generation Emergency Services in Europe Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eena.org/view/en/Committees/NG112.html Next Generation 112] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929225731/http://www.eena.org/view/en/Committees/NG112.html |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including an information sharing capability.

Total conversation defines three basic services

* seamless multimedia person to person calls including the ability to call regular telephone users.
* the ability to invoke a relay service by deaf or hard of hearing persons,
* the ability to call emergency services in total conversation mode.

Example of technical protocols used by total conversation are:

* [[Session Initiation Protocol]]  for call signalling,
* T.140&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.140/fr T.140 : T.140]&lt;/ref&gt; with an RFC 4103.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4103 RFC4103 RTP Payload for T.140]&lt;/ref&gt; for real-time text&lt;ref&gt;[[Text over IP|RTT in SIP: Text over IP (ToIP)]]&lt;/ref&gt; (RTT)
* Video codecs [[H.263]] and preferably [[H.264]].
* Audio codec ITU-T G.711 and other as commonly used in VoIP calls.
(* Use of [[Common Alerting Protocol]] may be also considered to share information with Emergency Services.)

== Over instant messaging ==

[[AOL Instant Messenger]] supports the simultaneous use of audio, video, and real-time text via the "Real-Time IM"&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=223568 AOL Instant Messenger "Real-Time IM"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312102140/http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=223568 |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; feature.  This would be considered compliant with Total Conversation.

For other chat networks such as [[Google Talk]], the [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] protocol technically allow for total conversation by combining multiple XMPP Extensions, such as XEP-0266 audio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0266.html XEP-0266 Codecs for Jingle Audio]&lt;/ref&gt; XEP-0299 video,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0266.html XEP-0299 Codecs for Jingle Video]&lt;/ref&gt; and XEP-0301 real-time text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0301.html XEP-0301 In-Band Real-Time Text]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2011, Google Talk only supports audio/video, but not real-time text yet.

[[Skype]] has been supporting simultaneous audio, video, and real-time text.

== IP multimedia subsystem ==

Total conversation basically provides a multi-media call services with specific media enabled. 
The currently most common implementation environment is native SIP as described above.

Total conversation can also be implemented in other call control environments. 
One such environment is [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]] (IMS) in its IMS multimedia telephony service.

Firstly, total conversation can be defined as a pragmatic selection of existing standards related to [[Session Initiation Protocol]] with the selection of audio, video and text codecs. It is a private initiative of services provider and technology vendors seeking interoperability in the broadtest sense.

Secondly, this can apply to existing and deployed SIP platform rather than future or next generation networks.

Thirdly, IMS is much more ambitious  and define a whole architecture, including all internal interfaces and billing and physical infrastructure. These standards are more suitable for large telecommunication operators and their equipment vendors. This complexity has consequences:

* Very little UMTS release 5 networks fully supporting IMS are in production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vision2mobile.com/articles/2007/01/ims-reality-check.aspx IMS Reality check]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multimedia call services defined by MMTEL are not translated&lt;ref&gt;[http://seekingalpha.com/article/64004-ims-mmtel-does-anyone-other-than-ericsson-care MMTel does anyone other than Ericsson care?]&lt;/ref&gt; in actual usable services on the market. An industry led initiative called Rich Communication Suite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/news/archive/2008/080207_richcomm.shtml RIch Communication Suite]&lt;/ref&gt; finally plans to do this .. when IMS will be rolled out in the networks.
* Rolling out a Native SIP Total Conversation services needs investments that are very reduced compared to the IMS equivalent. However, the implementations in both environments are close enough that interoperability between the two is an easy task.

The '''Uganda Dental Association''' (UDA) is a registered non-governmental organization that brings together all the qualified dental surgeons retired or practicing in Uganda.&lt;ref name= UDAGlobal &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.global-caries-initiative.org/dassociationsrch/search.html?dassociationsrchtext=&amp;typedassociationsrch=3 |title= Over 150 local National Dental Associations are supporting us |publisher= FDI Global Caries Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in Uganda's capital city [[Kampala]], the UDA serves its members and the public by managing key oral health issues on their behalf and by coordinating dental health awareness programs across the nation.&lt;ref name= UDAUG &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.suvison.com/net/sc_aww_fp.asp?id=8369 |title= ASSOCIATIONS WORLDWIDE |publisher= SUVISION}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= UDACW &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comdental.org/links.php |title= Useful Links |publisher= The Commonwealth Dental Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= UDAaware &gt;{{cite web|url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201404010294.html |title= Uganda: Insufficient Dentists As Dental Cases Escalate |publisher= allAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core objective of the UDA is to promote advancement of dentistry through the exchange of ideas amongst dental surgeons, in Uganda and the world. The association uses its leadership role to ensure that the rights and privileges of the members are enjoyed by all and acts as a watchdog to regulate the dental profession in Uganda. The association also ensures that the expectations of the public are met and is actively involved with lobbying and advocacy initiatives.&lt;ref name= UDA1 &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/459/702188 |title= Oral health should be given priority |publisher= New Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDA publishes an annual journal of dental related articles called ''UDA Journal''. Every November, the UDA fraternity marks ''Dental Health Week'' with media campaigns, screening and treatment for dental diseases and dental health education through outreach to the underserved communities.&lt;ref name= UDAJ &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ugadent.org/uda-journal/ |title= UDA Journal |publisher= UDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= UDA1 /&gt; On 20 March each year, the UDA joins the world in observing [[World Oral Health Day]] (WOHD) by organizing special awareness campaigns and clinics.&lt;ref name= WOHD &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.worldoralhealthday.com/uganda-celebrates-wohd-2014/ |title= Uganda celebrates WOHD 2014 |publisher= FDI: World Dental Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= WOHD2 &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ugadent.org/world-oral-health-day/ |title= Uganda celebrates healthy smiles on World Oral Health Day |publisher= The UDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The UDA was founded in the 1960s by five dentists, namely; Dr.Jack Barlow, Dr.Bisase Arnold, Dr.Aliker Okello, Dr. Amooti Twamirimo Nkurukenda and Dr. William B. Nganwa. In the 1970s during President [[Idi Amin]]'s regime, the association became inactive after the murder of Dr.Jack Barlow by president Amin. It was later revived in the 1980s by Dr. George W. Ssamula together with Dr. William B. Nganwa and Dr. J. F. Tiromwe. As of 2014, the UDA has more than 280 members. In 2010 the UDA published the first ''UDA Journal''. The first UDA office was at [[Mulago Hospital]]. The current UDA headquarters were opened at the Department of Dentistry [[Makerere University]], in 2013.

==Function==
The organisation provides continued dental education to its members through workshops, monthly UDA Meetings and UDA journals.&lt;ref name= UDAservices /&gt; The UDA provides a platform for dentists to network nationally and internationally. The organisation helps dentists to engage in outreach programmes and events which benefit both the community and the member. The UDA provides additional credibility to dental practitioners Uganda.

Also, the dental association provides group discounts on professional fees paid by its members; for example Group Professional Indemnity. Finally, the association lends books and DVDs to its members.&lt;ref name= UDAservices &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ugadent.org/services/ |title= Services |publisher= UDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of dentists===
The UDA acts as a watchdog to regulate the dental profession in Uganda in collaboration with the [[Uganda Medical &amp; Dental Practitioners Council]] (UMDPC) which is mandated by Uganda’s [[Ministry of Health]] to regulate professional Medical Officers and Dental Surgeons in the country.&lt;ref name= UDA1 /&gt; The UDA has a representative on the UMDPC Board as per the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act 1998.&lt;ref name= UMDPC &gt;{{cite web|url= http://umdpc.com/ |title= Welcome to Uganda Medical &amp; Dental Practitioners Council |publisher= UMDPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= MDPact &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/272 |title= Medical and Dental Practitioners Act 1998 |publisher= ULII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The association consists of Dental Surgeons, Honorary Members and Associate members qualified and/or with a professional connection with dentistry in Uganda. Qualified dentists must be registered with the Association, and thereafter with the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council upon payment of the levied charges and Professionals other than dentists whose work is related to dentistry may apply for membership of the association.&lt;ref name= UDAmembership &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ugadent.org/member-composition/ |title= Member Composition |publisher= UDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDA is a member of various international bodies like [[FDI World Dental Federation|FDI]] and the Commonwealth Dental Association (CDA).

The association has a unique and innovative partnership with [[Wrigleys]]. The UDA is promoting good oral hygiene and practice in communities around Uganda through [http://www.wrigleydentalcare.com/  The Wrigley Oral Healthcare Program]. [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) usually sponsor the UDA’s countrywide initiatives.&lt;ref name= UDAColg &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.co.ug/business/business-briefs/4695-colgate-launches-new-brand |title= Colgate launches new brand |publisher= UNICAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= WOHD2 /&gt;

==Publications==
It subscribes to over 100 dental journals and provides members with free [[MEDLINE]] searches.  The UDA produces regular dental publications, such as the ''UDA Journal'' (for clinical articles and jobs).&lt;ref name= UDAJ /&gt;

They are used when the vagina has become narrowed ([[vaginal stenosis]]), such as after [[brachytherapy]] for gynecologic cancers,&lt;ref name=Cochrane/&gt; and as therapy for [[vaginismus]] and other forms of [[dyspareunia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01443610050009683 |first1=T.

{{anchor|vaginal stent}}
Vaginal dilators, also called '''vaginal stents''', are used routinely in postoperative care for patients who have undergone [[sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)]].  The dilator is used immediately after surgery to keep the passage from healing, and regularly thereafter to maintain the viability of the [[neovagina]].
