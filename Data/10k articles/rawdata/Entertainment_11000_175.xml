'''''2by4''''' or '''''2 x 4''''' (Two by Four) is a 1998 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by and starring [[Jimmy Smallhorne]]. The screenplay by Smallhorne, Terry McGoff, and Fergus Tighe focuses on the bisexual foreman of a construction worker of a [[New York City]] construction crew.

At the January 1998 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and [[Declan Quinn]] won the Cinematography Award. It was released in New York City on November 26, 1999.

==Plot==
Johnnie Maher is under a lot of pressure.  Recently emigrated from Ireland to The Bronx, he sleepwalks and experiences nightmares.  Try as he might, he can not identify the cause of his torment or make sense of the fleeting remains of his dreams.  He shrugs them off, but things seem to be getting worse.  Johnnie works as foreman on his uncle Trump's construction crew.  Work tensions run high as the building owners complain about the cost and pace, while the workers constantly find their pay-packets shorted.  Sly as a fox, Uncle Trump always explains everything away.  Even when arrested for indecent exposure in a park frequented by gay men on the prowl for sex, he handily swears he only stopped there to relieve himself and was arrested by mistake.  Openly bisexual, Johnnie's pressures mount when his girlfriend, Maria, and a sex-partner, Christian, begin to pressure him for more commitment.  He fumbles his responses, and no one is satisfied.  Finally, Johnnie catches his Uncle Trump in an act that fractures the dam of memories, and in a short time, they come flooding back into Johnnie's consciousness.  Although shaken to his core, Johnnie finds the answers he needs.  Most importantly, he survives the flood and can finally move forward.

==Critical reception==
Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "an interesting and adeptly made drama" but thought "its message is unclear."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/112699four-film-review.html ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Glenn Lovell of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film a "bracing, beautifully shot upstart drama," he observed, "It's a safe bet ... [it] won't win over the ''[[Far and Away]]'' date crowd."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117467134.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Straps''', also known as '''aerial straps''', are a type of aerial apparatus on which various feats of strength and flexibility may be performed, often in the context of a [[circus]] performance. It is a cotton or nylon web apparatus that looks like two suspended ribbons. By wrapping the strap ends around hands and wrists, the performer performs holds, twists, rolls and manoeuvres, requiring extreme strength and precision similar men’s rings in gymnastics. Straps are available in various configurations, including those with various types of loops at the ends and those without loops. A straps act usually includes held poses and postures done on the straps, dance moves performed on the floor away from the straps, partner acrobatics done on and off the straps, as well as having the straps pulled up and let down during the act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.simplycircus.com/tutorials/aerial/aerial_arts_faq.htm Aerial Arts FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410060413/http://community.simplycircus.com/tutorials/aerial/aerial_arts_faq.htm |date=2016-04-10 }}. Community.simplycircus.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Panteleenko Brothers==
The discipline of aerial straps was originally a Chinese specialty where athletes would perform intensely muscular tricks up and down the straps. Many of the moves are similar to those of the Aerial Rings. 
The pioneers of contemporary aerial straps were identical twins Yuri and Valery Panteleenko, known as the Panteleenko Brothers. The brothers started their performance careers as part of a Russian illusionist’s magic show. During a show in Rostov-On-Don in 1969, Vladivien Levshin, the Rubanov Company’s acrobatic coach saw their athleticism and potential and began training them to perform what was to become a milestone act in the history of this apparatus.  Previously, a straps routine would be performed from a static position, only moving up and down the straps. Levshin introduced swinging, circular, and two-person moves. These new elements, not to mention the brothers’ elegance and resemblance added a new level of grace and beauty to the balletic nature of the apparatus.
In 1972 the brothers debuted the act; by 1973 they had already won the [[U.S.S.R.]]’s All-Union Circus Competition, at that time considered to be the world’s most difficult circus competition. They subsequently began touring with the [[Moscow State Circus]].

In 1983 the brothers performed at the [[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]] but were largely ignored by the judges, receiving only the City of Monaco prize. It wasn’t until the early 1990s that the Panteleenko brothers’ style of performance gained wider acceptance. Today nearly all straps routines bear the mark of their original routine.

In 1989 Yuri died of a heart attack after a show. Despite this, Valery decided to continue on the Panteleenko Brothers act, taking on Igor Gruzen as Yuri’s replacement. They performed until 1995 when Valery retired from performing at the age of 50 to become Head Rigger for ''[[Barnum's Kaleidoscape]]'', eventually retiring to Florida. Valery died of cancer in January 2006 but was succeeded by his son Maxime, who is still performing.

With the success of “[[Only Women Bleed]]” from his first solo effort, Alice continued with the rock ballads on this album. “[[I Never Cry]]” was written about his drinking problem, which would in one year send the performer into rehab and affect all his subsequent music up to and including 1983’s ''[[DaDa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-06-20/music/hangin-with-mr-cooper/2/ ‘Hanging with Mr. Cooper’]; ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', June 20, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper called the song “an alcoholic confession”.

The “Alice Cooper Goes To Hell” tour of 1976 was completely cancelled prior to commencement due to Cooper suffering from [[anemia]] at the time. However, “Go to Hell” proved the last song until his big hit “[[Poison (Alice Cooper song)|Poison]]” to become a consistent part of Cooper’s live setlists, being performed on most tours to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=Go+to+Hell&amp;artist=63d63aa3 ‘Go to Hell’ live performance data]&lt;/ref&gt; “I Never Cry” was also regularly performed in the late 1970s and during the 2000s, whilst “Guilty” was performed regularly on the ''Flush the Fashion'' and ''Special Forces'' tours and occasionally during the 2000s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=Guilty ‘Guilty’ liver performance data]&lt;/ref&gt; and “Wish You Were Here” frequently played on the tours for the following two albums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/alice-cooper-63d63aa3.html?song=Wish+You+Were+Here ‘Wish You Were Here’ live performance data]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the first track, “Go to Hell”, was featured as the theme song to the sixth episode of ''[[Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil]]'' titled "Human Sacrifice". The song was also featured in the 2009 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned]]'', the 1986 movie ''The American Way'', and the second season ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'' episode "Last Call".

==Plot==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT ADD TO this Plot summary. The word count must not exceed 700 words per Wikipedia guidelines. --&gt;
In 1939, Lady Sarah Ashley travels from England to northern Australia to force her philandering husband to sell his faltering cattle station, Faraway Downs. Her husband sends an independent cattle [[Drover (Australian)|drover]], called "Drover", to transport her to Faraway Downs.

Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] elder, "King George". Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton, who wants to buy the cattle.

The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah, who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land — in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song "[[Over the Rainbow]]" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Nullah tells her that "King George" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a "magic man".

Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aboriginals, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is unable to have children.

Drover leads a team of six other riders, including Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting in the death of Flynn when the group tries to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. The team drive the cattle through the dangerous [[Never Never (Australian outback)|Never Never]] desert. Then, when at last delivering the cattle in Darwin, the group has to race them onto the ship before Carney's cattle are loaded.

Afterwards, Lady Sarah, Nullah, and Drover live together happily at Faraway Downs for two years. Meanwhile, Fletcher kills Carney, marries his daughter Cath Carney, takes over Carney's cattle empire, and continues to menace Lady Sarah. It is established that Fletcher was the actual murderer of Lady Sarah's husband, and is also Nullah's father.

Nullah is drawn to go on a [[walkabout]] (a rite of passage) with his grandfather "King George", but is instead taken by the authorities and sent to live on Mission Island (a fictitious island, but inspired by [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]]) with the other half-Aboriginal children (dubbed the "[[Stolen Generations]]"). Lady Sarah, who has come to regard Nullah as her adopted son, vows to rescue him. Meanwhile, she works as a radio operator in Darwin during the escalation of World War II. When the Japanese [[Bombing of Darwin|attack the island and Darwin]] in 1942, Lady Sarah fears that Nullah has been killed.

Drover, who had quarrelled with Lady Sarah and left, returns to Darwin and hears (mistakenly) that she has been killed in the bombing. Drover learns of Nullah's abduction to Mission Island, and goes with Magarri and a young priest to rescue him and the other children. Magarri is killed by Japanese soldiers during the rescue. Meanwhile, Lady Sarah is about to be evacuated, but when Drover and the children sail back into port at Darwin, and Nullah plays "Over the Rainbow" on his harmonica, Lady Sarah hears the music and the three are reunited.

Fletcher, distraught at the ruination of his plans and at the death of his wife killed during a Japanese air strike, attempts to shoot Nullah, but is speared by King George and falls dead. Lady Sarah, Drover, and Nullah return to the safety of remote Faraway Downs. There, King George calls for Nullah, who returns to the Outback with his grandfather.

The director wanted to explore Australia's relationship with England and with its indigenous population.&lt;ref name="fox" /&gt; He decided to set the film between World Wars I and II in order to merge a historical romance with the [[Stolen Generations]], where thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families by the state and integrated into white society. Luhrmann has said that his film depicts "a mythologised Australia".&lt;ref name="fox" /&gt;

===Costumes===
Academy Award-winning costume designer [[Catherine Martin (designer)|Catherine Martin]] did extensive research for the film's outfits, studying archival images and newspapers from the 1930s and 1940s Australia. She also interviewed descendants of the original Darwin stockmen in order to find out if they "wore socks with his boots when he rode a horse, that's something you either get through a snapshot, or something you have to go talk to the people who lived there about".&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite news | author=Eric Wilson | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/movies/moviesspecial/02mart.html | title=Socks to Blouses, a Film Finds Its Look | work=The New York Times | date=31 October 2008 | accessdate=11 November 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130601231652/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/movies/moviesspecial/02mart.html| archivedate=1 June 2013| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asian-inspired costumes of the film were intended to evoke the romanticism of the era, and one of the centrepieces of the film's costuming is a red [[chrysanthemum]]-printed Chinese [[cheongsam]] or [[qipao]] that was made for Nicole Kidman's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/10/31/movies/20081102_MARTIN_SLIDESHOW_5.html|title=The Look of 'Australia'|work=The New York Times | date=31 October 2008 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received an [[81st Academy Awards nominees and winners|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Costume Design.

===Post-production===
Two weeks before the film's premiere, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' erroneously reported that Luhrmann gave in to studio pressure after "intense" talks with executives and re-wrote and then re-shot the ending of ''Australia'' for a happier conclusion after "disastrous reviews" from test screenings.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{cite news | author= Patrick Goldstein| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2008/11/fox-says-it-has.html | title=Fox says it hasn't tampered with ''Australia'' | work=Los Angeles Times | date=11 November 2008 | accessdate=13 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter these negative reports, the studio had Jackman and Kidman promoting ''Australia'' on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which dedicated an entire episode of the program to the film,&lt;ref name="Jinman"&gt;{{cite news | author= Richard Jinman| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/battling-baz-wobbles-into-home-stretch/2008/11/10/1226165477503.html | title=Battling Baz wobbles into home stretch | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=11 November 2008 | accessdate=11 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman spoke to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' where he described the ''Telegraph'' article as "patently nonsensical. It's all too typical of the way the world works today that everybody picked up an unsourced, anonymous quote-filled story in a tabloid from Sydney and nobody ever bothered to check to see if it was accurate".&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt; Rothman also said that Luhrmann had final cut on his film.

[[David Hirschfelder]] composed the score to ''Australia''. Interpolated musical numbers include the jazz standards "[[Begin the Beguine]]", "[[Tuxedo Junction]]", "[[Sing, Sing, Sing|Sing Sing Sing (With a Swing)]]", and "[[Aquarela do Brasil|Brazil]]".

[[Tourism Western Australia]] spent $1 million on a campaign linked with the release of ''Australia'' in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe and South Korea that ties in with an international Tourism Australia plan.&lt;ref name="Gosch"&gt;{{cite news | author= Elizabeth Gosch| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/see-the-film-then-come-visit/story-e6frgcs6-1111116642284 | title=See the film, then come visit | work=The Australian | date=16 June 2008 | accessdate=11 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the recession and fluctuating international fuel prices, the tourism industry hoped that Luhrmann's film would deliver visitors from all over the world in the same kind of numbers that came to the country following the 1986 release of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', and follow the significant increase in visitors to [[New Zealand]] since 2001 after the release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films. Federal Tourism Minister Martin Ferguson said, "This movie will potentially be seen by tens of millions of people, and it will bring life to little-known aspects of Australia's extraordinary natural environment, history and indigenous culture".&lt;ref name="Gosch" /&gt; Tourism Australia worked with Luhrmann and 20th Century Fox on a publicity campaign titled, "See the Movie, See the Country", based on [[Filming location|movie maps]] and location guides, to transform the film into "a real-life travel adventure".&lt;ref name="Gosch" /&gt; In addition, the director made a $50 million series of commercials promoting the country.&lt;ref name="dawson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite news | author= [[Kathy Marks]]| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/down-under--the-movie-but-can-baz-nicole-and-hugh-persuade-us-to-go-to-australia-935433.html | title=Down under - the movie | work=[[The Independent]] | date=18 September 2008 | accessdate=11 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. critics===
Megan Lehmann, writing in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', said that the film "defies all but the most cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to accompany the requisite Aussie clichés", and the bottom line is "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz".&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;{{cite news|author=Megan Lehmann |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=11975 |title=Film Review: ''Australia'' |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=18 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210195440/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?rid=11975 |archivedate=10 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism".&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081125/REVIEWS/811259991 |title=''Australia'' |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205013651/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20081125%2FREVIEWS%2F811259991 |archivedate=5 December 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ansen]], in his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', wrote, "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious.

==Box office and home media sales==
The film had better box office success in overseas markets and a disappointing gross in the United States — a pattern similar to Luhrmann's three previous films. {{as of|2009|November}}, the film has grossed $211,342,221 in its worldwide releases.&lt;ref name="BOMO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-4"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455824/releaseinfo ''Australia'' release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the film grossed [[Australian dollar|A$]]6.37 million in its opening weekend, setting the record for the highest grossing opening weekend for an Australian film and bumping the latest [[James Bond]] film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' to second place.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24732238-5003420,00.html |title=''Australia'' heads Aussie box office, dies in US |work=Courier Mail |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209054755/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C23739%2C24732238-5003420%2C00.html |archivedate=9 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australia'' performed less well in the U.S., where it surprised box office analysts by opening only at #5, behind ''Quantum of Solace'', ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', and ''[[Four Christmases]]'', and grossed $20 million opening weekend.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; However, Fox officials were reportedly happy with the numbers, as they said they were expecting only an $18 million opening gross for the film.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSTRE4AM1T520081125 "Hollywood Studios Turn Hopeful Eye Toward Holiday."] ''Reuters'', 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-2"&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996415.html?categoryId=13&amp;cs=1 "Hollywood Stuffs Thanksgiving Slate."] ''Variety'', 24 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They further pointed out that Baz Luhrmann's other films, like ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'', and ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', started slowly and then built momentum.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ronald D.

'''Contemporary dance in Australia''' is diverse with [[dance company|dance companies]] performing a broad range of what elsewhere may be termed [[contemporary dance|contemporary]] and [[modern dance|modern]] [[20th century concert dance|dance styles]].

Reduced funding (from the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] level down) has led to a reduction in the ability to sustain full-time employment to dancers, with only 5 companies in Australia that ''may'' offer a full year contract.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} All other companies work on a project basis with artists contracted for a set period of time, ranging from days to months, with no guarantee of further employment. Other funding sources include project specific funding for a dance work by example by a festival or performance venue to raise the expenses required to bring it to fruition.

==Dance film==
{{main|Dance film}}
Dance film provides one mode of contemporary dance in Australia with the [[ReelDance Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reeldance.org.au/ ReelDance Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; being the main avenue, with other opportunities being through installations at venues such as night clubs, back alley's to art galleries, shown as part of a live performance, or sometimes purchased for home viewing.

==On television==
[[So You Think You Can Dance Australia]] has drawn criticism for poorly representing dance as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/opinion/australia-you-cant-dance-like-that/2008/03/02/1204402265772.html Valerie Lawson, (3 March 2008), "Australia, you can't dance like that", ''Brisbane Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ABC1]] broadcasts contemporary dance as part of its [[Sunday Arts]] programming.

==Companies==
Australian contemporary dance companies include:
*[[Australian Dance Theatre]]
*[[Bangarra Dance Theatre]]
*[[Chunky Move]]
*[[Dancenorth]]
*[[Force Majeure (dance company)|Force Majeure]]
*[[Expressions Dance Company]]

'''BBC Arabic Television''' ([[Arabic]]: بي بي سي عربي)is a [[television news channel]] broadcast to the [[Arab world|Arab World]] by the [[BBC]].  It was launched on 11 March 2008.  It is run by the BBC World Service and funded from the British television licence fee.

==History==
In 1994, BBC Arabic Television was launched by Rome-based [[Orbit Communications Company]] (owned by [[King Fahd]]'s cousin, Prince [[Khalid ibn Abdullah]]) and a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabian [[Mawarid Holding]]. On 21 April 1996, it was "pulled off the air"&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cochrane|first1=Paul|title=Saudi Arabia's Media Influence|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/index.php?article=421&amp;printarticle|website=Arab Media and Society|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following an episode of ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' that was critical of the [[Saudi Arabia]]n government.   Ian Richardson, who set up the news department during that time blamed the short life of the channel on a clash with the owners over content.
&lt;blockquote&gt;During the short life of BBC Arabic Television, there were several angry ‘liaison meetings’ with Orbit and the guarantees of editorial independence proved to be a sour joke, only barely obscured by a thin smokescreen about the BBC's alleged failure to observe "cultural sensitivities" – Saudi code for anything not to the [[House of Saud|Royal Family]]'s liking. When it became clear to Orbit and Mawarid that it had, in their terms, created a monster not prepared to toe the Saudi line, it was only a matter of time before there would be a final parting of the ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Richardson, [http://www.preddonlee.com/arabic.html The Arabic TV "Monster"], first published in ''The Independent'' and ''Al-Quds Al-Arabi'', April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the staff who worked for the original BBC Arabic Television service went on to work for [[Al Jazeera]] television,&lt;ref name=preddonlee&gt;[http://www.preddonlee.com/al_jazeera_origins.html The Failed Dream That Lead To Al Jazeera]&lt;/ref&gt; now one of BBC Arabic Television's main competitors.

Plans to relaunch the channel were announced in October 2005 and broadcasting was to start in Autumn 2007, but was delayed until 0956 [[GMT]] on 11 March 2008.

==Presenters==
Tony Khouri, Malak Jaafar

==Funding==
BBC Arabic Television is run by the [[BBC World Service]]. Initially it was funded from a [[grant-in-aid]] from the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] but in 2014 funding was switched to come from the [[television licence]] that is mainly used to fund the BBC's domestic broadcasting.  The service is based in the Peel Wing of [[Broadcasting House]] in London. 24-hour programming began 19 January 2009.

In 2011, as the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] cut funding to the BBC, forcing the [[BBC World Service]] to close down its services in five languages, the government simultaneously increased funding to the BBC Arabic service, in the words of [[Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]], to "assist the BBC Arabic Service to continue their valuable work in [[Arab world|the region]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13873853 "BBC World Service receives government funding boost"], BBC, June 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
BBC Arabic can also be seen via [http://www.bbc.co.uk/arabic/ bbc.co.uk/Arabic/]. The website includes a 16:9 live stream of the channel.

''Newshour'', an hour-long news bulletin is broadcast twice a day. In this programme, the top stories of the day are analysed and covered by BBC correspondents around the world. Other bulletins are half-an-hour long. The top stories are broadcast on the channel every fifteen minutes.

The '''Bald Archy''' is an [[Australia]]n art prize, a parody of the [[Archibald Prize]], an important portraiture award. It usually includes cartoons or humorous works making fun of Australian celebrities. It is judged by Maude, a [[cockatoo]].&lt;ref name="official_site"&gt;[http://www.baldarchy.com.au/about.html http://www.BaldArchie.com.au], Official Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; It began in 1994 at the Coolac Festival of Fun, in the tiny town of [[Coolac, New South Wales|Coolac]] near [[Gundagai, New South Wales|Gundagai]], [[New South Wales]] but is now a popular event presented in Sydney, Melbourne and other locations.

Since 2005 the home of this art competition and its accompanying exhibition is the [[Museum of the Riverina]], [[Wagga Wagga]]. However, in 2008, the prize was announced during the [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]] portion of the national tour.

The game was initially set-up by a [[Wizard (MUD)|wizard]] who named himself Jaf, followed by many volunteer coders, all becoming [[Wizard (MUD)|wizards]] in the process.
The MUD's name comes from the name of the server the game was first hosted on, '''batman.cs.hut.fi'''.  Since then, BatMUD has relocated several times, at one point residing in Oulu, Finland.
As of November 2007, the main ''BatMUD'' servers are co-located in the two data centers of Nebula in Helsinki, Finland.

Despite its phenomenal age as an Internet community, the MUD is constantly evolving which makes it both challenging and entertaining to new and old players alike.
Due to the rich set of features, ''BatMUD'' may be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer.&lt;ref name="netgames"&gt;{{cite book

 | quote = '''BatMUD''' With dozens of races to choose from (each with different skills) [...] ''BatMUD'' is for hard-core MUDders, featuring hundreds of skills and spells!  Player killing is common, and the only time a wizard would intervene, explains one player, is "if there's a random mass murdering (i.e., summoning 30 random players into a room without exits and killing them all&amp;mdash;for no reason)."
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable (external) events, timeline===
In September 1994, the organization Balanced Alternative Techniques ry was officially registered in the "Joint corporate information system of the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration"&lt;ref&gt;The Joint corporate information system of the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration, Finland [http://www.ytj.fi/english/]&lt;/ref&gt; of Finland.
The game was also previewed in [[Pelit]]-magazine and was highly praised from its rich set of features while scoring over 90/100 points.&lt;ref&gt;Kaizu, "BatMUD", ''Pelit'', 1994/6&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years, ''BatMUD'' has also been voted "Game of the month" by several Internet gaming-sites, such as MPOGD.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpogd.com/gotm/?Date=4/1/2003 BatMUD, MPOGD.com Game of the Month, April 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105200635/http://www.mpogd.com/gotm/?Date=4%2F1%2F2003 |date=2016-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in April, 2003.

In 2004, B.A.T. ry applied for the ''BatMUD'' [[trademark]] and "BatMUD" was registered as a trademark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/ United States Patent and Trademark Office]&lt;/ref&gt; on April 5, 2005.

''BatMUD'' has a wide variety of [[race (fantasy)|race]]s.&lt;ref name="netgames" /&gt; [[Player killing]] is lightly moderated.&lt;ref name="netgames" /&gt;

==Virtual community and Playerbase==
It is arguable that ''BatMUD'' formed one of the earliest virtual communities of gamers on the Internet.
What marks the community significant, is the active operation and participation of the individuals within the [[virtual community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massively.com/2007/11/25/batmud-back-online-and-still-in-business/ BatMUD: back online and still in business by Jonathan Northwood]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several conventions and events are being held across the world, with one of the most notable probably being the Indiana, U.S. based Campcon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.campcon.org/ |title=Campcon 11 website, Clay City, Indiana, USA |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517171612/http://www.campcon.org/ |archive-date=2008-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; being held for the 11th consecutive year in June, 2009 &amp;mdash; a [[real life]] gathering of active participants of the ''BatMUD'' community.  Similar events are held in Europe and [[Scandinavia]] every year.

''BatMUD'' provides a range of interplayer communication methods, allowing the players to talk and chat.  Though the majority (about 2/3) of the players reside in Finland, the game itself is wholly in English, enabling it to host a large player base from several countries, including many European countries, the United States, Canada and Australia.  Together with [[Role-playing game|roleplay]] not being strictly enforced, the common language of English allows debates to flourish.

With about one hundred players simultaneously online,&lt;ref&gt;'Average online players' user graph on the official web site of BatMUD, checked on 2014-12-27 [http://www.bat.org/help/who]&lt;/ref&gt; it is also one of the largest traditional MUDs.  However, with the rise of [[massively multiplayer online game]]s its popularity has fallen off in recent years with fewer new players joining.  Aggressive efforts have been made to make the MUD more newbie friendly&lt;ref name="carton"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most players continue to be well established players who have invested months or years into the game.  As with many other popular online games, [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] is not unknown.

''BatMUD'' employs a [[virtual economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Masters Thesis about "Virtual gift - Trading gifts in BatMUD virtual community" [http://thesis.jyu.fi/07/URN_NBN_fi_jyu-2007234.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; with players selling rare items and favours to each other in the game's internal currency.  Sale of characters or equipment for real life money is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bat.org/help/help?htype=extra&amp;str=trading Official BatMUD help file on 'trading']&lt;/ref&gt;  If it has occurred, it has not been a major problem.

''BatMUD'' was the first MUD played by [[Matt Mihaly|Matt "Sarapis" Mihaly]], founder of [[Iron Realms Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="neely"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''BattleForge''''' is a discontinued [[video game]] that was developed by [[EA Phenomic]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2009. ''BattleForge'' is an online card-based [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) game. The [[End-of-life (product)|game's servers were shut down]] on October 31, 2013.

== History ==
Battleforge was developed by [[EA Phenomic]] and published [[Electronic Arts]]. It was released on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] in March 2009 along with a [[game demo|demo]].
On May 26, 2009, ''BattleForge'' became a [[Play 4 Free]] game.

On September 4, 2013, EA announced the [[End-of-life (product)|closing of the game]] in an email to registered players, effective October 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.battleforge.com/forum/showthread.php?t=80261 |title=BattleForge News: Important: BattleForge is being retired |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910060412/http://forums.battleforge.com/forum/showthread.php?t=80261 |archivedate=2013-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
In June 2015, a group started work on [[reverse engineering]] the [[Source code|game code]] to create a server for the game ([[Server emulator]]), called ''Skylords Reborn''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skylords.eu/ skylords.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; The final game is planned to be free-to-play, like the original, but without micro-transactions. The server maintenance is planned to be funded by donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/battleforge/news/battleforge_reborn,44416,3233541.html |title=BattleForge Reborn - Community will das Spiel wiederbeleben|language=de|publisher=[[GameStar]] |accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the beginning of 2017 the development is in [[closed beta]] testing, and open stress tests began in September 2018.

==Features==
On its initial release, the game revolved around trading, buying and winning through means of [[micro-transaction]]s, though micro-transactions were not required for playing the game, only for buying new cards. When ''BattleForge'' became a [[Play 4 Free]] branded game with fewer cards initially available (32 cards and no points). The retail version came with all of the [[starter pack|starter decks]] (One for each element, 64 cards) and 3,000 ''BattleForge'' points. The game's [[virtual currency]] was distributed to each player on a 2-point per day basis. Requirement was that the player has played at least 15 minutes that day. Through this, all micro-transactions were available to all players, but doing them without purchasing the retail version of the game or any virtual currency was possible, only slow.

There were a total of 383 cards available, almost equally divided between the powers of fire, frost, nature, and shadow. After an update, combinations of shadow/fire, frost/nature, frost/shadow and fire/nature were introduced, as well as legendary cards. Players could buy and sell cards at an in-game auction house, using BattleForge Points (BF Points), an in-game currency. Players could also invite each other to conduct a direct trade.

There was a [[Player versus environment|PvE mode]] (player versus environment) and a [[Player versus player|PvP mode]] (player versus player). In the PvE mode, players could complete missions. Some of these missions could only be played by 1 player, while others could be played with 2, 4 or 12 players. There were three modes available in missions: standard, advanced and expert. In order to unlock advanced and expert modes, players would have to complete the series of missions on standard mode first. The rewards for the missions were gold, card upgrades and PvE [[experience point]]s. These experience points would increase a player's PvE level.

For PvP, players could choose between ranked and unranked PvP. Unranked PvP would not give any rewards, but could be useful for testing cards and strategies or for a simple, friendly match. Ranked pvp would give players gold, [[Elo rating system|Elo]] points and tokens as reward. Gold and tokens could be traded for card upgrades, while ELO points would increase a player's PvP level.

BattleForge supported [[Direct3D#Direct3D 11|DirectX 11]]'s hardware [[tessellation]] feature on PC systems with DirectX 11 installed, which was subject to operating system and [[graphics card]] compatibility.

==Card editions==
The '''Twilight edition''' was the first edition of ''BattleForge'' cards. Twilight edition of cards contained a total of two-hundred (200) unique cards, including fifty cards for each elemental faction: Fire, Frost, Nature, and Shadow. Each of these powers had its own special abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Each power was represented by an orb color in the game. The Twilight Edition consisted of 200 cards in total, i.e. 50 units, buildings and spells for each of these powers.

The '''Renegade Edition''' was the second edition of ''BattleForge'' cards. It expanded the ''BattleForge'' card set with legendary units and monumental buildings from the Southern Wastes region of Nyn. 60 new units and buildings were added to the ''BattleForge'' card pool.

The '''Lost Souls Edition''' was released on February 9, 2010 with a total of 60 brand new and unique units.

The '''Amii Edition''' was released in small proportions in each patch. About 4 cards got released in almost each patch. When the Amii Edition was fully released on April 26, 2012 the last 2 cards where added, bringing a total of 32 new cards to the game. The Amii Edition was the smallest edition but took the longest time to be released, using Sneak Preview Decks for 2 years prior to the actual release.

The '''Bowery Poetry Club''' is a [[New York City]] poetry performance space founded by [[Bob Holman]] in 2002. &lt;ref name="wiyf1"&gt;Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008). ''Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam.'' Chapter 26: What the Heck is Going on Here; The Bowery Poetry Club Opens (Kinda) for Business. Soft Skull Press, 288. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Located at 308 Bowery, between Bleecker and Houston Streets in [[Manhattan]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], the BPC is a popular meeting place for poets and aspiring artists.

==Building history==
The building was built in the 1850s as a lumber yard. Its last incarnation before becoming the BPC was as a [[Formica (plastic)|formica]] tabletop manufacturer that ran on [[DC current]]. [[Plywood]] scraps were used to heat the building in a [[pot-belly stove]]. 

In a 2002 ''[[New York Times]]'' article about the club, Holman talked about the then-risky choice to open the club on Bowery, which at the time was a "skid row": 

{{quote|text=The Bowery is a vein of change. Being blind is not the way to retain the aspects of the past that need to be honored. In order to change the world, you have to be in the world. As you get older, the risk of selling out and becoming part of that system stays real but it's mitigated by wanting to get in there and dig...

'''Bud Boogie Beach''' was a small [[water park]] located on [[Mud Island]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It opened in 1987 and closed in 1997.  

Bud Boogie Beach included a beach, concession stands, a [[New Orleans]]-style restaurant and several games including [[Water basketball]] and water volleyball.  The park featured live music concerts, which included many local musicians.

It was open from [[Memorial Day]] weekend through [[Labor Day]] weekend each year.

Other attractions included two-person [[peddle boat]]s and a kiddie area.

==History==
The [[Mud Island]] Park was constructed with a scaled model of the entire [[Mississippi River]] that runs the length of the park.  At the end of the scaled version is replica of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  Originally designed as an area in which patrons could ride manual paddle boats, the success of the [[Adventure River]] waterpark led Mud Island officials to convert the Gulf area into a small waterpark.

==Corporate sponsor==
[[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] was the primary sponsor of the park and purchased the right to name the park '''Bud''' Boogie Beach.

==Closing==
Bud Boogie Beach was closed due to a variety of reasons.  The swimming area was far from the parking area, making the carrying of beach bags and floats difficult; the area was not built as a swimming pool, so the mixing of chlorine was done manually and was uneven. 

The Mud Island River Park and museum are still open.  Bud Boogie Beach is the only closed attraction at the park.

'''Burlamacco''' is the [[clown]]-like figure which presides over the [[carnival]] in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] town of [[Viareggio]], and is the town's mascot.  Burlamacco was first depicted in 1931 by Uberto Bonetti; A competition had been held for the design of the mascot and his was the winning entry. He had chosen the [[red]] and [[white]] of the outfit from the traditional colours of the [[umbrella]]s on the [[beach]] at Viareggio and the name came 8 years later; it is derived from the Burlamacca river. 
To this day Burlamacco remains a feature of the carnival and there is a statue of him all the year round on the Lungomare in [[Viareggio]].

'''''Club Penguin''''' was a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO), involving a [[virtual world]] that contained a range of online games and activities. It was created by New Horizon Interactive (now known as Disney Canada Inc.). Players used cartoon penguin-[[avatar (virtual reality)|avatars]] and played in a winter-set virtual world. After [[beta-testing]], ''Club Penguin'' was made available to the general public on October 24, 2005,&lt;ref name="BillyBob2005a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.clubpenguin.com/blog/2005/10/Its-Launched.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429202042/http://community.clubpenguin.com/blog/2005/10/Its-Launched.php |archivedate=April 29, 2008 |title=Club Penguin&amp;nbsp;— It's Launched! |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |author=Billybob |date=October 24, 2005 |work=Club Penguin Developer Blog |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded into a large [[online community]], such that by late 2007, it was claimed ''Club Penguin'' had over 30 million user accounts.&lt;ref name="Walmsley"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kids' virtual worlds are maturing nicely|last=Walmsley|first=Andrew|date=October 24, 2007|work=Marketing}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2013, ''Club Penguin'' had over 200 million registered user accounts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |title='Star Wars' Takes Over Disney's Club Penguin |author=

While free memberships were available, revenue was predominantly raised through paid memberships, which allowed players to access a range of additional features, such as the ability to purchase virtual clothing, furniture, and in-game pets called "puffles" for their penguins through the usage of in-game [[currency]]. The success of ''Club Penguin'' led to New Horizon being purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in August 2007 for the sum of 350 million dollars, with an additional 350 million dollars in bonuses should specific targets be met by 2009.&lt;ref name= WSJAcquire&gt;{{cite news | title = Disney Buys Kids' Social-Network Site – WSJ.com | work = Wall Street Journal | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118599768804085026?mod=hpp_us_whats_news|accessdate = December 26, 2010 | first1=Merissa | last1=Marr | first2=Peter | last2=Sanders | date=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was specifically designed for children aged 6 to 14 (however, users of any age were allowed to play ''Club Penguin'').&lt;ref name="kudos"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 11, 2006 |title=Kudos continue as Club Penguin marks one-year anniversary (Media Release) |work=Club Penguin |url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/company/news/061211-one-year-anniversary.htm |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420210109/http://www.clubpenguin.com/company/news/061211-one-year-anniversary.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a major focus of the developers was on child safety,&lt;ref name="Kiely" /&gt; with a number of features having been introduced to the game to facilitate this. These features included offering an "Ultimate Safe Chat" mode, whereby users selected their comments from a menu; [[Wordfilter|filtering]] that prevented swearing and the revelation of personal information;&lt;ref name="Kiely" /&gt; and [[Forum moderator|moderators]] who patrolled the game.&lt;ref name="Flanagan" /&gt;

On January 30, 2017, it was announced that the game would be discontinued on March 29, 2017. ''Club Penguin'' later shut down its servers on March 30, 2017 at 12:01 AM. The game was replaced by a successor, titled ''[[Club Penguin Island]]''.&lt;ref name="CPBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/whats-new/important-announcement-regarding-club-penguin-desktop-and-mobile-devices|title=Important Announcement Regarding Club Penguin on Desktop and Mobile Devices|first=|date=January 30, 2017|website=|publisher=Club Penguin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328202618/http://www.clubpenguin.com/whats-new/important-announcement-regarding-club-penguin-desktop-and-mobile-devices|archive-date=March 28, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=January 31, 2017|author=Megg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original game has since been recreated on a number of private servers using [[SWF]] files from Club Penguin. The two most popular ones, CPPS.me and Club Penguin Rewritten, have reached over two million players.

== History ==

=== Predecessors (2000–2004) ===
The first seeds of what would become ''Club Penguin'' began as a [[Adobe Flash|Flash 4]] [[web-based]] game called ''Snow Blasters'' that developer Lance Priebe had been developing in his spare time in July 2000.&lt;ref name="BDODunwoody"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizactions.com/index.cfm/ba/e105/fa/68240602G627J357168P0P10056056T0/|title=BDO Dunwoody Announcement|work=BDO Dunwoody|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016214213/http://bizactions.com/index.cfm/ba/e105/fa/68240602G627J357168P0P10056056T0/|archivedate=October 16, 2007|accessdate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/rocketsnail/status/289216023683547138|title=RocketSnail on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/rocketsnail/status/350638923585843200|title=RocketSnail on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priebe's attention was brought to penguins after he "happened to glance at a ''[[The Far Side|Far Side]]'' cartoon featuring penguins that was sitting on his desk".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/business/media/10adco.html|title=A Procession of Penguins Arrives on Madison Ave.|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=January 10, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was never finished, and instead morphed into ''Experimental Penguins. Experimental Penguins'' was released through Priebe's company of employment, the [[Kelowna]], British Columbia, Canada-based online game and comic developer Rocketsnail Games, in July 2000, though it ultimately went offline the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rocketsnail.com/experimental-penguins|title=Experimental Penguins|website=RocketSnail|language=en-US|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as the inspiration for ''Penguin Chat'' (also known as ''Penguin Chat 1''), a similar game which was released shortly after ''Experimental Penguins''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; removal. Released January 2003, ''Penguin Football Chat'' (also known as ''Penguin Chat 2)'' was the second attempt at a penguin-themed MMORPG, and was created on FLASH 5 and used the same interface as ''Experimental Penguins.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rocketsnail.com/penguin-chat/|title=Penguin Chat|website=RocketSnail|language=en-US|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game contained various minigames; the premiere title of RocketSnail Games was ''Ballistic Biscuit'', a game that would be placed into ''Experimental Penguins'' and eventually be adapted into ''Club Penguin''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s ''Hydro Hopper''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rocketsnail.com/games/|title=Games|website=RocketSnail|language=en-US|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; RocketSnails Games' ''Mancala Classic'' would also be placed into the game as ''Mancala''.

Lance Priebe, as well as co-workers Lane Merrifield and Dave Krysko, started to formulate the ''Club Penguin'' concept when the trio were unsuccessful in finding "something that had some social components but was safe, and not just marketed as safe" for their own children.&lt;ref name="Mlynek"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/managing/ceo_interviews/article.jsp?content=20080428_198723_198723 |title=Q&amp;A: Club Penguin's Lane Merrifield |last=Mlynek |first=Alex |date=April 28, 2008 |work=[[Canadian Business]] |accessdate=May 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219060236/http://www.canadianbusiness.com/managing/ceo_interviews/article.jsp?content=20080428_198723_198723 |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Krysko in particular wanted to build a safe social-networking site their kids could enjoy free of advertising.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/company/about|title=About Club Penguin|newspaper=Club Penguin|language=en|access-date=January 19, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131182951/http://www.clubpenguin.com/company/about|archivedate=January 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Merrifield and Priebe approached their boss, with the idea of creating a spinoff company to develop the new product.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/children-and-penguins-turn-trio-into-kingpins/article18176636/|title=Children and penguins turn trio into kingpins|last=McKenna|first=Barrie|date=November 13, 2006|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto|accessdate=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spin-off company would be known as New Horizon Interactive.

=== Early history (2004–2007) ===
Work commenced on the project in 2004, and the team settled on a name in the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The developers used the previous project ''Penguin Chat 2''&amp;nbsp;– which was still online&amp;nbsp;– as a jumping-off point in the design process, while incorporating concepts and ideas from Experimental Penguins. Penguin Chat's third version was released in April 2005, and was used to test the client and servers of ''Penguin Chat 4'' (renamed ''Club Penguin'').&lt;ref name="Priebe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rocketsnail.com/blog/2011/02/21/experimenting-with-penguins/|title=Experimenting with Penguins|last=Priebe|first=Lance|work=Rocketsnail Games|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variants of ''Penguin Chat 3'' included ''Crab Chat, Chibi Friends Chat, Goat Chat, Ultra-Chat, and TV Chat.'' Users from Penguin Chat were invited to beta test ''Club Penguin''. The original plan was to release ''Club Penguin'' in 2010, but since the team had decided to fast-track the project, the first version of ''Club Penguin'' went live on October 24, 2005,&lt;ref name="Priebe" /&gt; just after Penguin Chat servers were shut down in August 2005. While Penguin Chat used ElectroServer, ''Club Penguin'' would use SmartFoxServer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/rocketsnail/status/223980934335180800|title=RocketSnail on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers financed their start-up entirely with their own credit cards and personal lines of credit, and maintained 100 percent ownership.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bcbusiness.ca/people/lane-merrifield-club-penguin|title=Lane Merrifield: Club Penguin|last=Jordan|first=David|date=April 1, 2008|work=[[BCBusiness Online]]|location=Toronto|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Club Penguin'' started with 15,000 users, and by March that number had reached 1.4 million—a figure which almost doubled by September, when it hit 2.6 million.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; By the time ''Club Penguin'' was two years old, it had reached 3.9 million users, despite lacking a marketing budget.&lt;ref name="Shields"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shields|first=Mike|year=2007|title=Avatar Nation|journal=MediaWeek|volume=17|issue=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of the game in The New York Times was in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/27/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/29Rparenting.html|title=Halloween, Unmasked|last=Winerip|first=Michael|date=October 27, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, ''Club Penguin'' spokesperson Karen Mason explained: "We offer children the training wheels for the kinds of activities they might pursue as they get older."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/fashion/03Online.html|title=Online sites-online sites for children|last=Slatalla|first=Michelle|date=May 3, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisition by Disney (2007) ===
Although the three ''Club Penguin'' co-creators had turned down lucrative advertising offers and venture capital investments in the past,&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; in August 2007, they agreed to sell both ''Club Penguin'' and its parent company to [[Disney]] for the sum of $350.93 million.&lt;ref name="Walmsley" /&gt; In addition, the owners were promised bonuses of up to $350 million if they were able to meet growth targets by 2009.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite news | last = Brooks | first = Barnes | date = August 2, 2007 | title = Wary of Losing Out Online, Disney Buys Site for Children up to ages from 6 to 16 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney ultimately didn't pay the extra $350 million, as ''Club Penguin'' missed both profit goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/119491/Disney_Skips_350M_Payment_As_Club_Penguin_Misses_Profit_Targets.php|title=Disney Skips $350M Payment As  Club Penguin  Misses Profit Targets|last=Caoili|first=Eric|language=en|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/media/13penguin.html|title=Disney Gets a Half-Price Deal for Club Penguin|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=May 12, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the point when it was purchased by Disney, ''Club Penguin'' had 11–12 million accounts, of which 700,000 were paid subscribers, and was generating $40 million in annual revenue.&lt;ref name="Walmsley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan" /&gt; In making the sale, Merrifield has stated that their main focus during negotiations was philosophical,&lt;ref name="Mlynek" /&gt; and that the intent was to provide themselves with the needed infrastructure in order to continue to grow.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} By late 2007, it was claimed that ''Club Penguin'' had over 30 million user accounts.&lt;ref name="Walmsley" /&gt; In December of that year, The New York Times asserted that the game "attracts seven times more traffic than [[Second Life]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/business/31virtual.html|title=Web Playgrounds of the Very Young|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=December 31, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Club Penguin'' was the 8th top social networking site in April 2008, according to Nielsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nielsen-myspace-club-penguin-growth-static-linkedin-soaring/|title=Nielsen: MySpace, Club Penguin growth static, LinkedIn soaring|newspaper=CNET|language=en|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Disney's acquisition, Disney Interactive had four MMOs to simultaneously juggle: ''[[Toontown Online|ToonTown]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]]'', ''[[Pixie Hollow (video game)|Pixie Hollow]]'', and ''Club Penguin'', with ''[[The World of Cars Online|World of Cars]]'' set to follow soon. Lane Merrifield assured GlobalToyNews at the time that "it's a lot of worlds to manage, but we have really strong teams." Merrifield's role changed from taking a backseat in daily game design to focusing on overall branding and quality control of the virtual gaming properties. One of his roles was to merge the ''Club Penguin'' studio New Horizon Interactive in Kelowna (renamed to Disneyland Studios Canada) with Disneyland Studios LA). Disneyland Studios Canada focused its efforts on one product (with such features as multilingual versions), while Disneyland Studios LA focused on customer products and franchises of a wide selection of games. Merrifield was responsible for cross-pollinating both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltoynews.com/2010/08/an-interview-with-lane-merrifield-creator-of-club-penguin-.html|title=An Interview with Lane Merrifield; creator of Club Penguin – Global Toy News|website=www.globaltoynews.com|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Franchising and growth (2007–2015) ===
Since the Disney purchase, ''Club Penguin'' continued to grow, becoming part of a larger franchise including video games, books, a television special, an anniversary song, and an app MMO. Disney has often used the game as a cross-promotion opportunity when releasing new films such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]],'' ''[[Zootopia]],'' and ''[[Star Wars]],'' having special themed events and parties to celebrate their releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/19/club-penguin-gets-frozen/|title=Club Penguin gets Frozen|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/whats-new/zootopia-party-announcement|title=Zootopia Party Announcement|date=April 28, 2016|newspaper=Club Penguin|language=en|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/star-wars-takes-over-disneys-club-penguin-1200561084/|title='Star Wars' Takes Over Disney's Club Penguin|last=Graser|first=Marc|date=July 11, 2013|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game forged an ever-growing mythology of characters and plot elements, including: a pirate, a journalist, and a secret agent.

In 2008, the first international office opened in Brighton, England, to personalise the level of moderation and player support. Later international office locations included São Paulo and Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On March 11, 2008, ''Club Penguin'' released the ''Club Penguin'' Improvement Project.&lt;ref name="BillyBob2008a"&gt;{{cite web | last = BillyBob | date = March 10, 2008 | title = Welcome!! | work = Club Penguin Improvement Project: Blog | url = http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/03/welcome-to-the-club-penguin-im.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080421205905/http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/03/welcome-to-the-club-penguin-im.html | archivedate = April 21, 2008 | accessdate = May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project allowed players to be part of the testing of new servers, which were put into use in ''Club Penguin'' on April 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="BillyBob2008d"&gt;{{cite web | last = BillyBob | date = April 14, 2008 | title = New website and new servers | work = Club Penguin Improvement Project: Blog | url = http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/04/new-website-and-new-servers.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420170611/http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/04/new-website-and-new-servers.html | archivedate = April 20, 2008 | accessdate = May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players had a "clone" of their penguin made, to test these new servers for bugs and glitches.&lt;ref name="BillyBob2008b"&gt;{{cite web | last = BillyBob | date = March 10, 2008 | title = Account Questions | work = Club Penguin Improvement Project: Blog | url = http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/03/account-questions.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080421205844/http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/03/account-questions.html | archivedate = April 21, 2008 | accessdate = May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The testing was ended on April 4, 2008.&lt;ref name="BillyBob2008c"&gt;{{cite web | last = BillyBob | date = April 4, 2008 | title = Server Test Success!! | work = Club Penguin Improvement Project: Blog | url = http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/04/server-test-success.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080421041844/http://community.clubpenguin.com/cpip/2008/04/server-test-success.html | archivedate = April 21, 2008 | accessdate = May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2011, the game's website temporarily crashed after the company let the ''Club Penguin'' domain name expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/club-penguin-downtime-is-only-disneys-latest-internet-misstep/240752/|title=Club Penguin Downtime Is Only Disney's Latest Internet Misstep|last=Jackson|first=Nicholas|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, one of Club Penguin's minigames, Puffle Launch, was released on iOS as an app. Merrifield commented: "Kids are going mobile and have been asking for Club Penguin to go there with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/disneys-club-penguin-celebrates-150-186884|title=Disney's Club Penguin Celebrates 150 million users by launching new app|last=Mirror.co.uk|date=September 15, 2011|newspaper=mirror|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, Merrifield left Disney Interactive to focus on his family and a new educational product, Freshgrade. Chris Heatherly took Merrifield's former position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/17/entertainment/la-et-ct-disney-interactive-club-penguin-20121017| title=Disney Interactive loses Club Penguin founder Lane Merrifield | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first1=Dawn C. | last1=Chmielewski | first2=Ben | last2=Fritz | date=October 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company dropped the words "Online Studios" from its name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Club Penguin Trademark Details |url=http://trademarks.justia.com/850/69/club-penguin-85069142.html |date=November 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013 |publisher=Justia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/privacy-policy/en |title=Privacy Policy |publisher=Club Penguin |accessdate=December 27, 2013 |date=November 1, 2013 |quote=Disney Club Penguin ("Club Penguin") is operated and presented to users in all locations by Disney Canada Inc.

In April 2015, it was revealed that Disney Interactive had [[Layoff|laid off]] 28 members of ''Club Penguin''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Kelowna headquarters due to the game's declining popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techvibes.com/2016/03/05/layoffs-club-penguin-2016-03-05|title=Disney Canada Hit by Layoffs – More to Come?|date=March 5, 2016|website=Techvibes|access-date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's UK office in Brighton was shut down around April 17, 2015. Some employees in the [[Los Angeles]] office were also let go. Disney Interactive replied to Castanet on the layoffs: "Disney Interactive continually looks to find ways to create efficiencies and streamline our operations. As part of this ongoing process, we are consolidating a small number of teams and are undergoing a targeted reduction in workforce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/137843/Club-Penguin-cuts-jobs|title=Club Penguin cuts jobs – Kelowna News|website=www.castanet.net|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2015, ''Club Penguin'' closed down the [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] versions of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/blog/2015/06/important-news-about-club-penguin-russian-and-german-languages|title=Important News About Club Penguin in the Russian and German Languages|website=Club Penguin|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spin-off mobile app, Puffle Wild, was removed from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]] the same day in order to allow Disney Interactive to focus on Club Penguin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.disney.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/About-Puffle-Wild?section=clubpenguin|title=Disney Interactive Support – Puffle Wild Closure|date=September 5, 2015|access-date=April 9, 2016|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905223247/https://help.disney.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/About-Puffle-Wild?section=clubpenguin|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 2016, the Sled Racer and SoundStudio apps (the former being an original game and the latter being a [[Porting|port]] of a game on the website) followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/whats-new/important-information-regarding-sled-racer-soundstudio-apps|title=Important Information Regarding Sled Racer &amp; SoundStudio Apps|website=Club Penguin|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the closure of Disney Interactive in 2015, ''Club Penguin'' side-projects wound down to allow a streamlined effort to focus on the core ''Club Penguin'' experience; this involved the layoffs of 30 Disney Studios Canada staff.&lt;ref name="Wawro"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/241587/Report_Layoffs_strike_Disneys_Club_Penguin.php|title=Report: Layoffs strike Disney's  Club Penguin|last=Wawro|first=Alex|language=en|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2017, ''Club Penguin'' announced that the current game would be discontinued on March 29, 2017, to make way for its successor, ''[[Club Penguin Island]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/club-penguin-is-shutting-down/|title=Club Penguin is shutting down|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=January 31, 2017|website=TechCrunch|access-date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/31/14458168/club-penguin-closing|title=Club Penguin set to close, breaking millennial hearts worldwide|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=January 31, 2017|website=Polygon|access-date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/01/31/club-penguin-shutting-down-and-everyone-sad/97277620/|title=Club Penguin is shutting down and everyone is sad|last=Molina|first=Brett|date=January 31, 2017|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=February 5, 2017|work=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership payments for the original game were no longer accepted as of January 31, 2017, with paid members slated to receive emails about membership and refunds.&lt;ref name="CPBlog" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/club-penguin-shutting-down-mobile-only-club-penguin-island-take-its-place-582155|title='Club Penguin' Shutting Down; Mobile-Only 'Club Penguin Island' To Take Its Place|last=Medina|first=Nathalie|date=February 2, 2017|newspaper=iDigitalTimes.com|access-date=February 5, 2017|work=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became popular in the final weeks of Club Penguin to attempt speedruns to see how fast users could get banned from the site; the fastest records were [[tool-assisted speedrun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/22/14698354/club-penguin-ban-speedruns|title=Getting banned from Club Penguin is now a competitive sport|date=February 22, 2017|website=Polygon|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

=== Business model ===
Prior to being purchased by Disney, ''Club Penguin'' was almost entirely dependent on membership fees to produce a revenue stream.&lt;ref name="Kiely"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kiely | first = Lynsey | date = January 14, 2007 | title = C-c-c-click on clubpenguin | work = [[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]] | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cccclick-on-clubpenguin-120865.html | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of users (90% according to [[The Washington Post]]) chose not to pay, instead taking advantage of the free play on offer.&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite news | last = Reid | first = Alice | date = October 18, 2007 | title = Breaking the Ice&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;— Club Penguin Allows Kids to Safely Explore the World of Online Gaming and Chatting | work = [[The Washington Post]] | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/17/AR2007101702198.html | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who chose to pay did so because full (paid) membership was required to access all of the services, such as the ability to purchase virtual clothes for the penguins and buy decorations for igloos,&lt;ref name="Navarro"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28virtual.html | last = Navarro | first = Mireya | date = October 28, 2007 | title = Pay Up, Kid, or Your Igloo Melts | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because peer pressure created a "[[caste system]]," separating paid from unpaid members.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Robertson | first = Heather-Jane | year = 2007 | title = Postman Does Penguins | journal = [[Phi Delta Kappan]] | volume = 88 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising, both [[In-game advertising|in-game]] and on-site, was not incorporated into the system, although some competitors chose to employ it, including: [[Whyville]], which used corporate sponsorship,&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;{{cite news | last = Diaz | first = Sam |author2=Yang, Xiyun | date = August 3, 2007 | title = Playground Networking, Now Online&amp;nbsp;— Social Sites Aim at Users Too Young for MySpace | work = [[The Washington Post]] | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/02/AR2007080202351.html | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neopets]], which incorporated product placements.&lt;ref name="Rushe"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rushe | first = Dominic | date = November 18, 2007 | title = Hooking the kids with the internet | work = [[The Sunday Times]] | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article2889446.ece | accessdate = May 25, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative revenue stream came through the development of an online merchandise shop, which opened on the ''Club Penguin'' website in August 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://community.clubpenguin.com/blog/2006/08/NOW-OPEN.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080429194151/http://community.clubpenguin.com/blog/2006/08/NOW-OPEN.php | archivedate = April 29, 2008 | title = NOW OPEN!!! | accessdate = June 17, 2008 |author=Billybob | date= August 31, 2006 | work = Club Penguin Developer Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; selling stuffed [[#Puffles|Puffles]] and T-shirts.

As with one of its major rivals, ''[[Webkinz]]'', ''Club Penguin'' traditionally relied almost entirely on [[word-of-mouth]] advertising to increase its membership base.&lt;ref name="Garofoli"&gt;{{cite news | last = Garofoli | first = Joe | date = May 27, 2007 | title = I'm 8, I'm late for an online date with a cuddly penguin | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child safety ===
''Club Penguin'' was designed for the ages of 6–14.&lt;ref name="kudos" /&gt; Thus, one of the major concerns when designing ''Club Penguin'' was how to improve both the safety of participants and the suitability of the game to children. As Lane Merrifield stated, "the decision to build Club Penguin grew out of a desire to create a fun, virtual world that I and the site's other two founders would feel safe letting our own children visit."&lt;ref name="Merrifield"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merrifield|first=Lane|year=2007|title=Safety First?|journal=[[The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=300|issue=3|page=17|author2=Males, Mike|author3=Flanagan, Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ''Club Penguin'' maintained a strong focus on child safety,&lt;ref name="Jesdanun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Safety questioned as younger kids flock to Internet&amp;nbsp;— Parents need to set guidelines, limits|last=Jesdanun|first=Anick|date=July 23, 2007|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where the security features were described as almost "fastidious" and "reminiscent of an [[Orwellian]] [[dystopia]]",&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Many Children Are Now Picking a Penguin as Their Favourite Online Friend|last=Williamson|first=David|date=January 5, 2008|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was also argued that this focus might "reassure more parents than it alienate[d]."&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt;

The system employed a number of different approaches in an attempt to improve child safety. The key approaches included preventing the use of inappropriate [[usernames]];&lt;ref name="Reidb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Safe surfing: Club Penguin is a G-rated MySpace-type site that gives kids a safer way to mingle online|last=Reid|first=Alice|date=October 18, 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing an "Ultimate Safe Chat" mode, which limited players to selecting phrases from a list;&lt;ref name="Jesdanun" /&gt; using an automatic [[Wordfilter|filter]] during "Standard Safe Chat" (which allowed users to generate their own messages)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/parents/club_penguin_guide.htm#safe|title=Is It Safe?|accessdate=June 17, 2008|work=Club Penguin Q&amp;A for Parents}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blocked [[profanity]] even when users employed "creative" methods to insert it into sentences;&lt;ref name="Reidb" /&gt; filtering seemingly innocuous terms, such as "mom"; and blocking both telephone numbers and email addresses.&lt;ref name="Jesdanun" /&gt; It also included employing paid [[Forum moderator|moderators]]; out of 100 staff employed in the company in May 2007, Merrifield estimated that approximately 70 staff were dedicated to policing the game.&lt;ref name="Garofoli" /&gt; It also included promoting users to "EPF (Elite Penguin Force) Agent" status, and encouraging them to report inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref name="Jesdanun" /&gt;

Each game server offered a particular type of chat—the majority allowing either chat mode, but some servers allowed only the "Ultimate Safe Chat" mode. When using "Standard Safe Chat", all comments made by users were filtered. When a comment was blocked, the user who made the comment saw it, but other users were unaware that it was made—suggesting to the "speaker" that they were being ignored, rather than encouraging them to try to find a way around the restriction.&lt;ref name="Jesdanun" /&gt;

Beyond these primary measures, systems were in place to limit the amount of time spent online, and the site did not feature any advertisements, because, as described by Merrifield, "within two or three clicks, a kid could be on a gambling site or an adult dating site."&lt;ref name="Garofoli" /&gt; Nevertheless, after ''Club Penguin'' was purchased by Disney, concerns were raised that this state of affairs might change, especially in regard to potential spin-off products&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Virtual kids|last=Dwyer|first=Michael|date=November 29, 2007|work=[[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although Disney continued to insist that it believed advertising to be "inappropriate" for a young audience.&lt;ref name="Rushe" /&gt;

Players who used profanity were often punished by an automatic 24-hour ban, although not all vulgar language resulted in an immediate ban. Players found by moderators to have broken ''Club Penguin'' rules were punished by a ban lasting "from 24 hours to forever depending on the offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.clubpenguin.com/help/help/safety.htm|title="Breaking the Rules" and "How a Penguin is Banned"|quote=|accessdate=June 17, 2008|work=Club Penguin Communicating|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723123728/http://support.clubpenguin.com/help/help/safety.htm|archivedate=July 23, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and charity ===
Coins for Change was an in-game charity fund-raising event which first appeared in 2007. The fund-raising lasted for approximately two weeks each December during the game's annual "Holiday Party". Players could "donate" their virtual coins to vote for three charitable issues: Kids who were sick, the environment, and kids in developing countries.&lt;ref name="coins for change 2007 whattheyplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whattheyplay.com/blog/2008/12/10/coins-for-change-kicks-off-this-friday/|title=What They Play – Coins for Change kicks off this Friday|work=What They Play|accessdate=February 15, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231212056/http://www.whattheyplay.com/blog/2008/12/10/coins-for-change-kicks-off-this-friday/|archivedate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players were able to donate in increments of 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 5,000, or 10,000 virtual coins. At the end of the campaign, a set amount of real-world money was divided among each of the causes based on the amount of in-game currency each cause received. At the end of the first campaign, the New Horizon Foundation donated a total of $1 million to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation]], and [[Free The Children]].&lt;ref name="coins for change 2007 whattheyplay" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/29/AR2007122901848_pf.html|title=For Modern Kids, 'Philanthropy' Is No Grown-Up Word|last=Rucker|first=Philip|date=December 30, 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the 2007 and 2008 campaigns, two-and-a-half million players participated.&lt;ref name="coins for change 2007 whattheyplay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coins for change 2008 whattheyplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whattheyplay.com/blog/2008/12/25/club-penguin-kids-donate-3-billion-in-game-coins-t/|title=What They Play – Club Penguin kids donate 3 billion in-game coins to charity|work=What They Play|accessdate=February 15, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231212005/http://www.whattheyplay.com/blog/2008/12/25/club-penguin-kids-donate-3-billion-in-game-coins-t/|archivedate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''Club Penguin'' donated $1,000,000 Canadian dollars to charitable projects around the world. In 2010, ''Club Penguin'' donated $300,000 towards building safe places, $360,000 towards protecting the Earth, and $340,000 towards providing medical help. Lane Merrifield said: "Our players are always looking for ways to make a difference and help others, and over the past five years they've embraced the opportunity to give through Coins For Change, it was exciting to see kids from 191 countries participate together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/company/news/01-01-12-coins-for-change.htm|title=Virtual world celebrates fifth year of Coins For Change|work=celebrates fifth year|accessdate=February 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125092513/http://www.clubpenguin.com//company/news/01-01-12-coins-for-change.htm|archivedate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the amount of money donated was doubled to $2 million, ostensibly in response to an unexpected increase in participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubpenguin.com/global-citizenship/coins-for-change-2011|title=Coins For Change 2011|last=|first=|authorlink=|year=2011|publisher=Club Penguin|format=|doi=|work=|access-date=September 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920025046/http://www.clubpenguin.com/global-citizenship/coins-for-change-2011|archive-date=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot and gameplay ==
''Club Penguin'' was divided into various rooms and distinct areas. Illustrator Chris Hendricks designed many of the first environments. Each player was provided with an igloo for a home. Members had the option of opening their igloo so other penguins could access it via the map, under "Member Igloos."{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Members could also purchase larger igloos and decorate their igloos with items bought with virtual coins earned by playing mini-games.&lt;ref name="Reid" /&gt; At least one party per month was held on Club Penguin. In most cases, a free clothing item was available, both for paid members and free users. Some parties also provided member-only rooms which only paid members could access. Some major ''Club Penguin'' parties were its annual [[Halloween]] and Holiday parties. Other large parties included the Music Jam, the Adventure Party, the Puffle Party, and the Medieval Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Franchise ==
{{Main|Club Penguin (franchise)}}
Disney's franchising of the brand began with its acquisition of ''Club Penguin'' in 2007. In addition to the ''Club Penguin Island'' web-based video game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/club-penguin-island-to-shut-down-marking-final-end-of-1829370171 |title=Club Penguin Island To Shut Down, Marking Final End Of The Beloved Children's MMO |date=September 27, 2018 |last=D'Anastasio |first=Cecilia |website=Kotaku |access-date=November 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the franchise has also included console video games for [[Nintendo]] and [[Wii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/jinnygudmundsen/2008-12-11-club-penguin_N.htm|title=Join 'Elite Penguin Force' on Nintendo DS|first=Jinny |last=Gudmundsen |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |newspaper=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2010/6/10/news/74812/ |title='Club Penguin Game Day!'

== Critical reception ==
''Club Penguin'' received mixed reviews throughout its journey. The site was awarded a "kids' privacy seal of approval" from the [[Better Business Bureau]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Green | first = Elizabeth Weiss | date = March 19, 2007 | title = Clique on to Penguin | journal = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | volume = 142 | issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Brian Ward, a [[Detective Inspector]] at the Child Abuse Investigation Command in the United Kingdom, stated that it was good for children to experience a restricted system such as ''Club Penguin'' before moving into [[social networking]] sites, which provide less protection.&lt;ref name="TheAustralian"&gt;{{cite news | date = October 9, 2007 | title = Kids' online community growing fast | work = [[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of simple popularity, the rapid growth of ''Club Penguin'' suggested considerable success, although there were signs that this was leveling out. [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]] figures released in April 2008 indicated that in the previous 12 months, ''Club Penguin'' traffic had shrunk by 7%.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite web | last = McCarthy | first = Caroline | date = May 20, 2008 | title = Nielsen: MySpace, Club Penguin growth static, LinkedIn soaring | work = CNet | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-9948219-36.html | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism expressed by commentators was that the game encouraged [[consumerism]]&lt;ref name="Navarro" /&gt; and allowed players to [[cheating in online games|cheat]].&lt;ref name="Benderoff" /&gt; While ''Club Penguin'' did not require members to purchase in-game products with real money (instead relying on a set monthly fee), players were encouraged to earn coins within the game with which to buy virtual products. In addition, the "competitive culture" that this could create led to concerns about [[cheating in online games|cheating]], as children looked for "shortcuts" to improve their standing. It was suggested that this might influence their real-world behavior.&lt;ref name="Benderoff"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703080167mar08,0,7203137.story | last = Benderoff | first = Eric | date = March 7, 2007 | title = Young gamers may be learning the art of cheating | work = [[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, ''Club Penguin'' added guidelines to prevent cheating, and banned players who were caught cheating or who encouraged cheating.&lt;ref name="Benderoff" /&gt; The use of in-game money was commented on as possibly helping teach children how to save money, select what to spend it on, improve their abilities at math,&lt;ref name="Navarro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid" /&gt; and encourage them to "practice safe money-management skills".&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bishop | first = Tricia | date = April 8, 2007 | title = Sites aimed at preteens gaining in popularity&amp;nbsp;— Marketers courting children ages 6–12 as their spending soars | work = [[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the attempts to create a safe space for children in ''Club Penguin'', concerns about safety and behavior still arose within the media. While the language in-game was filtered, discussions outside of ''Club Penguin'' were beyond the owner's control, and thus it was stated that third-party ''Club Penguin'' [[Internet forum|forums]] could become "as bawdy as any other chat".&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt; Even within the game, some people noted that [[cyberbullying]] could still occur,&lt;ref name="Charkes"&gt;{{cite news | last = Charkes | first = Juli S. | date = March 30, 2008 | title = Cracking Down on the Cyberbully | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[flame war]]s potentially occurring within the game.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"&gt;{{cite news | last = Flanagan | first = Caitlin | date = July–August 2007 | title = Babes in the Woods | work = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/07/babes-in-the-woods/5974/ | accessdate = May 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the "Caste system" between those who had membership and exclusive items and those who lacked full membership (and therefore were unable to own the "coolest" items) could lead to players having a difficult time attracting friends.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

One criticism came from Caitlin Flanagan in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'': in relation to the safety procedures, she noted that ''Club Penguin'' was "certainly the safest way for unsupervised children to talk to potentially malevolent strangers—but why would you want them to do that in the first place?"&lt;ref name="Flanagan" /&gt; While views of the strength of this criticism might vary, the concern was mirrored by Lynsey Kiely in the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', who quoted Karen Mason, Communications Director for ''Club Penguin'', as saying "we cannot guarantee that every person who visits the site is a child."&lt;ref name="Kiely" /&gt;

On August 20, 2013, Disney announced that ''[[Toontown Online]]'', ''[[Pixie Hollow (video game)|Pixie Hollow]]'', and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]]'' were closing directly because of ''Club Penguin'' and Disney's mobile games. This caused major controversy between ''Club Penguin'' and fans of the three games, especially ''Toontown'', where some users had played for more than 12 years (''Toontown''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Alpha-test|alpha test]] started in August 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/23/tech/gaming-gadgets/closing-toontown/ | work=CNN | title=Coping with the loss of an online world – CNN.com | date=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private servers ==
A Club Penguin Private Server (commonly abbreviated and known as a CPPS) is an online multiplayer game that is not part of Club Penguin, but uses [[SWF]] files from Club Penguin, a database, and a server emulator in order to create a similar environment for the game. Many now use these environments in order to play the original game after its discontinuation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

CPPSs often contain features that did not exist in the original game such as custom items and rooms, free membership, etc.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Throughout its existence, various players created private servers of Club Penguin. The most popular among these is CPPS.me, a private server launched in 2011 that has since reached over two million players and is available in five languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cpps.me/ |title=CPPS.me |publisher=CPPS.me |access-date=January 13, 2018 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220192259/https://www.cpps.me/ |archive-date=December 20, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the closure of the game, more private servers were created; one of them&amp;nbsp;– Club Penguin Rewritten, launched February 12, 2017&amp;nbsp;– had reached a million players as of October 12, 2017,&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://culture.affinitymagazine.us/save-club-penguin-the-game-we-know-and-love/ |magazine=Affinity |title=Save Club Penguin: The Game We Know and Love |first=Marcus |last=Cooley |access-date=November 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though discontinued "permanently" on March 4, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://community.cprewritten.net/announcement.php |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226202443/https://community.cprewritten.net/announcement.php |archive-date=February 26, 2018 |date=February 26, 2018 |title=Announcement Regarding the future of Club Penguin Rewritten |publisher=Club Penguin Rewritten }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing community support and funding, it returned in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://community.cprewritten.net/2018/04/27/the-island-has-returned/ |title=The Island Has Returned! |author=Stu |website=Club Penguin Rewritten |date=April 27, 2018 |access-date=April 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal status ===
Since private servers essentially copy materials copyrighted by Disney, there has been much controversy as to whether or not creating and hosting them is legal. Disney and Club Penguin often pursue CPPSs and attempt to have them taken down with [[DMCA]] notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice by Club Penguin Rewritten that they are switching domains due to Disney's legal action|url=https://clubpenguinrewritten.pw/|accessdate=22 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022113002/https://clubpenguinrewritten.pw/|archivedate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vulnerabilities ===
Many private servers have become vulnerable to DDOS attacks and database leaks due to insufficient security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPPS.me Database Breach|url=http://www.speedycppshq.com/breaking-news-cpps-me-breach/|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SuperCPPS Database Breach|url=http://www.speedycppshq.com/breaking-news-supercpps-database-breach-10000-accounts/|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative consultant''' is a credit that has - particularly in the past - been given to [[screenwriters]] who have [[script doctor|consulted]] on a movie [[screenplay]]. Those given this credit in the television field work closely with an [[executive producer]] and [[head writer]]/[[showrunner]]. They are involved in the writing process (proposing and editing story outlines/scripts). Sometimes they are given the credit of ''executive consultant'', ''story consultant'' or ''script consultant''.

"Creative consultant" is not listed by the [[Writers Guild of America]] as one of its [[WGA screenwriting credit system|standard credits]] to be given to writers in television and film. The WGA discourages the use of credits not included on their list and requires that a waiver be obtained in order to credit someone as a creative consultant in television or film.&lt;ref name='tcpg'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/writers_resources/credits/tcpg10.pdf | title = Television Credits and Procedures Guide | accessdate = 19 June 2013 | author = Writers Guild of America, West | authorlink = Writers Guild of America, West | date = 2010 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Mankiewicz]]'s credit as Creative Consultant for the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' appeared after the writers' credits, leading to a dispute which Mankiewicz ultimately won. In 1993, the [[Film producer|producers]] of ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' were fined by the WGA for giving writer [[Steve Oedekerk]] a creative consultant credit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Critical Commons''' is an online repository of user-generated media. The archive is a project of the [[Media Arts and Practice]] division of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. The project supports the [[fair use]] of copyrighted media by educators.

== History ==
Critical Commons was established in 2008 by [[Steve F. Anderson]] and is an ongoing project of the [[Media Arts and Practice]] division of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. Critical Commons was designed by [[Erik Loyer]] and developed using the free software video sharing system [[Plumi]] by the Asia-Pacific based [[EngageMedia]] and the Greece based design collective Unweb.me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalcommons.org/about-us |title=About — Critical Commons |publisher=Criticalcommons.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was launched with funding from the [[Macarthur Foundation]]'s Digital Media and Learning Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cory Doctorow at 2:18 am Fri, Jan 22, 2010 |url=http://boingboing.net/2010/01/22/critical-commons-vs.html |title=Critical Commons vs. Hitler: resource for free/open media and fair use |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastac.org/projects/critical-commons |title=Critical Commons |publisher=HASTAC |date=2009-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of an ongoing debate within higher education about the need for [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;Guest, Charles; Guest, Joyce M.; Surry; Daniel W. ed.; and Robert M. Gray, ed. (2010). "Legal Issues in the Use of Technology in Higher Education: Copyright and Privacy in the Academy", ''Technology Integration in Higher Education: Social and Organizational Aspects'', IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bollier.org/new-frontiers-commons-based-innovation |title=New Frontiers of Commons-based Innovation &amp;#124; David Bollier |publisher=Bollier.org |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project background ==
Critical Commons makes use of the exemptions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/2012-dmca-rulemaking |title=2012 DMCA Rulemaking &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) that allow educators to circumvent the [[digital rights management]] of encrypted DVDs and downloads from online sources. Critical Commons utilizes the "safe harbor" provision of the DMCA granted to [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs) who have limited liability for potential copyright infringement by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Copyright:_Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act |title=Copyright: Digital Millennium Copyright Act; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media in Critical Commons is contributed by users who must add [[transformative]] commentaries to their uploads in order for them to be viewable. Once a piece of media is publicly available, registered users can post additional commentaries or create lecture-style playlists of media that are placed within a critical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mlajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1632/prof.2011.2011.1.136 |title=Engaging Digital Scholarship: Thoughts on Evaluating Multimedia Scholarship |publisher=Mlajournals.org |date=2011 |accessdate=2013-10-17 |doi=10.1632/prof.2011.2011.1.136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive contains over 7500 media clips, still images and audio files accompanied by text commentaries. Media content posted on Critical Commons is widely embedded in electronic journals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalstudies.org/ojs/index.php/digital_studies/article/view/234/301 |title=After the Document Model for Scholarly Communication: Some Considerations for Authoring with Rich Media &amp;#124; Sayers &amp;#124; Digital Studies / Le champ numérique |publisher=Digitalstudies.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and media supplements for scholarly publication and classroom use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enculturation.gmu.edu/the-youtube-gaze |title=The YouTube Gaze: Permission to Create? &amp;#124; Enculturation |publisher=Enculturation.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131015164954/http://enculturation.gmu.edu/the-youtube-gaze |archivedate=2013-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God of War: Ascension''''' is a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[SCE Santa Monica Studio|Santa Monica Studio]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] (SCE). The game was first released on March 12, 2013, for the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) console. It is the seventh installment in the [[God of War (franchise)|''God of War'' series]] and [[prequel]] to the entire series. Loosely based on [[Greek mythology]], the game is set in [[ancient Greece]] with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], the former servant of the God of War [[Ares]], who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. In response to this tragedy, Kratos renounced Ares, breaking his blood oath to the god. Kratos was therefore imprisoned and tortured by the three [[Erinyes|Furies]], guardians of honor and enforcers of punishment. Helped by the oath keeper [[Horkos|Orkos]], Kratos escapes his imprisonment and confronts the Furies to be completely free of his bond to Ares.

The gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on [[Combo (video gaming)|combo-based]] combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and other weapons acquired by the new World Weapons [[Game mechanics|mechanic]]. It continues the use of [[quick time event]]s and adds a new, promptless, free-form system. Four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options, and the game features [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements. ''Ascension'' is the only installment in the series to include [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], which is [[Online game|online-only]] and features modes for both [[Player versus player|competitive]] and [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] play. It also features a redesigned combat system, new gameplay mechanics, and [[downloadable content]]. From October 2012 to March 2013, a [[Social network game|social experience]] was available online in the form of a [[graphic novel]] titled ''[[#Rise of the Warrior|Rise of the Warrior]]'', a prequel story that tied into the game's single-player and multiplayer modes.

''God of War: Ascension'' received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its fundamental gameplay and spectacle as true to the series, although the story was generally deemed to be less compelling than previous installments. The game's multiplayer element received mixed responses: although reviewers found that the gameplay translated well into the multiplayer element, they criticized the balance and depth of combat. ''Ascension'' did not perform as well as its predecessors in terms of sales and awards, but it did receive several nominations, including the [[Writers Guild of America]] Videogame Awards's "Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing" and the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] award for "Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design".

==Gameplay==
{{further|Common gameplay elements in the God of War series}}
In both of ''God of War: Ascension''{{'}}s [[single-player video game|single-player]] and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] elements, it is primarily a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] video game viewed from a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed camera]] perspective. Some scenes in the single-player campaign feature a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] camera view. In single-player mode, the player controls the character [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] in [[Combo (video gaming)|combo-based combat]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle games]]. The enemies are an assortment of creatures, most of whom are drawn from [[Greek mythology]], including [[cyclops|cyclopes]], [[cerberus]]es, [[empusa]]s, [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, [[Gorgons]], [[satyr]]s, [[harpies]], and [[centaurs]]. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, such as the juggernauts, wraiths, and [[manticore]]s. Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer mode. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and slide down walls to proceed through sections of the game. The game features a variety of puzzles, ranging from simple to complex.&lt;ref name="multicon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-30-god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-confirmed |title=God of War: Ascension multiplayer confirmed |date=April 30, 2012 |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |publisher=Eurogamer Network |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch5gtwbL?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-30-god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-confirmed |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=5|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos, a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons [[Game mechanics|mechanic]] called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pg14"&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=14|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes as part of the new combat system.&lt;ref name="Hands on"/&gt; Another new mechanic is that Kratos can [[tether]] enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.&lt;ref name="pg14"/&gt;

Four [[Magic (gaming)|magical]] disciplines are acquired, including the Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, depending on the magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there.&lt;ref name="Hands on"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/02/07/hands-on-with-god-of-war-ascension/ |title=Hands-On with God of War: Ascension |date=February 7, 2013 |last=Shuman |first=Sid |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |accessdate=February 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EGpYdUoZ?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/02/07/hands-on-with-god-of-war-ascension/ |archivedate=February 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=15|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rage [[Superpower (ability)|ability]] called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking for an extended period of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=6|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three relics, the Amulet of Uroborus (Life Cycle mechanic), the Oath Stone of Orkos, and the Eyes of Truth, are acquired and needed for game progression. The Amulet of Uroborus allows Kratos to manipulate time by decaying or healing an object; examples include reconstructing broken pathways and using it during puzzle-solving. Construction can be paused or reversed if needed. The amulet can also be used against enemies to briefly slow their movements. The Oath Stone of Orkos gives Kratos the ability to create a "shadow" duplicate of himself that can depress plates, hold levers, or attack enemies. The Eyes of Truth remove illusions created by the Furies and cast a blinding light on enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|pp=16–17|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the [[quick time event]] (QTE) mechanic featured in the previous games, a new, promptless, free-form system allows players to choose when to attack or dodge based on the enemy's actions. When certain foes, such as a cyclops or a juggernaut, have been sufficiently weakened, the player may jump on their back and briefly force them to attack other foes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|pp=17–18|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other extra features include ten artifacts hidden in the game world that provide more abilities during [[New Game Plus]], such as unlimited magic. This mode also allows players to change Kratos' costume, but [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|trophies]] are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/03/06/future-god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-map-packs-will-be-free-single-player-includes-a-new-game-plus-mode/ |title=Future God of War: Ascension Multiplayer Map Packs Will be Free, Single Player Includes a "New Game Plus Mode" |date=March 6, 2013 |last=Dunning |first=Jason |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |work=[[PlayStation LifeStyle]] |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X6BRfk8W?url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/03/06/future-god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-map-packs-will-be-free-single-player-includes-a-new-game-plus-mode/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new feature absent from previous installments is "Chapter Select", which allows players to select and replay previously completed levels. Unlike previous installments, in which behind-the-scenes videos are unlocked after completing the game, these videos are already available from the main menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=''God of War: Ascension''|developer=[[SCE Santa Monica Studio]]|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|year=2013|platform=[[PlayStation 3]]|scene=Main Menu Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''God of War: Ascension'' is the only installment in the series to offer a multiplayer feature, which is [[Online game|online-only]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/122/1223989p1.html |title=The Multiplayer Madness of God of War: Ascension |date=April 30, 2012 |last=Moriarty |first=Colin |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch5fl19s?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/30/the-multiplayer-madness-of-god-of-war-ascension |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to eight players can take part. The main objective for players is to take control of a map to earn rewards from the gods. Before entering multiplayer battles, each player is introduced to a warrior, who, like Kratos, is an oath-breaker and is imprisoned in the Prison of the Damned—the warrior's backstory is explored in ''[[#Rise of the Warrior|Rise of the Warrior]]''. The player takes control of the warrior and aligns with one of the four deities: Ares,&lt;ref name="Ares"/&gt; Hades,&lt;ref name="Hades"/&gt; Zeus,&lt;ref name="Rise"/&gt; or Poseidon.&lt;ref name="Poseidon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=19|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each god offers a unique combat play-style and in-battle abilities. The attack style of the god with whom the player aligns is critical to their warrior's path.&lt;ref name="beta"/&gt; Players who ally with Ares are brute force experts with an up-close focus, although they are weak defensively, specifically to long range magical attacks. Players who ally with Zeus are magical experts with a focus on space control, although they are balanced by their lack of melee strength. Players who ally with Poseidon are supports with a focus on team synergy and self-sustenance; his synergistic powers can be replaced by more self-defense abilities if desired, although never as much as the other 3 gods. Players who ally with Hades are versatile, unlike the other 3, featuring other unique mechanics such as lifesteal, stealth and curses, making them excellent at controlling the flow of combat, although they can also choose to specialize in certain roles with certain armors or weaponry. Players can create up to three more warriors and have a champion representing each god.&lt;ref name="mpw"/&gt;

Players can unlock special magic abilities, new and upgraded armors, weapons, relics, and other treasures as they earn experience points (XP) to level-up their warrior.&lt;ref name="mpw"&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|pp=20–22|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may also complete "Labors", which are challenges from the gods that rewards armor and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=9|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout multiplayer matches, players receive [[Status effect#Buffs and debuffs|buffs and debuffs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=7|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a color-coding system, called flashes, where a player's character will flash a certain color indicating a special property, such as vulnerability or invulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2013)|p=25|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prestige feature called "Ascension", added in the June 10, 2013 [[Patch (computing)#Video games|update]], allows players to reset their allegiance progression when they reach Level 40, and receive in-game currency for "Godly" armors and weapons—the "most valuable and powerful items in the game".&lt;ref name="prestige"/&gt; They are classified as a Hero the first time they ascend and then a Demigod the second time and keep that title from then on.&lt;ref name="prestige"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/06/10/god-of-war-ascension-patch-1-08-now-live-brings-along-the-ascension-feature/ |title=God of War: Ascension Patch 1.08 Now Live, Brings Along the Ascension Feature |date=June 10, 2013 |last=Dunning |first=Jason |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |work=[[PlayStation LifeStyle]] |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fAl3hlHX?url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/06/10/god-of-war-ascension-patch-1-08-now-live-brings-along-the-ascension-feature/ |archivedate=February 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, [[Capture the Flag]], and Bout of Honor. Team matches randomly assign players to compete on either the [[Sparta]]n or [[Troy|Trojan]] team. The "signature" multiplayer mode is Team Favor of the Gods, in which two teams of two-to-four players try to win by accumulating a target quantity of points. Points, known as Favor, are earned by killing and other methods. When players are not on the offensive, they may help their team earn points by capturing altars, collecting red orbs from chests, and setting traps for opposing players. The non-team version, Match of Champions, is a four-to-eight-player [[deathmatch]] with a similar goal to Team Favor of the Gods.&lt;ref name="Jan8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/12/12/god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-beta-available-to-ps-plus-members-january-8th/ |title=God of War: Ascension Multiplayer Beta Available to PS Plus Members January 8th |date=December 12, 2012 |last=Osgood |first=Derek |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CrYETJHQ?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/12/12/god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-beta-available-to-ps-plus-members-january-8th/ |archivedate=December 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial of the Gods is a two-player, cooperative (co-op), [[Time attack#Video games|time-trial]] mode in which the duo faces five waves of mythological monsters concluding with a boss fight.

All but two of the fifteen multiplayer maps are based on locations explored throughout the ''God of War'' series, with eight of those based on locations explored in ''Ascension''; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]'', Bog of the Forgotten is from ''[[God of War II]]'', and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from ''[[God of War III]]''.&lt;ref name="Jan 8"/&gt; The two original maps are the Coliseum of [[Persia]] and the Walls of [[Troy]] (which features the [[Trojan Horse]]). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks.&lt;ref name="beta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpw"/&gt; Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] will grant bonus points for that team.&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joystiq preview"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
As with previous games, ''God of War: Ascension'' is set in an alternate version of [[ancient Greece]] populated by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original ''God of War'' (2005). The next game chronologically would be ''Chains of Olympus'' (2008), which takes place some time between ''Ascension'' and ''God of War'' (2005). The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) and past (the preceding three weeks), while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village [[Kirra, Phocis|Kirra]], the city [[Delphi]], and the island [[Delos]]—are explored in the game.

The Prison of the Damned is the Furies' massive prison to house all oath-breakers. Kirra is an abandoned village that lost its water supply after its [[water wheel]] and [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] were destroyed. Other than monsters, the only life is in its harbor, where the tamed [[Laestrygonian|Harbor Master]] guides vessels in and out of the port. Delphi is located in the snowy mountains north of Kirra and features the Tower of Delphi. After activating three massive, mechanical pythons, the Tower allows access to the Temple of Delphi, home of the Oracle. Delos features a Titan-sized statue of [[Apollo]], constructed by the inventor [[Archimedes]] to honor the god.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of God of War}}
The game's protagonist is Kratos (voiced by [[Terrence C. Carson]]), a Spartan warrior who broke his blood oath to the god [[Ares]] after being tricked into killing his family by his former master. The main antagonists are the three [[Erinyes|Furies]]: [[Megaera]] ([[Nika Futterman]]), [[Tisiphone]] ([[Debi Mae West]]), and the Fury Queen, [[Alecto]] ([[Jennifer Hale]]). The Furies are the guardians of honor and the bane of traitors, who punish those they deem guilty.  They were spawned from the eons-long war between the [[Greek primordial deities|Primordials]], the beings who created the Earth. Other characters include the oath keeper [[Horkos|Orkos]] ([[Troy Baker]]), the son of Ares and Alecto, who was disowned by the god as he was not the perfect warrior that Ares sought; [[Pythia|Aletheia]] ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]), the Oracle of Delphi with prophetic sight; the corrupted Prophet [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]] (David W. Collins) and his conjoined twin [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]] (Brad Grusnick), who usurped the oracle, deciding who can consult her; and the Scribe of Hecatonchires ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]), the first mortal imprisoned by the Furies who has been keeping records to maintain his sanity. Kratos' wife Lysandra (Jennifer Hale) and his daughter Calliope appear in an illusion created by Alecto, and the King of Sparta ([[Crispin Freeman]]) and the Village Oracle ([[Susan Blakeslee]]) appear in an illusion created by Tisiphone with the help of her [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], [[Daemon (classical mythology)|Daemon]].

In the game's multiplayer mode, [[Zeus]] ([[Corey Burton]]), the King of the Olympian Gods, Ares ([[Steven Blum]]), the God of War, [[Poseidon]] ([[Gideon Emery]]), the God of the Sea, and [[Hades]] ([[Fred Tatasciore]]), the God of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], appear as statues at the Rotunda of Olympus where the player selects one to align to, after which the chosen god will communicate with the player during gameplay. Castor and Pollux, the demigod [[Hercules]] ([[Kevin Sorbo]]), the Titan cyclops [[Polyphemus]], the Gorgon [[Stheno]], and the giant scorpion [[Scorpius#Mythology|Skorpius]] also appear in the multiplayer as [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] and/or environmental obstacles.

===Plot===
The game begins with Kratos, who is imprisoned, chained, and tormented by the Furies for breaking his blood oath to Ares. The Fury Megaera tortures Kratos, but he manages to break free. Chasing her through the prison, he discovers that the prison itself is [[Hekatonkheires|Aegaeon the Hecatonchires]], the first traitor of the Furies who had broken a blood oath to Zeus; he was turned into the Prison of the Damned as punishment.&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/preview/7443/watch-the-first-30-minutes-of-god-of-war-ascension |title=Watch the First 30 Minutes of God of War: Ascension |date=February 1, 2013 |author=IGN Staff |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=February 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EBqhh0Xd?url=http://me.ign.com/en/preview/7443/watch-the-first-30-minutes-of-god-of-war-ascension |archivedate=February 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming an illusion created by the Fury Tisiphone and her familiar Daemon, Kratos finds and kills Megaera, retrieving the Amulet of [[Uroborus]], which the Furies had confiscated from him when he was imprisoned.

The narrative shifts to three weeks before Kratos' imprisonment. Confronted by Orkos in the Village of Kirra, Kratos is advised that the visions he has been experiencing are mind tricks created by the Furies, and instructs him to find the Oracle of Delphi. Upon arrival at the Temple of Delphi, he overcomes Castor and Pollux, who tried to kill the Oracle. In her dying breath, the Oracle instructs Kratos to travel to Delos to retrieve the Eyes of Truth. Taking the Amulet of Uroborus from the now-dead Castor and Pollux, Kratos travels to Kirra's harbor, where he again encounters Orkos. The oath keeper reveals that Ares wanted a perfect warrior to help him overthrow Zeus, so Ares [[God of War (2005 video game)#Plot|helped Kratos against the barbarians]] to make him into a perfect warrior. Orkos became the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos takes a ship to Delos.

A week later, Kratos arrives at the island of Delos and explores the ruined statue of Apollo. He is attacked by all three Furies and is eventually captured. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, transporting him to another location. Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals that he and Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares' and the Furies' plan. In retaliation, they took the Oracle's eyes, the objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the eyes. On completing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies, who confiscate all of his items.

Back in the present time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another illusion to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home to his wife and daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a [[Charybdis|giant sea monster]]. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.

Kratos returns to Sparta, where he is met by Orkos. He praises Kratos' victory over the Furies, but reveals that Kratos will not be free from Ares' bond unless he kills Orkos. He begs Kratos to give him an honorable death, which will free them both from Ares. Kratos initially refuses but Orkos' continuing pleas ultimately force Kratos to kill him. Afterward, Kratos experiences the first of many nightmares—previously masked by his bond—and discovers his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos burns down his house with the corpse of Orkos inside and leaves, beginning his path towards becoming the champion of the gods.

In January 2010, [[SCE Santa Monica Studio|Santa Monica]]'s studio director John Hight told video-gaming blog [[Joystiq]] that "while ''God of War III'' will conclude the trilogy, it won't spell the end of the franchise" and said "We're going to be really careful about what we do next."&lt;ref name="GoW3 not last GoW game"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/01/19/interview-god-of-war-3-ends-trilogy-but-not-franchise/ |title=Interview: God of War III ends trilogy, but not franchise, Sony's John Hight says |date=January 19, 2010 |last=Yoon |first=Andrew |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=January 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ce2HZihc?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/01/19/interview-god-of-war-3-ends-trilogy-but-not-franchise/ |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 2011 until April 2012, several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/298849/god-of-war-4-release-date-september-2012/ |title=God of War 4 coming September 2012&amp;nbsp;– Source |date=April 20, 2011 |author=CVG Staff |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6GoEUc?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/298849/god-of-war-4-release-date-september-2012/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/300627/god-of-war-4-online-rumour-strengthened-by-opm/ |title=God of War 4 online rumour strengthened by OPM |date=May 9, 2011 |last=Robinson |first=Andy |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6HXWt9?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/300627/god-of-war-4-online-rumour-strengthened-by-opm/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/325735/god-of-war-4-listed-for-2012-release-again/ |title=God of War 4 listed for 2012 release again |date=November 10, 2011 |last=Hussain |first=Tamoor |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6J5axy?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/325735/god-of-war-4-listed-for-2012-release-again/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="composer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/330948/god-of-war-4-evidence-piles-up-with-another-listing/ |title=God of War 4 evidence piles up with ANOTHER listing |date=January 3, 2012 |last=Hussain |first=Tamoor |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch5cBhlA?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/330948/god-of-war-4-evidence-piles-up-with-another-listing/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/336025/god-of-war-4-listed-on-another-cv/ |title=God of War 4 listed on another CV |date=February 15, 2012 |last=Ivan |first=Tom |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6SbhIM?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/336025/god-of-war-4-listed-on-another-cv/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/334990/god-of-war-4-announcement-hinted-by-retailer/ |title=God of War 4 announcement hinted by retailer?

Papy said the game was not titled ''[[God of War IV]]'' to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy.

The game features a retooled ''God of War III'' engine, enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players. Papy said to allow customization, Kratos and other known gods would not be included as playable characters in the multiplayer modes because the developers did not want "red Kratos, blue Kratos, yellow Kratos", and selecting gods would lock players into established roles. This decision was made "to balance the game when players are pitted against each other".&lt;ref name="Joystiq preview" /&gt; Papy also said there would be no female characters because each character in the multiplayer mode is based on Kratos' animation model.&lt;ref name="Joystiq preview" /&gt; The first demonstration of the game's multiplayer element featured the Team Favor of the Gods mode running on the map Desert of Lost Souls, which features the Titan cyclops Polyphemus.&lt;ref name="Joystiq preview"/&gt; Multiplayer had been discussed for past games, but had never been implemented as previous game directors felt that ''God of War'' was a single-player-only experience;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/141892/interviews/god-of-war-ii/?page=4#top_banner |title=God of War II |page=4 |date=June 21, 2006 |last=Houlihan |first=John |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=December 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CpzLedC9?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/141892/interviews/god-of-war-ii/?page=4 |archivedate=December 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/212635/god-of-war-3-director-reveals-plans-for-future-dlc-and-why-multiplayer-wont-work/|title=''God of War 3'' director reveals plans for future DLC and why multiplayer won't work&amp;nbsp;– Page 1|date=November 4, 2009|last=Shaw|first=Patrick|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|work=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=November 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025020513/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/212635/god-of-war-3-director-reveals-plans-for-future-dlc-and-why-multiplayer-wont-work/|archivedate=October 25, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Chains of Olympus''{{'}}s case, it was cut due to time constraints during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/interview-taking-god-war-psp |title=Interview: Taking God of War to PSP |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |date=March 4, 2008 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |work=[[Edge (magazine)|EDGE]] |author=Edge Staff |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIwjXP0C?url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/interview-taking-god-war-psp/ |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Ascension'', the development team made the decision to invest in multiplayer after a simple version, tested using two Kratoses, turned out to be "a lot of fun" for the game testers.&lt;ref name="AscensionQA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/08/god-of-war-ascension-qa-taking-kratos-to-the-next-level/ |title=God of War: Ascension Q&amp;A: Taking Kratos to the Next Level |date=March 8, 2013 |last=Dutton |first=Fred |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X6BrGUJ4?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/03/08/god-of-war-ascension-qa-taking-kratos-to-the-next-level/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development team faced challenges in adding multiplayer to an established single-player franchise. Other established franchises had been criticized for sub-par multiplayer implementations, so Santa Monica felt they had to prove to critics that their multiplayer mode would not be "tacked on". Since multiplayer was new to the team, new staff were hired who specialized in multiplayer, engineering, and design, but Santa Monica did not realize the amount of work required for the experience they had envisioned. Development was delayed because multiplayer mode required several rewrites. The player navigation code had to be changed for online play, which was initially designed for co-op; the team eventually decided this was unsatisfactory, and the changed approach cost significant development time.&lt;ref name="postmortem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/193695/postmortem__sony_santa_monicas_.php?print=1 |title=Postmortem - Sony Santa Monica's God of War: Ascension |issue=June/July 2013 |author=Wade, Whitney and Chacko Sonny |publisher=[[UBM TechWeb]] |work=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120038/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/193695/postmortem__sony_santa_monicas_.php?print=1 |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multiplayer video game#Single-system|Local co-op]] was also explored, but the team decided to keep multiplayer online-only.&lt;ref name="3D &amp; local co-op"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/03/07/god-of-war-ascension-3d-support-and-local-co-op-in-trial-of-the-gods-were-explored-ultimately-determined-not-to-pursue-further/ |title=God of War: Ascension – 3D Support and Local Co-op in Trial of the Gods Were Explored, "Ultimately Determined not to Pursue Further" |date=March 7, 2013 |last=Dunning |first=Jason |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |work=[[PlayStation LifeStyle]] |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gs0vjXIq?url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/03/07/god-of-war-ascension-3d-support-and-local-co-op-in-trial-of-the-gods-were-explored-ultimately-determined-not-to-pursue-further/ |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finally "found the heart of [the] final multiplayer game" shortly before the first press show. Development focus switched back and forth between single-player and multiplayer; single-player received less attention while the team were preparing multiplayer for the first press announcement, but when single-player mode was reemphasized prior to its public debut, multiplayer mode suffered.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt;

David Jaffe, creator and Game Director of the original ''God of War'', spoke with ''NowGamer'' prior to the first press announcement in late April. He said that if he had worked on ''Ascension'', he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and "look to the ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]'' structure as a jumping off point".&lt;ref name="JaffeNowGamer"/&gt; He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck".&lt;ref name="JaffeNowGamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1339782/god_of_war_ascension_jaffe_reveals_ideas_for_next_kratos_adventure.html |title=God Of War: Ascension: Jaffe Reveals Ideas For Next Kratos Adventure |date=April 26, 2012 |last=Hopkins |first=Tom |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |work=NowGamer |accessdate=August 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6qkKfM?url=http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1339782/god_of_war_ascension_jaffe_reveals_ideas_for_next_kratos_adventure.html |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with [[IGN]] about the multiplayer element: "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, "If it turns out to be the case that the single player is watered down because of [multiplayer], then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/04/god-of-war-3-multiplayer-jaffe-on-ascension |title=God of War 3 Multiplayer, Jaffe on Ascension |date=May 3, 2012 |last=Miller |first=Greg |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=March 13, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X6C2pxhZ?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/04/god-of-war-3-multiplayer-jaffe-on-ascension |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-E3 2012===
At Sony's [[E3 2012|2012]] [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) press conference, the North American release date was confirmed as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems.&lt;ref name="E312"/&gt; An encounter with the sea monster [[Charybdis]] was included in the demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game.

At the 2012 [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX), Game Director Todd Papy, Lead Game Designer Mark Simon, Principal Character Artist Patrick Murphy, and writer of the ''God of War'' series [[Marianne Krawczyk]], hosted the first ''God of War'' panel, discussing the origins of ''Ascension'', and provided an overview of the evolution of Kratos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/08/28/playstation-at-pax-2012-god-of-war-ascension-all-stars-littlebigplanet-and-more/ |title=PlayStation at PAX 2012: God of War: Ascension, All-Stars, LittleBigPlanet and More |date=August 28, 2012 |last=Cardona |first=Cristian |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6sJT3Y?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/08/28/playstation-at-pax-2012-god-of-war-ascension-all-stars-littlebigplanet-and-more/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fury Megaera was revealed,&lt;ref name="Furies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/727543/god-of-war-ascension-enemies-revealed-meet-the-furies/ |title=God of War: Ascension Enemies Revealed; Meet the Furies |date=August 31, 2012 |last=Gaskill |first=Jake |publisher=[[G4 Media]] |work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4tv.com]] |accessdate=September 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CWQ6KGN8?url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/727543/god-of-war-ascension-enemies-revealed-meet-the-furies/ |archivedate=November 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Simon discussed the new combat system. Papy said he had considered using the goddess [[Artemis]] as a playable female character, which would have offered the player alternative combat options. Artemis would have been depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. Artemis was ultimately cut from the game, but Papy said he would like to explore the possibility of using other gods in the future.&lt;ref name="PAX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/08/29/pax-2012-god-of-war-ascension-panel-is-friday-attend-for-beta-access/ |title=Watch the PAX 2012 God of War: Ascension Panel |date=August 29, 2012 |last=Kaufman |first=Aaron |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |accessdate=September 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch6t8QxQ?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/08/29/pax-2012-god-of-war-ascension-panel-is-friday-attend-for-beta-access/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the developmental transition from ''God of War III'' to ''Ascension'', one of the graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that the limits of the ''God of War III'' engine restricted artist creativity, so they "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance."&lt;ref name="MasteredPS3"/&gt; For example, the number of [[UV mapping|UV]] sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat."&lt;ref name="MasteredPS3"/&gt; Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. ''Ascension'' was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as ''God of War III'' had been: "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree ''God of War: Ascension'' was more refinement on the graphics front" said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during ''Ascension''{{'}}s development.&lt;ref name="MasteredPS3"/&gt; The development team also added [[dynamic lighting]], which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from ''God of War III'': "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" said Perthuis.&lt;ref name="MasteredPS3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-how-sony-santa-monica-mastered-the-ps3 |title=How Sony Santa Monica mastered PlayStation 3 |date=May 4, 2013 |last=Morgan |first=Thomas |publisher=Eurogamer Network |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X6CH5qxB?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-how-sony-santa-monica-mastered-the-ps3 |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrence C. Carson, Linda Hunt, Corey Burton, Gideon Emery, Steven Blum, and Kevin Sorbo reprised their roles as Kratos, the narrator, Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, and Hercules, respectively. Jennifer Hale, who voiced two characters in the [[God of War: Ghost of Sparta|previous installment]], voiced the Fury Alecto and Kratos' wife, Lysandra, who was previously voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]. Debi Mae West, Adrienne Barbeau, and Crispin Freeman, who had each done voice work on previous installments, voiced the characters Tisiphone, Aletheia, and the King of Sparta. Troy Baker voiced the oath keeper Orkos and is the announcer in the multiplayer mode. Series veteran Fred Tatasciore assumed the role of Hades, who was previously voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. Susan Blakeslee reprised her role as the Village Oracle, who makes a cameo appearance as an illusion created by Tisiphone. Unlike previous games in which [[motion capture]] and [[voice over|voice recording]] were done separately, ''Ascension'' used "voice-over motion capture"; voice recording and motion capture were done at the same time, which allowed the voice actors to act out their characters' scenes together. The voice-over motion capture was done at House of Moves in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=God of War: Ascension: Unchained&amp;nbsp;– Kratos Comes to Life|publisher=[[SCE Santa Monica Studio]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Santa Monica's senior producer Whitney Wade and director of internal development Chacko Sonny, the beta made the team look at the game as an "evolving service".&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; The beta allowed the developers to make sure that the game design would meet with the approval of existing fans of the series, and that the system could cope with a high volume of players. Wade and Sonny said the testing went as expected, "revealing successive layers of issues that we would address, deploy fixes for, and then monitor in a live environment."&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; The most important change from the beta, they said, was their planning in how to support the game post-launch. The team designed a process that allowed them to "quickly iterate on fixes, deploy them through infrastructure (testing, certification, patching), and coordinate with internal technology partners within Sony."&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; They also developed a system to allow them to monitor, log, and interpret any changes added, and the beta test gave insight on how to prioritize key features.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt;

==Release==

At E3 2012, a single-player demo was shown, featuring new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. The demo revealed a redesigned quick time event mini-game, which replaced some button prompts with a new, prompt-less, free-form system. It featured the World Weapons mechanic and Kratos was shown to be capable of swinging opponents through the air while simultaneously attacking.

Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|November 2012|loc=Ch 3: The Beginning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|November 2012|loc=Ch 5: The Flood}}&lt;/ref&gt; One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|November 2012|loc=Ch 6: A Dark Presence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrior and his men traveled to the land of [[Aeaea]] and recruited the witch [[Circe]], who seemingly also sought revenge against the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|December 2012|loc=Ch 7: Circe's Temple}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|December 2012|loc=Ch 8: The Gem of Uroborus}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|December 2012|loc=Ch 9: The Lord of the Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After traveling through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|January 2013|loc=Ch 13: A Powerful Poison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was revealed to be the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|January 2013|loc=Ch 15: Dark Patriarch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|February 2013|loc=Ch 16: The Offer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior that if he were to kill the general, who was a member of his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|February 2013|loc=Ch 17: The Choice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. However, he tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|February 2013|loc=Ch 18: Vengeance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|February 2013|loc=Ch 19: Orkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ref=RotW|Krawczyk,|March 2013|loc=Ch 20: Prison of the Damned}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first maps were released via patch 1.06, called the "Hunter" update, on May 23, 2013.

''God of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)'' was composed by [[Tyler Bates]] and was released on [[iTunes]] on March 5, 2013 by SCE and La-La Land Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/god-war-ascension-original/id606539183|title=God of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|work=[[iTunes]]|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included as DLC in the ''God of War: Ascension—Collector's Edition'' and ''Special Edition''.&lt;ref name="06/04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Unboxing"/&gt; On October 15, the soundtrack was made available for free on PSN for a limited time.&lt;ref name="NoMoreDLC"/&gt; A notable feature of ''Ascension''{{'}}s soundtrack is that it was scored by only one composer; all the previous games had multiple composers. Tyler Bates previously scored the similarly themed film ''300'' and game ''[[Rise of the Argonauts]]''.  Bates said "My goal was to create a sound that supported the timeless dark age of ''God of War'', while expanding the parameters of the '[[Peplum (film genre)|Sword and Sandals]]' genre."  Although the game's story is linear, he approached the project as if he were scoring a novel as opposed to a film. Bates did not play any of the previous games and chose not to in order to take the score "to new places without being overtly aware of the great music that is emblematic" of the prior installments. The soundtrack was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], and features solo vocal work from Rafe Pearlman and Ciscandra Nostalghia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=God of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)|year=2013|first=Tyler|last=Bates|author-link=Tyler Bates|type=[[Liner notes|booklet]]|pp=3-4|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]], La-La Land Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the score, Bates uses a combination of techniques "to increase the drama of the game" said Emily McMillan of Game Music Online, who gave the album a 4 out of 5 stars. She said one of Bates's signature techniques is "an intense and simultaneous crescendo and glissando." All of the themes take place on a [[harmonic minor scale]]. On the track, "Warriors' Truth", Bates used [[Gerard Marino]]'s main ''God of War'' theme and "twists it for the prequel setting", "taking the harmonic ascending scale and reverting it to a downwards pattern with a harsh choir/brass combination." The track "Visions of Ruin" features the [[cimbalom]], which is rarely used in video game soundtracks. She said overall "The music is powerful, rich, and pulsing", though listening to the whole album can seem repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/godofwarascension/ |title=God of War -Ascension- Original Soundtrack |date=September 2, 2014 |last=McMillan |first=Emily |publisher=Game Music Online |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X6DGsmOd?url=http://www.vgmonline.net/godofwarascension/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''God of War: Ascension'' received generally favorable reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave it an average review score of 79.34% (based on 58 reviews)&lt;ref name="grankingscore"/&gt; and 80/100 (based on 89 reviews),&lt;ref name="metascore"/&gt; respectively. Critics praised the fundamental gameplay and spectacle, but were critical of the lack of new ideas and gave a mixed response to the additional multiplayer mode. Alex Simmons of IGN said the redesigned combat system adds a source of depth: "Learning how to use each power effectively&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;provides a strategic lifeline when there's no energy re-gen chest nearby". Although he initially found the World Weapons useful, he felt that they became unnecessary after upgrading the Blades of Chaos. Simmons felt the magic system was a "positive step"; since magic attacks are unlocked at a later time, players cannot rely on them as much as they may have done in previous installments, which encourages players "to think wisely about where to allocate experience points rather than being the ultimate badass from the outset".&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;

Combat and the new gameplay mechanics were well-received, with Dale North of [[Destructoid]] saying "''God of War'' has never looked or played better than this",&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; and Xav de Matos of Joystiq commenting that the combat is simpler than in ''God of War III'', and rarely required much adjustment.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; Opinions on difficulty varied; Simmons felt that most of the gameplay was balanced, and that ''Ascension'' "is probably the easiest" in the series, but both he and Hollander Cooper of [[GamesRadar]] commented that some areas, such as the Trials of Archimedes, were too difficult. Simmons felt that in some sections, the many enemies made dying feel "cheap and frustrating",&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; and in Cooper's opinion, some points in the game "[test] your patience, rather than your skills—including one [the Trials] that's easily the most difficult section in any ''God of War'' game to date, for all the wrong reasons".&lt;ref name="gradar"/&gt;

Both Simmons and Matos criticized the story; Simmons felt that although the narrative is "meticulously delivered", it "felt a bit incidental", and said that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, "the Furies don't quite cut it".&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Matos was critical of the plot framing and the narrative structure as "just too chaotic"; he argued that "the narrative fabric woven throughout the franchise has begun to split", and ''Ascension'' does little to enhance its characters "in any meaningful way". He did praise the game for providing the "distinct ''God of War'' flair" known to the series.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt;

Cooper praised the enhanced graphics engine as "not only the best the franchise has seen, but some of the most impressive on the PlayStation 3", and was impressed by Kratos' foes.&lt;ref name="gradar"/&gt; North agreed, saying "there's a shine and polish that runs throughout the game that makes it a perfect send-off for the PS3", noting its improved textures, animations, and lighting.&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; The review from ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' magazine also positively reviewed the graphics, but had some frustrations with the visual approach, such as some camera angles.&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt;

Matos was broadly critical of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;it doesn't feel deep enough to command much more than a furiously dedicated fan following".&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is "a genuinely fresh addition&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [game]". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition".&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; The review from ''Edge'' magazine described multiplayer mode as "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The ''Edge'' review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which "effectively lets you know when you have an opening and when to run".&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt;

===Controversy===
Some reviewers disliked the title of one of the game's trophies, "Bros before Hos", which is received after graphically face-stomping a female villain. In response to the criticisms of misogyny, Santa Monica released a patch changing the name of the trophy to "Bros before Foes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/03/11/controversial-god-of-war-ascension-trophy-altered-in-upcoming-p/ |title=Controversial God of War: Ascension trophy altered in upcoming patch |last=Matos |first=Xav de |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Joystiq]] |date=March 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F60x5OVh?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/03/11/controversial-god-of-war-ascension-trophy-altered-in-upcoming-p/ |archivedate=March 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Gojinjo-daiko'''''|御陣乗太鼓}} is a Japanese drum which has been selected as part of [[Wajima, Ishikawa|Wajima]] City’s [[cultural heritage]] (1961) and an Ishikawa Prefecture’s [[intangible cultural heritage]] (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pref.ishikawa.jp/satoyama/noto-giahs/f-lang/english/gal_chiiki_wajima.html |title=Noto's Satoyama and Satoumi Gallery |publisher= Noto Regional GIAHS Executive Committee |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pref.ishikawa.lg.jp/satoyama/giahs/index.html |title=GIAHS appointment |publisher= Ishikawa Prefecture |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing ''gojinjo-daiko'' is strictly restricted to residents of Nafune, a small village in [[Wajima, Ishikawa|Wajima]] City, where only 250 people live, making it very rare to see a live drum performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gojinjodaiko.jp/about_us_yurai.html |title=Gojinjo Daiko |publisher= Gojinjo Daiko of ART |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The origin of the ''gojinjo-daiko'' dates back to 1577 when the warlord [[Uesugi Kenshin]] invaded [[Noto Province]]. As the local people were unarmed, they resisted by beating war drums and wore ferocious looking devil masks with seaweed and bark on their heads in a bid to scare off their enemies. The low sound of drums associated with the rumbling of the earth and caused [[Uesugi Kenshin]] and his soldiers to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://attjapan.sakura.ne.jp/modules/tinyd0/rewrite/tc_50.html |title=att Japan Travel Guide |publisher= Finex Co., Ltd. |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.city.wajima.ishikawa.jp/yorankaine/taikogeinou.htm |title=att Gojinjo Daiko |publisher= Wajima City |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hot-ishikawa.jp/search-detail.php?id=900-jb000373 |title=Nahune Gojinjo Daiko |publisher= Ishikawa Prefecture Tourism League |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot is based on multiple real-life events in Los Angeles, including the rivalry between the [[Bloods]], [[Crips]], and [[Hispanic]] street gangs, the 1980s [[crack epidemic]], the [[Rampart scandal|LAPD Rampart scandal]], and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].

Considered one of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]] of video gaming's most significant titles, and by many reviewers to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]], ''San Andreas'' received rave reviews by many critics who praised the music, story and gameplay.

The game, like its predecessors, is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. However, the violence and sexual content of ''San Andreas'' has been the source of much public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made software patch, dubbed the "[[Hot Coffee mod]]", unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene. The next main entry in the series, ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', was released in April 2008.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Gta-sa-screen1.jpg|thumb|left|The player driving a Banshee towards the Grove Street [[cul-de-sac]] in Los Santos around the afternoon.]]
''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game with [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements. Structured similarly to the previous two games in the series, the core gameplay consists of elements in a [[third-person shooter]] and a driving game, affording the player a large, [[open world]] environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand-to-hand combat. The player can drive a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, buses, semis, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles and bikes. The player may also import vehicles in addition to stealing them.

The open, non-linear environment allows the player to explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, they are not required as the player can complete them at their own leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, the player can freely-roam and look around the cities of San Andreas, eat in restaurants, or cause havoc by attacking people and causing destruction. Creating havoc can attract unwanted and potentially fatal attention from the authorities. The more chaos caused, the stronger the response: police will handle "minor" infractions (attacking pedestrians, pointing [[gun]]s at people, stealing vehicles, manslaughter, etc.), whereas [[SWAT]] teams, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the [[United States Army|military]] respond to higher wanted levels.

The player can partake in a variety of optional side missions that can boost their character's attributes or provide another source of income. The traditional side missions of the past games are included, such as dropping off taxi cab passengers, putting out fires, driving injured people to the hospital and fighting crime as a [[vigilante]]. New additions include [[burglary]] missions, [[pimping]] missions, truck and train driving missions requiring the player to make deliveries on time, and driving/flying/boating/biking schools, which help the player learn skills and techniques to use in their corresponding vehicles.

Not all locations are open to the player at the start of the game. Some locales, such as mod garages, restaurants, gyms, and shops, become available only after completing certain missions. Likewise, for the first portion of the game, only Los Santos and its immediate suburbs are available for exploration; unlocking the other cities and rural areas again requires the completion of certain missions. If the player were to travel in locked locations early in the game, they would end up attracting the attention of SWAT teams, police, and police-controlled Hydras if in an aircraft.

Unlike ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City|Vice City]]'', which needed loading screens when the player moved between different districts of the city, ''San Andreas'' has no load times when the player is in transit. The only loading screens in the game are for cut-scenes and interiors. Other differences between ''San Andreas'' and its predecessors include the switch from single-player to multiplayer Rampage missions (albeit not in the [[Personal computer|PC]] version), and the replacement of the 'hidden packages' with spray paint tags, hidden camera shots, horseshoes, and oysters to discover.

The camera, fighting, and targeting controls were reworked to incorporate concepts from another [[Rockstar Games|Rockstar]] game, ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'', including various stealth elements,&lt;ref name="GameSpotRobbery2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Kasavin |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/preview_6104797.html?page=2 |title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Weekend Update: Robbery and Home Invasion |publisher=GameSpot |page=2 |date=13 August 2004 |accessdate=22 March 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427051710/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/preview_6104797.html?page=2 |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as improved target crosshairs and a target health indicator which changes from green to red to black depending on the target's health. The PC version of the game implements [[mouse chording]]; the player has to hold the right mouse button to activate the [[crosshair]]s, and then click or hold at the left mouse button to shoot or use an item, such as a camera.

[[File:Gta-sa-screen2.jpg|thumb|right|The player has a gunfight with members of an enemy gang.]]
In addition, players can swim and climb walls for the first time in the series.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; The ability to swim and dive underwater has a great effect on the player as well, since water is no longer an impassable barrier that kills the player (although it is possible to drown). For greater fire-power, the player can also dual wield firearms or perform a drive-by shooting with multiple gang members who can be recruited to follow the player. Due to the size of San Andreas, a waypoint reticle on the HUD map can be set, aiding the player in reaching a destination.

=== Role-playing game features in character development ===
Rockstar has emphasised the [[personalisation]] of the main protagonist by adding [[role-playing video game]] elements. Clothing, accessories, haircuts, jewellery, and tattoos are available for purchase by the player, and have more of an effect on [[non-player character]]s' reactions than the clothing in ''Vice City''. CJ's level of respect among his fellow recruits and street friends varies according to his appearance and actions, as do his relationships with his girlfriends. The player must ensure CJ eats to stay healthy and exercises properly. The balance of food and physical activity has an effect on his appearance and physical attributes.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt;

''San Andreas'' tracks acquired skills in areas such as driving, firearms handling, stamina, and lung capacity, which improve through use in the game.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; CJ may learn three different styles of [[hand-to-hand combat]] ([[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] and [[kung fu]]) at the gyms in each of the game's three cities. CJ can speak with a number of pedestrians in the game, responding either negatively or positively. According to Rockstar, there are about 4,200 lines of spoken dialogue for CJ when the cutscenes are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/preview_6111263.html Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Weekend Update: Street Talking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025001431/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/preview_6111263.html |date=25 October 2004 }}, [[GameSpot]], 23 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vehicles ===
In total, there are around 250 vehicles in the game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g-unleashed.com/index.php?cat=16&amp;pid=27&amp;page=vehicle_images |title=Vehicles Guide with images GTA: San Andreas |publisher=G-unleashed.com |date= |accessdate=5 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062342/http://www.g-unleashed.com/index.php?cat=16&amp;pid=27&amp;page=vehicle_images |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to approximately 60 in ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''. New additions include [[bicycle]]s, a [[combine harvester]], a [[street sweeper]], a [[jetpack]] and trailers amongst others. Car [[Game physics|physics]] and features are similar to the ''[[Midnight Club]]'' series of [[street racing]] games, allowing for much more midair vehicle control as well as [[nitrous]] upgrades and aesthetic modification.

There are several different classes of vehicles that serve different purposes. Off-road vehicles perform better in rough environments, while racing cars perform better on tracks or on the street. [[Jet aircraft|Jets]] are fast, but usually need a [[runway]] to land. [[Helicopter]]s can land almost anywhere and are much easier to control in the air, but are slower. While previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games had only a few aircraft that were difficult to access and fly, ''San Andreas'' has eleven fixed-wing aircraft and nine helicopters and makes them more integral in the game's missions. There is also the ability to [[skydive]] from aircraft, using a parachute. Several [[boat]]s were added, while some were highly modified.

=== Other additions and changes ===
Other new features and changes from previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games include:
* '''Gang wars''': Battles with enemy gangs are prompted whenever the player ventures into enemy territory and kills at least three gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the territory will be won and fellow gang members will begin wandering the streets of these areas. The more territory owned by the player, the more money that will be generated. Occasionally, the player's territory will come under attack from enemy gangs and defeating them will be necessary to retain these areas. Once all marked territories are claimed from one of the two hostile gangs for the protagonist's gang, the opposing gang can no longer attack. Once the player takes control of all the territories, none can come under attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gta-sanan.ucoz.net/index/gangs/0-9 |title=GTA San Andreas&amp;nbsp;— Gangs |publisher=Gta-sanan.ucoz.net |date= |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Car modification''': Most automobiles in the game can be modified and upgraded at various garages. All car mods are strictly visual apart from the stereo system and [[nitrous oxide]] upgrade which increases bass and gives the car a speed boost when activated respectively; and hydraulics, which lowers the car's height by default and allows the player to control various aspects of the car's suspension. Other common modifications include paintjobs, rims, [[body kits]], side skirts, bumpers and spoilers.
* '''Burglary''': Continuing the series' tradition of controversy, [[home invasion]] is included as a potential money-making activity.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Kasavin, [http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/preview_6104797.html Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Weekend Update: Robbery and Home Invasion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818021709/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/gta4/preview_6104797.html |date=18 August 2004 }}, GameSpot, 13 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By stealing a burglary van, CJ is able to sneak into a residence at night, and cart off valuables or shake down the occupants.
* '''Minigames''': Numerous [[minigame]]s are available for play in ''San Andreas'', including [[basketball]], [[pool (game)|pool]], [[Rhythm game|rhythm-based]] challenges (dancing and 'bouncing' [[lowrider]]s with hydraulics), and video game machines that pay homage to classic [[arcade game]]s. In addition, there are the aforementioned casino games and methods of gambling, such as betting on virtual [[horse racing|horse races]].&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;
* '''Money''': The money system has been expanded upon, compared to previous titles. Players can spend their cash on gambling, clothes, tattoos, meals, etc. Excessive gambling loss can force the player to sink into debt, which is shown in red negative numbers. When the player leaves a safehouse, CJ gets an unexpected call and a mysterious person tells him about his debts. Four gang members suddenly appear and shoot Carl on sight if he does not erase the debt when the mysterious person calls him a second time.
* '''Multiplayer''': Rampages have been modified to allow two players to complete them. The players are both shown simultaneously on the screen, meaning they must stay within close proximity of each other. The multiplayer rampages provide such functionality.

== Synopsis ==

=== Setting ===
''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' takes place in 1992 within the state of San Andreas, which is based on sections of [[California]] and [[Nevada]]. It comprises three major fictional cities: '''[[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]]''' corresponds to [[Los Angeles]], '''San Fierro''' corresponds to [[San Francisco]], and '''Las Venturas''' corresponds to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; The environments around these cities are also based on settings within the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern region]] of the United States. Players can drive up the half-mile (800&amp;nbsp;m) tall Mount Chiliad (based on [[Mount Diablo]]), [[parachute]] from various peaks and skyscrapers, and visit 12 rural towns and villages located in five counties: Red County, Flint County, Bone County, Tierra Robada, and Whetstone. Other notable destinations include Sherman Dam (based on the [[Hoover Dam]]), a large secret military base called Area 69 (based on [[Area 51]]), a large satellite dish (based on a dish from the [[Very Large Array]]), Vinewood (based on [[Hollywood]]) and the Vinewood sign (based on the [[Hollywood sign]]) which is located in Mulholland, and many other geographical features. The bridges in San Fierro are based on the Forth [[Forth Road Bridge|road]] and [[Forth bridge|rail]] bridges which link Edinburgh, the home of Rockstar North, to Fife although the road bridge is highly similar to the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]]. San Andreas is 13.9 square miles (36 square kilometres),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/gta4/news.html?sid=6126774 |title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Q&amp;A&amp;nbsp;— Under the Hood, ''GameSpot'', June 1, 2005 |accessdate=11 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806144402/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/gta4/news.html?sid=6126774 |archivedate=6 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost four times as large as Vice City and five times as large as the ''Grand Theft Auto III'' rendition of [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]]. The three cities are linked by numerous highways, a train system, and air travel. While its predecessors' areas were limited to urban locations, San Andreas includes not only large cities and suburbs, but also the rural areas between them.

=== Gangs ===
The main character is a member of the Grove Street Families street gang, a set of a gang that also includes the initially-hostile Temple Drive and Seville Boulevard Families. The two main rival gangs are the Ballas and Los Santos Vagos, both based out of Los Santos. The Varrios Los Aztecas also operate in Los Santos. The main gangs of San Fierro are the San Fierro Rifa, led by T-Bone Mendez; the Da Nang Boys, a Vietnamese gang; and the San Fierro Triads, whose leader Wu Zi Mu forms an alliance with Carl. In Las Venturas, the only gangs are the Triads (run by Wu Zi Mu) and the [[Italian Mafia]] (consisting of the Forellis, Sindaccos, and Leones). The "Loco Syndicate" appears in the San Fierro mission chain, essentially made up of T-Bone Mendez's Rifa gangsters, Mike Toreno and a pimp Jizzy B. In addition, the [[Russian Mafia]] makes a few small appearances in the storyline.

=== Characters ===
{{Main|List of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas characters}}{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The characters that appear in ''San Andreas'' are relatively diverse and relative to the respective cities and locales which each of them based himself in. This allows the game to include a significantly wider array of story lines and settings than in ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''Vice City''. The player controls [[Carl Johnson (Grand Theft Auto)|Carl "CJ" Johnson]] ([[Young Maylay]]), a young [[African-American]] gang member who serves as the game's protagonist.

The Los Santos stages of the game revolve around the theme of the Grove Street Families gang fighting with the Ballas and the Vagos for territory and respect. East Asian gangs (most notably the local [[Triad society|Triads]]), an additional Vietnamese gang (the Da Nang Boys), and a force of Hispanic thugs working for the local "Loco Syndicate" (the San Fierro Rifa) are evident in the San Fierro leg of the game, while three Mafia families and the Triads who all own their respective casino are more prominently featured in the Las Venturas section of the game.

Like the previous two ''Grand Theft Auto'' games, the voice actors of ''San Andreas'' include notable celebrities, such as [[David Cross]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Ron Foster (actor)|Ron Foster]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[James Woods]], [[Peter Fonda]], [[Charlie Murphy]], [[Frank Vincent]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Danny Dyer]], [[Sara Tanaka]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Wil Wheaton]], rappers [[Ice-T]], [[Chuck D]], [[Frost (rapper)|Frost]], [[MC Eiht]] and [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] and musicians [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Axl Rose]], [[Sly and Robbie]] and [[Shaun Ryder]]. [[Young Maylay]] made his debut as the protagonist, Carl.

''The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition'' lists it as the video game with the largest voice cast, with 861 credited voice actors, including 174 actors and 687 additional performers, many of those performers being fans of the series who wanted to appear on the game.&lt;ref name="guinness 2009" /&gt;

=== Plot ===
In 1992, [[Carl Johnson (Grand Theft Auto)|Carl "CJ" Johnson]] ([[Young Maylay]]), a former gangbanger for the Los Santos-based Grove Street Families, returns home to Los Santos from Liberty City after learning of his mother's murder in a drive-by shooting. Upon his arrival, CJ is intercepted by a group of corrupt police officers led by [[Frank Tenpenny]] ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]). Tenpenny coerces CJ into working for him by threatening to frame CJ for the murder of an Internal Affairs officer, whose death had been orchestrated by Tenpenny.

After Tenpenny lets him go, CJ reunites with his surviving family at his mother's funeral: his brother Sweet ([[Faizon Love]]) and his sister Kendl ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]). Sweet angrily confronts CJ about his long absence from Los Santos and blames CJ for the Grove Street gang's declining fortunes. However, CJ wins Sweet's grudging acceptance by promising to stay and help rebuild the gang. The two brothers work closely with their friends, Big Smoke ([[Clifton Powell]]) and Ryder ([[MC Eiht]]), to reunite the divided Grove Street Families and reconquer their old turf from their rivals, the Ballas. During the gang war, CJ is occasionally sidetracked by orders from Officer Tenpenny, who forces CJ to assist him with black market and drug racketeering. Later, Sweet asks CJ to investigate Kendl's new boyfriend Cesar ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]). Despite his preconceptions, CJ discovers that Cesar genuinely cares about Kendl, and the two men become friends.

With Grove Street stronger than ever, Sweet plans to ambush a major group of Ballas and end the war. However, before CJ can get to the fight, he receives a call from Cesar to meet elsewhere. Cesar shows CJ a shocking scene: Big Smoke, Ryder, Tenpenny, and the Ballas working together to hide the car used in the shooting which killed CJ's mother. Big Smoke and Ryder had arranged the shooting, and were working with Tenpenny and the Ballas to sell out Grove Street. CJ rushes to warn Sweet, but is too late, as Sweet is badly wounded from the Ballas counter-ambush. Tenpenny shows up and arrests them both. With Grove Street's leadership decapitated, Big Smoke and Ryder openly declare their alliance with the Ballas. They take over Los Santos and flood its streets with drugs, and with Tenpenny protecting them from police interference, they appear unstoppable.

However, Tenpenny decides to get more use out of CJ. Instead of throwing CJ in prison, Tenpenny drives him into the rural country outside Los Santos, and threatens to arrange Sweet's death in prison if CJ doesn't co-operate. Exiled in the countryside, CJ is forced to carry out favors for C.R.A.S.H, under threat of Sweet being transferred to a cell block where Ballas affiliates are housed. He also works with Cesar's cousin Catalina (Cynthia Farrell) to make money by carrying out several heists in the area. He also befriends a hippie named The Truth ([[Peter Fonda]]) and a blind Chinese-American Triad leader named Wu Zi Mu ([[James Yaegashi]]). After winning the deed to a garage in San Fierro in a race against Catalina and [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|her new boyfriend]], CJ goes there with The Truth, Cesar and Kendl to get it up and running so they can make a living. While in San Fierro, CJ crosses paths with the Loco Syndicate, Big Smoke and Ryder's drug connection. CJ infiltrates the organisation and identifies its leader, Mike Toreno ([[James Woods]]). CJ kills Ryder and the other Loco Syndicate leaders, Jizzy B ([[Charlie Murphy]]) and T-Bone Mendez ([[Kid Frost]]), and shoots down Toreno's helicopter. CJ then destroys the Syndicate's drug factory.

Soon after, CJ is called by an unknown man using a digitally distorted voice, who asks CJ to meet him at a ranch in the desert. There, CJ finds Mike Toreno alive, thus revealing Toreno as the caller. Toreno reveals that he is actually an undercover government agent spying on criminal operations and enlists CJ's help in several shady operations in exchange for Sweet's freedom. Meanwhile, CJ travels to Las Venturas, where Wu Zi Mu invites him to become a partner in the ''Four Dragons Casino'', where the organisation is facing problems from the mob families that control the city. Seeking to wrest control of Venturas from them, CJ helps Wu Zi Mu plot a robbery of the mob's casino and gains the mob's trust through various jobs for mob boss, Salvatore Leone ([[Frank Vincent]]). Eventually the heist is carried out successfully, earning the Triad a place of power in Las Venturas, although causing the mob to detest CJ. CJ also encounters rapper Madd Dogg ([[Ice-T]]), from whom he stole a rhyme book to help rapper OG Loc (Jas Anderson) become a name in the business. After rescuing Madd Dogg from a suicide attempt, he asks CJ to be his manager once he returns from rehab.

Tenpenny, fearing his arrest is inevitable, tasks his partner Pulaski ([[Chris Penn]]) with killing CJ and Officer Hernandez ([[Armando Riesco]]), whom Tenpenny found out was informing on them to Internal Affairs. While Pulaski forces CJ to dig his own grave, Hernandez, severely injured after being hit over the head with a shovel, manages to attack Pulaski, leading to his death. Pulaski attempts to escape, but CJ kills him. Madd Dogg returns from rehab, prompting CJ to return to Los Santos to get his music career started again. Toreno contacts CJ for one last favor, and finally has Sweet released from prison. Now rich and successful, CJ attempts to cut Sweet in on his businesses, but Sweet becomes angry that he ran away and let their home be taken over by rival gang members and drug dealers to make his fortune. While CJ helps Sweet once again kill the rival gangs, Tenpenny is arrested and tried for felonies that he has been charged with, but the charges are dropped due to lack of evidence, prompting a citywide riot. CJ helps Cesar regain control over the barrio and also regain territory for his gang, so as to have enough power to obtain knowledge of Big Smoke's whereabouts.

Sweet soon learns that Big Smoke is holed up in a fortified crack den in the city, and he and CJ go there to confront him. CJ enters the building alone, fighting his way to the top floor and confronting Smoke. CJ attempts to reason with Smoke, but the latter engages CJ in a gunfight. CJ defeats him and Smoke confesses that he betrayed the GSF in order to gain more power and money, and dies shortly after from his injuries. Tenpenny then arrives and holds CJ at gunpoint, before stealing Big Smoke's money, intending to use it to leave the city. Tenpenny escapes and CJ and Sweet pursue him. During the pursuit, Tenpenny loses control of a fire truck that he was using as a getaway vehicle, driving off the bridge over the Grove Street cul-de-sac and crashing at the entrance to it. CJ and his friends watch as a fatally wounded Tenpenny crawls from the wreckage and dies.

In the aftermath, CJ's family and friends arrive at the Johnson house for a meeting. Madd Dogg announces his first Gold record. As his friends and allies celebrate their success, CJ turns to leave.

== Marketing and release ==

=== Film ===
''The Introduction'', an in-engine video, was provided on a [[DVD]] with the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Official Soundtrack]]'', as well as the ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Special Edition'' re-release for the PlayStation 2. The 26-minute video chronicles the events leading up to the events in ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' and provides insight on the development of the characters of the game, to the point when Carl learns of his mother's death in a phone call from Sean "Sweet" Johnson &amp; returns to Los Santos to find his life is ruined. The film incorporates locations from the original ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' game. The PS2 release also includes a live-action documentary on the [[custom car]] culture (featured prominently in the game) called ''Sunday Driver''.

== Soundtrack ==
{{Main|Music of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas}}

As with the previous two entries in the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series, ''San Andreas'' has music taken from the time in which the game is based.

San Andreas is serviced by eleven radio stations; WCTR ([[talk radio]]), Master Sounds 98.3 ([[rare groove]], playing many of the old funk and soul tracks sampled by 1990s hip-hop artists), K-Jah West ([[Dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]]; modelled after K-Jah from ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''), CSR ([[new jack swing]], [[modern soul]]), Radio X ([[alternative rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[grunge]]), Radio Los Santos ([[gangsta rap]]), SF-UR (old school Chicago [[house music]]), Bounce FM ([[funk]]), K-DST ([[classic rock]]), K-Rose ([[classic country|country]]) and Playback FM ([[golden age hip hop|classic hip hop]]).

The music system in ''San Andreas'' is enhanced from previous titles. In earlier games in the series, each radio station was essentially a single looped sound file, playing the same songs, announcements and advertisements in the same order each time. In ''San Andreas'', each section is held separately, and "mixed" randomly, allowing songs to be played in different orders, announcements to songs to be different each time, and plot events to be mentioned on the stations. This system would be used in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''. WCTR, rather than featuring licensed music and DJs, features spoken word performances by actors such as Andy Dick performing as talk show hosts and listener callers in a parody of talk radio programming.

Lazlow again plays as himself on the show "Entertaining America" on WCTR in the same persona as in ''III'' and ''Vice City''. He takes over after the former presenter, Billy Dexter, is shot on air by in-game film star Jack Howitzer. Lazlow interviews guests such as O.G. Loc, who is one of the four characters Carl encounters during the game that is on the radio, along with Big Smoke, Madd Dogg, and The Truth.

The Xbox, iOS, and Windows versions of the game include an additional radio station that supports custom soundtracks by playing user imported [[MP3]]s, allowing players to listen to their own music while playing the game. This feature is not available on the PlayStation 2 version of the game or when played on the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="GSpot_XBOX"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-review/1900-6127083/ |title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Review |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann |date=7 June 2005 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=18 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227014024/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-review/1900-6127083/ |archivedate=27 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release, ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' was met with critical acclaim. It received an average review score of 95/100, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], tying for the fifth-highest ranked game in PlayStation 2 history.&lt;ref name="metaPS2" /&gt; ''[[IGN]]'' rated the game a 9.9/10 (the highest score it has ever awarded to a PlayStation 2 game), calling it "the defining piece of software" for the PlayStation 2.&lt;ref name="IGNReview" /&gt; ''[[GameSpot]]'' rated the game 9.6/10, giving it an Editor's Choice award. [[Jeff Gerstmann]] said "''San Andreas'' definitely lives up to the ''Grand Theft Auto'' name. In fact, it's arguably the best game in the series".&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview" /&gt; ''San Andreas'' also received an A rating from the ''[[1UP.com]]'' network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/games/ps2/gta-san-andreas/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605040809/http://www.1up.com/games/ps2/gta-san-andreas/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 June 2012 |title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for PS2 from |publisher=1UP |date= |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 10/10 score from ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]''. Common praises were made about the game's open-endedness, the size of the state of San Andreas, and the engaging storyline and voice acting. Most criticisms of the game stemmed from graphical mishaps, poor character models, and low-resolution textures, as well as various control issues, particularly with auto-aiming at enemies. Some critics commented that while a lot of new content had been added to ''San Andreas'', little of it had been refined or implemented well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/39128.shtml|title=GamePro review|accessdate=17 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103034411/http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/39128.shtml|archivedate=3 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, since its release, ''San Andreas'' has been regarded to be one of the greatest games of all time, placing at number 27 in ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''{{'s}} Top 100 Games to Play Today.

== Controversies ==

''San Andreas'' was criticised by some for its perceived [[racial stereotyping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/technology/the-color-of-mayhem.html |title=The Color of Mayhem |last=Marriott |first=Michel |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=12 August 2004 |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102204458/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/12/technology/the-color-of-mayhem.html |archivedate=2 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some saw the alleged stereotyping as ironic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/07/minorities-in-videogames/ |title=Study: Videogames Underrepresent Minorities |last=John |first=Tracey |publisher=''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714030207/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/07/minorities-in-videogames |archivedate=14 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others defended the game, noting that the storyline could speak to people of different backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5860471/envisioning-a-world-without-racism-with-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas |title=Envisioning a World Without Racism With Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas |last=Fahey |first=Mike |publisher=Kotaku |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106060626/http://kotaku.com/5860471/envisioning-a-world-without-racism-with-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas |archivedate=6 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of how different groups of youths engaged with the game found that "they do not passively receive the games' images and content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVane|first1=B.|last2=Squire|first2=K.

=== Hot Coffee mod ===
{{Main|Hot Coffee mod}}
{{Wikinews|Video game's secret sex scenes spark outrage}}
In mid-June 2005, a [[software patch]] for the game dubbed the "[[Hot Coffee mod]]" was released by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias "PatrickW"), a 38-year-old modder from the Netherlands. The name "Hot Coffee" refers to the way the released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would like to come in for "some coffee". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard. After installing the patch, users can enter the main character's girlfriends' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed [[sexual intercourse]] mini-game. The fallout from the controversy resulted in a public response from high-ranking politicians in the United States and elsewhere and resulted in the game's recall and re-release.

{{Wikinews|Stores drop game "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" after given 'Adults Only' rating}}
On 20 July 2005, North America's organisation who establish content ratings for video games, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], changed the rating of the game from Mature (M) to Adults Only (AO), making ''San Andreas'' the only mass-released AO console game in the United States. Rockstar announced that it would cease production of the version of the game that included the controversial content. Rockstar gave distributors the option of applying an Adults Only ESRB rating sticker to copies of the game, or returning them to be replaced by versions without the Hot Coffee content. Many retailers pulled the game off their shelves in compliance with their own store regulations that kept them from selling AO games. That same month in Australia, the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] revoked its original rating of MA15+, meaning that the game could no longer be sold there.&lt;ref name="AustraliaSexScandal"&gt;{{cite news|title=GTA sex scandal hits Australia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4728261.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=11 November 2010 |date=29 July 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114031426/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4728261.stm |archivedate=14 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Rockstar North released an official "Cold Coffee" patch&lt;ref name="coffee"&gt;[http://www.nomorehotcoffee.com/ No More Hot Coffee], ''[[Rockstar Games]]'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; for the PC version of the game and re-released ''San Andreas'' with the "Hot Coffee" scenes removed (''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' Version 2.0), allowing the game to return to its "M" rating. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions have also been re-released with the "Hot Coffee" scenes removed in the Greatest Hits Edition, the Platinum Edition and the "''Grand Theft Auto'' Trilogy Pack".&lt;ref&gt;Tim Surette, [http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/09/23/news_6134252.html GTA gets trilogized, San Andreas special edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051003230253/http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/09/23/news_6134252.html |date=3 October 2005 }}, ''GameSpot'', 23 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2007, Take-Two announced a proposed settlement to the class action litigation that had been brought against them following the Hot Coffee controversy. If the proposed settlement is approved by the court, neither Take-Two nor Rockstar would admit liability or wrongdoing. Consumers would be able to swap their AO-rated copies of the game for M-rated versions and may also qualify for a $35 cash payment upon signing a sworn statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Androvich |first=Mark |title=Take-Two settles "Hot Coffee" lawsuits |website=[[Gamesindustry.biz]] |date=8 November 2007 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=30468 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310002534/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=30468 |archivedate=10 March 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in ''The New York Times'' on 25 June 2008 revealed that a total of 2,676 claims for the compensation package had been filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/technology/25settle.html |work=The New York Times |title=Hidden Sex Scenes Draw Ho-Hum, Except From Lawyers |first=Jonathan D. |last=Glater |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529175907/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/technology/25settle.html |archivedate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow-ups ==
Rockstar released two follow-ups to ''San Andreas'': ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'', both by [[Rockstar Leeds]]. Unlike ''San Andreas'' and its predecessors, ''Liberty City Stories'' and ''Vice City Stories'' were developed for the [[PlayStation Portable]] handheld, and there was no Windows or Xbox version although a PlayStation 2 port was released afterward. ''San Andreas'' thus marks the last major ''Grand Theft Auto'' release across the sixth-generation consoles to be produced by Rockstar North, as well as the last one to introduce an entirely new setting.

''Liberty City Stories'' and ''Vice City Stories'' are prequels to ''San Andreas''{{'}} predecessors, so both games derive their maps from ''Grand Theft Auto III'' and ''Vice City'', respectively, each of which cover a considerably smaller area than ''San Andreas''. ''Liberty City Stories'' and ''Vice City Stories'' eliminated gameplay elements introduced in ''San Andreas'', including the ability to swim (in ''Liberty City Stories'', but re-introduced in a limited capacity in ''Vice City Stories'') and climb. Both ''Liberty City Stories'' and ''Vice City Stories'' include references to characters featured in ''San Andreas'', with ''Liberty City Stories'' set about 6 years after the events of ''San Andreas'' (in that game, for example, radio reporter Richard Burns, featured in news bulletins in ''San Andreas'', returns as a radio call-in guest) and ''Vice City Stories'' set about 8 years before the events of ''San Andreas''. Except for news bulletins, radio programming in ''Liberty City Stories'' and ''Vice City Stories'' does not change based upon player progress. While character customisation elements such as wardrobe changes are retained, for later games, Rockstar eliminated the need for the game protagonists to eat and exercise.&lt;ref name="OPM UK June 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | title = GTA Gets Real | journal = [[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)]] | issue = 6 | pages = 54–67 | publisher = [[Future Publishing]] | location = United Kingdom |date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''San Andreas'' marked the technological pinnacle of the ''Grand Theft Auto III'' era (also known as the "3D Universe") and also the end of that continuity (albeit for the handheld-focused ''Liberty City Stories'' and ''Vice City Stories'' spin-offs). Rockstar launched a new canon (the "HD Universe") with ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' for the seventh-generation consoles. The celebrity [[Video game voice acting|voice acting]] that had been so prominent in the "3D Universe", especially in ''Vice City'' and ''San Andreas'', was scaled back in the "HD Universe". Rockstar also took a new direction in the series, focusing on realism and details instead of greater area and added content. For instance, although the explorable sandbox area is smaller than ''San Andreas'', the main setting for ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' is comparable to ''San Andreas'' in terms of scope when "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" are taken into account.&lt;ref name="slab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200705/101_p1.asp |title=Welcome to Grand Theft Auto IV |author=Doree, Adam |work=[[Kikizo]] |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009043528/http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200705/101_p1.asp |archivedate=9 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal for the HD Universe layout of Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts found in San Andreas state.&lt;ref name="OPM UK June 2007"/&gt; [[Ars Technica]] wrote ''Grand Theft Auto IV''{{'}}s "slight regression of the series from ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' is surprising: there are fewer vehicles, weapons, and story missions, less character customisation, and even the size of the city itself is smaller".&lt;ref name="arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/gta-4-review/ |title=The streets hit back: a review of Grand Theft Auto IV |accessdate=1 May 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531080746/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/gta-4-review/ |archivedate=31 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Garbut explained, with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware, "our processes and the fidelity of the world [had] evolved so much from ''San Andreas''" that using it as a model would have been redundant.&lt;ref name="Game Informer Digital Issue 236"/&gt;

== Other versions ==

=== Steam version ===
''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' is distributed on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The game received a notable amount of updates raising the version from 1.1 to 3.0. On 7 November 2014, an update caused controversy after 17 tracks from the soundtrack were removed due to expired licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor |first1=Alice |title=GTA San Andreas Steam Pulls Songs And Breaks Saves |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/11/10/gta-san-andreas-steam-removes-songs/ |accessdate=19 October 2016 |work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |date=10 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205100439/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/11/10/gta-san-andreas-steam-removes-songs/ |archivedate=5 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drawbacks of the update include removal of widescreen support (which was later fixed via another minor update) and certain regions had incompatibility with older saves. Both old and new owners were affected by the update, unlike with ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'', where only new owners were affected due to a similar update. Additionally, the game received native support for [[XInput]]-enabled gamepads and the removal of [[Digital rights management|DRM]].

=== Mobile version ===
[[File:GTA San Andreas iOS gameplay.jpg|thumb|Gameplay of the iOS version]]
On 12 December 2013, ''San Andreas'' was released on select iOS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toby Moses |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/02/sonic-2-gta-san-andreas-steelseries-stratus-review |title=Sonic 2; GTA: San Andreas; Sonic &amp; All Stars Racing: Transformed; SteelSeries Stratus – review &amp;#124; Technology &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302055907/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/02/sonic-2-gta-san-andreas-steelseries-stratus-review |archivedate=2 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgrades and enhancements from the original game include newly remastered graphics, consisting of [[Shadow mapping|dynamic and detailed shadows]], greater [[draw distance]], an enriched colour palette, plus enhanced character and car models.&lt;ref name="IGN_iOS" /&gt; The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Amazon Kindle]] version was released on 19 December 2013 and [[Windows Phone]] version on 27 January 2014.

=== Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions ===
In 2008, the original Xbox version was released on Xbox 360; an [[Video game console emulator|emulated]] port as part of the [[List of Xbox Originals|Xbox Originals]] line-up. However, in late 2014 it was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace and replaced with a port of the mobile version on 26 October 2014, the game's tenth anniversary. It featured HD 720p resolution, enhanced draw distance, a new menu interface, and [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]]. While it introduced many new features, around ten songs were removed from the HD version that were present in the original due to licensing issues, and numerous new bugs were introduced.&lt;ref name="eurogamer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-gta-san-andreas-on-xbox-360-is-a-mobile-port |title=GTA: San Andreas HD on Xbox 360 is a mobile port |last=Leadbetter |first=Richard |date=30 October 2014 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=31 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101142950/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-gta-san-andreas-on-xbox-360-is-a-mobile-port |archivedate=1 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A physical release followed on 30 June 2015 in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-San-Andreas-Xbox/dp/B00Z0DOXEQ/ |title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Xbox 360 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17 July 2015 elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/GTA-San-Andreas-Xbox-360/dp/B00ZUS11ZA/ |title=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Xbox 360 |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the "[[Platinum Hits]]" banner ("Classics" in PAL regions).

''San Andreas'' was first released on PlayStation 3 in December 2012 as an emulated [[List of PlayStation 2 Classics|PS2 Classic]]. This version was also removed in late 2014, leading to rumours of a PS3 HD release. However, this was not the case at the time and the PS2 Classic later returned. In early November 2015, the game was re-rated by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] for an upcoming PS3-native release. The HD version was released on 1 December 2015, replacing the PS2 Classic on the [[PlayStation Store]], and on physical media, gaining instant "[[Greatest Hits (PlayStation)|Greatest Hits]]" status in North America.&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/news/28669/GTA-San-Andreas-for-PS3-gets-rated-for-upcoming-re-release/ |title=GTA San Andreas for PS3 gets rated for upcoming re-release |last=Harradence |first=Michael |work=[[PSU.com|PlayStation Universe]] |date=16 November 2015 |accessdate=18 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117155612/http://www.psu.com/news/28669/GTA-San-Andreas-for-PS3-gets-rated-for-upcoming-re-release |archivedate=17 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a PlayStation 4 version released, though unlike the remake for the PlayStation 3, it is an emulated port of the PlayStation 2 game, but it still has trophies and some songs edited out due to licensing restrictions.

The '''Independent Betting Adjudication Service (IBAS)''', founded in 1998, is a third party organisation that settles [[disputes]] between gambling establishments registered with IBAS and their customers in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/23/newsstory.sport4 Explain…Disputed Goals], guardian.co.uk, 23 January 2000, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation, which was originally part of the Sporting Life's Green Seal service, was formerly known as the ''Independent Betting Arbitration Service''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibas-uk.com/newsPress.php?newsID=27 IBAS marks 10 years as it looks for future funding], betting-business.com, 1 November 2008, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Service dropped ''[[Arbitration]]'' from its name in 2007, opting instead to use ''[[Adjudication]]'' to better reflect its role after the enactment of the [[Gambling Act 2005|2005 Gambling Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibas-uk.com/newsPress.php?newsID=18 IBAS Adjusts to Changes in the Betting Industry], racingpost.com, 9 June 2007, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

IBAS deals with several sectors in the realm of gambling. The sectors include:
*[[Betting exchange|Betting Exchanges]]
*Betting Intermediaries
*[[betting shops|Betting Shops]]
*Bingo Clubs
*[[Greyhound racing|Greyhounds]]
*Greyhound Stadia Pool Betting
*[[Lotteries]]
*[[online gambling|Online Gambling]] (UK and Offshore)
*[[Slot machine|Gaming Machines]]
*[[mobile gambling|Mobile Gambling]]
*Totalisator Betting

== Dispute involvement ==
Since its inception, IBAS has been handling the majority of gambling disputes in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/mar/27/gregwood Big shape-up in betting laws], guardian.co.uk, 27 March 2002, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the first year that IBAS was fully operational, approximately 800 disputes went to panel, a number which remained relatively constant the following year in 2001. In 2002, the number of cases to panel rose to 1126 due to the abolishment of the UK's gambling tax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/aug/06/horseracing.gregwood Concerns at huge rise in bet disputes], guardian.co.uk, 6 August 2002, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, IBAS saw another increase in cases to panel, this time as a result of the 2005 Gambling Act. In 2007, nearly 1700 disputes were handled by the IBAS panel, 372 of which were of the internet variety. IBAS claims to have awarded customers over £365,000 from dispute resolutions in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibas-uk.com/pdf/IBAS_Annual%20Report_07.pdf IBAS 2007 Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also instances when IBAS rules in favour of the establishment, rather than the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2008/01/12/england-fan-bookie-won-t-pay-me-9000-86908-20282796/ England Fan Bookie Won't Pay Me £9000], dailyrecord.co.uk, 12 January 2008, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/sport/Saints-fan-loses-out-on.4135790.jp Saints fan loses out on £700 bet – after backing Cobblers!], northamptonchron.co.uk, 30 May 2008, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

IBAS will become involved in a dispute only after the gambling establishment and the customer(s) have made attempts to resolve the issue amongst themselves. If a [[deadlock]] remains, the dispute will be reviewed by IBAS if the following conditions are met:

*a resolution has not been reached to satisfaction of either party involved
*both parties agree to the terms and conditions of involving IBAS as a third party [[adjudicator]]

If the dispute merits involvement, IBAS will accept written statements describing the conflict from both parties involved. IBAS verifies the establishment has upheld their own rules and regulations for gambling. If no rule that covers the dispute exists, IBAS will set forth its own rule based on what would be acceptable by industry standards. Both parties are bound by IBAS's ruling.

== Gambling commission ==
One objective of the [[Gambling Commission|UK Gambling Commission]] is to ensure that all gamblers are treated fairly in accordance with the rules and regulations established for gambling industry. This includes disputes between customers and gambling operators. By law, any sector in the realm of gambling under the jurisdiction of the Gambling Commission must use an independent, third party to resolve disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibas-uk.com/newsPress.php?newsID=16 IBAS Aims to Branch Out], racingpost.com, 7 June 2007, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Because IBAS is recognised as the third party adjudicator for nearly all [[bookmakers]] in the UK, the Gambling Commission works closely with IBAS to reduce the number of disputes between customers and gambling operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibas-uk.com/newsPress.php?newsID=20 IBAS still 'the only game in town' – now with added adjudication], racingpost.com, 31 August 2007, accessed 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==
From time to time, IBAS publishes a [[case study]] on one of their past rulings. These case studies provide gamblers with examples of previous disputes to help prevent future problems between gamblers and operators. The studies focus on aspects of gambling that are often confusing or misinterpreted. Case studies are available for several betting options offered to UK gamblers.

One [[association football|football]] study published stated that ''all football bets are based on 90 minutes, unless otherwise specified by the use of the words outright, win trophy or another suitable phrase that leaves no doubt as to the preferred settlement criteria.'' Bettors need to specify which option they desire prior to placing the intended wager, otherwise, the bet is assumed to be based on 90 minutes of play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibas-uk.com/adjudicationCase.php?adjudID=28 Adjudication Case Studies – Football]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noted that every single one of their case studies is in favour of bookmakers.

A '''Kibitzer''' is a [[Yiddish]] term for a spectator, usually one who offers (often unwanted) advice or commentary. The term can be applied to any activity, but is most commonly used to describe spectators in games such as [[contract bridge]], [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|go]].

In bridge, a kibitzer simply refers to a spectator watching a player's hand; kibitzers in bridge are expected to remain silent and not impact the game.

Kibitz and kibitzer are derived from German kiebitzen, to look over a card-player's shoulder, perhaps derived from Kiebitz, a [[Lapwing]] or Pewit.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

The verb '''kibitz''' can also refer to idle chatting or side conversations.

In computer science the term is the title of a programming language&lt;ref&gt;[http://expect.sourceforge.net/example/kibitz.man.html kibitz man page from expect.sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt; released by [[NIST]], as a sub-project of the [[Expect]] programming language, that allows two users to share one shell session, taking turns typing one after another. 

There is a 1930 film called ''[[The Kibitzer]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020056/ ''The Kibitzer'' (1930)]&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the 1929 three-act comedy play by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moderntimes.com/egr/ Rico's End: A Short Biography of Edward G. Robinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Jacobs]] describes a kibitzer as someone who keeps a look-out on a street, and seeing suspicious activity, intervenes to help the victim. In this way, kibitzers help keep streets safe.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' by Jane Jacobs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kidzania Tokyo''' is a family edutainment center amusement park, in the [[LaLaport Toyosu]], [[Tokyo, Japan]] opened in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kidzania.jp/tokyo/about/e_term.html Retrieved on 2009-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the [[Kidzania]] franchise, Kidzania Tokyo is the third ever Kidzania theme park ever built, preceded by Mexico City and Monterrey, and succeeded by Kidzania Jakarta. As like other Kidzania Theme parks, the Tokyo franchise offers 70 occupations for enjoyment by children; nevertheless, it was nearly identical to any other Kidzania theme parks in the franchise. 

The park, as like other parks (excluding [[Kidzania Jakarta]]) in the franchise, aimed at children from the age of three to fourteen. Although it looks smaller than any other parks in the franchise, the occupations offered remained similar to its Mexican counterparts.

== Hours of operation ==
There have been no changes during the past few years. However, Kidzania Tokyo is occasionally closed for maintenance on weekdays. Kidzania Tokyo is open for two sessions every day, unlike Kidzania Jakarta.
*1st session: 0900-1500hrs
*2nd session: 1600-2100hrs

== Entry ==
[[File:Kidzania.JPG|thumb|Kidzania]]
As alike to any other parks in the franchise, the park provides a 50 kidzos check available for replacement with real money, and can be used at any establishment charged with a certain amount of money. You must work if you run out of Kidzos.

Contrary to any other Kidzania theme parks, Kidzania Tokyo allows pets to enter the park. However, it should be at control of visitors. The park issued a Terms And Conditions rule &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/kidzania-tokyo-replica-town-children Retrieved on 2009-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; to maintain a safe and healthy playing environment in the park. Any disruptive, offensive, vulgar, libellous or any other activities disrupting the activity at Kidzania Tokyo, will result in the expulsion of the visitor from the park.

'''Letkajenkka''', also known as '''Letkajenka''' in English and many other languages, is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[dance]].

==History of the music genre Letkajenkka/Letkis==
The popular music genre and the ensuing dance craze were at their hottest during 1963–1965. Letkajenkka is based on the idea of performing [[Jenkka]] music using non-traditional [[musical instrument|instruments]]. Traditional instruments for playing the Jenkka, a Finnish traditional [[folk dance]], are instruments such as the [[violin]] and [[accordion]]. In the early 1960s some composers thought of writing Jenkka tunes for more contemporary bands with more modern instruments, such as [[wind instruments]] (for a more swing-like Jenkka) and amplified instruments like electric guitars, basses, and drums (a more [[rock 'n' roll]] or [[boogie woogie]]-like sound). The form of the letkajenkka songs is consistent with traditional Jenkka, but where the music is distinctively Jenkka, the dance steps are not.

[[Erik Lindström]] introduced the genre with his song ''Letkajenkka''. A Swedish band called the Adventurers recorded it, and it immediately topped the charts in Finland. Later [[Jan Rohde]], a Norwegian artist, recorded a version with lyrics with the bands the Adventurers and the Wild Ones.

Half a year later [[Rauno Lehtinen]] followed with his song ''Letkis''. This has become by far the most popular of all songs in the Letkajekka genre. It was first recorded by his studio orchestra Rautalanka Oy in August 1963, but was made popular in the October of the same year by a group called Ronnie Krank's Orchestra. His chart topper has been re-recorded approximately a hundred times, and the rights to at least 60 versions of the song are owned by Swedish publisher Stig Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| accessdate = July 27, 2010 | date = 1965-04-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One well known recording of the song is by German musician [[Horst Wende|Roberto Delgado]].

For versions in other languages, Lehtinen's Letkis was renamed Letkiss, Let's Kiss, Lasst uns Küssen etc., for easier pronunciation in different languages. The name Letkis has nothing to do with kissing; the idea of kissing was introduced by non-Finnish speakers, who thought that the title of the song [[homophony|sounded like]] "kissing". In Finnish Letkis is merely short for Letkajenkka, a [[diminutive]] formed by the beginning of the word and adding "is" in the end.

Lehtinen's Letkis made the charts in many European countries, in Latin America, and even in Japan. There are numerous translations including Russian, Swedish, and Japanese. In 1965, four instrumental versions of the tune reached number one in the Netherlands simultaneously. These were by Stig Rauno, Gudrun Jankis, The Wild Ones and the Dutch Swing College Band. All four versions had the English title ''Letkiss'' rather than the original Finnish title. It remained the only Dutch number one to have originated from Finland until 2000, when [[Freestyler (song)|"Freestyler"]] by the [[Bomfunk MC's]] reached number one.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Description==
The steps of Letkajenkka are like the steps of [[Bunny Hop]], a [[novelty dance]] from the 1950s. It has been proposed that exchange students returning from the United States to Finland would have imported the steps of the Bunny Hop to Finland, as they had seen them on the TV show Bandstand. Whereas the Bunny Hop starts with a right foot lead, the Letkajenkka transformed into a dance based on the same step, but starting with a left leg lead. This can be seen from the early recordings for TV and in some movies made during the hottest craze. Also many translated lyrics include advice on the steps: "left kick, left kick, right kick, right kick, forward jump, backward jump, hop, hop, hop".

===Steps===
The people participating in the dance form a [[Conga line|Conga-like line]] (that can also be a [[circle dance|circle]]) so that everyone holds the person in front of themselves by the shoulders or the waist. The steps go as follows (everybody does the same thing):{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
# kick to the left with the left foot &amp; step back into the middle,
# kick to the left with the left foot &amp; step back into the middle,
# kick to the right with the right foot &amp; step back into the middle,
# kick to the right with the right foot &amp; step back into the middle,
# jump forwards with both feet together (for only a few inches),
# jump backwards with both feet,
# jump forwards three times with both feet,
:(repeat).

1–4 may be enhanced by bouncing with the leg opposite to the kicking side.

==International Letkajenkka songs==
The music genre became popular, and many composers around the world started writing letkis music. Examples of non-Finnish letkis music include "La Yenka" (performed by Johnny &amp; Charley Kurt, 1965), Gemelle Kessler's ''Lasciati Baciare Col Letkis'', "Leaf Fall" ({{lang-ru|Листопад}}) by [[David Tukhmanov]] and ''Ploem Ploem Jenka'' by [[:nl:Pieter Goemans]]. Lindström's Letkajenkka was translated and covered in Japanese as Retto Kisu (Jenka) / レット・キス（ジェンカ）, performed by [[Kyu Sakamoto]].

==Original Finnish songs==
In Finland, the most well-known letkajenkka songs include

==Letkajenkka in the movies==
The movie ''Jamboree66'' (Sampaguita Pictures, Philippines, 1966, directed by Luciano B. Carlos) features a scene where the song "Letkis" is being played at a club.

There are at least two Letkajenkkas by [[Mimis Plessas]] that appear in the Greek movie ''Mia Trelli, Trelli Oikogeneia'' (Crazy, crazy family) that is directed by Dinos Dimopoulos ([[:el:Ντίνος Δημόπουλος]]). There is a scene with people dancing around the pool. The steps are not strictly Jenkka, but the music is in the style of letkis. In another scene, Katerina Gogou and Alekos Tzanetakos are dancing a Letkajenkka variation as a couple to Letkis music. The choreography is John Flery's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =| first =| title =San Palio Cinema| url =http://grcinema.matia.gr/2009/02/03/%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7-%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7-%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1/comment-page-1/| accessdate =July 27, 2010| language =Greek| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20120523234237/http://grcinema.matia.gr/2009/02/03/%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7-%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7-%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1/comment-page-1/| archivedate =May 23, 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hungarian movie ''Patyolat akció'' (1965), [[Mari Törőcsik]] and Gyula Bodrogi perform letkajenkka. The dance also appears in the Polish film ''[[Małżeństwo z rozsądku]]'' from 1966 (en. ''Marriage of Convenience'').

"'''Man's Best Friend'''" is an episode from the second season of the animated American television series [[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show|''The Ren and Stimpy Show'']].  It was originally intended to air on [[Nickelodeon]] on August 22, 1992 (alongside its sister episode "Ren's Toothache"), however it was ultimately pulled before airing. It eventually aired on [[Paramount Network|TNN]] on June 23, 2003. In this episode, [[Ren and Stimpy (characters)|Ren and Stimpy]] are adopted by [[George Liquor]], who wants to make them champions.

The episode was deemed controversial for the violent scene where Ren beats George with an oar, along with tobacco references, and Nickelodeon refused to carry it in its original form, terminating series creator [[John Kricfalusi]] and his production company [[Spümcø]] from further involvement in the series at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Khatam |url=http://comics122.blogspot.com/2006/11/bill-wray.html |title=Comics Interview #122 1993: "Ren &amp; Stimpy!" |publisher=Comics122.blogspot.com |date=2006-11-29 |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
One day, George Liquor is standing outside of a pet store, watching Ren and Stimpy sleep in the window and gets the idea to adopt them as his pets. Upon arriving home, he introduces them to their new abode: a fish bowl from which the fish was rudely thrown out (and stole George's car as a result). The next day Ren and Stimpy awaken to find George Liquor dressed as a drill sergeant to train them to be proper pets. Their first lesson is house training by doing butt-push-ups on a newspaper. Ren fails, but Stimpy easily does his business while reading about mudslides. He is given a cigar-shaped dog treat as a reward. Next they are taught discipline. To learn discipline, first they have to learn to disobey. George Liquor tells them NOT to go anywhere near the couch, then instructs them to do just that so they can be punished. When he begins to become enraged by them not following his orders, Ren freaks out and collapses to the floor sobbing, and a terrified Stimpy hurls himself onto the couch as George had instructed, only to be yelled at. Stimpy is scared, thinking he is going to be punished. Instead, George compliments him for following orders and gives him another dog treat. Then George asks Ren to ask him for punishment. But George insists that Ren is too "soft" for punishment and instead gives him 20 dollars and tells him to take the car and see a movie as well. Ren points out that the fish already took the car and it looks like George is going to be enraged. Instead, he gives Ren another 20 dollars for being a smart mouth.

Lastly, he teaches them go to protect their "master". But before they learn to defend, they have to learn to attack. Wearing a padded suit, he urges the two of them to attack him. Stimpy refuses because George is his "kind and beloved master", but Ren, who is sick of George Liquor and their treatment, picks up an oar and maniacally begins beating him up with it, much to Stimpy's horror. Again, Ren expects George to be enraged. Instead, he is impressed and calls him a champion and produces cigar-shaped treats for all of them. The episode ends with the three of them dancing with the cigar-shaped treats clamped between their teeth.

==Production and controversy==
Produced from the show's second season, the story for the episode was written by the storyboard artist, [[Vincent Waller]] and series creator [[John Kricfalusi]] who also served as the episode's director and was scheduled to air on Nickelodeon in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/ren_stimpy/encycs2.html |title=The Ren And Stimpy Encyclopedia - Season 2 |publisher=Lysator.liu.se |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the channel refused to air it due to one violent scene in which Ren beats up George with an oar, as well as references to tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mangels |first=Andy |date=January 1993 |title=Hollywood Heroes |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |volume= |issue=17 |page=32 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the episode's ban, Nickelodeon fired [[John Kricfalusi]] and the rest of [[Spümcø]] in order to make the show appropriate for younger viewers according to John K. himself.&lt;ref name="awm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/when-cartoons-were-cartoony-john-kricfalusi-presents|title=Dr. Toon interviews John Kricfalusi | author=Martin Goodman |date=September 1, 2004 |accessdate=2007-05-19 |publisher=Animation World Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this also, [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio#1991–1998: Games Animation|Games Animation]] handled the show starting with its third season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Mackenzie, The Digital Fix |url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content.php?contentid=57648 |title=Film @ The Digital Fix - The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Seasons Three and a Half-ish |publisher=Film.thedigitalfix.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Billy West]], Stimpy's voice actor, replacing Kricfalusi's role as the voice of Ren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PheypE68BKc |title=Billy West Vs John Kricfalusi 1995 |publisher=YouTube |date=2016-01-05 |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Kricfalusi was hired for [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] years later, creating the short-lived ''[[Ren &amp; Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"]]'' for the Spike TV network as part of its animation block, releasing the banned episode on the channel.

The episode was released on ''Ren &amp; Stimpy'''s first and second season boxset,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite media|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-ren-stimpy-show-complete-seasons-1-2/8937665?ean=0097368776746|title=Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Complete Seasons 1 &amp; 2|date=2005|publisher=Nickelodeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a bonus feature, and was later released for ''The Lost Episodes'' DVD.

In 1968, after promoting a series of concert events in the [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] area, Lang (together with Marshall Brevetz) produced the "[[Miami Pop Festival (May 1968)|1968 Miami Pop Festival]]". It drew around 25,000 people on day one (May 18) with acts such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Arthur Brown (musician)| Arthur Brown]], and [[Blue Cheer]]. On the afternoon of the second day (May 19) it started to rain and the event ended early. 

== Woodstock Festivals 1969, 1994, 1999, 2019 ==
After he moved to [[Woodstock, NY]] and met [[Artie Kornfeld]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], the two developed the concept for a major festival event to celebrate the '60s social movements, and planned to open a recording studio in the town of Woodstock. With Kornfeld and partners [[John P. Roberts]] and [[Joel Rosenman]], Lang set into motion the [[Woodstock]] festival, which was held on [[Max Yasgur]]'s farm in [[Bethel, New York]], from August 15 to August 18, 1969.

Michael Lang was featured in many scenes of the 1970 [[Academy Award]] winning documentary film [[Woodstock (film)|''Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music'']].

Lang also produced [[Woodstock '94]] with partners Roberts, Rosenman and co-producer John Scher, and [[Woodstock '99]] with John Scher and Ossie Kilkenny.

In May 2014, Lang revealed plans for a possible 50th anniversary concert in 2019 and that he is exploring various locations.&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com Woodstock 2019 50th Anniversary Concert"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/woodstock-organizer-plotting-50th-anniversary-concert-for-2019-20140530#ixzz47DCf2m3b |title=Woodstock Organizer Plotting 50th Anniversary Concert for 2019 |date= 30 May 2014 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate= 29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Altamont Free Concert ==
Lang was not among the producers of the December 6, 1969, [[Altamont Free Concert]] which some had billed as a "Woodstock West", but was asked by the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to assist with the last-moment re-location, from [[Sears Point Raceway]] to the [[Altamont Speedway]], near [[Tracy, CA]]. The concert was initially planned for [[Golden Gate Park]], and was to feature [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]].  The City of San Francisco revoked the permits for the Golden Gate venue, ostensibly due to a [[San Francisco 49ers]] football game at [[Kezar Stadium]], located in the park, on the scheduled date.  The concert was subsequently moved to [[Sonoma Raceway|Sears Point Raceway]].  However, a dispute over film rights led to its cancellation.  Lang and Grateful Dead manager [[Rock Scully]] were then offered the Altamont Speedway – a rival to Sears Point Raceway – by owner Dick Carter. After the venue was set for the concert, Lang appeared, with his experience in moving the much larger Woodstock festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sWCRWJnTTF8C&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=Michael+Lang+Altamont&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael%20Lang%20Altamont&amp;f=false Inside History of the Grateful Dead] by Dennis McNally – Broadway (August 12, 2003) {{ISBN|0-7679-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The venue was moved on December 4 to the racetrack with the concert starting December 6.

The venue change created major technical problems, including a stage built too low and close to the fans. The [[Hells Angels]] were then hired for stage security, which resulted in numerous fights with concertgoers, as well as an on-stage altercation with members of the Jefferson Airplane, in which singer [[Marty Balin]] was struck and knocked unconscious. Audience member [[Meredith Curly Hunter, Jr.|Meredith Hunter]] was stabbed and killed when he rushed the stage with a gun while The Rolling Stones were performing. These incidents were captured on film and appear in the [[Maysles Brothers]] documentary film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]''. There were also three accidental deaths among the crowd of 300,000.

Lang is also seen in the film. He last appears on-stage, seen walking away during the Hells Angels/Jefferson Airplane scuffle on the stage.

== Just Sunshine Records ==
Lang owned and operated Just Sunshine Records, which produced and released more than 40 albums by such diverse musical artists as [[Karen Dalton (singer)|Karen Dalton]], [[Betty Davis]] and [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]].  Lang also managed several successful international recording artists, including [[Joe Cocker]], [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Willie DeVille]], [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]], and Spanish recording artists [[El Ultimo de la Fila]]. The label was active and distributed by [[Gulf &amp; Western]]'s [[Famous Music]] Group from 1971 until 1974.

== Current ==
{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}
Lang was associate producer of [[Wes Anderson]]'s 1996 film ''[[Bottle Rocket]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast imdb]&lt;/ref&gt; The Michael Lang Organization (MLO) encompasses live event production, film production and artist management. Current projects include a 50th anniversary event for the [[Lincoln Center]] featuring the French Theater company Royal Delux, a 40th anniversary event for Woodstock in summer 2009, a movie version of the cult classic novel, "[[The Master and Margarita]]" and theater projects in [[Turkey]] and [[South Korea]]. Additionally, with his partners in Woodstock Ventures, Lang is developing future projects which include a [[Broadway musical]] based on Woodstock the musical and a Woodstock lifestyle brand.

In August 2005, MLO produced a sold out  Festival event for [[Heineken]] at [[Randall's Island|Randall’s Island]] called [[AmsterJam]] which featured [[Mashup (music)|mash ups]] from artists such as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Wyclef Jean]].

{{Inline|date=June 2014}}

'''Nikita F. Balieff''' (c.1873– 3 September 1936), was a Jewish Russian [[Armenians|Armenian]] born [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]], stage performer, writer, [[impresario]], and director. He is best known as the creator and master of ceremonies of ''[[La Chauve-Souris]]'' theater group.

==Theatrical career begins in Moscow==
Balieff is believed to have been born in [[Erzurum|Erzerum, Ottoman Empire]] in 1873,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19271017,00.html ''Time Magazine'', "New Plays in Manhattan", 17 October 1927 (with  Balieff on the cover)]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/img_passlists/?name=_Balieff&amp;birth=1873&amp;arrival=1927&amp;arrival_x=5-0-0&amp;birth_x=1-0-0&amp;gender=m&amp;name_x=_1|title=Ancestry.com|last=Passenger lists for usa|first=Giving birth year 1873|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;he left for [[Moscow]] in 1906 and took a job at the [[Moscow Art Theater]] under [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. After years of only non-speaking roles, and with a desire to perform comedy rather than drama, Balieff co-created (among with [[Nikolai Tarasov]]) his own theater group in a basement near the Moscow Art Theater. He named the troupe ''[[La Chauve-Souris]]'' (French for "[[bat]]") after a bat flew up out of the basement door and landed on his hat.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Chauve-Souris enjoyed much success and popularity in Moscow, until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917. Balieff then went into exile in [[Paris]] and began presenting vaudeville shows there with other Russian [[émigré]]s. He was noticed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] theatrical producer [[Charles B. Cochran]], who brought the troupe to [[London]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

==Success in the United States==
[[File:1922 program cover for US tour of La Chauve Souris.jpg|thumb|1922 program cover for first American tour of ''[[La Chauve-Souris]]'']]
In 1922 Chauve-Souris made its first tour to [[United States|America]] through an arrangement with the producer [[Morris Gest]]. Balieff and his company toured from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[California]] for 65 consecutive weeks. Between 1922 and 1929, Balieff returned to America to tour six times, appearing on Broadway in 1922, 1923, 1925, 1927, and 1929, with one final show billed as ''New Chauve-Souris'' in 1931. His shows consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia.&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{IBDB name|id=28104|name=Nikita Balieff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most popular acts, ''[[The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers]]'', which used the [[Leon Jessel]] tune "Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten" ("The Parade of the Tin Soldiers"), referenced a story regarding [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I]]. The legend claims the Tsar left his parade grounds without issuing a "halt" order to the marching soldiers. Without one, the soldiers marched to [[Siberia]] before being remembered and ordered back. The Balieff vaudeville version with its popular tune was a mainstay in Chauve-Souris, and later became part of [[The Rockettes]] repertoire as well. ''Wooden Soldiers'' was filmed in the [[Lee De Forest|DeForest]] [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process, and premiered on 15 April 1923 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City, along with 18 other short films made by DeForest. This short film is located in the Maurice Zouary collection at the [[Library of Congress]]. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

Balieff was known for his feigned lack of [[English language|English]] on stage. His monologues and introductions were delivered in a mix of [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], and English language and slang coupled with much gesticulation. However, in private his English was better than that of his stage persona. His company toured [[Europe]] and [[South Africa]], appearing in major capital cities. He was married to Helena Komisarjevska, a member of one of his theatrical companies. In 1927 he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

In 1934 Balieff created a new Chauve-Souris production, which proved to be his last theatrical venture. The fall of that year marked his final stage appearance: [http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=10683 Continental Varieties], a [[revue]] at the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]], which featured [[Lucienne Boyer]]. He also appeared in the [[Ben Hecht]]-[[Charles MacArthur]] film, ''Once in a Blue Moon'' (1935).&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;*{{IMDb name|id=0050227|name=Nikita Balieff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and funeral==
Balieff died of a kidney ailment on 3 September 1936, aged 63, at the Park West Hospital on West 76th Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', "Nikita Balieff, 59, Stage Figure Dies", 4 September 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  His funeral was held at the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] of Christ the Savior on [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', "1,000 Attend Services for Nikita Balieff", September 8, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Russian Opera Company sang and nearly 1,000 people attended the service, including members of the Russian nobility. Balieff is buried in [[Maspeth, Queens|Mount Olivet Cemetery, Maspeth, Queens, New York]]. His caricature was drawn by [[Alex Gard]] for the famed [[Sardi's|Sardi's Restaurant]], where well-known performers often congregated during the Broadway season, and where many well-known stage actors' caricatures hang. The signed drawing is now housed in the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the [[New York Public Library|New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]].

The '''International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians''' ('''OISTAT''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) founded in 1968 in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. According to its founding name, the organization is mainly a network for theatre designers, theatre architects and theatre technicians around the world, made up of people associated with creating or studying live performances, including educators, researchers and practitioners. The organization has members from 53 countries,{{cn|date=March 2018}} in the membership categories: Centre Member, Associate Member and Individual Member.

==History==
The predecessor of the organization was the scenography section of the [[International Theatre Institute]] (ITI), founded in 1948. This institute was expected to form an international co-operation of all artistic fields and establish leading publishing and educational direction from the drama sections. The project failed, but interest in the visual elements of theatre grew.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Shortly after, in 1958, the International Association of Theatre Technicians (IATT) was formed in Paris. This association also faltered due to lack of direction, programming, organizational structure, administrative and financial provisions.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The representatives sought ITI to take up the activities again, and the ITI Secretary General [[Jean Darcante]] went to Prague in 1967 to discuss with representatives of the Czechoslovak National ITI Center, the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography, the possibility of establishing an organization with a general secretariat in Prague. Czechoslovak scenographers, including professional workers and theatre specialists from both institutions, prepared a draft program for the activity of the new organization with the Czechoslovak Ministry of Culture. Darcante travelled to Prague again in early 1968 to obtain a binding promise from the Czechoslovak official authorities and agree the final details with the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography. On 7 and 8 June 1968, the foundation committee met to establish the new International Organization of Scenographers and Theatre Technicians ({{lang-fr|Organisation Internationale des Scénographes et technicians de Théatre}}; OISTT). The founding membership consisted of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Canada, Israel, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Organizational structure==
===The World Congress===
OISTAT is composed of members in regions around the world, known as OISTAT Centres, Associate members and Individual members. As defined in the Statutes, "the directing body of OISTAT is the Congress, which is formed when the delegates of the OISTAT Centres, Associate Members and Individual Members are assembled in plenary session". Every four years, the delegates of the World Congress elect the President and the members of Executive Committee. They also decide on changes in the Statutes and other arising issues of the organization.

===Executive Committee and Governing Board ===
OISTAT affairs are coordinated by the Governing Board and its Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of eight elected members including the President, elected at the congress. The Governing Board consists of the elected chairs of the six commissions.

===Headquarters===
The Headquarters, known as the Secretariat until 2011, are the only constant office of the organization in charge of daily communications, and serve as the central network for its members and commissions. The Headquarters has moved twice since its foundation; it was in Prague from 1968-1993, in the Netherlands from 1993-2005, and since 2006 it is in Taipei, Taiwan.

===Commissions===
Six commissions lead various projects in their field of studies: 

* '''Architecture''': The Architecture commission was composed mainly of architects, theatre designers and technicians. The commission initiated the quadrennial Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC) in 1978 and the finalist designs are exhibited at the Prague Quadrennial.
* '''Education''': This commission is the main facilitator of OISTAT Scenofest and International Stage Design Students' Works Exchange (ISDSWE) in Beijing, China.
* '''Research''': The Research commission focuses on the theoretical and historical aspects of theatre [[scenography]], architecture, and technologies. The Theatre Timeline Sub-commission is a recent establishment by the commission focusing on archiving theatre technologies, recording and preservation.
* '''Performance design''': Performance Design includes four sub-commissions: Costume Design, Lighting Design, Sound Design and Space Design.
* '''Publication and communication''': This commission's recent projects include Core Strategy, World Scenography, the Digital Theatre Words and the Bibliography of Theatre Arts.
* '''Technology''': OISTAT Technology facilitates exchange of ideas in the field of theatre technology, develops research projects, and examines standards and safety issues. The commission offers technical advice and support for theatre technicians worldwide. The Theatre Invention Prize (TIP) is a competition initiated since 2011 by the commission.

==OISTAT projects ==

===Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC)===
Theatre Architecture Competition is an international ideas competition, aimed at students and emerging practitioners, which is organized every four years by the Architecture commission. The sites of the competition have been in these cities:
*1978, Paris, France 
*1983, Stockholm, Sweden
*1990, Moscow, Russia
*1999, Prague, Czech Republic
*2003, Hengelo, Netherlands
*2007, Prague, Czech Republic
*2011, Prague, Czech Republic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pq.cz/en/tac-competition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103062538/http://www.pq.cz/en/tac-competition.html |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;
*2015, Berlin, Germany
*2017, Hsinchu, Taiwan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/6v6aqkgqnfazoqs/10th+OISTAT+Theatre+Architecture+Brief.final.+Hsinchu+City_rev.pdf?dl=0|title=10th OISTAT Theatre Architecture Brief.final. Hsinchu City_rev.pdf|website=Dropbox.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the competition theme was to design a theatre for a specific performance. The theatre can be in 'found' spaces which were not previously or presently a performing space or create a temporary installation.

In 2015, the theme was to construct a 'floating theatre' on Spree River in Berlin, Germany. The competition has moved from Prague Quadrennial to Berlin's Stage|Set|Scenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oistat.org/Item/list.asp?id=1503|title=TAC Info &amp; Schedule|website=Oistat.org|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the theme is 'Theatre as Public Space'. The aim of the competition is to challenge the conventional typology of the theatre and to focus on the design of a temporary theatre (or theatres) in The Public Activity Center, a disused sports stadium in Hsinchu City in Taiwan. The 25 selected entries of TAC 2017 were exhibited and awarded during 2017 World Stage Design on July 1–9, 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan.

===World Stage Design===
World Stage Design is an international exhibition of performance design from theatre, dance, music, and opera, as well as a showcase for cross-disciplinary performances and installations in non-conventional theatre spaces since 2005. It is held every four years on different continents, to purposely show the latest designs in theatre performances. Different from the Prague Quadrennial which presents designs curated by each country, World Stage Design allows every individual designer to submit design works directly to the curatorial panel for the grand exhibition. It has been in these cities:
*2005, Toronto, Canada
*2009, Seoul, South Korea
*2013, Cardiff, UK
*2017, Taipei, Taiwan

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">'''Pietro Mingotti''' (b [[Venice]], c1702; d [[Copenhagen]], 28 April 1759) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[impresario]] active across continental Europe. His brother, Angelo, formed an [[opera]] company in [[Prague]] around 1732, consisting of 3 male singers and 5 females; Pietro quickly followed suit, and the two troupes achieved Europe-wide success (though mostly in German and Austrian cities), sometimes performing together. Pietro's company, the more high-profile of the two, at times included [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Giuseppe Sarti]] as members. Most of the works performed belonged to the genre of ''[[opera seria]]'', though ''[[opere buffe]]'' were also given.

After performances at the coronation of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz I]] at Frankfurt ([[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]'s husband) in 1745, and at a royal wedding at Dresden in 1747 (when Gluck's ''[[Le nozze d'Ercole e d'Ebe]]'', with the composer conducting, was performed), Mingotti's troupe were invited to [[Copenhagen]] by [[Louise of Great Britain|Queen Louise]] in the same year. The company's repertory for the Danish court included not only operas but also [[ballet]]s. Sarti joined the troupe in December 1752 as music director after Gluck left during 1750. Severe financial difficulties forced Pietro to end his contract with the court at Copenhagen in 1755, and he died impoverished 4 years later in the Danish capital. Little is known of Angelo Mingotti's later career; from 1743 till 1751 the [[Oper am Gänsemarkt]] was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian opera's.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, H.J. &amp; D. Schröder (1995) Die Hamburger Gänsemarkt-Oper, p. 502-507. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an [[anti-abortion]] organization named the [[Center for Medical Progress]] (CMP) released several videos that had been [[Hidden camera|secretly recorded]]. Members of the CMP posed as representatives of a [[biotechnology]] company in order to gain access to both meetings with abortion providers and abortion facilities. The videos showed how abortion providers made fetal [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] available to researchers, although no problems were found with the legality of the process. &lt;section begin="lead" /&gt;All of the videos were found to be altered, according to analysis by [[Fusion GPS]] and its co-founder [[Glenn R. Simpson]], a former investigative reporter for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. The CMP disputed this finding, attributing the alterations to the editing out of "bathroom breaks and waiting periods." CMP continues to allege that the videos provide evidence that abortion providers profit from the sale of donated tissue. The videos attracted widespread media coverage, and after the release of the first video, conservative [[United States Congress|Congressional]] lawmakers singled out [[Planned Parenthood]] and began to push bills that would strip the organization of federal [[family planning]] funding. No such attempts by Congress to cut federal family planning money from Planned Parenthood have become law. Conservative politicians in several states have also used this as an opportunity to cut or attempt to cut family planning funding at the state level.

Officials in twelve states initiated investigations into claims made by the videos, but none found Planned Parenthood clinics to have sold tissue for profit as alleged by CMP and other [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion groups]]. An investigation by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] [[House Oversight and Government Reform Committee|Oversight and Government Reform Committee]] found no evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. A [[select committee]], the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood|U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood]], was formed to further investigate Planned Parenthood. The Republican-controlled Select Investigative Panel released its final report on December 30, 2016, recommending that Planned Parenthood be defunded. The report was heavily criticized as [[Partisan (politics)|partisan]] and inaccurate by Democratic members of the committee, Planned Parenthood, and some news media.

On January 25, 2016, a Texas grand jury [[Indictment|indicted]] CMP founder [[David Daleiden]] and member Sandra Merritt, while finding no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. The charges against Daleiden and Merritt in Texas were dismissed six months later. On March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California – one for each of the people whom they had [[Legality of recording by civilians|filmed without consent]], and one for [[Conspiracy (criminal)|criminal conspiracy]] to [[Privacy laws of the United States|invade privacy]]. On June 21, 2017, all the invasion of privacy charges (but not that of conspiracy) were dismissed with [[Motion for leave|leave]] to [[Amend (motion)|amend]].&lt;!-- The tag to the left is used to end the transclusion of this lead to the Planned Parenthood main article. Do NOT put references in the lead per [[WP:CITELEAD]] or they will transclude as broken references in the Planned Parenthood article. --&gt; Soon after, the State of California re-filed amended charges.&lt;ref name="m.sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/California-files-more-charges-against-11271723.php#photo-13200872|title=California files more charges against antiabortion activists|author=|date=July 7, 2017|website=sfgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theblaze.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/07/10/california-refiles-charges-against-pro-life-filmmakers/|title=California refiles charges against pro-life filmmakers|author=|date=July 10, 2017|website=theblaze.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;section end="lead" /&gt;

==CMP's videos==
The CMP videos consisted of portions of secretly recorded, hours-long conversations between members of CMP and abortion providers. Members of CMP posed as representatives of a non-existent company called Biomax Procurement Services, presenting themselves as potential buyers of fetal tissue.&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt; CMP claims that it has "hundreds if not thousands of hours of recordings".&lt;ref name="LAT_judge_halts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Planned Parenthood Videos Were Altered, Analysis Finds"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calmes|first1=Jackie|title=Planned Parenthood Videos Were Altered, Analysis Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/us/abortion-planned-parenthood-videos.html|website=nyt.com|publisher=nyt.com|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos were made over a period of 30 months, and were released approximately once per week to increase exposure, including media coverage, and to allow the public more time to consume and react to each video.&lt;ref name="assault" /&gt; [[Americans United for Life]] began working with CMP beginning in January 2015, providing them with advice.&lt;ref name="assault" /&gt; There were widespread protests at Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) affiliates.&lt;ref name="Holley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pager" /&gt; The [[Abortion debate|debate over abortion]] was reinvigorated.&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt;

One of the videos includes an image of a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] fetus, published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in January 2014, used without the permission of the woman in the photo, and in a way that falsely suggests that the stillborn was aborted.&lt;ref name="yahoostillborn" /&gt;

===Financial aspects===
CMP claimed the videos were evidence of [[Planned Parenthood]] engaging in the illegal sale of fetal tissue.&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt; Their dummy corporation Biomax offered one clinic {{US$|1600|link=yes}} for tissue, but the affiliate declined the offer.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="more_videos" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' has characterized the offer as an attempt to "[[Entrapment|trap]] the affiliate in the act of accepting a high payment for fetal tissue".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In a less-edited version of the first video, PPFA staff repeatedly state that the organization makes no money from tissue donations, and that the $30{{ndash}}100 charge only covers [[procurement]] costs.&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt; PPFA have said they may donate fetal tissue at the request of a patient, but such tissue is never sold.&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bassett" /&gt; At one point in the video, a PPFA staffer states "nobody should be 'selling' tissue," and "that's just not the goal here."&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt;

According to several experts in the field, the money Planned Parenthood received for fetal tissue was too little to make any profit for Planned Parenthood and constituted reasonable compensation for the costs of procurement, as allowed by federal law. These experts included Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of [[Harvard University]]'s and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]'s [[biorepository]]; Jim Vaught, president of the [[International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories]] and formerly the deputy director of the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s (NCIs) [[Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research]]; and Carolyn Compton, the chief medical and science officer of [[Arizona State University]]'s National Biomarkers Development Alliance and a former director of biorepositories and biospecimen research at the NCI.&lt;ref name=factcheck /&gt;

On October 13, 2015, Planned Parenthood announced it would no longer accept reimbursement for the costs of collecting and shipping fetal tissue to research labs. Citing an "anti-abortion agenda" by some in Congress, Planned Parenthood stated the move was designed to remove a reason for politically motivated attacks.&lt;ref name="Lewin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crary" /&gt;

===Alleged variation in abortion procedures===
The CMP alleges that the videos show Planned Parenthood officials offering to make adjustments in the techniques used in abortions in order to acquire more intact fetal tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; Federal law prohibits changing from one abortion procedure to another procedure in order to obtain human tissue for medical research,&lt;ref name="altered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thomasroberts" /&gt; as well as for delivering intact fetuses.&lt;ref name="altered" /&gt; Planned Parenthood spokespeople have responded to CMP's allegations by stating that the organization follows "all laws{{snds}}period," and that accusations made in CMP's videos "are false".&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newvideo" /&gt;

===Alleged lack of consent from donors===
In the sixth video, Holly O'Donnell, a pro-life former StemExpress technician, says that she was told by her superiors to encourage women seeking abortions to sign the consent forms, and that even when women refused to sign the fetal organs and tissues were sometimes taken anyway.&lt;ref name="newvideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="6cnn" /&gt; In the unedited first video, representatives claim the donations are only made with the patient's consent.&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt; StemExpress, a supplier of [[biological specimen]]s mostly [[stem cell]]s for research, has "unequivocally" denied O'Donnell's allegation, stating that the video is "deceptively edited and falsely worded to suggest impropriety or illegality where none exists".&lt;ref name="newvideo" /&gt; Eric Ferrero, vice president of communication for the PPFA, noted that O'Donnell "has never worked for Planned Parenthood", and called her claims "false and outrageous."&lt;ref name="newvideo" /&gt;

=={{Anchor|Reception}} Aftermath==
The editorial board of ''The New York Times'' described CMP's actions as a "campaign of deception against Planned Parenthood", and wrote that the "video campaign is a dishonest attempt to make legal, voluntary and potentially lifesaving tissue donations appear nefarious and illegal". Supporters of Planned Parenthood have complained that the videos were "highly edited,"&lt;ref name="WashPostWonkblog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="probes" /&gt; although the CMP has released unedited videos along with the much shorter edited versions.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="secondvideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="looking" /&gt; Defending the release of the videos in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]] said "these revelations will have an effect on public perceptions [...] by throwing open the door to the backroom where [the developing infant ''in utero''] is destroyed".&lt;ref name="Krauthammer" /&gt;

[[Cecile Richards]], the president of Planned Parenthood, "personally [apologized] for the staff member's tone and statements", saying the videos were "unacceptable".&lt;ref name="merica" /&gt; Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of PPFA, stated: "The latest [fifth] tape has at least 20 substantial and unexplained edits. Previous tapes released by this extremist group were 'heavily edited' in order to distort what was actually said. These videos are intended to shock and deceive the public."&lt;ref name="WashPostWonkblog" /&gt; In a letter to a Congressional committee, PPFA wrote: "A group of extremists who have intimidated women and doctors for years{{nsmdns}}in their agenda to ban abortion completely{{nsmdns}}are not 'documenting' misdeeds; they are trying to create them, quite unsuccessfully."&lt;ref name="NYT4" /&gt;

In response to Planned Parenthood, CMP stated that "we look forward to showing the public more clear evidence that Planned Parenthood routinely profits from the sale of baby parts and changes the abortion procedures it uses on pregnant women in order to do so".&lt;ref name="Bassett" /&gt;

===Investigations===
Responding to the videos and to CMP's claims, three different Congressional committees, and officials in a number of states, launched investigations into Planned Parenthood's tissue collection activities.&lt;ref name="NYP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fetal" /&gt; One Congressional committee asked to interview the filmed representatives to see whether the statements made in the videos are consistent with existing federal law.&lt;ref name="digging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;

On July 30, 2015, former Indiana Governor [[Mike Pence]] announced that the state's investigation did not find any evidence of wrongdoing in Planned Parenthood's handling of fetal tissue.&lt;ref name="Indiana" /&gt;  In Massachusetts, where there is no fetal tissue and organ donation program, Attorney General [[Maura Healey]] found that aborted fetuses are disposed of properly in a report that "voiced strong support for" Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="healy" /&gt; In Florida, investigators from the Agency for Health Care Administration found on July 31, 2015 that three Planned Parenthood clinics were performing second-trimester abortions without the proper licenses, and that one clinic was failing to keep proper logs relating to fetal remains. Planned Parenthood rejected the findings.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]] announced an investigation into practices in Texas, and said that the state would "expand its investigation" after the release of the second video,&lt;ref name="secondvideo" /&gt; and Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]] announced that his office would investigate Planned Parenthood for any potential wrongdoing at its clinics in that state.&lt;ref name="secondvideo" /&gt; Investigations were also launched in Ohio, Kansas, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana, with calls for the [[U.S. Justice Department]] to investigate.&lt;ref name="tapper" /&gt;

At the local level, the [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] district attorney launched a criminal investigation in conjunction with the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] and the [[Houston Police Department]] after the fifth video was released showing a Planned Parenthood executive in that city.&lt;ref name="HoustonDA" /&gt;

Altogether, the videos prompted investigations in fifteen states, including Texas where the sting operation took place; eight other states refused to investigate their Planned Parenthood clinics, including California and Colorado where CMP sting operations also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/28/464594826/in-wake-of-videos-planned-parenthood-investigations-find-no-fetal-tissue-sales|title=Planned Parenthood Investigations Find No Fetal Tissue Sales|author=|date=|website=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California Attorney General [[Kamala D. Harris]] announced an investigation into the CMP's practice of undercover recording.&lt;ref name="LAT_judge_halts" /&gt;

Officials in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, South Dakota, and Kansas investigated and failed to find any evidence of Planned Parenthood clinics breaking any state laws concerning the collection of fetal tissues.&lt;ref name="Culp-Ressler" /&gt; The state of Pennsylvania cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="politicspa5" /&gt; In September, the Missouri Attorney General found no evidence that the state's only clinic that provides abortion services mishandled fetal tissues. The report stated, "As a result of our investigation, the Office of the Missouri Attorney General has found no evidence that (Planned Parenthood) has engaged in unlawful disposal of fetal organs and tissue."&lt;ref name = "Hauser" /&gt;

On October 8, 2015, Republican [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jason Chaffetz]] (Utah), chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], stated that the GOP investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="Bendery" /&gt;

On January 25, 2016, a Houston grand jury indicted Daleiden&lt;ref name="daleiden 2016" /&gt; and another videographer, Sandra Merritt,&lt;ref name="tennenbaum 2016" /&gt; but declined to charge Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="videographers indicted" /&gt; On July 26, 2016, the charges against Daleiden and Merritt in Texas were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/26/last-charge-dropped-against-anti-abortion-duo-behind-planned-parenthood-videos.html |title=Last charge dropped against anti-abortion duo behind Planned Parenthood videos |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Brian |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Charges-dismissed-against-Planned-Parenthood-8422998.php |title=Charges dismissed against Planned Parenthood videographers - Houston Chronicle |website=Chron.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-daleiden-sandra-merritt-planned-parenthood-videos-charges-dismissed/ |title=Charges dismissed against duo who made anti-Planned Parenthood videos |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Liebelson, "Felony Charge Against Anti-Abortion Activists Who Made Sting Videos Dismissed," July 26, 2016, ''Huffington Post'', at [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/felony-charge-david-daleiden-planned-parenthood-sting-dismissed_us_57979c78e4b01180b530616e].&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2017, however, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 [[Felony|felonies]] in the State of California – one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timescolonist.com/felony-charges-for-2-who-secretly-filmed-planned-parenthood-1.13281156&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[select committee]], the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood|U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood]], was formed to further investigate Planned Parenthood, with Congresswoman [[Marsha Blackburn]] serving as the chairman.&lt;ref name="Kane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report|url=https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Select_Investigative_Panel_Final_Report.pdf|publisher=[[United States House Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood]]|accessdate=February 27, 2017|date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, the panel voted 8–0 to recommend holding StemExpress in [[contempt of Congress]] for failure to comply with a [[subpoena]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/09/21/us/politics/ap-us-congress-fetal-tissue.html?_r=0 House Panel Holds Fetal Tissue Firm in Contempt, Dems Walk] (AP)&lt;/ref&gt; The six Democratic members of the panel walked out of the meeting in protest before the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin-nyi.thehill.com/policy/healthcare/297097-house-panel-votes-to-hold-fetal-tissue-company-in-contempt House panel votes to hold fetal tissue company in contempt] (''The Hill'')&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's final report recommended that "the National Institutes of Health be required to stop funding fetal tissue research, and that the huge health provider Planned Parenthood be stripped of U.S. funding." According to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the report contained multiple inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wadman|first1=Meredith|title=Fact-checking Congress's fetal tissue report|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/fact-checking-congress-s-fetal-tissue-report|publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|accessdate=February 27, 2017|date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic members of the panel - who had not been permitted to read, respond to, or vote on the final report - released an alternate report,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/01/planned-parenthood-witch-hunt-shuts-down-in-absurd-way.html|title=Now-Defunct Planned Parenthood 'Witch Hunt' Panel Calls for Terrifying Changes|first=Susan|last=Rinkunas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they criticized the committee for relying on "[[McCarthyism|McCarthy]]-era tactics" and of relying on "unsourced, unverified documents" in writing the report. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson described the report as "nothing more than a partisan attack on Planned Parenthood and women's access to safe and legal abortion" and noted that 13 state-level investigations and other congressional inquiries had found no wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-panel-recommends-cutting-funding-for-planned-parenthood-reigniting-old-debate/2017/01/04/3755fd78-d2b5-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html|title=House panel recommends cutting funding for Planned Parenthood, reigniting old debate|publisher=washingtonpost.com|author= Mike DeBonis|date=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post,'' ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the panel's inquiry as a "witch hunt" and criticized both its findings and tactics in editorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-planned-parenthood-witch-hunt/2016/02/20/a6cb0e5c-d660-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html|title=The Planned Parenthood witch hunt|first1=Editorial|last1=Board|date=February 20, 2016|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-fetal-tissue-20160724-snap-story.html|title=Congressional witch hunt for 'baby body part' sellers needs to end|author=The Times Editorial Board|publisher=LA Times|date=July 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Court orders===
On July 31, 2015, the [[National Abortion Federation]] sued CMP and Daleiden.&lt;ref name="probes" /&gt; A Los Angeles judge placed a temporary restraining order on the release of further videos of employees of StemExpress, one company which Planned Parenthood does business with, based on California's [[Telephone recording laws|anti-wiretapping law]].&lt;ref name="LAcourt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="court" /&gt;&lt;ref name="order" /&gt;  The order also prohibited the group from disclosing names or addresses of National Abortion Federation members, or dates and locations of future meetings.&lt;ref name="LAT_judge_halts" /&gt; The [[restraining order]] was later lifted, allowing release of more videos.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; A hearing was held on August 27, 2015.&lt;ref name="extends" /&gt;

CMP has said that it follows "all applicable laws."&lt;ref name="Bassett" /&gt; Daleiden has stated that, in the suppressed video, the "top leadership" of StemExpress "admitted that they sometimes get fully intact fetuses shipped to their laboratory from the abortion clinics that they work with and that could be ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of born-alive infants".&lt;ref name="6cnn" /&gt; StemExpress has denied Daleiden's "intact fetuses" claims:

:CMP's accusations that this conversation somehow refers to "intact fetuses", which were never mentioned at any point during the entirety of the illegally recorded conversation, are false. StemExpress has never requested, received or provided to a researcher an "intact fetus". CMP and Daleiden's claims to the contrary are unequivocally false.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;

StemExpress CEO Cate Dyer explained the discrepancy as a misuse of terms by CMP operatives:

:As anyone can see and read, the entire discussion was, in fact, about "intact livers." [...] My use of the term "intact cases" is a medical term of art that refers solely to "intact livers," as there was absolutely no mention of "intact fetuses" at any point in over two hours of illegally recorded video.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

StemExpress has severed ties with Planned Parenthood as a result of the controversy, stating that their business with Planned Parenthood was a small percentage of their activities.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;

In September 2015, two courts ruled that Daleiden and CMP must turn over private documents and submit to depositions about how they orchestrated their video sting, and could require Daleiden to turn over paperwork and details of the operation, and provide the full raw footage he collected while posing as an executive of the fictitious tissue procurement firm Biomax.&lt;ref name="politico6" /&gt; On December 4, 2015, [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] ruled on an emergency appeal from the CMP. The CMP's appeal had asked the Justice to block the lower courts' order that would require CMP to release the names of its donors. Justice Kennedy denied the appeal.&lt;ref name="Newsweek_12_5_2015" /&gt;

===Scientific impact===
In August 2015, StemExpress cut all ties with Planned Parenthood for the procurement of human fetal tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-a-partner-bails-on-planned-parenthood-20150817-column.html |title=Planned Parenthood: A terrified business partner abandons the organization |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 18, 2015 |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has had a severe impact on medical researchers. StemExpress was one of the main providers of human fetal tissue along with Advanced Biosciences Resources. According to a [[United States Congress|congressional]] [[report]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161206191756/https://selectpaneldems-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/REVISED_FINAL_2.5.2016--ENTIRE%20REPORT-2.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; research into the [[Zika]] [[virus]] has been stalled along with investigations into [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[diabetes]], and [[childhood leukemia]]. [[Science Friday]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/whats-in-a-subpoena/ |title=Science in the Crosshairs |publisher=Science Friday |date= |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; aired a segment about [[Dr.]] [[Eugene Gu]], one of the fetal tissue researchers [[subpoenaed]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7610/full/535037c.html |title=Fetal tissue: US panel risks infant and researcher lives |author1=Eugene Gu |author2=Cate Dyer |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |volume=535 |doi=10.1038/535037c |journal=Nature |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gu studies [[congenital]] [[heart]] and [[kidney]] diseases in infants but has since placed his research on hold after [[United States Marshals]] delivered the subpoena to his [[Nashville]] apartment, which is in proximity to [[Marsha Blackburn]] and [[Diane Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eugene-gu-research-congress_us_581a3d79e4b01a82df6460de |title=How House Republicans Derailed A Scientist Whose Research Could Save Lives |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=November 3, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in spite of broad support for fetal tissue research by the scientific community. ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (NEJM) published an editorial in support of Planned Parenthood's "efforts to channel fetal tissue into important medical research". The editorial argued that many medical advances would not have been made without fetal tissue research and that "Planned Parenthood, its physicians, and the researchers who do this work should be praised, not damned." The NEJM described CMP's actions as a "campaign of misinformation" and said that it is shameful that CMP "continues to twist the facts to achieve its ends". In addition, the NEJM praised Planned Parenthood's contributions to women's health care and stated that the "contraception services that Planned Parenthood delivers may be the single greatest effort to prevent the unwanted pregnancies that result in abortions".&lt;ref name="Topulos" /&gt;

===Political impact===
The videos were shown to several pro-life congresspeople, including [[Diane Black]], [[Trent Franks]], and [[Timothy F. Murphy|Tim Murphy]], weeks before being made publicly available.&lt;ref name="assault" /&gt;&lt;ref name="knew" /&gt; Black said that she was given advance screening of the videos, which "literally made [her] sick to [her] stomach" as well as "emotional and tearful", so that she would be prepared to comment on them after their release.&lt;ref name="assault" /&gt;

The timing of the first video led commentators to speculate it may have been released to coincide with a bill to raise money for [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]], which gives funding to Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="yahootiming" /&gt;  After the first video was released, [[Rand Paul]] and [[Diane Black]] introduced pre-prepared legislation to discontinue federal funding of Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="defunding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="selyukh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA_clinics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alabama" /&gt;

On July 14, 2015, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] ordered congressional hearings into the practice procuring fetal tissues and organs by Planned Parenthood, and at least one committee committed to scheduling a hearing.&lt;ref name="boehner" /&gt; [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] has said that Planned Parenthood's practices "should be looked into."&lt;ref name="wave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mitch" /&gt;

On August 3, 2015, the legislation failed to pass in the Senate with 53 supporting discontinuing funding and 46 opposed.  This was seven votes short of the 60 needed to pass the bill.&lt;ref name="Fox_votes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blocks" /&gt;

On September 18, 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 241{{ndash}}187 to defund Planned Parenthood for one year, allowing time to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. The vote is largely symbolic because the bill is not expected to pass in the Senate and President Obama has stated he would veto legislation to defund Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="Ferris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fram_blocking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chappel" /&gt;  Some have raised the issue that this kind of congressional vote could violate the United States Constitution, which prohibits [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]], which refers to lawmakers punishing an individual or organization based on alleged infractions without a finding of guilt by a court.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

On October 7, 2015, The U.S. House of Representatives created the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives led by [[Marsha Blackburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hres461/BILLS-114hres461eh.pdf |format=PDF |title=H. Res. 461 : In the House of Representatives, U. S. |date=October 7, 2015 |website=Congress.gov |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel states that its mission "is to gather information and get the facts about medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations who sell baby body parts." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energycommerce.house.gov/select-investigative-panel |title=Select Investigative Panel (114) &amp;#124; Energy and Commerce Committee |website=Energycommerce.house.gov |date= |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential campaigns====
Several [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican presidential candidates]] repeated CMP's allegations that PPFA used tissue donation as a way to profit from abortion. [[Rick Perry]] said "The video showing a Planned Parenthood employee selling the body parts of aborted children is a disturbing reminder of the organization's penchant for profiting off the tragedy of a destroyed human life",&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt; and cited the videos as the reason why Planned Parenthood should lose federal funding.&lt;ref name="hillary" /&gt; Republican presidential candidate [[Rand Paul]] posted on Twitter "...a video showing Planned Parenthood's top doctor describing how she performs late-term abortions to sell body parts for profit", vowed to campaign to defund Planned Parenthood,&lt;ref name="selyukh" /&gt; and called for Hillary Clinton to return Planned Parenthood's donations to her campaign.&lt;ref name="hillary" /&gt;

[[Carly Fiorina]] said "This latest news is tragic and outrageous. This isn't about 'choice'. It's about profiting on the death of the unborn while telling women it's about empowerment".&lt;ref name="factcheck" /&gt; {{anchor|Carly Fiorina GOP debate comment}} During the [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2016#September 16, 2015 – Simi Valley, California|September 16, 2015, GOP presidential candidates' debate]] on ''[[CNN]]'', she harshly criticized Planned Parenthood and their involvement in fetal tissue donation,&lt;ref name="CNN_transcript_9_16_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_YouTube_9_16_2015" /&gt; stating "I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain'".&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt; The website ''[[PolitiFact.com]]'', however, said the video footage Fiorina referred to was not obtained from a Planned Parenthood clinic, but was stock footage of an unrelated live fetus, obtained from the Grantham Collection, "an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure". It was then added by CMP to dramatize the description by StemExpress procurement technician Holly O'Donnell. In the edited video, O'Donnell alleged that while she was working in a pathology lab at a Planned Parenthood clinic, her supervisor told her that they would procure a brain from a well preserved fetus. O'Donnell said: "I'm sitting here looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don't know what to think."&lt;ref name="CNN_transcript_9_16_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_YouTube_9_16_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that "while the authenticity of the videos remains a subject of debate, Mrs. Fiorina appears to have exaggerated their contents",&lt;ref name="NYTVideos" /&gt; and ''[[Politifact.com|PolitiFact.com]]'' rated Fiorina's statement "mostly false".&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt;

Democratic presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]], who "staunchly defended" the organization, said that the videos were "disturbing" and called for a national investigation into the sale of aborted fetal tissue.&lt;ref name="hillary" /&gt; The [[White House]] said it would oppose any congressional attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;

===Other reactions===
[[Governor of Louisiana|Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] announced, on August 3, 2015, that the [[Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals]] was terminating its contract with [[Planned Parenthood]], which provides the organization with state Medicaid funds.&lt;ref name="jindal" /&gt; In court filings, the Justice Department argued that [[Louisiana|Louisiana's]] action violates federal law by denying Medicaid patients the choice of their healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=latimes_Jindal /&gt; Also noted, neither of the two Louisiana clinics provide abortion services.&lt;ref name=Kaufman /&gt; The states of [[Alabama]],&lt;ref name="alabama" /&gt; [[New Hampshire]],&lt;ref name="NH" /&gt; and [[Utah]]&lt;ref name="Frandsen" /&gt; also cut their respective funding to Planned Parenthood in the wake of the videos, while [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Wisconsin]] were considering similar measures.&lt;ref name="states2" /&gt; The Obama administration has warned state legislators it may be illegal to cut funding to Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="states" /&gt;

After consulting with the university's Bioethics Advisory Committee, [[Colorado State University]] president [[Anthony A. Frank|Tony Frank]] suspended the further purchase of fetal tissue for research purposes.&lt;ref name="CSU" /&gt;

===Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting===
{{main|Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting}}
On November 27, 2015, a gunman shot and killed two civilians and a police officer during a five-hour gun battle at the Colorado Springs clinic.&lt;ref name="NYT2711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn2711" /&gt; The 57-year-old gunman&lt;ref name="DP2711" /&gt; surrendered to police and was taken into custody. During his arrest, he gave a rambling interview&lt;ref name="NYT2911" /&gt; in which, at one point, he said "no more baby parts,"&lt;ref name="reuters 1129" /&gt; an apparent reference to protests against the clinic,&lt;ref name="bbc news baby parts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lowery wesley" /&gt; echoing language used in the news media about the clinic.&lt;ref name="hundreds protest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hernandez stewart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="red hot topic" /&gt; However, authorities could not clearly identify a specific motivation.&lt;ref name=NYT2911 /&gt;

U.S. Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] called the shooting a "crime against women receiving health care services".&lt;ref name="cnn 1129" /&gt; Colorado Springs Mayor [[John Suthers]] said that the shooting and standoff "certainly appears" to be an act of [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|domestic terrorism]].&lt;ref name="abc 1129" /&gt;

[[Vicki Saporta]], president of the National Abortion Federation drew particular attention to the videos, two of which were filmed at a clinic in Denver, {{Convert|75|mi|}} north of Colorado Springs; these videos resulted in a number of threats against one doctor featured in the videos, who had to move out of her home and hire 24-hour security as a result according to Saporta.&lt;ref name="wa post 1129" /&gt;

The CMP issued a statement condemning the shooting as a "barbaric killing spree" by a "violent madman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerformedicalprogress.org/2015/11/cmp-statement-on-violence-in-colorado-springs/|title=CMP Statement on Violence in Colorado Springs|author=|date=November 28, 2015|website=centerformedicalprogress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 developments==
In March 2017, [[California Attorney General]] [[Xavier Becerra]] charged Daleiden and Merritt with 15 felonies related to the videos, including one count of conspiracy to invade privacy and 14 counts of filming people without permission in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/28/david-daleiden-sandra-merritt-charged-filming-plan/?|title=David Daleiden, Sandra Merritt charged in filming at Planned Parenthood|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|date=|website=washingtontimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Daleiden issued a statement calling the charges "bogus" and pledged to release more videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-planned-parenthood-charges-activists-20170328-story.html|title=Two antiabortion activists behind undercover Planned Parenthood videos charged with 15 felonies|first=Matt|last=Hamilton|date=|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published an editorial stating that while they disagreed with the CMP's cause and methods, the filing of criminal charges by Becerra was a "disturbingly aggressive" action against people "trying to influence a contested issue of public policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-planned-parenthood-charges-20170330-story.html|title=Felony charges are a disturbing overreach for the duo behind the Planned Parenthood sting videos|first=The Times Editorial|last=Board|date=|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 2017, all the invasion of privacy charges (but not that of conspiracy) were dismissed with leave to amend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-judge-deals-setback-to-prosecutors-in-abortion-11237776.php|title=SF judge deals setback to prosecutors in abortion sting videos|author=|date=June 22, 2017|website=sfgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the State of California re-filed the charges, amended.&lt;ref name="m.sfgate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theblaze.com"/&gt;

In December 2016, Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] referred Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers to the [[Federal Bureau Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) for investigation. In the fall of 2017, the FBI made a request to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] for access to un-redacted comments obtained from abortion providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/13/planned-parenthood-docs-requested-from-senate-by-fbi-signaling-possible-criminal-probe.html|title=Planned Parenthood docs requested from Senate by FBI, signaling possible criminal probe|first=Perry|last=Chiaramonte|date=November 13, 2017|website=foxnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pre-certification video''' is any [[videotape]] (or [[laserdisc]]) issued in the UK before the introduction of the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|1984 Video Recordings Act]].

Pre-certification videos were not required by law to be submitted to the [[BBFC]] so the era was unregulated, leading to many uncut releases of videos which would have fallen foul of the BBFC's strict guidelines, and would therefore have been [[censorship|censored]] if submission to the board was a legal requirement. However, whilst many of the larger respectable companies simply issued their previously BBFC certificated [[film|cinema]] releases onto video to play safe as they feared there was bound to be a clampdown at some stage, some of the smaller independent companies decided to take advantage of the unregulated [[video rental]]s market by issuing "strong uncut" versions depicting [[graphic violence]] and [[Graphic violence|gore]]. A whole barrage of titles previously banned by the BBFC from getting a cinema release suddenly ended up uncensored on [[home video]].

What began as a bill drafted by little known [[Luton South]] Conservative [[back bencher]] [[Graham Bright]] was made law after he and the [[tabloid press]] (most notably The [[Daily Mail]]) had successfully whipped the media into a frenzied hysteria over so-called [[Video nasty|"video nasties"]]. "Ban the Sadist Videos!" was one of the more famous headlines they ran. When the bill was made law it became a legal requirement that all videotapes must be submitted to the BBFC for classification and possible cuts.

The pre-certification video era is best remembered, amongst horror fans in particular, for the ensuing "[[video nasty]]" debacle in which a selection of 72 videotapes were singled out and prosecuted by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) under Section 2 or Section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Acts|Obscene Publications Act]] (OPA). Of these, 39 titles were deemed by the courts to be obscene and it's those titles which formed the final [[Video nasty|"Video Nasties"]] list.

Video releases from this unregulated pre-certification era have become increasingly collectible items. Whilst most can be picked up cheaply on [[eBay]] and through second hand stores and [[car boot sale]]s, many titles are highly sought after. In fact some of the very hard to find titles have been known to command prices in excess of £500. There remains to this day a very dedicated pre-cert collector's market.

==Introduction of legislation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
In 1984 the UK government introduced the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]] which effectively meant that all pre-recorded videocassettes had to be officially classified by an independent body called the BBFC ([[British Board of Film Classification]]) before they could legally be released in the [[United Kingdom]]. There were some exceptions to this, such as music, educational, documentary and religious programmes providing they contained no profanity, sexual or violent content. These could be released with an Exempt status. Everything else had to be classified - and the costs of getting a cassette classified were quite high!

Before the VRA (Video Recordings Act) came into force, videos were not subject to classification, [[certification]] or [[censorship]] by any official means (although some companies chose to implement their own, and of course the [[Obscene Publications Act]] (1959) meant [[hardcore pornography]] would have been swiftly and severely dealt with (at least if it was on ready display).

The Video Recordings Act left uncertified titles in limbo, and unless a distributor acquires them and releases them with a BBFC classification all titles fall under section 9 and 10 which states:-

Section 9 Supplying video recording of unclassified work.

(1) A person who supplies or offers to supply a video recording containing a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued is guilty of an offence unless—.
(a)the supply is, or would if it took place be, an exempted supply, or.
(b)the video work is an exempted work.

(2) It is a defence to a charge of committing an offence under this section to prove that the accused believed on reasonable grounds—.
(a) that the video work concerned or, if the video recording contained more than one work to which the charge relates, each of those works was either an exempted work or a work in respect of which a classification certificate had been issued, or.
(b) that the supply was, or would if it took place be, an exempted supply by virtue of section 3(4) or (5) of this Act..
(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable—.
(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine or both,.
(b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding £20,000 or both.]

Section 10 Possession of video recording of unclassified work for the purposes of supply.
(1)Where a video recording contains a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued, a person who has the recording in his possession for the purpose of supplying it is guilty of an offence unless— 
(a) he has it in his possession for the purpose only of a supply which, if it took place, would be an exempted supply, or.
(b) the video work is an exempted work

These years, from about 1978 until the classifications finally took hold good and proper in late 1985, became known as the pre-certification years.

'''Sentai Filmworks''' is an American [[anime]] licensing company based in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], specializing in [[Anime|Japanese animation]] and film. The company was formed in 2008 by [[John Ledford]], formerly of [[A.D. Vision]].

Some of Sentai's notable licensed anime series include ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]'', ''[[K-On!]]'', ''[[Highschool of the Dead]]'', ''[[Angel Beats!]]'', ''[[Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions]]'', ''[[WataMote]]'', ''[[Akame ga Kill!]]'', ''[[Parasyte|Parasyte -the maxim-]]'', ''[[Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?]]'' and ''[[Made in Abyss]]''; as well as the films ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise]]'', ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', ''[[The Garden of Words]]'' and ''[[Children Who Chase Lost Voices]]''.

==Name==
When asked by a fan on [[Facebook]] what the reason was for calling the company "Sentai", chief executive officer [[Matt Greenfield]] responded, "It's a multi-layered pun, mostly for the benefit of the Japanese. Although Sentai can be translated as Squadron, Regiment or Flotilla, it basically means a team or group assembled with specific training and equipment for a specific purpose. Plus, Sentai was formed to help keep the anime industry alive in the U.S., so the superhero aspect is a double-play on that that Americans can get."

==History==
Beginning in 2008, Sentai had started releasing their first titles, which included ''Clannad'', ''[[Princess Resurrection]]'', ''[[Indian Summer (manga)|Indian Summer]]'', ''[[Appleseed (film)|Appleseed]]'' and ''[[Mahoromatic]]'' (formerly licensed by [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Geneon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-Season Princess Resurrection, Clannad Sets Slated|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-01-12/half-season-princess-resurrection-clannad-sets-slated|website=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their titles were initially distributed by [[A.D. Vision#ADV Films|ADV Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-10-20/adv-films-to-distribute-anime-for-sentai-filmworks|title=ADV Films to Distribute Anime for Sentai Filmworks|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=October 20, 2008|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2009, [[A.D. Vision]] had closed their doors and sold off their assets, which included transferring distribution rights to [[Section23 Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADV Films Shuts Down, Parent Transfers Assets to Other Companies|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-09-01/adv-films-shuts-down-transfers-assets-to-other-companies|website=Anime News Network|date=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunrise &amp; Tatsunoko deals===
On July 4, 2013, during their industry panel at [[Anime Expo]], Sentai Filmworks announced their plans to release a number of classic titles from [[Tatsunoko Production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Signs Deal with Tatsunoko Production|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-04/sentai-filmworks-signs-deal-with-tatsunoko-production|website=Anime News Network|date=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current list of released titles from the partnership include the original ''[[Gatchaman]]'' series and [[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman: The Movie|movie]], ''[[Time Bokan: Royal Revival]]'', and ''[[Casshan]]'', with more titles to follow.

[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] announced a licensing deal with Sentai Filmworks that included a number of titles from Sunrise’s library that were formerly licensed by [[Bandai Entertainment]] during their [[Otakon]] panel on August 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Adds Sacred Seven, Big O, Kurokami, More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/sentai-filmworks-adds-sacred-seven-big-o-kurokami-more|website=Anime News Network|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localization and dubbing===
Sentai's anime titles were initially localized and produced by [[Seraphim Digital]]. Certain titles such as ''[[Queen's Blade Rebellion]]'' and ''[[Persona 4: The Animation]]'' were produced by [[NYAV Post]] and [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]], respectively. In 2014, Sentai Filmworks had opened their in-house localization and recording facility, Sentai Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sentai Filmworks|title=Ask Sentai #18: Nozaki-kun Box Sets and Sentai Studios|url=http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/news/ask-sentai-18-nozaki-kun-box-sets-and-sentai-studios|website=SentaiFilmworks.com|publisher=Sentai Filmworks|accessdate=31 January 2016|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toonami broadcasts===
On June 1, 2015, Sentai made an announcement on their website that ''[[Akame ga Kill!]]'' has been picked up by [[Adult Swim]] for broadcast on its [[Toonami]] block, almost one week after its announcement at [[MomoCon]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sentai Filmworks|title=Akame Ga Kill!

As a result of [[Daylight Saving Time]] ending, ''[[Children Who Chase Lost Voices]]'' would air during the 1st week of the ''Intruder III'' event on November 5, 2016 at 3AM.

===Anime Strike deal===
In March 2017, Sentai signed a deal with [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] to stream the majority of their new licenses exclusively on [[Anime Strike]] in the United States and [[Amazon Video|Prime Video]] in Canada, starting with the Spring 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anime Strike Spring Season Schedule|url=https://twitter.com/i/moments/852559558870351872|website=Twitter|publisher=AnimeStrike|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIDIVE===
After the discontinuation of [[Anime Network|Anime Network Online]], HIDIVE, LLC, a new company which is not affiliated with Anime Network, Section23, or Sentai Filmworks, acquired the service's assets and spun them off into a new streaming service called HIDIVE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-06-20/hidive-anime-streaming-service-launches-with-legend-of-the-galactic-heroes/.117768|title=HIDIVE Anime Streaming Service Launches With Legend of the Galactic Heroes (Update 3)|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Anime Streaming Service, HIDIVE, Launches as Beta with Dubs, Live-Chat, and More|url=https://www.hidive.com/news/2017/6/21/new-anime-streaming-service-hidive-launches-as-beta-with-dubs-live-chat-and-more|website=Hidive|publisher=News|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former subscriptions for Anime Network Online were migrated over to HIDIVE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-06-20/anime-network-streaming-website-switches-to-cable-video-on-demand-only/.117774|title=Anime Network Streaming Website Switches to Cable, Video on Demand Only (Updated)|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIDIVE is the exclusive carrier of selected licensed titles from Sentai and Section23, including English dubs, in addition to simulcasts, live-action titles, and older series. Following the closure of [[Anime Strike]], HIDIVE began streaming titles that were previously exclusive to the former service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIDIVE Streams 4 Former Anime Strike-Exclusive Titles|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-12-27/hidive-streams-4-former-anime-strike-exclusive-titles/.125813|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIDIVE Adds Armed Girl's Machiavellism Anime|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-01-09/hidive-adds-armed-girl-machiavellism-anime/.126244|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2017, HIDIVE announced that the service will start to offer selected anime titles with Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hidive.com/news/2017/07#cbp=/news/2017/7/21/hidive-to-expand-subtitled-offerings-for-international-fans|title=HIDIVE News|website=Hidive|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2018, [[VRV (streaming service) |VRV]] announced that HIDIVE will be launching a channel on its service. HIDIVE's channel will replace that of [[Funimation]], which left the service on November 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-10-18/funimation-crunchyroll-end-content-sharing-partnership/.138330|title=Funimation, Crunchyroll End Content Sharing Partnership|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign distribution==
Sentai Filmworks does not directly release its properties in non-North American (English-speaking) markets as opposed to its predecessor, [[A.D. Vision]]. Instead it sub-licenses to other companies such as [[Manga Entertainment]], [[MVM Entertainment]], [[Anime Limited]] and Animatsu Entertainment in the United Kingdom and [[Siren Visual]], [[Madman Entertainment]], and Hanabee in Australia and New Zealand. In 2011, MVM licensed ''[[Mahoromatic: Something More Beautiful]]'' after Sentai's re-release of the series, and has done the same to ''[[Broken Blade]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MVM Licenses Broken Blade|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-02-22/mvm-licenses-broken-blade|website=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dream Eater Merry]]'', ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'' and ''[[Bodacious Space Pirates]]'' for release in the UK.

In Latin America, Sentai Filmworks sub-licenses their titles to companies like [[Crunchyroll]] and [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]]. On July 21st, 2017, Hidive distributes selected Sentai Filmworks and simulcast titles with Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hidive.com/news/2017/07#cbp=/news/2017/7/21/hidive-to-expand-subtitled-offerings-for-international-fans|title=HIDIVE News|website=Hidive|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2018, it was revealed that Sentai Filmworks holds distribution rights to the film ''[[No Game, No Life Zero]]'' that the company gave to the Mexican distributor Madness Entertainment. It was revealed that they directly commissioned a Spanish dubbed version for the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-1001641/animes-en-hidive-catlogo-completo?fpid=57374427|title=Animes en HIDIVE - Catálogo Completo|work=Crunchyroll|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15 of the same year, Sentai Filmworks announced the acquisition of the anime ''[[Alice or Alice]]'' to Spain and Portugal, making the first official announcement on Sentai's side of an anime title in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/news/sentai-filmworks-acquires-the-adorable-slice-of-life-series-alice-or-alice|title=Sentai Filmworks’ Acquires the Adorable Slice of Life Series ALICE or ALICE|work=Sentai Filmworks|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">'''Sneezing powder''' is a group of [[Powder (substance)|powders]] or powder-like substances that induce [[sneezing]] when someone is exposed to them. This is usually done as a [[Practical joke device|practical joke]] or [[prank]] to an unsuspecting victim.

Sneezing powders containing ''[[Veratrum album]]'' [[alkaloid]]s have been linked to poisoning, including [[dyspepsia|upset stomach]], [[fainting]], [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]] and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="carlier"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Carlier P, Efthymiou ML, Garnier R, Hoffelt J, Fournier E | title = Poisoning with Veratrum-containing sneezing powders | journal = Human Toxicology | year = 1983 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–325 | pmid = 6862477 | doi=10.1177/096032718300200224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are especially vulnerable.&lt;ref name="fogh"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Fogh A, Kulling P, Wickstrom E | title = Veratrum alkaloids in sneezing-powder a potential danger | journal = Journal of Toxicology.

'''Street magic''' falls into two genres; traditional street performance and [[guerrilla]] magic. 
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 051.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]: [[The Conjurer (painting)|The Conjurer]], 1475-1480]]

== Traditional street performance ==

The first definition of street magic refers to a traditional form of magic performance - that of [[busking]]. In this, the magician draws an audience from passers by and performs an entire act for them. In exchange, the magician seeks remuneration either by having a receptacle for tips available throughout the act (known in the parlance as a "trickle show"), or by offering a receptacle for tips at the end of the show. The term "passing the hat" comes from the practice of having the hat passed before the final trick is performed, as opposed to "bottling" the audience at the end of the performance.

Street magic most often consists of what has been referred to in the past as "hand" or "pocket" magic, [[sleight of hand]]. Whether [[card magic]] or magic performed with coins, balls, scarves, or rope, even occasionally [[mentalism]] (see notably: Kenny Lightfoot), regardless of the props involved, the ability to draw and hold an audience is cited by contemporary practitioners as a skill of greater importance than the illusions themselves.

The famous Indian Mango Tree is an old and venerated trick as performed by street magicians of the past and while it is demonstrably not of the hand magic variety, it exemplifies the fact that even large stage sized illusions can be presented in the street. In the trick, the magician apparently plants a mango seed, covers it with a cloth, makes mysterious incantations and, removing the cloth from time to time successively shows a tree of various heights, up to two or three feet. The same effect was achieved by the Apaches. Instead of a mango seed, a yucca seed was planted and watered. Covering the seed with a rawhide animal skin, the seed would apparently root, grow and finally flower within the span of but a few minutes.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] chronicle this form of street magic from approximately 3,000 years ago - and there are records of such [[performers]] across the continents,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} notably [[Europe]], [[Asia]]/[[South Asia]] and the [[Middle East]].  While it is a very old performing style, its history is not particularly well documented in print. In his diary, [[Samuel Pepys]] mentions seeing magicians performing in this fashion and one can see street magicians in depictions by [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[William Hogarth]], and [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]]. Book XIII of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''Discoverie of Witchcraft'' (1584) describes magic tricks of the type performed by buskers in the 16th century.

[[File:FarlaStreet1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Christian Farla performs street magic on Dutch Television]]
[[New York City|New York]] based artist and magician [[Jeff Sheridan]] is regarded as one of the pre-eminent U.S. street magicians to emerge from the surge in street performance artistry which began in the late '60s.  He authored the 1977 book, ''Street Magic'', taught [[Jeff McBride]] and allegedly was one of the performers who inspired and taught the young [[David Blaine]] after Blaine saw Sheridan perform in [[Central Park]].

More recently, other performers have garnered accolades from the magic community for their contributions to the art.  Jim Cellini (a.k.a. Richard Sullivan) has been a full-time street performer since the 1970s and has published a book (''Cellini: The Royal Touch'') and DVDs (''The Art of Street Performing, volumes 1 - 3'') on the subject.  [[Gazzo Macee]] (a.k.a. Gary Osborne) has been a full-time street performer since the 1980s and has published a booklet (''"The Art of Krowd Keeping" written for Gazzo by Danny Hustle and Jim Wells'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1= Gazzo |first2= Danny |last2= Hustle |first3= James E |last3= Wells |title= The Art of Krowd Keeping |publisher= Penguin Magic |year= 2006 |oclc= 211995463 |url= http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/1158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and DVD (''Street Cups'') on the subject.  Eric Evans has been a full-time professional since the 1990s and co-wrote -- along with Nowlin Craver -- a book on the subject (''The Secret Art of Magic'').

== Guerrilla magic ==

The second category is more appropriately called "guerrilla magic"&lt;ref name=erlandish&gt;{{cite web | url= http://erlandish.blogspot.com/2008/11/mall-based-guerrilla-magic-training.html | title= Mall-Based Guerrilla Magic Training |work= Ye Olde Magick Blogge (erlandish.blogspot.com) |date= 12 November 2008 | first= Andrew | last= Musgrave }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively recent style of performing [[Magic (illusion)|magic illusions]] where the magician performs a single trick or two in a public space (such as on a sidewalk) for an unpaying audience.  The desired effect of this "hit and run" style of magic is to give the audience a feeling that what they are seeing is [[wiktionary:impromptu|impromptu]], unrehearsed, and experimental.

This style of "street magic" is associated with [[David Blaine]] (who popularized the term) and more recently, [[Criss Angel]], [[Derren Brown]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].  The format was developed to play well on television beginning with the 1997 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television special ''David Blaine: Street Magic.'' Many magicians respect Blaine's choice of material and give him credit for creating an image of the contemporary magician distinct from other magicians in recent television history, such as [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] or [[Doug Henning]].  However, magic historians, such as [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] note that "guerrilla magic" is primarily associated with only a few individuals who perform on television and certain magic dealers that sell effects to amateur magicians who watch these programs.&lt;ref name="swiss"&gt;[http://www.antinomymagic.com/swiss.htm In Search of Street Magic]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eugene Burger]] opined to Jamy Ian Swiss "On one level it's the ultimate trivialization of magic: accosting strangers on the street."&lt;ref name="swiss"/&gt;

'''Tap dance''' makes frequent use of [[syncopation]]. [[Tap dance]]  [[choreographies]] typically start on the eighth [[Beat (music)|beat]], or between the eighth and the first count.

==Styles==
Tap was formed from other types of dancing, such as ballet, jazz and contemporary clogging.
Hoofers  are tap dancers who dance only with their feet, making a louder, more grounded sound.  This kind of tap dancing is also called "rhythm tap".

Another aspect of tap dancing is [[improvisation]].  This can either be done with [[music]] and follow the beats provided or without musical accompaniment, otherwise known as a cappella dancing.

==Steps==
There is no universal terminology for tap techniques and steps. The following includes descriptions of steps that are well known, although the names may vary.

[[File:Tap Dance Technique.webm|thumb|Tap Dance Technique]]

===Steps with one sound===
* '''toe''': tap the ball or pad of the foot against the floor, use your ankle not your whole leg.
* '''heel tap''': strike the heel of the foot on the floor and release it immediately.  
* '''step''': place the ball of the foot on the floor with a change of weight.
* '''touch''': place the ball of the foot on the floor without change of weight.
* '''stamp''': place the flat foot on the floor with a change of weight. Foot stays on floor.
* '''stomp''': place the flat foot on the floor, lift foot off floor (no change of weight).
* '''(heel) dig''': place the heel on the floor, keeping the ball off the floor (with or without change of weight). 
* '''heel (drop)''': standing on the balls of one or both feet, "drop" the heel on the floor, with or without change of weight.
* '''ball (drop)''':standing on the heels of one or both feet, "drop" the ball on the floor, with or without change of weight.
* '''toe''': hit the floor with the tip of the foot, usually behind the other foot, without change of weight.
* '''toe stand''': stand on one or both tips of the feet. This requires fairly stiff tap shoes.
* '''hop''': standing on one foot, jump up and land on the same foot.
* '''leap''': standing on one foot, jump up and land on the other foot.
* '''jump''': standing on one or both feet, jump up and land on both feet.
* '''brush''': standing on one leg sweep the opposite leg forward or backward from the hip striking the ball of the foot. (Backward aka "spank")
* '''scuff''': as a brush, but striking the floor with the heel instead of the ball of the foot,

===Steps with two sounds===
* '''ball heel''': strike the ball of the foot on the floor and drop your heel.
* '''shuffle''': combine two brushes, one forward and one backward. A faster shuffle can be achieved by making smaller movements that are closer to the body.  There are actually many different ways to perform a shuffle.  '''Broadway-style shuffles''' use knee movement to swing the foot into a shuffle.  Hoofers generally execute a shuffle from movement in the upper leg and hip. While a faster shuffle may seem to come from the ankle, it is actually much easier to get speed and clarity from the hip, which is why this method is preferred.
* '''scuffle''' or '''paddle''': combine a scuff with a backward brush.
* '''flap''': brush forward and a step (which is striking the ball of the foot on the floor with a change of weight; similar to a walking step, only done on the ball of the foot—the heel does not touch the floor).  The flap is often counted as "&amp; 1."  It is similar to the shuffle, but instead of brushing the ball back after the brush forward, the dancer steps (i.e. brush step instead of brush brush, as in a shuffle).
* '''slap''': brush forward and a touch, similar to the flap but without change of weight.
* '''pickup''': placing the heel of the foot on the ground and slapping the ball of the foot where the heel was in a picking up motion.
* '''pullback''': standing on the balls of one or both feet, jump up, hitting the ground with the ball(s) of the foot/feet, and land on the same foot (or again both feet), slapping your feet while in the air and landing on the foot/feet. Notable variations are single pullback, double pullback, alternating pullback, and other variations including other steps. 
* '''riff''': standing on one leg, swing the other leg to the front, first hitting the ground with the ball of the foot, then with the heel.
* '''ball change''': two steps on alternating feet. The first step does not get full weight.

===Steps with three sounds===
* '''riffle''': a riff combined with a backward brush.
* '''ripple''': using only the toe tap of one foot, striking with the outer edge of the tap, followed by the inner edge, followed by the ball of the foot. 
* '''slurp''': one foot is placed on the floor with or without weight, first hitting with the ball, then with the heel, then again with the ball. This step is usually very fast with precision.
* '''shuffle-hop-step''': a shuffle connected with a hop and a step on the foot that had brushed in the beginning.
* '''three beat shuffle''':the same movement as a two beat shuffle except with a heel

===Steps with four sounds===
* '''Cramp roll''': Steps and heel drops can be combined to make a '''cramp roll''' which produces a rolling sound like a horse [[Horse gait|gallop]] or a drum roll.  It is performed by doing two steps (right then left or vice versa), followed by two heel drops (right then left or vice versa), releasing the first heel immediately upon completion.  In other words, it is performed as "ball (R) ball (L) heel (R) heel (L)" and is often counted as "1 and a 2."  It may be preceded by a brush (counted as "&amp; 1 &amp; a 2" and known as a flap cramp roll or 5-cramp roll) or done double time, known as a "bite cramproll" and counted as "a &amp; a 1."   
* '''paradiddle''': a scuffle, followed by step heel, all on the same foot.
* '''riff walk''': a riff, followed by a dig-ball on the same  foot. Can be extended to a 5-sound riff walk by inserting a heel on the other foot between the riff and the dig-ball.
* '''Four beat shuffle''': a shuffle with four beats, with relaxed movement of the foot.
* '''Irish''': Named for its resemblance to Irish jigs.  A shuffle followed by a hop on the standing foot, then the working foot crosses either in front or in back.
All tap dancing steps are a combination of simple movements that build upon each other.  Most movements, simple and complex, include "taps", "drops", "brushes" (including shuffles and flaps), and "steps".  For example, "shuffle ball change" is a shuffle followed by a [[ball change]]. Tap dancing steps may be learned and mastered by children and adults alike and are a good way to express/learn rhythm, dance, and percussion.

The '''tetractys''' ({{lang-el|τετρακτύς}}), or '''tetrad''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=24vBaQDNy8UC|title=The Theosophical Glossary|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''tetractys of the decad'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=36|author=[[Eduard Zeller]]|title=Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[triangular number|triangular figure]] consisting of ten points arranged in four rows: one, two, three, and four points in each row, which is the geometrical representation of the fourth [[triangular number]]. As a [[mysticism|mystical]] symbol, it was very important to the secret worship of [[Pythagoreanism]]. There were four seasons, and the number was also associated with planetary motions and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DQpSA4CEnIwC| title = Pythagoras: pioneering mathematician and musical theorist of Ancient Greece| author = Dimitra Karamanides| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group|year= 2005 |pages=65–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pythagorean symbol==

# The first four numbers symbolize the ''[[musica universalis]]'' and the [[Cosmos]] as: 
## (1) Unity ([[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])
## (2) [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] – Power – Limit/Unlimited (peras/[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]])
## (3) Harmony (Triad)
## (4) Kosmos (Tetrad).&lt;ref&gt;''The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library'' by [[Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The four rows add up to ten, which was unity of a higher order (The Dekad).
# The Tetractys symbolizes the [[classical element|four classical elements]]—[[fire]], [[air]], [[water]], and [[earth]].
# The Tetractys represented the organization of [[space]]:
## the first row represented zero [[dimension]]s (a [[Point (geometry)|point]])
## the second row represented one dimension (a [[Line (geometry)|line]] of two points)
## the third row represented [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|two dimensions]] (a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] defined by a [[triangle]] of three points)
## the fourth row represented [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three dimensions]] (a [[tetrahedron]] defined by four points)

A [[prayer]] of the Pythagoreans shows the importance of the Tetractys (sometimes called the "Mystic Tetrad"), as the prayer was addressed to it.
{{quote|Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men! O holy, holy Tetractys, thou that containest the root and source of the eternally flowing creation! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-comprising, all-bounding, the first-born, the never-swerving, the never-tiring holy ten, the keyholder of all.&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, Tobias ([1930], 2005) Number. The Language of Science. p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a portion of the secret religion, [[Initiation|initiates]] were required to swear a secret oath by the Tetractys. They then served as novices for a period of silence lasting five years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The Pythagorean oath also mentioned the Tetractys:
:By that pure, holy, four lettered name on high,
:nature's eternal fountain and supply,
:the parent of all souls that living be,
:by him, with faith find oath, I swear to thee."

It is said&lt;ref&gt;[[Introduction to Arithmetic]] – [[Nicomachus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-1o3tUGcXMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=tetraktys+diatessaron&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R6YTUZrMAYXB0gWy_YCQDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tetraktys%20diatessaron&amp;f=false|title=The Musical Order of the World: Kepler, Hesse, Hindemith-Siglind Bruhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=musica-cn&amp;highlight=pythagorean%2Cpythagoras|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities(1890) – William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G.

That is, Pythagorean scales are generated from combining pure fourths (in a 4:3 relation), pure fifths (in a 3:2 relation), and the simple ratios of the unison [[unison|1:1]] and the octave [[octave|2:1]].  Note that the [[diapason (interval)|diapason]], 2:1 (octave), and the diapason plus diapente, 3:1 (compound fifth or perfect twelfth), are consonant intervals according to the tetractys of the decad, but that the diapason plus diatessaron, 8:3 (compound fourth or perfect eleventh), is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0386%3Asection%3D14|title=Plutarch, De animae procreatione in Timaeo – Goodwin, Ed.(lang.:English)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehDG5mGUYAMC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=tetraktys+diatessaron&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R6YTUZrMAYXB0gWy_YCQDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tetraktys%20diatessaron&amp;f=false|title=Sacred Architecture of London – Nigel Pennick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Tetractys [also known as the decad] is an [[equilateral triangle]] formed from the sequence of the first ten numbers aligned in four rows.

==Kabbalist symbol==
[[Image:Boehme-heart.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol by early 17th-century Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], including a tetractys of flaming Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton.]]
[[Image:Tetragrammaton-Tetractys.png|thumb|A tetractys of the letters of the Tetragrammaton adds up to 72 by [[gematria]].]]
There are some {{who?|date=April 2018}} who believe that the tetractys and its mysteries influenced the early [[Kabbalah]]. A Hebrew tetractys has the letters of the [[Tetragrammaton]] inscribed on the ten positions of the tetractys, from right to left. It has been argued that the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Kabbalistic Tree of Life]], with its ten spheres of emanation, is in some way connected to the tetractys, but its form is not that of a triangle. The occultist [[Dion Fortune]] writes: 
:The [[Point (geometry)|point]] is assigned to [[Keter|Kether]]; 
:the [[Line (geometry)|line]] to [[Chokhmah|Chokmah]];
:the two-dimensional [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]]; 
:consequently the three-dimensional [[Solid geometry|solid]] naturally falls to [[Chesed]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Qabalah, Dion Fortune, Chapter XVIII, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between geometrical shapes  and the first four [[Sephirot]] is analogous to the geometrical correlations in Tetraktys, shown above under &lt;span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Pythagorean Symbol&lt;/span&gt;, and unveils the relevance of the Tree of Life with the Tetraktys.

==Tarot card reading arrangement==
In a [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|Tarot reading]], the various positions of the tetractys provide a representation for forecasting future events by signifying according to various occult disciplines, such as Alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/PT/D-tet.html|title=Tetractys Spread|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is only a single variation for interpretation.

The first row of a single position represents the Premise of the reading, forming a foundation for understanding all the other cards.

The second row of two positions represents the cosmos and the individual and their relationship.
* The Light Card to the right represents the influence of the cosmos leading the individual to an action.
* The Dark Card to the left represents the reaction of the cosmos to the actions of the individual.

The third row of three positions represents three kinds of decisions an individual must make.
* The Creator Card is rightmost, representing new decisions and directions that may be made.
* The Sustainer Card is in the middle, representing decisions to keep balance, and things that should not change.
* The Destroyer Card is leftmost, representing old decisions and directions that should not be continued.

The fourth row of four positions represents the four Greek elements.
* The Fire card is rightmost, representing dynamic creative force, ambitions, and personal [[will (philosophy)|will]].
* The Water card is to the right middle, representing the [[emotion]]s, feelings, and whims.
* The Air card is to the left middle, representing the mind, [[thought]]s, and strategies toward goals.
* The Earth card is leftmost, representing physical [[reality|realities]] of day to day living.

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Template-Metropolitan Archbishop.svg|thumb|100px|right|[[Coat of arms]] of an [[archbishop]] of the [[Catholic Church]]]]
The tetractys occurs (generally coincidentally) in the following:
* the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|baryon decuplet]]
* an [[archbishop]]'s [[coat of arms]]
* the arrangement of pins in [[ten-pin bowling]]
* a [[Chinese checkers]] board
* the [[Formation_(association_football)#4–3–2–1 (the "Christmas Tree" formation)|"Christmas Tree" formation]] in [[association football]]

==In poetry==
In English-language poetry, a tetractys is a syllable-counting form with five lines.  The first line has one syllable, the second has two syllables, the third line has three syllables, the fourth line has four syllables, and the fifth line has ten syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.volecentral.co.uk/vf/englishsyllable.htm#Tetractys|title=English Syllable Counters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sample tetractys would look like this:

:''&lt;span style="font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold;"&gt;Mantrum&lt;/span&gt;
:''Your /
:''fury /
:''confuses /
:''us all greatly. /
:''Volatile, big-bodied tots are selfish.  //''

The tetractys was created by Ray Stebbing, who said the following about his newly created form:

:''"The tetractys could be Britain's answer to the haiku. Its challenge is to express a complete thought, profound or comic, witty or wise, within the narrow compass of twenty syllables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bensonofjohn.co.uk/poetry/formssearch.php?searchbox=Tetractys Search result for Tetractys]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Buzz''''', stylized as '''''The Buzz 15''''', and formerly known as '''''Buzz Ng Bayan''''', is a weekly entertainment news and talk show in the [[Philippines]]. It premiered on June 13, 1999, and was the [[List of longest-running Philippine television series|second longest-running]] weekly entertainment news and talk show in Philippine television after [[GMA Network]]'s ''[[Startalk (Philippine television show)|Startalk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/65838/showbiz/rp-s-longest-running-television-shows | title=RP's longest running television shows | publisher=''[[GMA News]]'' | date=October 25, 2007 | accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured local celebrity gossip and news.

''The Buzz'' viewers were surprised when the show got cancelled with its official final episode on April 5, 2015, in order to give way for ''Kapamilya Blockbusters'' since April 12, 2015.

==History==
===''The Buzz'' (1999–2013)===
[[File:The Buzz (ABS-CBN talk show - logo).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Buzz'' logo used from 2012 to 2013.]]
''The Buzz'' premiered on June 13, 1999, as it replaced the popular sunday afternoon Showbiz-oriented talk show (run for seven years) ''[[Showbiz Lingo]]'', and was originally hosted solely by [[Boy Abunda]]. The show's original format was similar to ABS-CBN's ''[[The Correspondents (TV series)|The Correspondents]]'' were Abunda interacts with a group of showbiz field reporters dishing out the latest showbiz news. Showbiz columnist [[Ricky Lo]] and [[John Lapus]] were the first co-hosts of the show, along with [[Tim Yap]] and Dolly Anne Carvajal as reporters.

The format was later on discarded when the network took in [[Kris Aquino]] during the show's second season on January 9, 2000. Aquino's inclusion in the show served as a reunion of sorts between her and Abunda, when they used to host ''[[Startalk (Philippine television show)|Startalk]]'' on [[GMA Network]]. The show became an interesting gabfest with Aquino and Abunda dishing out the latest exclusives with the help of its reliable staff. Actress and model [[Angelica Jones]] and columnist Pat-P Daza-Planas were introduced as the new segment presenters after the departure of Yap and Carvajal from the show. Jones left the show a year later, and was replaced by reporter and blogger JV Villar in 2002, but later left after a few months. This was also the same year where Pat-P decided to leave due to commitments with her family and pursuing other ventures.

In 2003, the duo welcomed [[Cristy Fermin]] as an additional host, who used to headline the network's Saturday talk show ''[[S2: Showbiz Sabado]]'' and its predecessor ''[[Showbiz Lingo]]''. Her opinions and commentaries made the show wider and more noticeable. This was also the same year where one of its original hosts, Lo, left to transfer to [[GMA Network]].

[[Phoemela Barranda]], who was then working at ABS-CBN's flagship newscast ''[[TV Patrol|TV Patrol World]]'' as the anchor of ''Star Patrol'', joined the show to headline the teasers before it actually starts in 2004. In 2005, one of its pioneer hosts, Lapus, left the show after his contract in ABS-CBN expired and was given a hosting stint to [[GMA Network|GMA]]'s ''[[S-Files]]''. The show welcomed actress [[Anne Curtis]] to host the new segment ''Wanna Buzz'', but was later discarded a year later into ''Pinoy Big Brother Buzz'' (following the debut of the Philippine franchise of Big Brother), where she was joined by gossip reporter [[AJ Dee]] and comedians Chokoleit and [[Pokwang]], but it did not do well, so the network decided to shelve the segment.

Jobert Sucaldito served as the replacement of Lapus in 2006. This year also presented ''Buzz Express'', wherein other showbiz-related news were presented within a time span of 1–2 minutes. It was voice-overed by Roxy Liquigan and Eric John Salut, both staff of the show.

On March 11, 2007, Ruffa Gutierrez became the temporary replacement for Aquino who left the show to focus on her pregnancy and her family.&lt;ref name="Kris quits"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2013/01/21/899241/why-kris-still-best-host-tv | title=Why Kris is still the best host on TV | publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]'' | date=January 21, 2013 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | author=Bibsy M.

In October 15, 2008, Cristy Fermin was suspended by the network after she rattled off a series of accusations against former actress Nadia Montenegro in an episode aired on October 5, 2008. According to a statement released by the network, "It was deemed that Ms. Fermin did not conduct herself with due regard to social conventions and public morals. Her statements went beyond the bounds of decency as they involved innocent children who were not party to their personal dispute. Ms. Fermin's statements violated the highest standards of professionalism and journalistic integrity. The act committed by Ms. Fermin brought her and ''The Buzz'' to public disrepute, jeopardizing the name and goodwill of both the show and the network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20081015-166569/Cristy-Fermin-suspended-for-two-months | title=Cristy Fermin suspended for two months | publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' | date=October 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/controversies/17184/Embattled-Cristy-Fermin-faces-question-of-credibility- | title=Embattled Cristy Fermin faces question of credibility | publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' | date=October 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | author=Jaja Rodriguez}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2008, [[Ai-Ai de las Alas]] served as a substitute host for Cristy Fermin, who was suspended by the network for two months, until Aquino returned to the show on October 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/19604/Ai-Ai-delas-Alas-wants-to-make-peace-with-James-Yap | title=Ai-Ai delas Alas wants to make peace with James Yap | publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' | date=October 21, 2008 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | author=Glen P. Sibonga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Ruffa Gutierrez left the show after signing an exclusive contract to [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/15/10/ruffa-gutierrez-no-goodbyes | title=Ruffa Gutierrez: No goodbyes | publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News]]'' | date=March 15, 2010 | accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KC Concepcion]] later replaced her on April 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/25221/KC-Concepcion-accepts--The-Buzz-hosting-job | title=KC Concepcion accepts The Buzz hosting job | publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' | date=April 6, 2010 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | author=Trisha Alvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2010, Aquino left the show after being an on-and-off host of the show for ten years. She decided to leave the show for the reason of that she wanted to spend time with her family and for her not to cause any trouble while her brother, [[Benigno S. Aquino III]], is still in office as the [[President of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/26023/Kris-Aquino-says-goodbye-to--The-Buzz- | title=Kris Aquino says goodbye to The Buzz | publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' | date=June 28, 2010 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | author=Glen P.

After Aquino's departure, [[Charlene Gonzales]] and [[Toni Gonzaga]] replaced her as hosts on July 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spot.ph/the-feed/46071/charlene-gonzales-and-toni-gonzaga-replace-kris-aquino-on-emthe-buzzem | title=Charlene Gonzales and Toni Gonzaga replace Kris Aquino on The Buzz | publisher=''[[Spot.PH]]'' | date=July 12, 2010 | accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 2012, KC Concepcion left the show in order to focus as the ''[[The X Factor Philippines|X Factor Philippines]]''{{'}} host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/news/32513/kc-concepcion-leaves-the-buzz-excited-to-host-x-factor | title=KC Concepcion leaves The Buzz; excited to host X Factor | publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=May 16, 2014 | author=Rose Garcia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2013, Gonzaga and Gonzales bid farewell to the show. With the two hosts departure, Abunda hinted that the program will be undergoing changes. Abunda said, "Sa inyong walang patid na pagsubaybay, sa inyong walang sawang pagsuporta at sa patuloy naming pagbibigay serbisyo, kasama kayo sa isang panibagong simula. Kasali kayo sa pagbubukas ng isang bagong kabanata, mas malawak, mas malaki. Pakikinggan, paguusapan at pakikialaman. Ito ang pagbabagong kakapitan, pagbabagong tatatak sa puso at isipan.

Serato}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also marked the return of the segment P.O.V., wherein their first topic was about the concept of linked showbiz couples. After its pilot aired, most viewers applauded the show for its reformat and hoping for more episodes to come with this new and fresher look to show.

===Cancellation===
On April 5, 2015, ''The Buzz'' had their last show on an Easter Sunday. Boy Abunda delivered the final farewell on behalf of the co-hosts and staff, following the VTR that detailed the show's history and controversies that the hosts dealt with. Abunda cited changes through the years pertaining to how technology has changed the world, how it's changed the way we communicate, how it's changed the media, and how the news is delivered. But he assured three points in his farewell speech; "they will be back", "showbiz news is here to stay", and "the talk show genre is here to stay".

'''Yut Nori''', also known as '''Yunnori''', '''Nyout''', and '''Yoot''', is a [[Traditional games of Korea|traditional]] [[board game]] played in [[Korea]], especially during [[Korean New Year]]. The game is also called ''cheok-sa'' or ''sa-hee''. The combining-form ''-nori'' means 'game'.

Although the origins of this popular family game are unclear, some research suggests that yut was played as early as the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] (57 BCE – 668 CE). The ''[[Taiping Imperial Reader]]'' states that people of [[Baekje]] played a board game similar to [[Po Yut]],&lt;ref&gt;Yi I-Hwa/Lee E-Wha, transl. Park Ju-Hee, Korea's Pastimes and Customs: A Social History (Homa &amp; Sekey Books, 2005) p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to be similar to [[Pachisi]], a board game originating in India.&lt;ref&gt;김광언 (2001). 민속놀이 ''Minsoknori''. 대원사 Daewonsa. {{ISBN|978-89-369-0244-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200901210149&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a folk explanation for the game, describing a bet by some villagers to raise five different kind of livestock: [[pig]]s, [[dog]]s, [[sheep]], [[cow]]s and [[horse]]s. Each of the villagers would raise only one type.

The board and the game are known to have been used in [[I Ching divination|casting hexagrams]], particularly in mountain-areas and small farming-villages, but this is no longer practiced.

==Equipment==
The board (''mal-pan'', 말판) is normally made of stitched cloth. The modern board is a rectangular shape, but historically there was also a round variation.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Sang-hoon "Yut playing, a traditional four-stick game" {{cite web|url=http://www.prkorea.com/engnews/index.cgi?action%3Ddetail%26number%3D398%26thread%3D10r01 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605181750/http://prkorea.com/engnews/index.cgi?action=detail&amp;number=398&amp;thread=10r01 |archivedate=June 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four straight courses and two diagonal ones. Each of the straight courses comes with five stations, the diagonal ones have five stations, too, but one is shared. This brings the number of stations to twenty-nine in total. The board is also known to sometimes be drawn onto the floor.

Instead of [[dice]], yut-sticks are used. (These are similar to those used in the Egyptian board game [[Senet]].) There are two kinds of yut-stick: ''jang-jak yut'' (장작 윷) and ''bam yut'' (밤 윷). Jang-jak yut are made of firewood. There are four sticks of about 15&amp;nbsp;cm in length and from 2&amp;nbsp;cm to 3&amp;nbsp;cm. in diameter. These sticks are split into halves. Chestnut-wood is most commonly used, but birch-wood is also common. These woods are chosen for their weight and the fresh sound they make when playing. Bam yut, on the other hand, are wooden sticks of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm in length. They have a diameter of about 1&amp;nbsp;cm, and also are split into halves. The bam yut are played in a small bowl, shaken in the palm, and then released.

There are small tokens (marks) used for the game, called ''mal'' (말, literally a "horse"). There are four tokens for each team, although there are no common rules what a token can be made of. The only rule is that the mals of the opponent teams must be clearly distinguishable. Apart from black and white plastic tokens generally found today, common mals are coins, buttons, small pebbles, or even chess beads (both from Western [[chess]] and [[Korean chess]]). When choosing the mal, some Koreans consider its ''speed'', because the faster a ''horse'' runs, the better it is thought to run.

===Yut sticks===
{{multiple image |total_width=430

 |image2=Yunnori en.svg |width2=690 |height2=370 |caption2=Scoring: The number of points followed by a schematic representation of the sticks, as well as the name of the particular throw
}}
The sticks are cast to determine how far a token can advance. The score is determined by counting the sticks that are over, and those that are up. Each combination has a name. One stick over (flat side up) and three sticks up (round side up) is called "do". Two sticks up and two sticks over is called "gae" (dog). One stick up and three sticks over is called "geol". All sticks over is called "yut", whereas all sticks up is called "mo". A "do" is worth one space advancement, a "gae" is worth two space advancement, a "geol" is worth 3 space advancement, "yut" is worth 4 space advancement, and "mo" is worth 5 space advancement. When the sticks come to the result of either "yut" or "mo", the player has another chance of throwing the sticks up again (optional- some people prefer not to play with this rule). If you get "yut" or "mo" consecutively, you play (throw) again.

==Game rules==
The game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate discussing the strategy.

The start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.

Each team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast.  However, a player achieving a ''yut'' or ''mo'' earns an extra cast for the turn; if he/she casts a ''yut'' or ''mo'' at the second cast, he/she earns an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided he or she keeps casting ''yuts'' or ''mos''. The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves&amp;mdash;for example, a ''geol'' (advance three steps) cannot be split into a ''do'' (one step) and a ''gae'' (two steps).

[[Image:Yut board.svg|thumb|The four possible courses of the game of Yut]]

As long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.&amp;nbsp; However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.

For example, if one casts two ''yuts'' and one ''do'' at his/her first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see ''The Stations'' below for the station names):

*Put a mal on the board at the ''yut'' station (uses the first ''yut'' score); advance to ''mo'' (uses the ''do'' score), then to ''sok-yut'' (uses the second ''yut'').
*Put a mal on the board at the ''yut'' station (uses first ''yut'' score); put another mal on the board at the same ''yut'' station (uses the second ''yut'' score), causing the two mals to move together from then on; advance them to ''mo'' (uses the ''do'').
*Put a mal on the board at the ''yut'' station (uses the first ''yut''); advance to ''duet-geol'' (uses the second ''yut''), then to ''duet-yut'' (uses the ''do'').

The game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (''cham-meoki''). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going "beyond" this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins.

===Special rules===
The game is sometimes enhanced by labeling one, two, or three of the yut stick on their flat side. The ''Seoul'' rule can be played if one of the sticks is labelled ''[[Seoul]]'' (서울). If this stick is the only one facing down (''do'' so that the letters ''Seoul'' can be read), a mal can be placed directly into the centre (''bang''), which in this case is called ''Seoul''. If all the mals are already on the course, this counts as a ''do''. The ''Busan'' rule is similar. One of the yut sticks is labelled ''[[Busan]]'' (부산). Rather than to the centre, the mal travels directly to the far corner (''mo''). Again, this only applies if this is the only stick facing down, and not all mals are on the course already.

There is also the ''back'' rule, where one of the sticks is labelled ''back'' (후퇴). If this is the only stick facing down, one of the mals has to go back one step. Depending on the rules used, if none of the mals are on the course, then this is counted as either a ''do'' or a skipped turn.  Alternatively, if the ''do'' rule is not being used, the other most common rule is for a mal to be placed onto the arrow next to the start. The mal remains there until another ''back'' is cast. In this case, however, the mal completes the course at once. Furthermore, if a mal is placed on the do spot, and then gets a ''back'', then they will be on the ''cham-meoki'' spot and then will exit the malpan when a do, gae or geul, yut or mo is thrown. Another ''back'' will put them on the nal-yut spot.

==Social meaning==
The game is a popular board game throughout Korea, and it is considered a game of deep tradition. The game is often treated as a social spectacle with onlookers and team members shouting loudly, encouraging each other, or wishing for a certain score. This game is played in almost every [[Seollal]] gathering and is commonly played in almost any region of the world with a significant Korean population.  The rare scores of ''yut'' and ''mo'' in particular cause excitement, particularly if cast more than one at a time.

The Australian film and theatre group, Yut Art, takes its names from the game as a result of the excitement and crowd participation associated with its activities.

==The stations==
[[Image:korea mal pan.svg|thumb|Yut board (mal-pan) with the different stations]]
Each station of the gameboard has its own name, although they are obscure to most Koreans. It is thought that the outer stations symbolize heaven, and the inner square, the earth. The whole board can be also interpreted as a reflection of universal symmetry and celestial procession, reflecting elements of [[Korean shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Korea News Review, Volume 17, Issues 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-Joseon writer Gim Munpyo described the Yut board as symbolising the circle of the cosmos, with the North Star in the centre, surrounded by 28 constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Yi I-Hwa/Lee E-Wha, transl. Park Ju-Hee, ''Korea's Pastimes and Customs: A Social History'' (Homa &amp; Sekey Books, 2005) p.22–3&lt;/ref&gt;
