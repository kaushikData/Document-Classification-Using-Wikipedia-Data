'''{{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}}''', [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisionally known]] as '''2005 YU55''',  is a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]]&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; 360±40 [[metre|meters]] in diameter, as measured after its Earth flyby.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt; Previously it was estimated at 310 meters&lt;ref name=mpi&gt;[http://www.mpg.de/4652308/2005_YU55_rocks_in_space?filter_order=L The Herschel Space Observatory catches a glimpse of the minor planet during its rendezvous with Earth (November 17, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; or about 400 m (1,300 [[Foot (unit)|feet]]) in diameter.&lt;ref name="news171"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell2010"/&gt; It was discovered on 28 December 2005 by [[Robert S. McMillan (astronomer)|Robert S. McMillan]] at [[Steward Observatory]], Kitt Peak.&lt;ref name="MPEC2005-Y47"/&gt; On 8 November 2011 it passed 0.85 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]s (324,900 [[kilometers]]; 201,900 [[miles]])&lt;ref name="NASA2011-332"/&gt; from Earth.

[[File:2005-YU55-Trajectory-8th-Nov-2011.png|thumb|left|alt=Skymap showing apparent trajectory of 2005 YU55.|Apparent trajectory on 8–9 November 2011.]]

In February 2010, {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} was rated 1 on the [[Torino Scale]] for a potential pass near Earth on November 10, 2103,&lt;ref name=Wayback2010-03/&gt; that posed no unusual level of danger. On 19 April 2010, [[radar astronomy|radar]] ranging by the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] reduced uncertainties about the orbit by 50%.&lt;ref name="Cornell2010"/&gt; This improvement eliminated any possibility of an impact with Earth within the next 100 years.&lt;ref name="Cornell2010"/&gt; It was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 22 April 2010 and as such it now has a rating of 0 on the Torino Scale.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt; It is now known that on 10 November 2103 {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} will be roughly 2 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from Earth.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2103"/&gt;

On 8 November 2011 at 23:28 [[Universal Time|UT]] the asteroid passed {{convert|0.85|LD|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA2011-332"/&gt; On 9 November 2011 at 07:13 UT the asteroid passed {{convert|0.6231|LD|km mi|abbr=on}} from the Moon.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; During the close approach the asteroid reached about [[apparent magnitude]] 11,&lt;ref name="news171"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEODyS2011"/&gt; and would have been visible to experienced observers using high-end [[Binoculars#Astronomical|binoculars]] with an [[objective lens]] of 80+&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] if it were not for bright moonlight preventing a true [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|dark sky]]. Since the [[Lunar phase|gibbous moon]] did interfere with the viewing,&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; observers trying to visually locate the asteroid required a telescope with an aperture of 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15 centimeters) or larger.&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA2011-332"/&gt;

The next few times a known asteroid this large will come this close to Earth will be in 2028&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; when {{mpl|(153814) 2001 WN|5}} passes 0.65 LD from Earth,&lt;ref name=jpl-close-WN5/&gt; and in 2029 when the 325-meter [[99942 Apophis]] comes even closer at just 0.10 LD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to [[Jay Melosh]], if an asteroid the size of {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} (~400&amp;nbsp;m across) were to hit land, it would create a [[Impact crater|crater]] {{convert|6.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} across, {{convert|518|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and generate a seven-[[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]]-equivalent-earthquake.&lt;ref name="Melosh"/&gt; The chances of an actual collision with an asteroid like {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} is about 1 percent in the next thousand years.&lt;ref name="Melosh"/&gt;

== Study ==
[[File:Swift Captures Flyby of Asteroid 2005 YU55.ogv|thumb|right|300px|[[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] captures flyby of asteroid {{mp|2005 YU|55}}.]]
During the 2011 passage {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} was studied with radar using [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]], [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]], the [[Very Long Baseline Array]], and the [[Green Bank Telescope]].&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; The [[Herschel Space Observatory]] has made far-[[infrared]] measurements of {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} on November 10, helping determine its temperature and composition.&lt;ref name="Herschel"/&gt;

Radar analysis has also helped to pin down the asteroid's [[albedo]], or [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]]. Although radar measurements do not detect visible light they can determine the distance and size of an object with a high degree of accuracy. This information, coupled with visible light measurements, provides a more accurate measure of an object's [[absolute magnitude]], and therefore its albedo.

On November 8, 2011, NASA released a statement mentioning a number of structures on the surface of the asteroid, which were detected as it passed near Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/news/yu55-20111108.html| title=NASA Releases Radar Movie of Asteroid 2005 YU55| publisher=NASA| date=November 8, 2011| accessdate= 6 December 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2011, higher-resolution images showed concavities, a ridge near the asteroid's equator, and numerous features interpreted as decameter-scale boulders.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boulders"/&gt; Shape modeling based on the radar images shows that YU55's shape is close to spheroidal, with maximum dimensions of 360±40 m, and an equator-aligned ridge. A 150–200-meter-long, ~20-meter-high rise forms a portion of the ridge-line, and the number of boulders on the surface is comparable to that seen on the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]] by the Hayabusa spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

Optical lightcurve measurements during the flyby provided a more accurate estimate of the asteroid's spin period – about 19.3 hours.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; Because {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} is so nearly spheroidal, it was not significantly torqued by [[Tidal force|Earth's tides]] during the flyby, and there is no evidence of [[Rotation|non-principal-axis rotation]]. Optical, near-infrared,&lt;ref name=Moskovitz/&gt; and ultraviolet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/cbet/002900/CBET002937.txt |title=Electronic Telegram No. 2937: 2005 YU_55 |last=Bodewits |first=Dennis |displayauthors=etal |date=5 December 2011 |website=[[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]] |access-date=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; spectroscopy confirmed that {{mp|2005 YU|55}} is a [[C-type asteroid]].

== Future trajectory ==
On 19 January 2029, {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} will pass {{convert|0.0023|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from [[Venus]].&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The close approach distance to Venus in 2029 will determine how close the asteroid will pass to Earth in 2041.&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; Before the November 2011 observations, the uncertainties in the post-2029 trajectory showed that the asteroid would pass somewhere between {{convert|0.002|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} and {{convert|0.3|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} of Earth in 2041.&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; Radar astrometry in November 2011 clarified the Earth passage in 2041 and beyond.&lt;ref name="Goldstone-planning"/&gt; As a result of the November 2011 radar observations, it is now known that {{mp|(308635) 2005 YU|55}} will pass between {{convert|0.1017|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} and 0.1020&amp;nbsp;AU of Earth on 12 November 2041.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; Using the current uncertainty region [[Numerical integration|integrated]] until the future, the 2075 approach will be between {{convert|0.0013|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} and {{convert|0.0021|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;

'''{{mp|357439|2004 BL|86}}''' is a bright sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] and [[Binary asteroid|binary system]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|300|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter. It was discovered on 30 January 2004 by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] at [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; Its {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[minor-planet moon]] was discovered during the asteroid's close approach to the Earth in January 2015.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-news-moon"/&gt;

== 2015 Earth approach ==

On 26 January 2015 at 16:20&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]], {{mp|2004 BL|86}} passed {{convert|1199600|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}, or 3.1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]], from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The asteroid briefly peaked around [[apparent magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;9 and was near the [[celestial equator]].&lt;ref name="NEODyS2015"/&gt; The asteroid was visible in [[telescope]]s with [[Objective (optics)|objectives]] of {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} or larger; high-end [[binoculars]] under a dark sky may also have worked.&lt;ref name="Musgrave20150123"/&gt; Near closest approach the asteroid was moving about 2.5 degrees per hour (2.5 [[arcsecond]]s per second).&lt;ref name="NEODyS2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="st20150122"/&gt; The asteroid came to [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]] (furthest [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] in the sky from the Sun) on 27 January 2015 at 04:37&amp;nbsp;UTC.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2015"/&gt; Around 5:00&amp;nbsp;UTC, the asteroid was near M44 (the [[Beehive Cluster]]).&lt;ref name="st20150122"/&gt;

The 26 January 2015 approach of 3.1 lunar distances was the closest approach of {{mp|2004 BL|86}} for at least the next 200 years.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter20150207" /&gt; For comparison, {{mpl|2015 TB|145}}, about twice the size of {{mp|2004 BL|86}}, passed {{convert|486800|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or 1.3 lunar distances, from Earth on 31 October 2015.&lt;ref name=2015TB145/&gt;

== Satellite ==

A [[minor-planet moon]], provisionally designated {{mp|S/2015 (357439) 1}}, was first detected by ground-based telescopes by Joe Pollock and [[Petr Pravec]].&lt;ref name="Pollock-2015a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NRAO20151030"/&gt; Observations by the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]] and [[Green Bank Telescope]] confirmed that it is a [[binary asteroid]] with a secondary roughly {{convert|70|m|ft|sp=us}} across.&lt;ref name="NASA-news-moon "/&gt; The secondary is estimated to orbit at least {{convert|500|m|ft|sp=us}} from the primary.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt; About 16% of asteroids over {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter are thought to be binaries.&lt;ref name="NASA-news-moon "/&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==
This [[minor planet]] was numbered on 27 March 2013 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 83151}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; As of 2017, it has not been named.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Aberdour Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] located in the state’s south-east in the locality of [[Willalooka, South Australia|Willalooka]] about {{convert|226|km}} south-east of the state capital of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] and about {{convert|35|km}} south of the town of [[Keith, South Australia|Keith]].&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;

The conservation park consists of land in sections 7 and 80 in the cadastral unit of the [[Hundred of Willalooka]].  The Cannawigara Road which extends from [[Bordertown, South Australia|Bordertown]] in the east to the [[Riddoch Highway]] in the west in Willalooka passes between sections 7 and 80 while Nankivell Road adjoins the eastern boundary with section 7.  A fire access track is located inside the fence line on the western and northern boundaries while a disused quarry is located on the eastern boundary.&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;&lt;ref name="SAGG-1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SAGG-2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=   |first1=   |title= National Parks and Wildlife (Aberdour Conservation Park) Proclamation 2006 |url= http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/proc/npawcpp2006612/ |website=South Australian Government Gazette |publisher=South Australian Government|accessdate=27 April 2018|page= 582|date= 16 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proclaimed under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' on 28 February 1991 in respect to section 7 which was gifted to the state government by the Nankivell family.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;&lt;ref name="SAGG-1991"/&gt;  Land in section 80 which was formerly a stone reserve under the control of the [[District Council of Tatiara]] was added by proclamation to the conservation park on 16 February 2006.&lt;ref name="SAGG-2006"/&gt;  The name is derived from Aberdour Homestead which is located to the west of the conservation park on the east side of the [[Riddoch Highway]] in the locality of Willalooka.&lt;ref name=LMV/&gt;&lt;ref name=LMV-HMSD&gt;{{cite web|title= Search results for ‘Aberdour, HMSD’ with the following datasets selected – ‘Suburbs and Localities’, ‘NPW and Conservation Boundaries’, ‘Roads’ and ‘Gazetteer’ |url= http://location.sa.gov.au/viewer/?map=hybrid&amp;x=140.40803&amp;y=-36.32395&amp;z=13&amp;uids=41,19,105,136&amp;pinx=140.354500&amp;piny=-36.330500&amp;pinTitle=Location&amp;pinText=Aberdour,+Hmsd |website=Location SA Map Viewer |publisher= South Australian Government |accessdate=27 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2016, it covered an area of {{convert|1.45|km2}}.&lt;ref name="ReserveList"/&gt;

In 1997, the conservation park was described as follows:&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The park preserves an area of remnant vegetation typical of undulating dune and limestone country.  Due to the extensive clearance in the surrounding area, the park provides an important habitat and stepping stone for many fauna species, particularly birds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conservation park supports the following three vegetation associations:&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;
#An open scrub of ''[[Eucalyptus diversifolia]]'' and [[Eucalyptus leptophylla]] located on a “rocky calcrete’’ ridge passing through the conservation park in a north-south direction and including other dominant species such as broombush (''[[Melaleuca uncinata]]''), slaty sheoak (''[[Allocasuarina muelleriana]]''), and silver broombush (''[[Babingtonia|Baeckea behrii]]'').
#An open scrub of ''[[Eucalyptus incrassata]]'' located on a “small strip” of sandy soil on the conservation park’s northern boundary including other dominant species such as broombush, slaty sheoak and silver broombush, but distinguished from the previous association by “the presence of the canopy species ''E. incrassate'' and the scattering throughout the community of the dryland tea-tree (''[[Melaleuca lanceolata]]).”
#A woodland of ''[[Eucalyptus fasciculosa]]'' located along the eastern boundary.

Land within the conservation park’s boundaries is known to be a site for Jumping-Jack Wattle (''[[Acacia enterocarpa]]''), a species of plant which is listed as ''endangered'' both by the ''National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972'' and the Commonwealth ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Moritz |first1= K.N. | last2= Bickerton |first2= D.C.  | title= Recovery Plan for the Nationally Endangered Jumping-Jack Wattle ''Acacia enterocarpa'' | publication-date=2011 | publisher= Department for Environment and Natural Resources, South Australia | url= http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/159d471b-a2cd-4047-ad79-1738c1d4c10f/files/acacia-enterocarpa-recovery-plan.pdf | accessdate=28 April 2018 |pages= 1, 3–4, 6, 14, 16 and 26 | isbn=978-0-9806503-8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1997, visitation consisted mainly of “local school groups” undertaking “environmental education.”&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{Citation | author1=South East Region, Natural Resources Group, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, South Australia | title=Aberdour and Mount Monster Conservation Parks, Desert Camp Conservation Reserve and Poocher Swamp Game Reserve management plans.

'''Analog observation''' is typically divided into two iteration of application: The first iteration primarily studies the effect of manipulation of variables in the subject's environment, including setting and events, on the subject's behavior. The second iteration primarily seeks to observe the subject's behavior in [[quasi-experiment]]al social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=Encyclopedia of psychology|year=1984|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electric power]] transmission and distribution, the '''Common Information Model''' ('''CIM'''), a [[standardization|standard]] developed by the [[electric power industry]] that has been officially adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), aims to allow [[application software]] to exchange [[information]] about an [[electrical network]].&lt;ref name=CIM-U-00&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5772503 IEEE.org | The impact of PAP 8 on the Common Information Model (CIM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIM is currently maintained as a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] model.&lt;ref name=CIM-U-01&gt;[http://www.elp.com/index/display/article-display/316548/articles/utility-automation-engineering-td/volume-13/issue-1/features/using-the-common-information-model-for-enterprise-integration.html Electric Light and Power.com | Using the common information model for enterprise integration]&lt;/ref&gt; It defines a common vocabulary and basic [[ontology]] for aspects of the electric power industry. The CIM models the network itself using the 'wires model'. This describes the basic components used to transport electricity. Measurements of power are modeled by another class. These measurements support the management of powerflow at the transmission level, and by extension, the modeling of power through a revenue meter on the distribution network. The CIM can be used to derive 'design artifacts' (e.g. [[XML Schema]], [[RDF Schema]]) as needed for the integration of related [[application software]].

The CIM is also used to derive messages for the wholesale energy market with the framework for energy market communications, [[IEC 62325]]. The European style market profile is a profile derivation from the CIM to harmonize the energy market data exchanges in Europe. [[ENTSO-E]] is a major contributor to the European style market profile.&lt;ref name=ESMP&gt;[https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/electronic-data-interchange-edi-library/Pages/default.aspx ENTSO-E | Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard that defines the core packages of the CIM is [[IEC 61970]]-301, with a focus on the needs of [[electricity transmission]], where related applications include [[energy management system]], [[SCADA]], planning and optimization. The IEC 61970-501 and 61970-452 standards define an [[XML]] format for network model exchanges using [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. The [[IEC 61968]] series of standards extend the CIM to meet the needs of [[electrical distribution]], where related applications include [[distribution management system]], [[outage management system]], planning, metering, work management, [[geographic information system]], asset management, customer information systems and [[enterprise resource planning]].

== Difference between CIM and SCL ==
CIM and Substation Configuration Language (SCL) are developed in parallel under different working groups of [[IEC TC 57]]. Though both have the ability to exchange model and configuration information between different equipment or tools and use XML for storage, there are lot of differences between both the standards.

#CIM is completely developed based on UML which is developed on the basis of inheritance. SCL representation is sequential or hierarchical in nature.
#Although the CIM is not limited to modeling equipment, the CIM approach gives emphasis on the equipment inheritance and its interconnection whereas SCL starts from a functional point of view.
#CIM is broadly applied to enterprise integration and related information exchanges between systems including, but not limited to, EMS, DMS, Planning, Energy Markets and Metering, where SCL is limited to exchange of data within substation equipment and tools.

== Harmonization of CIM and SCL ==
There are applications which use both these standards and there will be significant improvements on interoperability and data exchange between the applications if SCL model can be transformed into CIM based models. Without the harmonization of these standards, the development and implementation of systems and applications will result in a significant amount of engineering and design that applies to only one implementation. The harmonization can be done by mixing equipment topological approach of CIM and functionality approach of SCL. IEC TC57 WG19 is involved in the harmonization CIM &amp; SCL. This will involve the following steps

#Mapping of logical nodes of [[IEC 61850]] (SCL) to equipment defined in CIM.
#Use [[Web Ontology Language]] to define the mapping patterns for the areas to which the automatic mapping cannot be performed.
#The complete approach should not modify the existing models to large extent.

'''Condurrite''' is a name given to a mixture of [[cuprite]], [[domeykite]] and [[tenorite]]. It takes its name from the Great Condurrow Mine at [[Troon, Cornwall|Troon]], [[Cornwall]] in the United Kingdom, which is regarded as the [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-10070.html Condurrite: Condurrite mineral information and data&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The chorus can be seen between 1000 Hz and 3000 Hz, sandwiched between components of [[radio atmospheric|sferics]]]]

The [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] '''dawn chorus''' is a phenomenon that occurs most often at or shortly after [[dawn]] local time. With the proper [[radio]] equipment, dawn chorus can be converted to sounds that resemble [[dawn chorus (birds)|birds' dawn chorus]] (by coincidence).

The electromagnetic dawn chorus is believed to be generated by a [[Doppler effect|Doppler-shifted]] [[Electron cyclotron resonance|cyclotron interaction]] between anisotropic distributions of energetic (&gt; 40 keV) electrons and ambient background VLF noise. These energetic electrons are generally injected into the inner magnetosphere at the onset of the substorm expansion phase.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Dawn choruses occur more frequently during [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]].

This phenomenon also occurs during [[auroral light|aurorae]], when it is termed an [[auroral chorus]].

The [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[archipelago]] is one of the world's great reservoirs of [[biodiversity]] and [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]]. The archipelago includes over 7000 islands, and a total land area of 300,780 km².

The Philippines was never connected to mainland [[Asia]] via [[land bridge]]s,{{dubious|land bridge|date=July 2014}} so the flora and fauna of the islands had to cross ocean straits to reach the Philippines. The Philippines is part of the [[Indomalaya]] ecozone, and its flora and fauna is mostly derived from tropical Asia. [[Botany|Botanically]], the Philippines are part of [[Malesia]], a [[floristic province]] that includes the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Indonesia]], and [[New Guinea]]. Most of the Malesian flora is derived from tropical Asia, including the [[dipterocarp]]s, which are the characteristic tree of the Philippine forests. Elements of the [[Antarctic flora]], which originated in the ancient [[southern hemisphere]] supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], are also present, including ancient conifers like [[podocarpaceae|podocarps]] (''[[Podocarpus]], [[Nageia]], [[Sundacarpus]]'') and [[Araucariaceae|araucarias]] (''[[Agathis]]'').

The [[ecoregions]] of the Philippines are defined primarily by the sea levels during the Ice Ages, which were 120 meters lower than at present, as billions of gallons of water were locked away in huge continental ice sheets. This drop in sea level connected many presently separate islands into larger islands, which allowed for exchanges of flora and fauna:
* '''Greater Luzon''' included [[Luzon]], Catanduanes, Marinduque, [[Polillo Islands|Polillo]], and several small islands.
* '''Greater Mindanao''' included [[Mindanao]], [[Basilan]], [[Bohol]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], [[Samar (island)|Samar]], and adjacent small islands.
* '''Greater Palawan''' included [[Palawan]], Balabac, Busuanga, Culion, Cuyo, and adjacent small islands.
* '''Greater Negros-Panay''' included [[Negros Island|Negros]], [[Panay Island|Panay]], [[Cebu Island|Cebu]], and [[Masbate]].
* '''Greater Sulu''' included the most of the [[Sulu Archipelago]], from [[Tawi Tawi]] to [[Jolo]].

These formerly linked islands each constitute a separate ecoregion, as does [[Mindoro]], which remained separate from the rest, along with a few smaller islands, notably Camiguin, Sibuyan, and Siquijor.

Each group of islands that were linked by land bridges in the ice ages also constitutes a separate faunal region. The lack of a land bridge to the Asian continent prevented most of the Asian [[megafauna]], including [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]], [[tapir]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[gibbon]]s, from reaching the Philippines, although they do inhabit the adjacent [[Indonesia]]n islands of [[Sundaland]], which were formerly linked to the Asian continent by lowered sea levels.

The other main factor that defines the Philippine ecoregions is elevation; the high mountains of Luzon and Mindanao host distinct montane rain forest ecoregions. The mountains of Luzon are also home to the [[Luzon tropical pine forests]].

The lavas of the Ethiopia-Yemen CFB show systematic variations in composition both vertically and laterally. Most of the lavas are basalts, but those closest to the Afar Triangle being very [[High and low titanium basalts|high Titanium]] transitional [[basalt]]s and [[picrite]]s, passing outwards into high-Ti [[tholeiite|tholeiitic]] basalts and finally into low-Ti tholeiitic basalts. The sequence is also an example of [[bimodal volcanism]] and the uppermost part typically contains significant amounts of [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] lavas.&lt;ref name="Natali et al 2011"/&gt;

'''Exergonix Inc,''' is an [[energy storage]] company based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. It was founded in 2010, after spinning out of [[Kokam America]], Inc., which was acquired by [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 2009. Exergonix develops, manufactures and deploys community-level and [[grid energy storage]] to supply [[Peaking power plant|peak-shaving]], [[demand response|demand-management]], and [[smart grid]] capabilities to the grid and micro-grid.

The company designs and builds [[renewable energy]] solutions for a wide range of applications including storage for [[solar energy|solar]] and [[wind power]], [[Energy demand management|utility management]], the [[United States Armed Forces|military]], [[telecommunications]] cell towers and [[Uninterruptible power supply|emergency back-up]].

==Background==

===History===
According to the company president’s statement to the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]] in 2012, the company’s mission is to make renewable energy cost effective and will allow nations around the world to implement a worldwide, workable, smart and decentralized utility grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg77859/html/CHRG-112shrg77859.htm Promoting American Competitiveness: Filling Jobs Today And Training Workers For Tomorrow] at [[U.S. Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-04-17/html/CREC-2012-04-17-pt1-PgD355.htm United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies] at [[U.S. Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; The company makes a “promising energy storage application”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2014/02/14/enUK201402140367 Grid-Scale Energy Storage in North America 2013: Applications, Technologies and Suppliers] in ''[[American City Business Journals|Kansas City Business Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility sits atop 83 acres of land on [[Missouri Route 291]] and [[U.S. Route 50]], previously owned by [[Pfizer|Pfizer, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://kcmetro.com/2011061731007/local-news/lee-s-summit-mo/exergonix-closes-on-pfizer-property.html Exergonix closes on Pfizer property]&lt;/ref&gt; Valued at $90 million, the company raised another $2 million from local angel investor group, and a $1.4 million package from the [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|City of Lee’s Summit]], [[Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/print-edition/2011/01/07/angels-aid-pursuit-of-exergonix.html?page=3 Angel investors aid pursuit of Exergonix] in ''[[American City Business Journals|Kansas City Business Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Also from Senators [[Kit Bond]] and [[Jim Talent]], the company further secured $8 million in federal funding from a defense spending bill, to bring a new manufacturing plant to Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucmo.edu/today/archives/06/fall/industry.cfm?print=yes&amp; Nissanka's Charge Could Revolutionize an Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the "Green Energy Park" was dialed back to $50 million, after $100 million federal money fell through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/11138396/1/exergonix-extends-talks-for-lees-summit-incentives.html#disqus_thread Exergonix Extends Talks For Lee's Summit Incentives], May 31, 2011. ''[[TheStreet.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
The CEO had approached [[Missouri General Assembly|state legislators]] to seek $650 million for a manufacturing plant in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouripartnership.com/Sites-Incentives-Data/Data-Center/Industry-Insight-Blog/itemid/148/amid/717/kokam-america-seeks-state-incentives-for-lees-summit-plant Kokam America seeks state incentives for Lee's Summit plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The CEO approached the [[United States Department of Defense]] with new battery technology and although the agency was interested, its budget was committed. Senator [[Kit Bond]] was then approached with the request to include the money in the department's budget.

Nissanka said: "I would say that the reason we got the money has nothing to do with a high-power lobbyist, we got it because of our technology. Earmarks unfortunately are the only way you can drive new technology into the market." Nissanka provided testimony during Senator [[Roy Blunt]]’s attempt at [[Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2013]].

Exergonix received $2 million to build and install a 1 megawatt utility storage at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] in [[Knob Noster, Missouri]] in order to demonstrate the ability of the [[US military]] to provide safe and effective energy security solutions compounded with renewable energy. The battery technology offered an improved cycle life, lighter weight, wider operating temperature range and true maintenance-free design. Applications include many aerospace and defense uses, such as weapon platforms, aircraft and future land warrior programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2008/Jun/20080608Pers001.asp As a Missouri senator earmarks millions, watchdog groups complain] at ''[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blunt.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=96451d00-69c5-4cc4-979a-e961e395d06b Congress Approves Brown-Blunt Manufacturing Bill In Omnibus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy storage projects==
In 2010, as part of [[Emanuel Cleaver]]’s Green Impact Zone in [[Kansas City]], Exergonix along with [[Siemens]], [[Electric Power Research Institute]], [[Landis+Gyr]], [[Intergraph]], [[Tendril]], [[City of Kansas City]] and the [[Mid-America Regional Council]] launched a pilot project for SmartGrid development under [[Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability]] with funding from [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] in partnership with [[Kansas City Power and Light]]. The project aimed to generate greater [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], reduced cost, improved reliability, more transparent and interactive information, and an improved [[environmental footprint]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smartgrid.gov/project/kansas_city_power_and_light_green_impact_zone_smartgrid_demonstration.html Kansas City SmartGrid]&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] expressed bright futures talking to [[Smith Electric Vehicles]]’s USA branch about clean technology jobs, where Kokam America was the battery supplier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/04/18/smith-electric-vehicles-us-choose-kokam-as-battery-supplier/ SEV choose Kokam as suppliers] at ''Autoblog''&lt;/ref&gt; and CEO Don Nissanka (also formerly Kokam America President and CEO) was on the board. Besides Smith Electric, Nissanka had customers in the EV market, but he declined to disclose any of their names. He was also on the 18-member taskforce on Automotive Jobs Task Force, appointed by Governor [[Jay Nixon]] in 2009.

"The future is here for us in terms of the battery technology," said Nissanka&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/update-gov-jay-nixon-tours-missouri-battery-plant/article_4c6c0834-669e-5104-85fa-aa484ba1bdba.html Gov. Jay Nixon tours Missouri battery plant] at ''[[Columbia Missourian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissanka also initiated the “[https://www.ucmo.edu/mic/ Missouri Innovation Campus]” (MIC) which was Obama’s travel stop for a speech at [[University of Central Missouri]].

“I think the president is right on, I think the administration has done a good job of putting enough money into this economy right now. We’re in a depression and we needed this money to fuel the economy and fuel the jobs. I see it happening. It’s happening around the country”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wynstonhill.com/index.php/obama-touts-energy-investments-during-stop-at-electric-vehicle-plant/ Obama touts Energy Investments]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[InformationWeek]]'', the company along with a handful of other battery storage firms, shares [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]]’s ambition of disruptive home power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/tesla-battery-looks-to-disrupt-home-office-power-consumption/d/d-id/1319144 Tesla Battery Looks To Disrupt Home, Office Power Consumption] at ''[[InformationWeek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the company acquired [[Coda Automotive|Coda Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Foam latex''' is a lightweight, soft form of [[latex]] which is used in [[masks]] and [[facial prosthetic]]s to change a person's outward appearance. ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' was one of the first films to make extensive use of foam latex prosthetics in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ron. ''Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic.'' Twenty-First Century Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been a staple of film, television, and stage productions, as well as finding use in a number of other fields.  Its original formulation began in 1936 and was the work of makeup chemist, Charles Gemora.  It was first used on The General Died at Dawn for some Asian eyelids on actor Akim Tamiroff.

To create foam latex, a liquid latex base is mixed with various additives and whipped into a [[foam]], then poured or injected into a mold and baked in an oven to cure. The main components of foam latex are the latex base, a [[foaming agent]] (to help it whip into a froth), a [[gelling agent]] (to convert the liquid foam into a gel), and a [[curing agent]] (to turn the gelled foam latex into a solid when baked). A number of additional additives can also be added depending on the required use of the foam.&lt;ref&gt;Drexler, Donna. ''The Foam Latex Survival Guide.'' Burman Industries, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foam latex has also seen heavy use in the field of [[stop motion]] animation, being used to form the skin and muscles of many puppets. The characters in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Coraline]]'' were made partially of foam latex. It is also used in place of clay in productions such as ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' in which the various celebrities who appear to be made of clay are in fact foam latex over wire [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]].{{fact|date=August 2011}}

Artists such as [[Lordi]] and [[GWAR]] wear costumes that include this material.{{fact|date=August 2011}}

Latex foam is also widespread in the manufacture of modern soccer goalkeeper gloves. The material has proven to be the most effective way of allowing players to grip the football in wet and dry playing conditions, as well as providing damping properties which help in catching. A variety of treatments are applied to latex foam to produce different types of foam with varying properties to assist performance. Some, for example, are designed to offer a high level of grip; whereas others are designed to offer maximum durability.{{fact|date=August 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3189">[[File:Frog jumping contest 1.jpg|thumb|Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee 2016]]
'''Frog jumping''' is a competitive pastime for humans in which [[frog]]s are entered into competitions to [[jumping|jump]] certain distances. Frog jumping contests are held in small communities scattered around the [[United States]], as part of the folk culture.

Frog jumping was made famous in a [[short story]] by [[Mark Twain]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]." An event, inspired by the Twain story, has been held annually in [[Angels Camp, California|Angels Camp]], in California's [[Calaveras County]], since 1928, with other events held in Indiana, Ohio, Washington, Maine, Missouri, Louisiana, New York, and also in Manitoba, Canada.

With 4,000 contestants in 2007, the Calaveras County contest has imposed strict rules regulating the frogs's welfare, including limiting the daily number of a frog's jumps and mandating the playing of calming music in their enclosures. Entering specimens of the  [[California Red-legged Frog]] in the competition, since it is an endangered species, is illegal. (It is also illegal, and likewise considered poor sportsmanship, for any competing frog to be weighted down by any means, as the frog in the Twain story was by the stranger who cheated in the contest as described.) Participants entering the longest-jumping frog were to win a $750 prize, or $5,000 if their frog were to break the 1986 record of 21 feet, 5¾ inches, set by "Rosie the Ribeter."

[[File:AlapahaRiver2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The entire [[surface water]] flow of the [[Alapaha River]] near [[Jennings, Florida|Jennings]], [[Florida]] going into a [[sinkhole]] leading to the [[Floridan Aquifer]] groundwater]]

'''Groundwater''' is the [[water]] present beneath [[Earth]]'s surface in [[Pore space in soil|soil pore spaces]] and in the [[fracture]]s of [[stratum|rock formations]]. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an [[aquifer]] when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which [[soil]] pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the [[water table]]. [[Groundwater recharge|Groundwater is recharged]] from and eventually flows to the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and can form [[oasis|oases]] or [[wetland]]s. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for [[agriculture|agricultural]], [[city|municipal]], and [[industry|industrial]] use by constructing and operating extraction [[water well|wells]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], also called groundwater [[hydrology]].

Typically, groundwater is thought of as water flowing through shallow aquifers, but, in the technical sense, it can also contain [[soil moisture]], [[permafrost]] (frozen soil), immobile water in very low permeability [[bedrock]], and deep [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] or [[petroleum geology|oil formation]] water. Groundwater is hypothesized to provide [[lubrication]] that can possibly influence the movement of [[fault (geology)|faults]]. It is likely that much of [[Earth]]'s subsurface contains some water, which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances. Groundwater may not be confined only to Earth. The formation of some of the [[Hydrology of Mars|landforms]] observed on [[Mars]] may have been influenced by groundwater. There is also evidence that liquid water may also exist in the subsurface of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Richard Greenburg | title=The Ocean Moon: Search for an Alien Biosphere | publisher=Springer Praxis Books | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundwater is often cheaper, more convenient and less vulnerable to [[water pollution|pollution]] than surface water. Therefore, it is commonly used for public water supplies. For example, groundwater provides the largest source of usable water storage in the United States, and California annually withdraws the largest amount of groundwater of all the states.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Almanac of Geography, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7922-3877-X}}, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Underground reservoirs contain far more water than the capacity of all surface reservoirs and lakes in the US, including the [[Great Lakes]]. Many municipal water supplies are derived solely from groundwater.&lt;ref name="hydrology"&gt;{{cite web| title =What is hydrology and what do hydrologists do? | work =The USGS Water Science School | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = 23 May 2013 &lt;!-- 13:24:42 EDT --&gt; | accessdate = 21 Jan 2014 | url =https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groundwater pollution|Polluted groundwater]] is less visible, but more difficult to clean up, than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage [[sanitary landfill|landfills]], excessive [[fertilizer]]s and pesticides used in agriculture, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process [[wastewater]] from mines, industrial fracking, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, [[sewage sludge]] and [[septic tank|septic systems]].

{{Main article|Aquifer}}

An ''aquifer'' is a layer of porous substrate that contains and transmits groundwater. When water can flow directly between the surface and the saturated zone of an aquifer, the aquifer is unconfined. The deeper parts of unconfined aquifers are usually more saturated since gravity causes water to flow downward.

The upper level of this saturated layer of an unconfined aquifer is called the ''water table'' or ''phreatic surface''. Below the water table, where in general all pore spaces are saturated with water, is the [[phreatic zone]].

Substrate with low porosity that permits limited transmission of groundwater is known as an ''aquitard''. An ''aquiclude'' is a substrate with porosity that is so low it is virtually impermeable to groundwater.

A ''confined aquifer'' is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate such as an aquiclude or aquitard. If a confined aquifer follows a downward grade from its ''recharge zone'', groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create [[artesian well]]s that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above, unconfined, aquifer.

The characteristics of aquifers vary with the geology and structure of the substrate and topography in which they occur. In general, the more productive aquifers occur in sedimentary geologic formations. By comparison, weathered and fractured crystalline rocks yield smaller quantities of groundwater in many environments. Unconsolidated to poorly cemented alluvial materials that have accumulated as [[valley]]-filling sediments in major river valleys and geologically subsiding structural basins are included among the most productive sources of groundwater.

The high [[specific heat capacity]] of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature. In some places where groundwater temperatures are maintained by this effect at about 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F), groundwater can be used for controlling the temperature inside structures at the surface. For example, during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a home and then returned to the ground in another well. During cold seasons, because it is relatively warm, the water can be used in the same way as a source of heat for [[heat pump]]s that is much more efficient than using air.

The volume of groundwater in an aquifer can be estimated by measuring water levels in local wells and by examining geologic records from well-drilling to determine the extent, depth and thickness of water-bearing sediments and rocks. Before an investment is made in production wells, test wells may be drilled to measure the depths at which water is encountered and collect samples of soils, rock and water for laboratory analyses. Pumping tests can be performed in test wells to determine flow characteristics of the aquifer.&lt;ref name=hydrology /&gt;

[[File:Groundwater flow.svg|thumb|right|Relative groundwater travel times]]
[[File:Shipot.jpg|thumb|Dzherelo, a common source of drinking water in a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[village]]]]

Groundwater makes up about twenty percent of the world's [[fresh water]] supply, which is about 0.61% of the entire world's water, including oceans and permanent ice. Global groundwater storage is roughly equal to the total amount of freshwater stored in the snow and ice pack, including the north and south poles. This makes it an important resource that can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of [[surface water]], as in during times of [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/?id=learn_more&amp;navid=groundwater/ |title=Learn More: Groundwater |publisher=[[Columbia Water Center]] |author= |date= |accessdate=15 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[stream]]s, and [[river]]s when this recharge reaches the water table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=United States Department of the Interior |first= |authorlink =United States Bureau of Reclamation |title =Ground Water Manual |publisher =United States Government Printing Office |volume = |edition =First |date =1977 |location = |page =4 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundwater can be a long-term '[[Water cycle#Reservoirs|reservoir]]' of the natural water cycle (with residence times from days to millennia), as opposed to short-term water reservoirs like the atmosphere and fresh surface water (which have residence times from minutes to years). The figure&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Groundwater flow.svg]]&lt;/ref&gt; shows how deep groundwater (which is quite distant from the surface recharge) can take a very long time to complete its natural cycle.

The [[Great Artesian Basin]] in central and eastern [[Australia]] is one of the largest confined aquifer systems in the world, extending for almost 2 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By analysing the trace elements in water sourced from deep underground, [[Hydrogeology|hydrogeologists]] have been able to determine that water extracted from these aquifers can be more than 1 million years old.

By comparing the age of groundwater obtained from different parts of the Great Artesian Basin, hydrogeologists have found it increases in age across the basin. Where water recharges the aquifers along the [[Great Dividing Range|Eastern Divide]], ages are young. As groundwater flows westward across the continent, it increases in age, with the oldest groundwater occurring in the western parts. This means that in order to have travelled almost 1000&amp;nbsp;km from the source of recharge in 1 million years, the groundwater flowing through the Great Artesian Basin travels at an average rate of about 1 metre per year.

Recent research has demonstrated that [[evaporation]] of groundwater can play a significant role in the local water cycle, especially in arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;

It managed to capture and condense enough ground vapor to bring to life naturally buried seeds underneath it, with a green area of about 10% of the carpet area. It is expected that, if seeds were put down before placing this carpet, a much wider area would become green.&lt;ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Overview ===
Certain problems have beset the use of groundwater around the world. Just as river waters have been over-used and [[water pollution|polluted]] in many parts of the world, so too have aquifers. The big difference is that aquifers are out of sight. The other major problem is that water management agencies, when calculating the "sustainable yield" of aquifer and river water, have often counted the same water twice, once in the aquifer, and once in its connected river. This problem, although understood for centuries, has persisted, partly through inertia within government agencies. In Australia, for example, prior to the statutory reforms initiated by the [[Council of Australian Governments]] water reform framework in the 1990s, many Australian states managed groundwater and surface water through separate government agencies, an approach beset by rivalry and poor communication.

In general, the time lags inherent in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies, decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated. In brief, the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves. In a classic study in 1982, Bredehoeft and colleagues&lt;ref name="Sophocleous, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10040-001-0170-8|title=Interactions between groundwater and surface water: the state of the science|year=2002|last1=Sophocleous|first1=Marios|journal=Hydrogeology Journal|volume=10|pages=52–67|bibcode = 2002HydJ...10...52S }}&lt;/ref&gt; modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an intermontane basin withdrew the entire annual recharge, leaving ‘nothing’ for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community. Even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation, 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by the lag inherent in the system after 100 years. By year 500, this had reduced to 0%, signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation. The science has been available to make these calculations for decades; however, in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear outside the rough timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years). Marios Sophocleous&lt;ref name="Sophocleous, 2002"/&gt; argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate timeframes in groundwater planning. This will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades, sometimes centuries in the future.

As water moves through the landscape, it collects soluble salts, mainly [[sodium chloride]]. Where such water enters the atmosphere through [[evapotranspiration]], these salts are left behind. In [[irrigation]] districts, poor drainage of soils and surface aquifers can result in water tables' coming to the surface in low-lying areas. Major [[land degradation]] problems of [[soil salinity]] and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] result,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with increasing levels of salt in surface waters. As a consequence, major damage has occurred to local economies and environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1942074|url=http://landscape.forest.wisc.edu/courses/Landscape565spr01/Ludwig_etal1993.pdf|doi=10.1126/science.260.5104.17|title=Uncertainty, Resource Exploitation, and Conservation: Lessons from History|year=1993|last1=Ludwig|first1=D.|last2=Hilborn|first2=R.|last3=Walters|first3=C.|journal=Science|volume=260|issue=5104|pages=17–36|pmid=17793516 |bibcode = 1993Sci...260...17L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four important effects are worthy of brief mention. First, flood mitigation schemes, intended to protect infrastructure built on floodplains, have had the unintended consequence of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding. Second, prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in land [[subsidence]], with associated infrastructure damage – as well as, third, [[Saltwater intrusion|saline intrusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Zektser et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, draining acid sulphate soils, often found in low-lying coastal plains, can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and [[estuary|estuarine]] streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Water quality and macroinvertebrate response to acidification following intensified summer droughts in a Western Australian wetland|doi=10.1071/MF00021|year=2001|last1=Sommer|first1=Bea|last2=Horwitz|first2=Pierre|last3=Sommer|first3=Bea|last4=Horwitz|first4=Pierre|journal=Marine and Freshwater Research|volume=52|issue=7|page=1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause for concern is that groundwater drawdown from over-allocated aquifers has the potential to cause severe damage to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems – in some cases very conspicuously but in others quite imperceptibly because of the extended period over which the damage occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00254-004-1164-3|title=Environmental impacts of groundwater overdraft: selected case studies in the southwestern United States|year=2004|last1=Zektser|first1=S.|last2=LoaIciga|first2=H. A.|last3=Wolf|first3=J. T.|journal=Environmental Geology|volume=47|issue=3|pages=396–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overdraft ===
{{Main article|Overdrafting}}

[[File:MiddleSpring.JPG|thumb|Wetlands contrast the arid landscape around Middle Spring, [[Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Utah]]]]

Groundwater is a highly useful and often abundant resource. However, over-use, over-abstraction or '''overdraft''', can cause major problems to human users and to the environment. The most evident problem (as far as human groundwater use is concerned) is a lowering of the water table beyond the reach of existing wells. As a consequence, wells must be drilled deeper to reach the groundwater; in some places (e.g., [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[India]]) the water table has dropped hundreds of feet because of extensive well pumping. In the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] region of [[India]], for example, groundwater levels have dropped 10 meters since 1979, and the rate of depletion is accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/water/2009/07/28/punjab-a-tale-of-prosperity-and-decline/ |title=Punjab: A tale of prosperity and decline |publisher=[[Columbia Water Center]] |author=Upmanu Lall |date= |accessdate=2009-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A lowered water table may, in turn, cause other problems such as [[groundwater-related subsidence]] and [[saltwater intrusion]].

Groundwater is also ecologically important. The importance of groundwater to ecosystems is often overlooked, even by freshwater biologists and ecologists. Groundwaters sustain rivers, [[wetland]]s, and [[lake]]s, as well as subterranean ecosystems within [[karst topography|karst]] or alluvial aquifers.

Not all ecosystems need groundwater, of course. Some terrestrial ecosystems – for example, those of the open [[desert]]s and similar arid environments – exist on irregular rainfall and the moisture it delivers to the soil, supplemented by moisture in the air. While there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role, groundwater is in fact fundamental to many of the world’s major ecosystems. Water flows between groundwaters and surface waters. Most rivers, lakes, and wetlands are fed by, and (at other places or times) feed groundwater, to varying degrees. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation, and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. [[Hyporheic zone]]s (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and [[riparian zone]]s are examples of [[ecotone]]s largely or totally dependent on groundwater.

===Subsidence===
{{main article|Groundwater-related subsidence}}

Subsidence occurs when too much water is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural equilibrium state, the [[hydraulic pressure]] of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some of the weight of the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When the aquifer gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface. The city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it.&lt;ref name="Dokka2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dokka|first1=Roy K.|title=The role of deep processes in late 20th century subsidence of New Orleans and coastal areas of southern Louisiana and Mississippi|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=116|issue=B6|year=2011|issn=0148-0227|doi=10.1029/2010JB008008|bibcode=2011JGRB..116.6403D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sneed, M|last2=Brandt, J|last3=Solt, M|title=Land Subsidence along the Delta-Mendota Canal in the Northern Part of the San Joaquin Valley, California, 2003–10|journal=USGS Scientific Investigations Report 2013-5142|date=2013|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5142/pdf/sir2013-5142.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to groundwater removal.

=== Seawater intrusion ===

In general, in very humid or undeveloped regions, the shape of the water table mimics the slope of the surface. The recharge zone of an aquifer near the seacoast is likely to be inland, often at considerable distance. In these coastal areas, a lowered water table may induce [[sea water]] to reverse the flow toward the land. Sea water moving inland is called a [[saltwater intrusion]]. In alternative fashion, [[salt]] from [[mineral]] beds may leach into the groundwater of its own accord.

=== Pollution ===
[[File:Limestone building with pollution.jpg|thumb|right|Iron III oxide staining caused by oxidation of dissolved [[iron(II) oxide]] and precipitation, from an unconfined aquifer in karst topography. [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]].]]

{{Main article|Groundwater pollution}}
Polluted groundwater is less visible, but more difficult to clean up, than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems. Polluted groundwater is mapped by sampling soils and groundwater near suspected or known sources of pollution, to determine the extent of the pollution, and to aid in the design of groundwater remediation systems. Preventing groundwater pollution near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials, collecting any leachate with drains, and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants, along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater.&lt;ref name="hydrology" /&gt;

Groundwater pollution, from [[pollutant]]s released to the ground that can work their way down into groundwater, can create a contaminant [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] within an aquifer. Pollution can occur from landfills, naturally occurring arsenic, on-site [[sanitation]] systems or other point sources, such as [[petrol station]]s with leaking underground storage tanks, or leaking sewers.

Movement of water and dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area, its advancing boundary often called a plume edge, which can then intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as [[seep]]s and [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. Different mechanism have influence on the transport of pollutants, e.g. [[diffusion]], [[adsorption]], [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[radioactive decay|decay]], in the groundwater. The interaction of groundwater contamination with surface waters is analyzed by use of [[hydrology transport model]]s.

The danger of pollution of municipal supplies is minimized by locating wells in areas of deep groundwater and impermeable soils, and careful testing and monitoring of the aquifer and nearby potential pollution sources.&lt;ref name="hydrology" /&gt;

==== Arsenic and fluoride ====
Around one-third of the world’s population drinks water from groundwater resources. Of this, about 10 percent, approximately 300 million people, obtains water from groundwater resources that are heavily polluted with arsenic or fluoride.&lt;ref&gt;Eawag (2015) Geogenic Contamination Handbook – Addressing Arsenic and Fluoride in Drinking Water. C.A. Johnson, A. Bretzler (Eds.), Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland. (download: www.eawag.ch/en/research/humanwelfare/drinkingwater/wrq/geogenic-contamination-handbook/)&lt;/ref&gt; These trace elements derive mainly from natural sources by leaching from rock and sediments.

===== New method of identifying substances that are hazardous to health =====
In 2008, the Swiss Aquatic Research Institute, Eawag, presented a new method by which hazard maps could be produced for geogenic toxic substances in groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Amini, M.; Mueller, K.; Abbaspour, K.C.; Rosenberg, T.; Afyuni, M.; Møller, M.; Sarr, M.; Johnson, C.A. (2008) Statistical modeling of global geogenic fluoride contamination in groundwaters. Environmental Science and Technology, 42(10), 3662–68, {{doi|10.1021/es071958y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amini, M.; Abbaspour, K.C.; Berg, M.; Winkel, L.; Hug, S.J.; Hoehn, E.; Yang, H.; Johnson, C.A. (2008). “Statistical modeling of global geogenic arsenic contamination in groundwater”. Environmental Science and Technology 42 (10), 3669–75. {{doi|10.1021/es702859e}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winkel, L.; Berg, M.; Amini, M.; Hug, S.J.; Johnson, C.A.

Nature Geoscience, 1, 536–42 (2008). {{doi|10.1038/ngeo254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Lado, L.; Sun, G.; Berg, M.; Zhang, Q.; Xue, H.; Zheng, Q.; Johnson, C.A. (2013) Groundwater arsenic contamination throughout China. Science, 341(6148), 866–68, {{doi|10.1126/science.1237484}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides an efficient way of determining which wells should be tested.

In 2016, the research group made its knowledge freely available on the Groundwater Assessment Platform [http://www.gapmaps.org GAP]. This offers specialists worldwide the possibility of uploading their own measurement data, visually displaying them and producing risk maps for areas of their choice. GAP also serves as a knowledge-sharing forum for enabling further development of methods for removing toxic substances from water.

== Regulations ==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=July 2015}}

=== United States ===
In the United States, laws regarding ownership and use of groundwater are generally state laws; however, regulation of groundwater to minimize pollution of groundwater is by both states and the federal-level [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Ownership and use rights to groundwater typically follow one of three main systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | chapter = Appendix H, Groundwater Law and Regulated Riparianism | title = Final Report: Restoring Great Lakes Basin Water thorough the Use of Conservation Credits and Integrated Water Balance Analysis System, The Great Lakes Protection Fund Project # 763 | url = http://www.hydra.iwr.msu.edu/iwr/glpf/FinalPublic/Appendices/H.%20%20Groundwater%20Law.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720004903/http://www.hydra.iwr.msu.edu/iwr/glpf/FinalPublic/Appendices/H.%20%20Groundwater%20Law.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 20 July 2011 | format = pdf | accessdate = 16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Rule of Capture provides each landowner the ability to capture as much groundwater as they can put to a beneficial use, but they are not guaranteed any set amount of water. As a result, well-owners are not liable to other landowners for taking water from beneath their land. State laws or regulations will often define "beneficial use", and sometimes place other limits, such as disallowing groundwater extraction which causes [[subsidence]] on neighboring property.
* Limited private ownership rights similar to [[riparian rights]] in a surface stream. The amount of groundwater right is based on the size of the surface area where each landowner gets a corresponding amount of the available water. Once adjudicated, the maximum amount of the water right is set, but the right can be decreased if the total amount of available water decreases as is likely during a drought. Landowners may sue others for encroaching upon their groundwater rights, and water pumped for use on the overlying land takes preference over water pumped for use off the land.
* In November 2006, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] published the groundwater Rule in the United States Federal Register. The EPA was worried that the groundwater system would be vulnerable to contamination from fecal matter. The point of the rule was to keep microbial pathogens out of public water sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/gwr/index.cfm Ground Water Rule (GWR) | Ground Water Rule | US EPA]. Water.epa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 groundwater Rule was an amendment of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act.
Other rules in the United States include:
* Reasonable Use Rule (American Rule): This rule does not guarantee the landowner a set amount of water, but allows unlimited extraction as long as the result does not unreasonably damage other wells or the aquifer system. Usually this rule gives great weight to historical uses and prevents new uses that interfere with the prior use.
* Groundwater scrutiny upon real estate property transactions in the US: In the US, upon commercial [[Real estate transaction|real estate property transaction]]s both groundwater and soil are the subjects of scrutiny. For [[brownfields]] sites (formerly contaminated sites that have been remediated), [[Phase I Environmental Site Assessment]]s are typically prepared, to investigate and disclose potential pollution issues.&lt;ref&gt;EPA; {{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/index |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426092518/http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/index |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; In the [[San Fernando Valley]] of California, [[real estate contract]]s for property transfer below the [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]] (SSFL) and eastward have clauses releasing the seller from [[Legal liability|liability]] for groundwater contamination consequences from existing or future pollution of the Valley Aquifer.

=== India ===
In India, groundwater regulation is controlled and maintained by the central government and four organizations; 1) Central Water Commission, 2) Central Ground Water, 3) Central Ground Water Authority, 4) [[Central Pollution Control Board]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/administrator/uploads/general/1455682937~~Overview%20of%20Ground%20Water%20in%20India.pdf|title=Overview of Groundwater in India|last=Suhag|first=Roopal|date=February 2016|website=PRS India.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws and Regulations regarding India's Groundwater:

* In 2011, the Indian Government created a Model Bill for Groundwater Management; this model selects which state governments can enforce their laws on groundwater usage and regulation.
* The Indian Government created a National Water Framework Bill in 2013. This bill ensures that India's groundwater is a public resource, and is not to be exploited by companies through [[Water privatization|privatization of water]]. The National Water Framework Bill allows for everyone to access clean drinking water, of the right to clean drinking water under Article 21 of [[Fundamental rights in India|'Right to Life']] in [[Constitution of India|India's Constitution]]. The bill indicates a want for the states of India to have full control of groundwater contained in aquifers. So far [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Goa]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu &amp; Kashmir]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[West Bengal]], [[Telangana]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Lakshadweep]], [[Puducherry]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli|Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli]] are the only ones using this bill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Section 7(g) of the Easement Act, 1882 states that every landowner has the right to collect within his limits, all water under the land and on its surface which does not pass in a defined channel.
* The 1882 Easement Act gives landowners priority over surface and groundwater that is on their land and allows them to give or take as much as they want as long as the water is on their land. This act prevents the government from enforcing regulations of groundwater, allowing many landowners to privatize their groundwater instead accessing it in community areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Canada ===
A significant portion of [[Canada]]’s [[population]] relies on the use of groundwater. In [[Canada]], roughly 8.9 million people or 30% of Canada’s population, rely on groundwater for domestic use and approximately two thirds of these users live in [[Rural area|rural areas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Groundwater Use in Canada|last=Rutherford|first=Susan|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=https://www.wcel.org/sites/default/files/publications/Groundwater%20Use%20in%20Canada.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] does not give authority over groundwater to either order of Canadian government, therefore, the matter largely falls under provincial [[jurisdiction]]
* Federal and Provincial government can share responsibilities when dealing with [[agriculture]], health, inter-provincial waters and national water-related issues.
* Federal jurisdiction in areas as boundary/trans-boundary waters, fisheries, navigation, and water on federal lands, [[First Nations]] reserves and in Territories.
* Federal jurisdiction over groundwater when [[Aquifer|aquifers]] cross inter-provincial or international boundaries.

A large federal government groundwater initiative, is the development of the multi-barrier approach. The multi-barrier approach is a system of processes to prevent the deterioration of drinking water from the source. The multi-barrier consists of three key elements:

* Source water protection;
* Drinking water treatment; and

'''Intelligent Energy''' is a fuel cell engineering company focused on the development and commercialisation of its PEM fuel cell technologies for a range of markets including automotive, stationary power and UAVs. We are headquartered in the UK, with offices and representation in the US, Japan, India, and China.

== History ==

The origins of Intelligent Energy began at [[Loughborough University]] in the UK during the late 1980s, when the University became one of Europe’s first research and development centres for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology. In 1995, the UK’s first kW-level PEM fuel cell stack was produced by the R&amp;D team.  In June of that year, Advanced Power Sources (APS) Ltd was founded as a spin-out from Loughborough University by Paul Adcock, Phil Mitchell, Jon Moore and Anthony Newbold, and was the first company in the UK formed specifically to address the development and commercialisation of PEM fuel cells.

Founded by Harry Bradbury, Intelligent Energy was established in 2001, acquiring Advanced Power Sources Ltd, together with its personnel and fuel cell related intellectual property that originated from research conducted by both APS and Loughborough University into PEM fuel cell technology. This triggered investment and enabled the company to grow its business activities.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/mainmenucomp/companiesi/586-intelligent-energy-/11138-profile-intelligent-energy-published-in-cleantech-infocus-uk-innovation-in-fuel-cells-and-hydrogen.html Profile: Intelligent Energy - October 2012]. ''Cleantech Investor''. October 2012. Retrieved 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2005, it launched the [[ENV]], the world’s first purpose-built fuel cell motorbike which gained the company recognition as a Technology Pioneer by the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2006. The ENV incorporated the company’s air-cooled fuel cell technology hybridised with a battery pack to provide 6&amp;nbsp;kW peak load to the motor to improve performance during spikes in power demand i.e. acceleration.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/03/intelligent_ene.html Intelligent Energy’s ENV Fuel Cell Motorcycle].

Intelligent Energy was acquired by Meditor Energy, part of the Meditor Group, in October 2017.

== Technology ==

Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology is divided into two platforms: air-cooled (AC) and evaporatively-cooled (EC). The air-cooled fuel cell systems use low-power fans to provide cooling and the oxidant supply for operation. Heat from the fuel cell stack is conducted to cooling plates and removed through airflow channels,  a simplified and cost-effective system for the power range from a few watts to several kilowatts. They  are used in a wide range of UAV, stationary power and automotive applications for two-wheel and small car range extender applications.

Evaporatively-cooled (EC) fuel cell systems provide power generation from a few kilowatts up to 200&amp;nbsp;kW. Efficient thermal management of the EC fuel cell stack reduces system complexity, mass and cost. These  systems are designed for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, and use modular architecture that can be quickly modified to suit the application.

== Market sectors ==

=== Automotive ===

The firm's fuel cell stacks have been developed for  small and large cars, scooters and motorbikes. 
In 2010, the company was involved in the development of the report entitled “A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis. The role of Battery Electric Vehicles, Plug-In Hybrids and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles”, produced by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] with input from car manufacturers, oil and gas suppliers, utilities and industrial gas companies, wind turbine and electrolyser companies as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations. The report concluded, amongst other findings, that fuel cell vehicles are technology ready, and cost competitive, and that decarbonisation targets for Europe are unlikely to be met without the introduction of fuel cell powertrains.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;[http://www.fch-ju.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Power_trains_for_Europe.pdf/ A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis]. ''Fuel Cells and Hydrogen''. 9 November 2010. Retrieved 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jarylo''' ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: Ярило or Ярила; {{lang-pl|Jaryło}}; {{lang-hr|Jura or Juraj}}; {{lang-sr|Јарило}}; {{lang-be|Ярыла}}), alternatively '''Yarylo''', '''Iarilo''', or '''Gerovit''', is a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic god]] of [[vegetation deity|vegetation]], [[fertility]] and [[spring (season)|spring]]time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2805;jsessionid=1791FDC950EA63F0F2802FBA864BFC30 source of Jarilio name in IAU Nomenclature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Proto-Slavic root *jarъ (jar), from Proto-Indo-European *yōr-, *yeh₁ro-, from *yeh₁r-, means ''spring'' or ''summer'', ''strong'', ''furious'', loaded with youthful life-force.
This youthful life-force was considered sacred in the Slavic pre-christian religion and the god personifying this sacred force was thus called Jarovit, or [[Hypocorism|hypocoristically]] Jarilo.

The only historic source that mentions this deity is a 12th-century biography of the proselytizing German bishop [[Otto of Bamberg]], who, during his expeditions to convert the pagan tribes of [[Wends|Wendish]] and [[Polabian Slavs]], encountered festivals in honor of the war-god Gerovit in the cities of [[Wolgast]] and [[Havelberg]]. Gerovit is most likely a German corruption of the original Slavic name ''Jarovit''.

Up until the 19th century in [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Serbia]], folk festivals called ''Jarilo'' were celebrated in late spring or early summer. Early researchers of [[Slavic mythology]]  recognised in them relics of pagan ceremonies in honor of an eponymous spring deity. 
In Northern [[Croatia]] and Southern [[Slovenia]], especially [[White Carniola]], similar spring festivals were called ''Jurjevo'' or ''Zeleni Juraj'' or ''Zeleni Jurij'' ([[Green Man|Green George]]), nominally dedicated to [[St. George]], and fairly similar to the Jarilo festivals of other Slavic nations.

All of these spring festivals were basically alike: processions of villagers would go around for a walk in the country or through villages on this day. Something or someone was identified to be Jarilo or Juraj: a doll made of straw, a man or a child adorned with green branches, or a girl dressed like a man, riding on a horse. Certain songs were sung which alluded to Juraj/Jarilo's return from a distant land across the sea, the return of spring into the world, blessings, fertility and abundance to come.

==Myth==
[[Radoslav Katičić]] and Vitomir Belaj attempted to reconstruct the mythology surrounding Jarilo.
According to these authors,  he was a fairly typical [[life-death-rebirth deity]], believed to be (re)born and killed every year. His mythical life cycle followed the yearly life of various wheat plants, from seeding through vegetation to harvest.

Jarilo was a son of the supreme Slavic god of thunder, [[Perun]], his lost, missing, tenth son, born on the last night of February, the festival of ''Velja Noć'' (Great Night), the pagan Slavic celebration of the [[New Year]]. On the same night, however, Jarilo was stolen from his father and taken to the world of the dead, where he was adopted and raised by [[Veles (god)|Veles]], Perun's enemy, Slavic god of the underworld and cattle. The Slavs believed the underworld to be an ever-green world of eternal spring and wet, grassy plains, where Jarilo grew up guarding the cattle of his adoptive father. In the mythical geography of ancient Slavs, the land of the dead was assumed to lie across the sea, where migrating birds would fly every winter.

With the advent of spring, Jarilo returned from the underworld, that is, bringing spring and fertility to the land. Spring festivals of Jurjevo/Jarilo that survived in later folklore celebrated his return. Katičić identified a key phrase of ancient mythical texts which described this sacred return of vegetation and fertility as a rhyme '''hoditi/roditi''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Zeleni Lug: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2010 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA / Matica Hrvatska |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-49-4 |url=http://www.matica.hr/knjige/782/ |ref=Katičić 2010 |page=9-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; (to walk/to give birth to), which survived in folk songs:
:''...Gdje Jura/Jare/Jarilo hodit, tam vam polje rodit...''
:"...Where Jura/Jare/Jarilo walks, there your field gives birth..."

The first of the gods to notice Jarilo's return to the living world was [[Marzanna|Morana]], a goddess of death and nature, and also a daughter of Perun and Jarilo's twin-sister. The two of them would fall in love and court each other through a series of traditional, established rituals, imitated in various Slavic courting or wedding customs. The divine wedding between brother and sister, two children of the supreme god, was celebrated in a festival of summer [[solstice]], today variously known as Ivanje or [[Ivan Kupala]] in the various Slavic countries. This sacred union of Jarilo and Morana, deities of vegetation and of nature, assured abundance, fertility and blessing to the earth, and also brought temporary peace between two major Slavic gods, Perun and Veles, signifying heaven and underworld. Thus, all mythical prerequisites were met for a bountiful and blessed harvest that would come in late summer.

However, since Jarilo's life was ultimately tied to the vegetative cycle of the cereals, after the harvest (which was ritually seen as a murder of crops), Jarilo also met his death. The myth explained this by the fact that he was unfaithful to his wife, and so she (or her father Perun, or his other nine sons, her brothers) kills him in retribution. This rather gruesome death is in fact a ritual sacrifice, and Morana uses parts of Jarilo's body to build herself a new house. This is a mythical metaphor which alludes to rejuvenation of the entire cosmos, a concept fairly similar to that of Scandinavian myth of [[Ymir]], a giant from whose body the gods created the world.

Without her husband, however, Morana turns into a frustrated old hag, a terrible and dangerous goddess of death, frost and upcoming winter, and eventually dies by the end of the year. At the beginning of the next year, both she and Jarilo are born again, and the entire myth starts anew.

From comparison to [[Baltic mythology]] and from Slavic folklore accounts, one can deduce that Jarilo was associated with the Moon. His somewhat mischievous nature, which ultimately results in his betrayal of his wife, was likened to the Moon's changing phases.

Katičić and Belaj suggest that the god had an equine characteristic. 
Folk accounts strongly emphasize the presence of a horse (in Belarusian festivals, for instance, Jarilo was symbolised by a girl dressed as a man and mounted on a horse), and also the fact Jarilo walked a long way and his feet are sore. Thus, he is a rider on a horse who also "walks".

*In historic descriptions of West Slavic paganism, one often finds references to sacred horses held in temples, which were used for divination, and predictions were made on the basis of how the horse walked through rows of spears sticking from the ground.
*In certain customs of some Baltic and Slavic wedding celebrations, a horse symbolises a young husband.
*In some Slavic folk songs, an angry young wife, apparently cheated upon by her husband, kills a horse or orders her brothers to kill it for her.
*Jarilo's identification as a mischievous god may involve the ability of [[shapeshifting]]. This is seen in other mischievous pagan deities, such as [[Proteus]] and [[Loki]], who himself once took the form of a horse.

All this led Katičić and Belaj to conclude that Jarilo himself was conceived of as a horse.

==Identification with St. George==
Jarilo became identified with [[St. George]] and [[John_the_Evangelist | St. John]] after the arrival of Christianity, because the festivities of those two saints fall in the period between the first grow of grass and leaves and harvest in the cycle of annual vegetation and fertility. This made them especially suitable as christian interpretations of this god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Naša stara vjera: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2017 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA/Matica Hrvatska |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-98-2 |url=http://www.matica.hr/knjige/nasa-stara-vjera-1206/ |ref=Katičić 2017 |page=18 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification with Dionysus==
Some [[neopagans]] identify Jarilo with [[Dionysus]], as they are both gods of fertility, forest, and youth, who die and rise again. Another similarity is his relationship with [[Persephone]], Dionysus's sister, and in some cases lover, who is an underworld goddess just like Morana, Jarilo's wife and sister. They are also both sons of the respective sky deity.  The Norse rebirth deity [[Baldr]] also bears close similarities.

'''Karl Marx'''&lt;ref name="his_name group=note"&gt;The name "Karl Heinrich Marx", used in various lexicons, is based on an error. His birth certificate says "Carl Heinrich Marx", while elsewhere "Karl Marx" is used. "K. H. Marx" is used only in his poetry collections and the transcript of his dissertation; since Marx wanted to honour his father, who had died in 1838, he called himself "Karl Heinrich" in three documents.[https://archive.org/stream/handwrterbuchder04conr#page/1130/mode/1up The article] by Friedrich Engels "Marx, Karl Heinrich" in ''Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften'' (Jena, 1892, column 1130 to 1133 see ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works|MECW]]'' Volume 22, pp. 337–345) does not justify assigning Marx a middle name.

Born in [[Trier]], Germany, to a [[History of Jews in Germany|Jewish]] middle-class family, Marx studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] at university. Due to his political publications, Marx became [[Statelessness|stateless]] and lived in exile in [[London]] for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker [[Friedrich Engels]] and publish his writings, researching in the [[British Museum Reading Room|reading room of the British Museum]]. His best-known titles are the 1848 [[pamphlet]], ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', and the three-volume ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]''. His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.

Marx's theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as [[Marxism]]—hold that human societies develop through [[class struggle]]. In [[capitalism]], this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the [[bourgeoisie]]) that control the [[means of production]] and the working classes (known as the [[proletariat]]) that enable these means by selling their [[labour power]] in return for wages.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt; Employing a critical approach known as [[historical materialism]], Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and [[crisis theory|crisis-prone nature]], would eventuate the working class' development of [[class consciousness]], leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, [[communist]] society constituted by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program'']&lt;/ref&gt; Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised [[Revolution|revolutionary action]] to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic [[emancipation]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24" /&gt;

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and [[Criticisms of Marxism|criticised]].&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt; His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and subsequent economic thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]].

==Biography==

===Childhood and early education: 1818–1836===
Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to [[Heinrich Marx]] (1777–1838) and [[Henriette Pressburg]] (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in [[Trier]], a town then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s [[Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine|Province of the Lower Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=8, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was ethnically [[Jewish]]. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch [[rabbi]], while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–5}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=7–9, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. He became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of [[Moselle wine|Moselle]] vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and after the abrogation of [[Jewish emancipation]] in the Rhineland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q0OHHNyFeEC&amp;pg=PA419|title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews – A History|last=Carroll|first=James|date=1 April 2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0547348889|location=|pages=419|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herschel converted from [[Judaism]] to join the state [[Prussian Union of Churches|Evangelical Church of Prussia]], taking on the German forename Heinrich over the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Herschel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–6}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet [[Heinrich Heine]], also born to a German Jewish family in the [[Rhineland]], with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Raddatz ''Karl Marx: A Political Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], interested in the ideas of the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Voltaire]]. A [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, at that time being an [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=5, 8–12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=11}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, Heinrich Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near  the [[Porta Nigra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=10}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, [[Henriette Pressburg]], was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company [[Philips Electronics]]. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both [[Gerard Philips|Gerard]] and [[Anton Philips]] and great-grandmother to [[Frits Philips]]. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and [[Jenny von Westphalen|Jenny Marx]] would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.&lt;ref&gt;''Francis Wheen, Karl Marx: A Life'', (Fourth Estate, 1999), {{ISBN|1-85702-637-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By employing many [[Liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=12–15}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=7–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the [[University of Bonn]] wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=15–16}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a condition referred to as a "weak chest",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18. While at the University at Bonn, Marx joined the Poets' Club, a group containing political radicals that were monitored by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=20}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (''Landsmannschaft der Treveraner''), at one point serving as club co-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=16}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 he took part in a duel with a member of the university's Borussian Korps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegelianism and early journalism: 1836–1843===
Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to [[Jenny von Westphalen]], an educated baroness of the Prussian ruling class who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father [[Ludwig von Westphalen]] (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=23–30}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–21, 33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=15, 20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=70–71}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=52–53}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=61–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.  &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=31}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first term, Marx attended lectures of [[Eduard Gans]] who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasizing particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question, and lectures of [[Karl von Savigny]] who represented the [[Historical School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that "without philosophy nothing could be accomplished".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=32–34}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club (''Doktorklub''), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas and through them became involved with a group of [[Political radicalism|radical thinkers]] known as the [[Young Hegelians]] in 1837. They gathered around [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] assumptions, but adopted his [[Marxist dialectic|dialectical method]] in order to criticise established society, politics and religion from a leftist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=34–38}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=25–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=44,69–70}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=17–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sperber|2013|pp=55–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jenny-von-Westphalen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jenny von Westphalen]] in the 1830s]]

By 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, ''[[Scorpion and Felix]]'', a drama, ''[[Oulanem]]'', as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=18–19}}. These love poems would be published posthumously in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 531–632.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, [[art history]] and the translation of Latin classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He began co-operating with [[Bruno Bauer]] on editing Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion|Philosophy of Religion]]'' in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Marx's thesis was posthumously published in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 25–107.&lt;/ref&gt; which he completed in 1841. It was described as "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal [[University of Jena]], whose faculty awarded him his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in April 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=28–29, 33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://willamette.edu/cla/classics/careers/marx/index.html | title=Classics: Karl Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Marx and Bauer were both [[atheism|atheists]], in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled ''Archiv des Atheismus'' (''Atheistic Archives''), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to [[Bonn]] from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=38–45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=32–33, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=49}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx moved to [[Cologne]] in 1842, where he became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' (''Rhineland News''), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=34–36, 42–44}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=35–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper attracted the attention of the Prussian [[censorship|government censors]], who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=47}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=48–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=60–61}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=47–48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=50–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris: 1843–1845===
In 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical leftist Parisian newspaper, the ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'' (''German-French Annals''), then being set up by the German socialist [[Arnold Ruge]] to bring together German and French radicals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=68–69, 72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 [[Rue Vaneau]], they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=77–79}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=62–66}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=73–74, 94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the ''Jahrbücher'' was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian [[Collectivist anarchism|anarchist collectivist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=64–65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx contributed two essays to the paper, "[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[On the Jewish Question]]",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, "On the Jewish Question", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  the latter introducing his belief that the [[proletariat]] were a revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=65–70, 74–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of [[Heinrich Heine]]'s satirical odes on King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig of Bavaria]], leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=72, 75–76}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=88–90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, ''[[Vorwärts!]]'' (''Forward!''). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the [[League of the Just]], a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings, but did not join.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=66–67, 112}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=79–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Vorwärts!'', Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Engels 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Engels]], whom Marx met in 1844; the two became lifelong friends and collaborators]]

On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist [[Friedrich Engels]] at the [[Café de la Régence]], beginning a lifelong friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels showed Marx his recently published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, Philip: ''Paris Between Empires'', p. 390 (St. Martin Press, NY) 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "The Condition of the Working Class in England", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295–596.&lt;/ref&gt; convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, [[Bruno Bauer]]. This work was published in 1845 as ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Holy Family", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4'', pp. 3–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians [[Max Stirner]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.&lt;ref name="et"/&gt;

During the time that he lived at 38 Rue Vanneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845),&lt;ref&gt;Taken from the caption of a picture of the house in a group of pictures located between pages 160 and 161 in the book "Karl Marx: A Biography", written by a team of historians and writers headed by P. N. Fedoseyev (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx engaged in an intensive study of [[political economy]] ([[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], ''etc.'')'',''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'' ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; the French socialists (especially [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri St. Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]])&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' (Oxford University Press: London, 1963) pp. 90–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of France.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of political economy is a study that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life&lt;ref&gt;Larisa Miskievich, "Preface" to Volume 28 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and would result in his major economic work{{mdash}}the three-volume series called ''Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', ''Volume 36'' and ''Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996, 1997 and 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: [[Hegel]]'s dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of "Marxism" were in place by the autumn of 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', pp. 35–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy{{mdash}}not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies:  he sought "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An outline of "Marxism" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.&lt;ref&gt;Note 54 contained on page 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844" ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 229–346.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach.  Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Theses on Feuerbach" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it".&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach," contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engels1999"/&gt; In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down ''Vorwärts!'', with the interior minister, [[François Guizot]], expelling Marx from France.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/&gt; At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.

===Brussels: 1845–1848===
[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|upright|The first edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', published in German in 1848]]

Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/&gt; In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including [[Moses Hess]], [[Karl Heinzen]] and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]]. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild ["New Book Publishing House"]: Dresden, 1972) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Mary Burns]], Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartists]], a socialist movement in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [New Book Publishing House]: Dresden, 1972) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; to August 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Engels already know the English language,&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/&gt; Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/&gt; Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "German Ideology" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 19–539.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Marx broke with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with [[Karl Grun]] and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "idealism". In ''German Ideology'', Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; ''German Ideology'' is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, ''German Ideology'' would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See Note 71 on p. 672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6''(International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 105–212.&lt;/ref&gt; and offered it as a response to the "petty bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as expressed in his book ''[[The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marx+Family and Engels.jpg|thumb|Marx, Engels and Marx's daughters]]

These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation [[League of the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1973) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 671–672.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.&lt;ref&gt;Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'', p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev,''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt; This new open political society was called the Communist League.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new [[Communist League]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Principles of Communism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) pp. 341–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work — a programme of action for the [[Communist League]]. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published on 21 February 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'', pp. 477–519.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Communist Manifesto'' laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref name="ShillingMellor2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Shilling|author2=Philip A Mellor|title=The Sociological Ambition: Elementary Forms of Social and Moral Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2001|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6549-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the [[bourgeoisie]] (the wealthy capitalist class) and the [[proletariat]] (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the ''Manifesto'' presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar48|Marx and Engels 1848]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the [[Revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/&gt; In France, [[French Revolution of 1848|a revolution]] led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]].&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/&gt; Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000&lt;ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/&gt; or 5,000 francs&lt;ref&gt;Saul Kussiel Padover, ''Karl Marx, an intimate biography'', McGraw-Hill, 1978, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; he allegedly used a third of it to arm [[Belgium|Belgian]] workers who were planning revolutionary action.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,&lt;ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David McLellan 1973 ''Karl Marx: His life and Thought''. New York: Harper and Row. pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Felix |first1=David |year=1982 |title=Heute Deutschland!

===Cologne: 1848–1849===
Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a [[German Workers' Club]] with various German socialists living there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the ''Demands of the Communist Party in Germany'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "Demands of the Communist Party" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 7'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) pp. 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the ''Communist Manifesto'', believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June, Marx started publication of a daily newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the Communist League, according to [[Friedrich Engels]] it remained "a simple dictatorship by Marx".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DL-Marx"/&gt;

Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Splichal2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehring2003"/&gt; although each time he was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehring2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in [[Prussia]] collapsed and the king, [[Frederick William IV]], introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Consequently, the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May.&lt;ref name="DL-Marx"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 137–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a [[cholera]] epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2010"/&gt;

===Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860===
Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850 a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by [[August Willich]] and [[Karl Schapper]] began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"/&gt; They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (''circa'' 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.

After a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.&lt;ref&gt;Note 269 contained on page 674 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society held their meetings in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[Soho]], central London's entertainment district.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 151–155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harriss2006"/&gt; This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Note 269 on page 674 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''New-York Daily Tribune'' and journalism ===
In the early period in London, Marx committed himself almost exclusively to revolutionary activities, such that his family endured extreme poverty.&lt;ref name="DusselMoseley2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egsbio"/&gt; His main source of income was Engels, whose own source was his wealthy industrialist father.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; In Prussia as editor of his own newspaper, and contributor to others ideologically aligned, Marx could reach his audience, the working classes. In London, without finances to run a newspaper themselves, he and Engels turned to international journalism.  At one stage they were being published by six newspapers from England, the United States, [[Prussia]], Austria and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's principal earnings came from his work as European correspondent, from 1852 to 1862, for the ''[[New-York Daily Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="Kluger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kluger|first=Richard|title=The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} and from also producing articles for more "bourgeois" newspapers.  Marx had his articles translated from German by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Pieper (revolutionary)|de|3=Wilhelm Pieper (Revolutionär)|lt=Wilhelm Pieper}}, until his proficiency in English had become adequate.&lt;ref name="Dispatches"/&gt;

The ''New-York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in April 1841 by  [[Horace Greeley]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Its editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among them [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] and the journalist [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]], who was editor-in-chief.  Dana, a [[fourierist]] and an [[abolitionist]], was Marx's contact. 

The ''Tribune'' was a vehicle for Marx to reach a transatlantic public to make a "hidden war" to [[Henry Charles Carey]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perelman : How Karl Marx Helped Shape the Republican Party [https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/12/25/how-karl-marx-helped-shape-the-republican-party] - More : Karl Mary and Henry Carey in the New-York Tribune [https://michaelperelman.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/political-economy-and-the-press-karl-marx-and-henry-carey-at-the-new-york-tribune/]&lt;/ref&gt;. The journal had wide working-class appeal from its foundation;  at two cents, it was inexpensive;&lt;ref&gt;Taken from a picture on page 327 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and, with about 50,000 copies per issue, its circulation was the widest in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kluger"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Its editorial ethos was progressive and its anti-slavery stance reflected Greeley's.&lt;ref name="Kluger"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  Marx's first article for the paper, on the British parliamentary elections, was published on 21 August 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Elections in England – Tories and Whigs" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 327–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 1857 Dana informed Marx that, due to the economic recession, only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, the ''Tribune'' discharged all its correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Marx resumed contributions in September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform him that there was no longer space in the ''Tribune'' for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs.&lt;ref name="MECW"&gt;[https://ia801605.us.archive.org/29/items/MarxEngelsCollectedWorksVolume10MKarlMarx/Marx%20%26%20Engels%20Collected%20Works%20Volume%2041_%20Ka%20-%20Karl%20Marx.pdf Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works, vol.41]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the ''New York Sun'', at which he was editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knopf Publishing, New York, 1986) p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1857, Dana invited Marx to contribute articles, mainly on military history, to the ''[[New American Cyclopedia]]'', an idea of George Ripley, Dana's friend and literary editor of the ''Tribune''. In all, 67 Marx-Engels articles were published, of which 51 written by Engels, although Marx did some research for them in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1850s, American popular interest in European affairs waned and Marx's articles turned to topics such as the "slavery crisis" and the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, in the "War Between the States".&lt;ref&gt;Note 1 at page 367 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 19'' (International Publishers: New York, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
Between December 1851 and March 1852, Marx worked on his theoretical work about the [[French Revolution of 1848]], titled  ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon" contained in the ''Collected Works of KarlMarx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 99–197.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he explored concepts in [[historical materialism]], [[class struggle]], [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], and victory of the proletariat over the [[bourgeois]] state.&lt;ref name="Marx2008"/&gt;

The 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the [[young Marx]]'s [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and the more [[mature Marx]]'s&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2000"/&gt; scientific ideology associated with [[structural Marxism]];&lt;ref name="Johnston2000"/&gt;  however, not all scholars accept this distinction.&lt;ref name="Hook1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GeorgeScanlan1975"/&gt; For Marx and Engels, their experience of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] to 1849 were formative in the development of their theory of economics and historical progression. After the "failures" of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Marx and his fellow communists, whom he denounced as "adventurists". Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that "will power" could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite.

Recession in the United States' economy in 1852 gave Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity. Yet, this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America's western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by their national borders. When the so-called "[[Panic of 1857]]" in the United States spread globally, it broke all economic theory models,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first truly global economic crisis.

Financial necessity had forced Marx to abandon economic studies in 1844 and give thirteen years to working on other projects. He had always sought to return to economics.

===The First International and ''Capital''===
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich Das Kapital Marx 1867.jpg|thumb|upright|The first volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'']]

Marx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune's'' editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the ''Tribune.''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, Marx became involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also known as the First International),&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt; to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864.&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007-267"/&gt; In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876).&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.&lt;ref name="JessopWheatley1999-526"/&gt; The most important political event during the existence of the International was the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "[[The Civil War in France]]", a defence of the Commune.&lt;ref name="Curtis1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Civil War in France" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 22'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 307–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying and reflecting on the works of [[political economy|political economists]] and on economic data.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20"/&gt; By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title ''[[Grundrisse|''Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy'']]''.&lt;ref name="Segrest2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 5–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the Preparatory Materials section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) pp. 421–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 1859, Marx published ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 257–417.&lt;/ref&gt; his first serious economic work. This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (English title: ''Capital: Critique of Political Economy''), which he intended to publish at a later date. In ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', Marx expands on the [[labour theory of value]] advocated by [[David Ricardo]]. The work was enthusiastically received, and the edition sold out quickly.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl-Marx.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Marx in the 1870s]]

The successful sales of ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—''Das Kapital'' and the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; ''Theories of Surplus Value'' is often referred to as the fourth volume of ''Das Kapital'' and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name="Rockmore2002"/&gt; In 1867, the first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production.&lt;ref name="BrewerMarx1984-15"/&gt; Here Marx elaborated his [[labour theory of value]], which had been influenced by [[Thomas Hodgskin]]. Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's "admirable work" ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' at more than one point in ''Capital.''&lt;ref&gt;See footnote #2 on the bottom of page 360 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production. No longer was there any "natural reward of individual labour. Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgskin, ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' (London, 1825) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first volume of ''Capital'', Marx outlined his conception of [[surplus value]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Demand for a Russian language edition of ''Capital'' soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German language edition of ''Capital'' had been sold out and a second edition was published.

Volumes II and III of ''Capital'' remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life. Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx's death.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Volume II of ''Capital'' was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name ''Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 36'' (International Publishers: New York, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Volume III of ''Capital'' was published a year later in October 1894 under the name ''Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theories of Surplus Value'' derived from the sprawling ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863'', a ''second'' draft for ''Capital'', the latter spanning volumes 30-34 of the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels''.  Specifically, ''Theories of Surplus Value'' runs from the latter part of the ''Collected Works' '' thirtieth volume through the end of their thirty-second volume;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988) pp. 318–451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–543.&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile, the larger ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863'' run from the start of the ''Collected Works' '' thirtieth volume through the first half of their thirty-fourth volume.  The latter half of the Collected Works' thirty-fourth volume consists of the surviving fragments of the ''Economic Manuscripts of 1863-1864'', which represented a ''third'' draft for Capital, and a large portion of which is included as an appendix to the Penguin edition of ''Capital'', volume I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/introduction.htm |title=Economic Works of Karl Marx 1861-1864 |website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German language abridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published as the "fourth volume" of ''Capital'' in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;See note 228 on page 475 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marx old.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx in 1882]]

During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' opposed the tendency of his followers [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]] to compromise with the [[state socialism]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in the interests of a united socialist party.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref name="CGP P1"/&gt;

In a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]] dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village ''[[mir (social)|mir]]''.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Volume 46'' (International Publishers: New York, 1992) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides".&lt;ref name="k72"/&gt; Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that "at the core of the capitalist system&amp;nbsp;... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production".&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation". He added that "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, ''etc''. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies".&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, First draft of letter to Vera Zasulich [1881]. In Marx-Engels 'Collected Works', Volume 24, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

==Personal life==

===Family===
[[File:Jenny laura marx.jpg|thumb|upright|Jenny Carolina and Jenny Laura Marx (1869): all the Marx daughters were named Jenny in honour of their mother, Jenny von Westphalen.]]

Marx and von Westphalen had seven children together, but partly owing to the poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer (2000).'' Marx a very short introduction''. p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-285405-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were: [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny Caroline]] (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); [[Laura Marx|Jenny Laura]] (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); [[Eleanor Marx|Jenny Julia Eleanor]] (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy,&lt;ref name=Montefiore&gt;{{cite news |last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|title=The Means of Reproduction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/love-and-capital-by-mary-gabriel-book-review.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of wedlock by his housekeeper, [[Helene Demuth]].&lt;ref name="Karl Marx"/&gt;

Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. While in Paris, he used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London he signed off his letters as "A. Williams". His friends referred to him as "Moor", owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him "Old Nick" and "Charley".&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/&gt; He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as "General", his housekeeper Helene as "Lenchen" or "Nym", while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as "Qui Qui, [[Emperor of China]]" and another, Laura, was known as "[[Cockatoo|Kakadou]]" or "the [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]".&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/&gt;

===Health===
Marx was afflicted by poor health (what he himself described as "the wretchedness of existence")&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, "none of which are good for liver patients", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount "and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: "These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes".&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Princeton historian J.E. Seigel, in his late teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on ''Capital'' (which he never completed),&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 98; Siegel, 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, "was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, 495-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a [[retrodiagnosis]] of Marx's skin disease was made by [[dermatologist]] Sam Shuster of [[Newcastle University]] and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of [[apocrine]] ducts opening into [[hair follicles]]. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the ''Marx/Engels Collected Works''. There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, [[perianal]], [[genital]] ([[Human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]) and [[suprapubic]] regions and inner thighs, "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis "can now be made definitively".&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuster went on to consider the potential [[psychosocial]] effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found "much evidence" in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop [[Marx's theory of alienation|his theory of alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]], East [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]

Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a [[catarrh]] that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the [[bronchitis]] and [[pleurisy]] that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a [[Statelessness|stateless person]].&lt;ref name="stateless"/&gt; Family and friends in London buried his body in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists ([[George Eliot]]'s grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&amp;pg=PA382 p. 382].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt;

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and Friedrich Engels. Engels' speech included the passage: {{quote|On the 14th&amp;nbsp;of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the greatest living thinker ceased to think. He had been left alone for scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his armchair, peacefully gone to sleep—but forever.&lt;ref name="1883: The death of Karl Marx"/&gt;}}

Marx's surviving daughters [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] and [[Laura Marx|Laura]], as well as [[Charles Longuet]] and [[Paul Lafargue]], Marx's two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; He had been predeceased by his wife and his eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Two [[telegram]]s from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Together with Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne communist trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as "an old member of the Communist League"; and [[Carl Schorlemmer]], a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and a communist activist involved in the 1848 [[Revolution in Baden|Baden revolution]].&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Another attendee of the funeral was [[Ray Lankester]], a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt;

Upon his own death in 1895, Engels left Marx's two surviving daughters a "significant portion" of his considerable estate (valued in 2011 at US$4.8m).&lt;ref name=Montefiore /&gt;

Marx and his family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The [[Tomb of Karl Marx|tomb]] at the new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The posthumous life of Karl Marx, Highgate Cemetery|url=http://thelondondead.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/the-posthumous-life-of-karl-marx.html|website=The London Dead|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; bears the carved message: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Workers of All Lands Unite]]", the final line of ''The Communist Manifesto''; and, from the 11th "[[Theses on Feuerbach|Thesis on Feuerbach]]" (as edited by Engels), "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways{{mdash}}the point however is to change it".&lt;ref name="wh1" /&gt; The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] had the monument with a portrait bust by [[Laurence Bradshaw]] erected and Marx's original tomb had only humble adornment.&lt;ref name="wh1"/&gt; In 1970, there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm "Tomb raiders' failed attack on Marx grave"], ''Camden New Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] remarked: "One cannot say Marx died a failure" because although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the leftist movements in Germany and Russia. Within 25 years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics were each gaining between 15 and 47 per cent in those countries with [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hob11|Hobsbawm 2011]]. pp. 03–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
{{Marxism}}

===Influences===
{{Main article|Influences on Karl Marx}}
Marx's thought demonstrates influences from many thinkers including, but not limited to:
* [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus']] philosophy, including the forceful and equal redistribution of resources (land) and the equality of all citizens&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Biography of Lycurgus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;
* The classical [[political economy]] (economics) of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt;, as well as [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]'s critique of laissez-faire economics and analysis of the precarious state of the proletariat&lt;ref name="Paresh" /&gt;
* [[History of the Left in France|French socialist thought]],&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; in particular the thought of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]&lt;ref name="Beilharz1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;
* Earlier German philosophical materialism among the [[Young Hegelians]], particularly that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]],&lt;ref name=et/&gt; as well as the French materialism of the late 18th century, including [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and [[d'Holbach]]
* The working class analysis by [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt; as well as the early descriptions of class provided by French liberals and Saint-Simonians such as [[François Guizot]] and [[Augustin Thierry]]
* Marx's Judaic legacy has been identified as formative to both his moral outlook&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry ''Why Marx Was Right''  Yale University Press, 2011, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and his materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, Jerrold  ''Marx's Fate'' Princeton University Press, 1978, pp.  112–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's view of history, which came to be called [[historical materialism]] (controversially adapted as the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) [[dialectic]]ally.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; However, Hegel had thought in [[idealist]] terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in [[materialist]] terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Where Hegel saw the "spirit" as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] language in several of his works: in ''The Communist Manifesto'' he proclaims "A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre", and in ''The Capital'' he refers to capital as "[[necromancy]] that surrounds the products of labour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX's VAMPIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; Marx criticised [[utopian socialists]], arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the [[economic system]] can bring about real change.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The other important contributions to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of [[class conflict]] and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt;, as well as from the social democrat [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz]], who in ''Die Bewegung der Produktion'' described the movement of society as "flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production."&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx therefore concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wh1"/&gt;

===Philosophy and social thought===
Marx's polemic with other thinkers often occurred through [[critique]] and thus he has been called "the first great user of [[critical method]] in social sciences".&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; He criticised speculative philosophy, equating [[metaphysics]] with ideology.&lt;ref name="Bannerji2001"/&gt; By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;

Like Tocqueville, who described a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot,&lt;ref&gt;Annelien de Dijn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a3SFelqBLw8C&amp;dq= ''French Political Thought from Montesquieu to Tocqueville''], Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also broke with classical thinkers who spoke of a single tyrant and with [[Montesquieu]], who discussed the nature of the single despot. Instead, Marx set out to analyse "the despotism of capital".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy'', vol. 1, trans. Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling (New York: Modem Library, 1906), 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, Marx assumed that [[human history]] involves transforming [[human nature]], which encompasses both human beings and material objects.&lt;ref name="Ollman1973"/&gt; Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves.&lt;ref name = "Marx_labour"&gt;Marx K (1999).

Original work published 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] agent, renders its potential counterpart an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] to be apprehended.&lt;ref name = "Marx_critique"/&gt; Marx further argues that by moulding nature&lt;ref name = "Lefever"&gt;See also Lefever DM; Lefever JT (1977).

[[File:Marx et Engels à Shanghai.jpg|upright|thumb|A monument dedicated to Marx and Engels in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]]]
Marx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref name="Mészáros2006"/&gt; As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; Marx described this loss as [[commodity fetishism]], in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.&lt;ref name="Balibar1995"/&gt;

[[Commodity fetishism]] provides an example of what Engels called "[[false consciousness]]",&lt;ref name="KołakowskiFalla2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leszek Kołakowski|author2=Paul Stephen Falla|title=Main currents of Marxism: the founders, the golden age, the breakdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUCxpznbkaoC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=29 October 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-06054-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By "ideology", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.&lt;ref name="Hernadi1989"/&gt; Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods, but also the production of ideas (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson1990"/&gt; An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction] to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, in: ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'', February 1844&lt;/ref&gt; to his 1843 ''Contribution to the [[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'': {{quote|Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.

Whereas his [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] senior thesis at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|de|3=Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|lt=Gymnasium zu Trier}} argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic ''status quo'' and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref name="SwatosKivisto1998"/&gt;

Marx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also [[economic determinism]]).&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; [[Accumulation of capital]] shapes the [[social system]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; For Marx, [[social change]] was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources and technology but not human labor.  The [[relations of production]] are the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Together, these compose the [[mode of production]] and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], where the base (or substructure) is the economic system and superstructure is the cultural and political system.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudalism]]).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Marx never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], but scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt; On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical [[economic depressions|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, he characterized capitalism as "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, [[technological progress]], increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]] and [[scientific revolution]]) that are responsible for progress.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010" /&gt; Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt;

According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference "[[surplus value]]" and argued that it was based on [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Although Marx describes capitalists as [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood,&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; he notes that drawing profit is "by no means an injustice"&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; and that capitalists cannot go against the system.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; The problem is the "cancerous cell" of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]].&lt;ref name=wk/&gt; He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Since Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth and collapse.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:
{{quote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&amp;nbsp;... the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&amp;nbsp;... The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Outside a factory in [[Oldham]]. Marx believed that industrial workers (the [[proletariat]]) would rise up around the world.]]

Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:
{{quote|The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.&lt;ref name="manifesto"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop [[class consciousness]], in time realising that they can and must change the system.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx argued in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: {{quote|Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.&lt;ref name="Elster1985"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; In such a [[utopia]]n world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; As he wrote in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme"/&gt; While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot "attain their goal by peaceful means" the "lever of our revolution must be force".&lt;ref&gt;"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries – such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland – where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour."

===International relations ===
Marx viewed [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as the main counter-revolutionary threat to European revolutions.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Kevin B. Anderson (2016). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TxCZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239 Marx at the Margins: On Nationalism, Ethnicity, and Non-Western Societies]''". University of Chicago Press. pp.49-239. {{ISBN|022634570X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Crimean War]], Marx backed the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its allies Britain and France against Russia.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; He was absolutely opposed to [[Pan-Slavism]], viewing it as an instrument of Russian foreign policy.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; Marx had considered the [[Slavs|Slavic]] nations except [[Poles]] as 'counter-revolutionary'. Marx and Engels published in the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' in February 1849:

{{quote|To the sentimental phrases about brotherhood which we are being offered here on behalf of the most counter-revolutionary nations of Europe, we reply that hatred of Russians was and still is the primary revolutionary passion among Germans; that since the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolution]] [of 1848] hatred of Czechs and Croats has been added, and that only by the most determined use of terror against these Slav peoples can we, jointly with the Poles and Magyars, safeguard the revolution. We know where the enemies of the revolution are concentrated, ''viz''. in Russia and the Slav regions of Austria, and no fine phrases, no allusions to an undefined democratic future for these countries can deter us from treating our enemies as enemies. Then there will be a struggle, an “inexorable life-and-death struggle”, against those Slavs who betray the revolution; an annihilating fight and ruthless terror — not in the interests of Germany, but in the interests of the revolution!"&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: B. Hepner, “Marx et la puissance russe,” in: K. Marx, ''La Russie et l'Europe'', Paris, 1954, p. 20.

Marx and Engels sympathised with the [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the [[Narodnaya Volya|Russian revolutionaries]] assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed ‘the formation of a Russian commune’.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to the Chairman of the Slavonic Meeting, 21 March 1881. Source: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Selected Correspondence'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx supported the [[Polish–Russian Wars|Polish uprisings]] against tsarist Russia.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; He said in a speech in London in 1867:

{{quote|In the first place the policy of Russia is changeless... Its methods, its tactics, its manoeuvres may change, but the polar star of its policy – world domination – is a fixed star. In our times only a civilised government ruling over barbarian masses can hatch out such a plan and execute it. ... There is but one alternative for Europe. Either Asiatic barbarism, under Muscovite direction, will burst around its head like an avalanche, or else it must re-establish Poland, thus putting twenty million heroes between itself and Asia and gaining a breathing spell for the accomplishment of its social regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Speech delivered in London, probably to a meeting of the International’s General Council and the Polish Workers Society on 22 January 1867, text published in ''Le Socialisme'', 15 March 1908; ''Odbudowa Polski'' (Warsaw, 1910), pp. 119–23; ''Mysl Socjalistyczna'', May 1908.

Marx supported the cause of [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish independence]]&lt;!--The quote shows he meant more than Home Rule. He also seemed to be confusing England and Great Britain.--&gt;. In 1867, he wrote Engels: "I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable. The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland. ... English reaction in England had its roots ... in the subjugation of Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/01/archives/karl-marx-and-the-irish.html Karl Marx and the Irish]". ''The New York Times.'' December 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx spent some time in [[French Algeria]], which had been [[French conquest of Algeria|invaded]] and made a [[French colonial empire |French colony]] in 1830, and had opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. He wrote about the colonial justice system, in which "a form of torture has been used (and this happens ‘regularly’) to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the ‘police’; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it."&lt;ref name="alahram"/&gt; Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]] in Algiers and wrote in a letter: "when a European colonist dwells among the ‘lesser breeds,’ either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the ‘lesser breeds,’ the British and Dutch outdo the French."&lt;ref name="alahram"/&gt; 

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'': "Marx’s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. His account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colonialism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marx discussed [[British Empire|British]] [[British Raj|colonial rule]] in [[Colonial India|India]] in the ''New York Herald Tribune'' in June 1853: 

{{quote|There cannot remain any doubt but that the misery inflicted by the British on Hindostan [India] is of an essentially different and infinitely more intensive kind than all Hindostan had to suffer before. England has broken down the entire framework of Indian society, without any symptoms of reconstitution yet appearing... [however], we must not forget that these idyllic village communities, inoffensive though they may appear, had always been the solid foundation of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within the smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition.&lt;ref name="alahram"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marx in Algiers |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/24784.aspx |work=Al-Ahram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marx on India under the British |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/marx-on-india-under-the-british/article3209143.ece |work=The Hindu |date=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Marx's ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Francis (17 July 2005).

''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2010"/&gt; Followers of Marx have often debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world.&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt; The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include [[Leninism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]], [[Maoism]], [[Luxemburgism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]].&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt; Various currents have also developed in [[Marxism#Academic Marxism|academic Marxism]], often under influence of other views, resulting in [[structuralist Marxism]], historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, [[analytical Marxism]] and Hegelian Marxism.&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt;

From an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the 19th century's three masters of the "school of suspicion" alongside [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, Paul. ''Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1970, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the three principal architects of modern [[social science]] along with [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt; Both Marx and [[Auguste Comte]] set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European [[secularisation]] and new developments in the [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]] and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean [[sociological positivism]] in attempt to develop a ''science of society''.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-19"/&gt; [[Karl Löwith]] considered Marx and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors.&lt;ref&gt;Löwith, Karl. ''From Hegel to Nietzsche''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1991, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[sociological theory]], [[Marxist sociology]] is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives.

Social theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common, move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and emphasise the "relative autonomy" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the "forces of production" and the succession of "modes of production". Such has been for example the neo-Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kołakowski, Leszek.

Two centuries after his birth Marx remains both controversial and relevant, as the unveiling of a 4.5m statue of him (given by China, sculpted by [[Wu Weishan]]) in his birthplace of [[Trier, Germany]] in 2018 demonstrates. &lt;ref name="Trier Statue"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44009621 |title=Karl Marx statue from China adds to German angst |date=5 May 2018 |access-date=5 May 2018|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a feature film, ''[[The Young Karl Marx]]'', featuring Marx, his wife [[Jenny Marx]], and his collaborator Friedrich Engels, among other revolutionaries and intellectuals prior to the [[revolutions of 1848]] received good reviews both for its historical accuracy and its brio in treating the intellectual life. &lt;ref name="Review: In ‘The Young Karl Marx,’ a Scruffy Specter Haunts Europe"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/movies/the-young-karl-marx-review.html |title=Review: In 'The Young Karl Marx,' a Scruffy Specter Haunts Europe |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=22 February 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[European Commission]] President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] attended the event in Karl Marx's hometown of Trier, Germany, at which a statue of Marx, donated by the [[Government of China|Chinese government]], was unveiled. Juncker defended Marx, saying that "Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future, had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn't cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite."&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/karl-marx-jean-claude-juncker-defends-legacy-a8337176.html 'Today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for': EU president Juncker defends Karl Marx’s legacy]".

'''Kots Kaal Pato''' ([[English language|English]]: '''Strangle the Duck''') is a controversial event practiced among some [[Mayan people|Mayan]] youth in the village of [[Izamal Municipality|Citilcum]] within the [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. In the event, [[ducks]], bound to high wooden crossbeams by their feet, are [[Mutilation|mutilated]] in a ceremony-like atmosphere. It has attracted condemnation from [[animal rights]] activists in the region, with several Mexican environmental authorities filing an [[animal cruelty]] complaint on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Mexican Environmental Authorities file complaint against duck-killing ceremony|publisher=''[[The Yucatan Times]]''|url=http://www.theyucatantimes.com/2015/05/mexican-environmental-authorities-file-complaint-against-duck-killing-ceremony/|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lightning''' is a sudden [[electrostatic discharge]] that occurs typically during a [[thunderstorm]].  This discharge occurs between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] regions of a [[thundercloud|cloud]] (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning).

The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a '''flash'''. A lightning flash can also be a [[Lightning strike|''strike'']] if it involves an object on the ground. Lightning creates light in the form of [[black body radiation]] from the very hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by the electron flow, and sound in the form of  [[#Thunder|thunder]]. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash.

==Electrification==

[[File:Understanding Lightning - Figure 1 - Cloud Charging Area.gif|thumb|The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}]]
The details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}, see figure to the right. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and [[graupel]] (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm|title=NWS Lightning Safety: Understanding Lightning: Thunderstorm Electrification|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=25 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130080723/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm|archivedate=November 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graupel animation 3a.gif|thumb|left|When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.]]

The differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.  See figure to the left. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud. The larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;
[[File:Charged cloud animation 4a.gif|thumb|The upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.]]
The result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;

The upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;

==General considerations==
[[File:LightningCNP.ogg|thumb|left|Four-second video of a lightning strike, Island in the Sky, [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], United States.]]

On Earth, the lightning frequency is approximately 40–50 times a second or nearly 1.4 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] flashes per year&lt;ref name="EncyWorldClim freq"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&amp;pg=PA452|title=Encyclopedia of World Climatology|accessdate=February 8, 2009|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=Oliver, John E.| isbn=978-1-4020-3264-6|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes (strokes) of around 60 to 70 [[microsecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html|title=Lightning|work=gsu.edu|accessdate=December 30, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115043319/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html|archivedate=January 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many factors affect the frequency, distribution, strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world. These factors include ground elevation, [[latitude]], [[prevailing wind]] currents, [[relative humidity]], proximity to warm and cold bodies of water, etc. To a certain degree, the ratio between IC (in-cloud or intracloud), CC (cloud-to-cloud) and CG (cloud-to-ground) lightning may also vary by [[season]] in [[middle latitudes]].
Because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, CG lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though IC and CC are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.

A typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] channel through the air in excess of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall, from within the cloud to the ground's surface. The actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, a typical [[thunderstorm]] produces three or more ''strikes'' to the Earth per minute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g1foWWN5odwC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Lightning+occurs+when+warm+air+is+mixed+with+colder+air+masses#v=onepage&amp;q=Lightning%20occurs%20when%20warm%20air%20is%20mixed%20with%20colder%20air%20masses&amp;f=false|title="Sprites, Elves and Intense Lightning Discharges"|last=Füllekrug|first=Martin|last2=Mareev|first2=Eugene A.|last3=Rycroft|first3=Michael J.|date=2006-05-01|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402046285|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104190958/https://books.google.com/books?id=g1foWWN5odwC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Lightning+occurs+when+warm+air+is+mixed+with+colder+air+masses&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV44XT9uXUAhVJ7mMKHb3pBUoQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Lightning%20occurs%20when%20warm%20air%20is%20mixed%20with%20colder%20air%20masses&amp;f=false|archivedate=November 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, it can also occur during [[dust storm]]s, [[forest fires]], [[tornado]]es, [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], and even in the cold of [[winter]], where the lightning is known as [[thundersnow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/ New Lightning Type Found Over Volcano?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209015048/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/ |date=February 9, 2010 }}.

==Frequency==
{{main|Distribution of lightning}}
[[File:Global lightning strikes.png|thumb|300px|World map showing frequency of lightning strikes, in flashes per km² per year (equal-area projection), from combined 1995–2003 data from the Optical Transient Detector and 1998–2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor.]]

Lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet, as shown in the map.

About 70% of lightning occurs over land in the [[tropics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oZUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land&amp;dq=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land|title=Encyclopedia of atmospheric sciences|last=Holton|first=James R.|last2=Curry|first2=Judith A.|last3=Pyle|first3=J.

This occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder [[air mass]]es, as well as differences in moisture concentrations, and it generally happens at the [[Weather front|boundaries between them]]. The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world's oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere, lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.

In general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.

[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], [[France]]]]

Because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60° North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

Lightning is usually produced by [[cumulonimbus]] [[cloud]]s, which have bases that are typically 1–2&amp;nbsp;km (0.6–1.25&amp;nbsp;miles) above the ground and tops up to {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} in height.

== Necessary conditions ==
{{main|Thunderstorm}}
[[File:Thunder.ogg|thumb|left|Sound of a thunderstorm]]
In order for an [[electrostatic discharge]] to occur, two preconditions are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently high [[electric potential]] between two regions of space must exist, and secondly, a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges.

It is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud; however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032&lt;0642:AROTEP&gt;2.0.CO;2|volume=32|title=A Review of Thunderstorm Electrification Processes |last1=Saunders|first1=C. P. R.|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |issue=4 |pages=642–55|bibcode=1993JApMe..32..642S |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity. This is overcome by "lightning", a complex process referred to as the lightning "flash".

===Electrical field generation===
[[File:LightningAboveCloudsView.JPG|thumb|View of lightning from an airplane flying above a system.]]

As a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|thundercloud]] moves over the surface of the Earth, an equal [[electric charge]], but of opposite polarity, is [[Electrostatic induction|induced]] on the Earth's surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.

The oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud – the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.

== Flashes and strikes ==
The best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no "physical" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A lightning strike from '''cloud to ground''' in the California, [[Mojave Desert]]]] 
[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|right|260px|An '''intracloud''' flash. A lightning flash within the cloud, illuminates the entire blanket.]]

=== Lightning leaders ===
[[File:Lightning formation.gif|thumb|Lightning formation|thumb|A downward leader travels towards earth, branching as it goes.]]
[[File:Leaderlightnig.gif|thumbnail|Lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders, positive shown in blue and negative in red]]

In a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of [[ionized]] air, called a "[[leader (spark)|leader]]", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125231/http://www.ztresearch.com/ |date=April 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called "stepping". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.

It is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.

The positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader "pools" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader. The negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward, often speeding up as it get closer to the Earth's surface.

About 90% of ionic channel lengths between "pools" are approximately {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;Goulde, R.H. (1977) "The lightning conductor", pp. 545–576 in ''Lightning Protection'', R.H. Golde, Ed., ''Lightning, Vol. 2'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of [[millisecond]]s) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few dozen microseconds. The [[electric current]] needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of [[ampere]]s, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.

Initiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9338-z|title=Charge Structure and Dynamics in Thunderstorms|date=2008|last1=Stolzenburg|first1=Maribeth|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas C.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=137|page=355|bibcode = 2008SSRv..137..355S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hypotheses have been proposed. One theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by [[cosmic rays]] and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called [[runaway breakdown]]. As these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules, they initiate leader formation. Another theory invokes locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2007JD009036|title=A brief review of the problem of lightning initiation and a hypothesis of initial lightning leader formation|date=2008|last1=Petersen|first1=Danyal|last2=Bailey|first2=Matthew|last3=Beasley|first3=William H.|last4=Hallett|first4=John|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=113|pages=D17205|bibcode = 2008JGRD..11317205P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percolation theory]], especially for the case of biased percolation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.81.011102|title=Biased percolation on scale-free networks|date=2010|last1=Hooyberghs|first1=Hans|last2=Van Schaeybroeck|first2=Bert|last3=Moreira|first3=André A.|last4=Andrade|first4=José S.|last5=Herrmann|first5=Hans J.|last6=Indekeu|first6=Joseph O.|journal=Physical Review E|volume=81|pages=011102|bibcode = 2010PhRvE..81a1102H |arxiv = 0908.3786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify| what does 'biased percolation' mean?|date= July 2013}} describes random connectivity phenomena, which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes.

=== Upward streamers ===
When a stepped leader approaches the ground, the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the [[electric field]]. The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward [[Streamer discharge|streamer]], can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.&lt;ref&gt;Kasemir, H. W. (1950) "Qualitative Übersicht über Potential-, Feld- und Ladungsverhaltnisse bei einer Blitzentladung in der Gewitterwolke" (Qualitative survey of the potential, field and charge conditions during a lightning discharge in the thunderstorm cloud) in ''Das Gewitter'' (The Thunderstorm), H. Israel, ed., Leipzig, Germany: Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhnke, Lothar H. (June 7, 2007) [https://archive.is/20110611231459/http://www.physicstoday.org/obits/notice_157.shtml Death notice: Heinz Wolfram Kasemir]. physicstoday.org&lt;/ref&gt;

As negatively charged leaders approach, increasing the localized electric field strength, grounded objects already experiencing [[corona discharge]] [[Electrical breakdown#Corona breakdown|exceed a threshold]] and form upward streamers.

=== Attachment ===
Once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader, a process referred to as attachment, a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur. Photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are. High-speed videos can show the attachment process in progress. &lt;ref&gt;Saba, M. M. F., A. R. Paiva, C. Schumann, M. A. S. Ferro, K. P. Naccarato, J. C. O. Silva, F. V. C. Siqueira, and D. M. Custódio (2017), Lightning attachment process to common buildings, Geophys. Res. Lett., 44, doi:10.1002/2017GL072796&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discharge ===

====Return stroke====
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|High-speed photography showing different parts of a lightning flash during the discharge process as seen in [[Toulouse]], [[France]].]]

Once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel. Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.

A large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Electricity takes every path available to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104215214/http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|archivedate=January 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.

The electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as "negative CG" lightning. In some cases, a ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000 km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Mach | first3 = D. M. | last4 = Rust | first4 = W. D. | title = The propagation speed of a positive lightning return stroke | doi = 10.1029/GL014i011p01150 | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | page = 1150 | year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1987GeoRL..14.1150I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs (measured in microseconds) rapidly [[superheating|superheats]] the completed leader channel, forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel. The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].

====Re-strike====
High-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable "[[strobe light]]" effect.&lt;ref name="uman"&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called '''recoil leaders''', usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a '''dart leader''' travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ground-flashes/ |title=Ground Flashes |last=Warner |first=Tom |website=ZT Research |access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt;

====Transient currents during flash====
The electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1–10 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50–200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which "flow through" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].

The rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. This is the "[[Voltage spike|surge]]" that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate [[electronics]], [[electrical appliance]]s, or [[electric motor]]s. Devices known as [[Surge protector|surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS)]] attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through an alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached [[Electrical ground|earthing ground]], thereby protecting the equipment from damage.

== Types ==
There are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the "ends" of a flash channel.
*Intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit
*Cloud to cloud (CC) or intercloud, which starts and ends between two different "functional" thundercloud units
*Cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud 
There are variations of each type, such as "positive" versus "negative" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.

=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===
[[File:Lightning strikes mountain top.jpg|thumb|right|''Cloud to ground'' lightning]]
Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.

CG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning.  It is easier to study scientifically, because it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or "strikes" the Earth. 
The overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.&lt;ref&gt;V. Cooray, Mechanism of the Lightning Flash, in: The Lightning Flash, 2nd ed., V. Cooray (Ed.), The Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, United Kingdom, 2014, pp. 119–229&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Positive lightning}}Positive and negative lightning====
Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is either positive or negative, as defined by the direction of the [[Electric current#Conventions|conventional electric current]] from cloud to ground.  Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel. The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground. Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NWS JetStream – The Positive and Negative Side of Lightning | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | accessdate = September 25, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705205815/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anvil-to-ground lightning.jpg|thumb|A ''Bolt from the blue'' lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear, but turbulent sky above the [[anvil cloud]] and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground. They are commonly referred to as positive flashes despite the fact that they are usually negative in polarity.]]

There are six different mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of downward positive lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2012JD017545|title=Positive lightning: An overview, new observations, and inferences|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=117|pages=n/a|year=2012|last1=Nag|first1=Amitabh|last2=Rakov|first2=Vladimir A|bibcode=2012JGRD..117.8109N}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vertical wind shear displacing the upper positive charge region of a thundercloud, exposing it to the ground below.
* The loss of lower charge regions in the dissipating stage of a thunderstorm, leaving the primary positive charge region.
* A complex arrangement of charge regions in a thundercloud, effectively resulting in an '''inverted dipole''' or '''inverted tripole''' in which the main negative charge region is above the main positive charge region instead of beneath it.
* An unusually large lower positive charge region in the thundercloud.
* Cutoff of an extended negative leader from its origin which creates a new bidirectional leader in which the positive end strikes the ground, commonly seen in anvil-crawler spider flashes.
* The initiation of a downward positive branch from an intracloud lightning flash.

Contrary to popular belief, positive lightning flashes do '''not''' necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm. This belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar in nature and originating from their respective charge region.

Positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts. An average bolt of [[Electrical polarity|negative]] lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 [[ampere]]s (30 kA), and transfers 15 [[coulomb]]s of [[electric charge]] and 500 [[joule|megajoules]] of [[energy]]. Large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs.&lt;ref&gt;Hasbrouck, Richard. [https://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/05_96.1.pdf Mitigating Lightning Hazards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005230/https://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/05_96.1.pdf |date=October 5, 2013 }}, Science &amp; Technology Review May 1996. Retrieved on April 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash, and can produce peak currents up to 400,000 amperes (400 kA) and charges of several hundred coulombs.&lt;ref&gt;V.A.

As a result of their greater power, as well as lack of warning, positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous. Due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current, they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited.

Positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of [[Upper-atmospheric lightning#Sprites|sprites]] several tens of kilometers above ground level. Positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in [[winter storm]]s, as with [[thundersnow]], during intense [[tornado]]es&lt;ref name="Tornadic lightning"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Antony H.

A unique form of cloud-to-ground lightning exists where lightning appears to exit from the cumulonimbus cloud and propagate a considerable distance through clear air before veering towards, and striking, the ground. For this reason, they are known as "bolts from the blue". Despite the popular misconception that these are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region, observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes. They begin as intracloud flashes within the cloud, the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2011JD016890|title=Lightning morphology and impulse charge moment change of high peak current negative strokes|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=117|pages=n/a|year=2012|last1=Lu|first1=Gaopeng|last2=Cummer|first2=Steven A|last3=Blakeslee|first3=Richard J|last4=Weiss|first4=Stephanie|last5=Beasley|first5=William H|bibcode=2012JGRD..117.4212L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo162|title=Upward electrical discharges from&amp;nbsp;thunderstorms|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|issue=4|pages=233|year=2008|last1=Krehbiel|first1=Paul R|last2=Riousset|first2=Jeremy A|last3=Pasko|first3=Victor P|last4=Thomas|first4=Ronald J|last5=Rison|first5=William|last6=Stanley|first6=Mark A|last7=Edens|first7=Harald E|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..233K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground. When it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as ''inter-cloud lightning'', and when it occurs between areas of differing [[electric potential]] within a single cloud it is known as ''intra-cloud lightning''. Intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.&lt;ref name="GHCC primer2" /&gt;

Intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper [[cumulonimbus incus|anvil]] portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm. This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called "[[sheet lightning]]". In such instances, the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder.

Another term used for cloud–cloud or cloud–cloud–ground lightning is "Anvil Crawler", due to the habit of charge, typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm, often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes. These are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay. The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.

=== Observational variations ===
* '''Anvil crawler lightning''', sometimes called '''Spider lightning''' is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt;
* '''[[Ball lightning]]''' may be an [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still [[controversial]]. The term refers to reports of [[luminosity|luminous]], usually [[spherical]] objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Singer | first = Stanley

{{anchor|Bead lightning}}
* '''Bead lightning''' is the decaying stage of a lightning channel in which the [[luminosity]] of the channel breaks up into segments. Nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit ''beading'' as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke, sometimes referred to as the lightning's 'bead-out' stage. 'Bead lightning' is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself. Beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature, and therefore is often only apparent when the observer/camera is close to the lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Dan|title=Weather Library: Lightning Types &amp; Classifications|url=http://stormhighway.com/types.shtml|accessdate=March 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041135/http://stormhighway.com/types.shtml|archivedate=February 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cloud-to-air lightning''' is a lightning flash in which one end of a bidirectional leader exits the cloud, but does not result in a ground flash. Such flashes can sometimes be thought of as failed ground flashes. [[Upper-atmospheric lightning#Jets|Blue jets and gigantic jets]] are a form of cloud-to-air or cloud-to-ionosphere lightning where a leader is launched from the top of a thunderstorm.
* '''[[Dry lightning]]''' is used in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] for lightning that occurs with no [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] at the surface.

{{anchor|Sheet lightning}}
* '''Sheet lightning''' is cloud-to-cloud lightning that exhibits a diffuse brightening of the surface of a cloud, caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away. The lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator, so it appears as only a flash, or a sheet of light. The lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes.
{{anchor|Smooth channel lightning}}
* '''Smooth channel lightning''' is an informal term referring to a type of cloud-to-ground lightning strike that has no visible branching and appears like a line with smooth curves as opposed to the jagged appearance of most lightning channels. They are a form of positive lightning generally observed in or near the convective regions of severe thunderstorms in the north central United States. It is theorized that severe thunderstorms in this region obtain an "inverted tripole" charge structure in which the main positive charge region is located below the main negative charge region instead of above it, and as a result these thunderstorms generate predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. The term "smooth channel lightning" is also sometimes attributed to upward ground-to-cloud lightning flashes, which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures.
* '''Staccato lightning''' is a cloud-to-ground lightning (CG) strike which is a short-duration stroke that (often but not always) appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Glossary | work = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | publisher = National Weather Service | url = http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=s | accessdate = September 2, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915070315/http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=s | archivedate = September 15, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often found in the visual vault area near the [[mesocyclone]] of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm [[updraft]]s.

{{anchor|Sympathetic lightning}}
* '''Sympathetic lightning''' is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances. Discharges can appear in clusters when viewed from space.
{{anchor|Clear-air lightning}}
* '''Upward lightning''' or '''ground-to-cloud lightning''' is a lightning flash which originates from the top of a grounded object and propagates upward from this point. This type of lightning can be triggered by a preceding lightning flash, or it may initiate entirely on its own. The former is generally found in regions where spider lightning occurs, and may involve multiple grounded objects simultaneously. &lt;ref&gt;Saba, M. M. F., C. Schumann, T. A. Warner, M. A. S.

== Effects ==

=== Lightning strike ===
{{Main|Lightning strike}}

Objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude. The heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk. As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the [[plasma channel]] may melt, forming tubular structures called [[fulgurite]]s. Even though roughly 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive,&lt;ref name="Outside 2014-09-22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/The-Body-Electric.html|title=Lightning-Strike Survivors Tell Their Stories|last1=Jabr|first1=Ferris|date=22 September 2014|publisher=''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]''|accessdate=28 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928220906/http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/The-Body-Electric.html|archivedate=September 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage. Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Lightning also serves an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into [[nitrates]] which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Steiger | first2 = S. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = R. | last4 = Tie | first4 = X. | last5 = Orville | first5 = R.E. | year = 2002 | title = The importance of NOx production by lightning in the tropics | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume = 36 | issue = 9| pages = 1509–1519 | doi=10.1016/s1352-2310(01)00553-2| bibcode = 2002AtmEn..36.1509B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, K.E., Bucsela, E., Allen, D, Cummings, K., Li, Y., MacGorman, D., Bruning, E. 2014.

=== Thunder ===
{{main|Thunder}}

Because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration, [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a [[shock wave]] audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.

[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about 300,000,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about 343&amp;nbsp;m/s. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|343|m|mi|abbr=on}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{convert|1|km|mi|sp=us|spell=in}} (3×343&amp;nbsp;m). A flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} (5×343&amp;nbsp;m). Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

Lightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard; there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over 100 miles whereas the thunder travels about 20 miles. Anecdotally, there are many examples of people saying 'the storm was directly overhead or all-around and yet there was no thunder'. There is no coherent data available.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

A number of observations by space-based telescopes have revealed even higher energy [[gamma ray]] emissions, the so-called [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es (TGFs). These observations pose a challenge to current theories of lightning, especially with the recent discovery of the clear signatures of [[antimatter]] produced in lightning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/49288/title/Signature_of_antimatter_detected_in_lightning Signature Of Antimatter Detected In Lightning – Science News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716051431/http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/49288/title/Signature_of_antimatter_detected_in_lightning |date=July 16, 2012 }}.

===Air quality===
The very high temperatures generated by lightning lead to significant local increases in [[ozone]] and [[NOx|oxides of Nitrogen]]. Each lightning flash in temperate and sub-tropical areas produces 7kg of NOx on average&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091030100022.htm|title=Lightning's 'NOx-ious' Impact On Pollution, Climate|publisher= Science News|access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Volcanic ==
[[File:Rinjani 1994.jpg|thumb|Volcanic material thrust high into the atmosphere can trigger lightning.]]

Volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways. The enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles. The ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions (triboelectrification), resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself. Due to the extensive solid material (ash) content, unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud, it is often called a [[dirty thunderstorm]].

* Powerful and frequent flashes have been witnessed in the volcanic plume as far back as the 79 AD eruption of [[Vesuvius]] by [[Pliny The Younger]].&lt;ref name="Volcano Lightning"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/pliny.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030625075734/http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/final/pliny.html| archivedate = June 25, 2003|title = Pliny the Younger's Observations|accessdate = July 5, 2007|author = Pliny the Younger|quote = Behind us were frightening dark clouds, rent by lightning twisted and hurled, opening to reveal huge figures of flame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, vapors and ash originating from vents on the volcano's flanks may produce more localized and smaller flashes upwards of 2.9&amp;nbsp;km long.
* Small, short duration [[Electric spark|spark]]s, recently documented near newly extruded magma, attest to the material being highly charged prior to even entering the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Dell'Amore, Christine (February 3, 2010) [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/?source=link_fb02102009 New Lightning Type Found Over Volcano?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020153656/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100203-volcanoes-lightning/?source=link_fb02102009 |date=October 20, 2012 }}.

== Extraterrestrial ==
Lightning has been observed within the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of other [[planet]]s, such as [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Although in the minority on Earth, superbolts appear to be common on Jupiter.

Lightning on Venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study. During the Soviet [[Venera]] and U.S. [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] missions of the 1970s and 1980s, signals suggesting lightning may be present in the upper atmosphere were detected.&lt;ref name="plasma"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~strange/JATP_paper/JATP_title.html|title=Plasma Wave Evidence for Lightning on Venus|accessdate=September 24, 2007|journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics|volume=57|pages=537–556|date=1995|author=Strangeway, Robert J.|bibcode=1995JATP...57..537S|doi=10.1016/0021-9169(94)00080-8|issue=5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160656/http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~strange/JATP_paper/JATP_title.html|archivedate=October 12, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Cassini–Huygens]] mission fly-by of Venus in 1999 detected no signs of lightning, the observation window lasted mere hours. Radio pulses recorded by the spacecraft [[Venus Express]] (which began orbiting Venus in April 2006) may originate from lightning on Venus.

== Human-related phenomena ==
* '''Airplane contrails''' have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree. The water vapor-dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 4, pp. 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rocket exhaust plumes''' provided a pathway for lightning when it was witnessed striking the [[Apollo 12|Apollo 12 rocket]] shortly after takeoff. 
* '''[[Thermonuclear weapon|Thermonuclear explosions]]''' by providing extra material for electrical conduction and a very turbulent localized atmosphere, have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud. In addition, intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through [[Compton scattering]]. The intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear-air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Lightning"&gt;{{Cite journal|date= 1987 | title= An empirical study of the nuclear explosion-induced lightning seen on IVY-MIKE | journal= Journal of Geophysical Research | volume= 92 | issue= D5 | pages= 5696–5712| bibcode=1987JGR....92.5696C | doi= 10.1029/JD092iD05p05696| author= Colvin, J.

Thunder is heard as a rolling, gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103–110&lt;/ref&gt;

When the local electric field exceeds the [[dielectric strength]] of damp air (about 3 million volts per meter), electrical discharge results in a ''strike'', often followed by commensurate discharges branching from the same path. (See image, right.)

Lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations, including radio-frequency pulses. The times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge. The United States federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors, allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Earth-ionosphere waveguide]] traps electromagnetic [[VLF]]- and [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] waves. Electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide. The waveguide is dispersive, which means that their [[group velocity]] depends on frequency. The difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver. Together with direction finding methods, this allows locating lightning strikes up to distances of 10,000&amp;nbsp;km from their origin. Moreover, the eigenfrequencies of the Earth-ionospheric waveguide, the [[Schumann resonances]]
at about 7.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity.&lt;ref&gt;Volland, H. (ed) (1995) ''Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics'', CRC Press, Boca Raton, {{ISBN|0849386470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ground-based lightning detection, several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution.

=== Artificially triggered ===
* '''Rocket-triggered lightning''' can be "triggered" by launching [[lightning rocket|specially designed rockets]] trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms. The wire unwinds as the rocket ascends, creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders. If a leader attaches, the wire provides a low-resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur. The wire is vaporized by the return current flow, creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place. This method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner.&lt;ref name="vid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skydiary.com/gallery/chase2002/2002lightmovie.html|title=Triggered lightning video|accessdate=September 24, 2007|publisher=Chris Kridler's Sky Diary|date=July 25, 2002|author=Kridler, Chris|work=requires QuickTime|format=video|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915074527/http://skydiary.com/gallery/chase2002/2002lightmovie.html|archivedate=September 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*:In New Mexico, U.S., scientists tested a new [[terawatt]] laser which provoked lightning. Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as "'''filaments'''". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |title=Terawatt Laser Beam Shot in the Clouds Provokes Lightning Strike |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420130439/http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} News report based on: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/OE.16.005757| pmid = 18542684| title = Electric events synchronized with laser filaments in thunderclouds| journal = Optics Express| volume = 16| issue = 8| pages = 5757–63| year = 2008| last1 = Kasparian | first1 = J. | last2 = Ackermann | first2 = R. | last3 = André | first3 = Y.

==== Magnetism ====
The movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field (see [[electromagnetism]]). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced [[Remanence|remanent]] magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Re-magnetization of a Surface Outcrop by Lightning Currents|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1961.tb02963.x|date=1961|last1=Graham|first1=K.W.T.|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|volume=6|page=85|bibcode = 1961GeoJ....6...85G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox A.

[[File:Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis - LIGHTNING - 1909.jpg|thumb|Lightning by [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis]] (1909)]]

In many cultures, lightning has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in and of itself. These include the [[Greek god]] [[Zeus]], the [[Aztec]] god [[Tlaloc]], the [[Maya religion|Mayan]] [[God K]], [[Slavic mythology]]'s [[Perun]], the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Pērkons]]/[[Perkūnas]], [[Thor]] in [[Norse mythology]], [[Ukko]] in [[Finnish mythology]], the [[Hindu]] god [[Indra]], and the [[Shinto]] god [[Raijin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6973441&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6973441|title=IEEE Xplore|work=ieee.org|accessdate=October 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402224733/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6973441&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6973441|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the traditional religion of the African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes, lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. Verses in the [[Jewish]] religion and in [[Islam]] also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning. In [[Christianity]], the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] is compared to lightning.{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|24:27}}{{Bibleref2c|Luke|17:24}}

The expression "Lightning never strikes twice (in the same place)" is similar to "Opportunity never knocks twice" in the vein of a "once in a lifetime" opportunity, ''i.e.'', something that is generally considered improbable. Lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas. Since various factors alter the [[probability]] of strikes at any given location, repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability (but are not impossible).&lt;ref name="uman2"&gt;[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 6, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Jesus actor struck by lightning| publisher = BBC News| date = October 23, 2003| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209223.stm| accessdate = August 19, 2007| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070917055711/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209223.stm| archivedate = September 17, 2007| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, "A bolt from the blue" refers to something totally unexpected.

Some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power, such as the [[People's Action Party]] in [[Singapore]], the [[British Union of Fascists]] during the 1930s, and the [[National States' Rights Party]] in the [[United States]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mauryk2.com/2010/11/06/john-kasper-the-national-states-rights-party-and-the-demise-of-the-old-south/ Picture of John Kaspar of the National States Rights Party speaking in front of the party’s lightning bolt flag (the flag was red, white, and blue)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203185623/http://mauryk2.com/2010/11/06/john-kasper-the-national-states-rights-party-and-the-demise-of-the-old-south/ |date=February 3, 2013 }}. Mauryk2.com (November 6, 2010). Retrieved on April 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Schutzstaffel]], the [[paramilitary]] wing of the [[Nazi Party]], used the [[Sig (rune)|Sig rune]] in their logo which symbolizes lightning. The [[German language|German]] word [[Blitzkrieg]], which means "lightning war", was a major offensive strategy of the German army during [[World War II]].

In [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], the expression for "Love at first sight" is ''coup de foudre'' and ''colpo di fulmine'', respectively, which literally translated means "lightning strike". Some European languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground (as opposed to lightning in general); often it is a [[cognate]] of the English word "rays". The name of [[New Zealand]]'s most celebrated [[thoroughbred]] horse, [[Phar Lap]], derives from the shared [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]] and [[Thai language|Thai]] word for lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/lightning.asp |title=Lightning |work=Phar Lap: Australia's wonder horse |publisher=Museum Victoria |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024205404/http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/horse/lightning.asp |archivedate=October 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bolt of lightning in [[heraldry]] is called a [[thunderbolt]] and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends. This symbol usually represents power and speed.

The lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered [[telegraph]]s and [[radio]]s. It was a commonly used motif in [[Art Deco]] design, especially the [[zig-zag]] Art Deco design of the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillier, Bevis|title=Art Deco of the 20s and 30s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7YBPAAAAMAAJ|date=1968|publisher=Studio Vista|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426142458/https://books.google.com/books?id=7YBPAAAAMAAJ|archivedate=April 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lightning bolt is a common insignia for [[military communications]] units throughout the world. A lightning bolt is also the [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems|NATO symbol for a signal asset]].

The Unicode symbol for lightning is ☇ U+2607

[[File:Mount Whitney 2003-03-25.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Whitney]] is the highest summit of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[State of California]], and the [[contiguous United States]].]]

In the [[mountaineering]] parlance of the [[Western United States]], a ''fourteener'' is a [[Summit|mountain peak]] with an elevation of at least {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}.  This is a '''complete list of the 12 fourteeners in the U.S. state of [[California]]''' with at least  {{convert|300|ft|m|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].  The main [[fourteener]] article has a list of all of the fourteeners in the United States, as well as references, more information about how the list is determined, and caveats about accuracy.

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AVISO TERREMOTO 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Aviso del Terremoto'', 1785]]
[[File:Oceanic-continental convergence Fig21oceancont.gif|thumb|right|250px|The subduction of the Malpelo Plate (left) below the North Andes Plate (right) causes most of the earthquakes in Colombia.]]
This is a '''list of earthquakes in Colombia'''. [[Colombia]] is a seismically active country and has a large seismic risk in many areas of its territory due to its location at the boundaries of the [[Malpelo Plate|Malpelo]], [[Panama Plate|Panama]], [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]], [[North Andes Plate|North Andes]] (where most earthquakes occurred) and [[South American Plate]]s along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

The first historically registered earthquake felt in Colombia occurred on September 11, 1530, around 10:00 AM, probably with the [[epicentre]] near [[Cumaná]], [[Venezuela]]. The earthquake was documented by [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]] in his work ''La Historia general de las Indias'' and by [[friar]] [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] in his book ''Historia de Las Indias''.&lt;ref name=Ramirez1975_p63&gt;Ramírez, 1975, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented earthquake with its epicentre in present-day Colombia territory took place in 1566,&lt;ref name=Ramirez1975_p65&gt;Ramírez, 1975, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; with the epicentre estimated around [[Santander, Cauca|Santander]] in the [[departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]].&lt;ref name=Ramirez1975_p217&gt;Ramírez, 1975, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Other important historical earthquakes have been documented by Luis Vargas Jurado, from 1703 until 1764 and Santiago Pérez Valencia between 1785 and 1843.&lt;ref name=Espinosa2001_p273&gt;Espinosa Baquero, 2001, p.273&lt;/ref&gt;

The most devastating earthquake for Colombia happened on August 15 and 16, 1868 off the coast of Ecuador, leading to approximately 70,000 fatalities. The strongest earthquake, with an estimated [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 8.8 also happened offshore Ecuador in 1906. Other major earthquakes were the [[1875 Cúcuta earthquake]] with around 10,000 deaths and the [[1999 Armenia, Colombia earthquake|1999 Armenia earthquake]] with an [[Mercalli intensity scale|intensity of X]]. The deepest registered earthquake happened in the department of [[Amazonas Department|Amazonas]] in 1970 at an estimated depth of almost {{convert|645|km|ft}}. The [[1785 Viceroyalty of New Granada earthquake]] sparked the birth of journalism in Colombia, initiated by [[Manuel del Socorro Rodríguez]], six years after the publication of the ''Aviso del Terremoto'' about the earthquake with its epicentre in [[La Calera, Cundinamarca|La Calera]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].

The main seismically active zone is the [[Malpelo Plate#Subduction zone|subduction zone of the Malpelo, formerly Nazca, Plate]] with strong earthquakes in 1906, 1947, 1958 and 1979. The most active onshore fault systems are the {{convert|674|km|mi}} [[Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault]] with earthquakes frequently occurring at the [[Bucaramanga Nest]] around [[Aratoca]], [[Santander Department|Santander]], the {{convert|697.4|km|mi}} [[Romeral Fault System]] in the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Central Ranges]] (Popayán 1983 and Armenia 1999) and the {{convert|921.4|km|mi}} long [[Eastern Frontal Fault System]] in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]]. Other strong earthquakes are associated with the [[Murindó Fault|Murindó]] (M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 7.2, 1992), [[Irlanda Fault|Irlanda]] (M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 6.8, 1994), [[Tucurá Fault|Tucurá]] (M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 6.7, 1952), [[Bahía Solano Fault|Bahía Solano]] (M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 6.5, 1970), and [[Mutatá Fault]]s (M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 6.0, 2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6968">All stars but one can be associated with an IAU constellation. IAU constellations are areas of the sky. Although there are only 88 IAU constellations, the sky is actually divided into 89 irregularly shaped boxes as the constellation Serpens is split into two separate sections, Serpens Caput (the snake's head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (the snake's tail) to the east.

The only star that does not belong to a constellation is the Sun. The Sun travels through the 13 constellations along the ecliptic, the 12 of the [[Zodiac]] and [[Ophiuchus]].

Among the remaining stars, the nearer ones exhibit [[proper motion]], so it is only a matter of time before some of them cross a constellation boundary and switch constellations as a consequence. In 1992, [[Rho Aquilae]] became the first star to have its [[Bayer designation]] "invalidated" by moving to a neighbouring constellation—it is now a star of the constellation [[Delphinus]].&lt;ref name="jrasc92"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''New England water resource region''' is one of 21 major geographic areas, or [[Water resource region|regions]], in the first level of classification used by the [[United States Geological Survey]] to divide and sub-divide the [[United States]] into successively smaller [[hydrologic unit]]s. These geographic areas contain either the drainage area of a major river, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers.&lt;ref name=USGS_WS&gt;{{cite web|title=Science in Your Watershed - Locate Your Watershed|url=http://water.usgs.gov/wsc/watershed_finder.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrologic Unit Maps|url=http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The New England region, which is listed with a 2-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) of 01, has an approximate size of {{convert|73,753|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}}, and consists of 11 sub-regions, which are listed with the 4-digit HUCs 0101 through 0111.

This region includes the drainage within the United States that ultimately discharges into: (a) the [[Bay of Fundy]]; (b) the [[Atlantic Ocean]] within and between the states of [[Maine]] and [[Connecticut]]; (c) [[Long Island Sound]] north of the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Connecticut]] state line; and (d) the [[Saint-François River|Riviere St. Francois]], a tributary of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. Includes all of [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Rhode Island]], and parts of [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC_name&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Descriptions and Names of Regions, Subregions, Accounting Units and Cataloging Units|url=https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc_name.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth poster.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|The internal structure of Earth]]

The '''outer core''' of the Earth is a fluid layer about {{convert|2400|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick and composed of mostly [[iron]] and [[nickel]] that lies above Earth's solid [[inner core]] and below its [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earth's Interior |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/earths-interior/ |website=Science &amp; Innovation |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its outer boundary lies {{convert|2890|km|mi|abbr=on}} beneath Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately {{convert|5150|km|mi|abbr=on}} beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike the inner core, the outer core is liquid. The inner core is also referred to as the solid core.&lt;ref&gt;Beno Gutenberg (4 June 2016). Physics of the Earth's Interior. Elsevier. pp. 115–. {{ISBN|978-1-4832-8212-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Seismic inversions of [[Seismic wave#Body waves|body waves]] and [[Seismic wave#Free oscillations of the Earth|normal modes]] constrain the radius of the outer core to be 3483&amp;nbsp;km with an uncertainty of 5&amp;nbsp;km, while that of the inner core is 1220±10&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Ahrens|editor-first1=Thomas J.|title=Global earth physics a handbook of physical constants|date=1995|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780875908519|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}}

Estimates for the temperature of the outer core are about {{convert|3000|–|4500|K|abbr=on}} in its outer regions and {{convert|4000|–|8000|K|abbr=on}} near the inner core.&lt;ref name="DeWijs98"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The viscosity of liquid iron at the physical conditions of the Earth's core |doi=10.1038/33905 |url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfbdxa/pubblicazioni/nat.pdf |volume=392 |issue=6678 |year=1998 |last1=De Wijs |first1=Gilles A. |last2=Kresse |first2=Georg |last3=Vočadlo |first3=Lidunka |last4=Dobson |first4=David |last5=Alfè |first5=Dario |last6=Gillan |first6=Michael J. |last7=Price |first7=Geoffrey D. |journal=Nature |pages=805 |bibcode=1998Natur.392..805D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for a fluid outer core includes  from [[seismology]] which shows that [[Seismic wave|seismic]] [[S-wave|shear-waves]] are not transmitted through the outer core&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffreys|first=Harold|date=1926-06-01|title=The Rigidity of the Earth's Central Core.|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1926.tb05385.x/abstract|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=1|issue=|pages=371–383|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1926.tb05385.x|issn=1365-246X|pmid=|access-date=|via=|bibcode=1926GeoJ....1..371J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its high temperature, modeling work has shown that the outer core is a low [[viscosity]] fluid that convects [[turbulence|turbulently]].&lt;ref name="DeWijs98" /&gt; [[Eddy current]]s in the nickel iron [[fluid]] of the outer core are believed to influence the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

[[Sulfur]] and [[oxygen]] could be present in the outer core.&lt;ref name=nature473_361&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Gubbins |first2=Binod |last2=Sreenivasan |first3=Jon |last3=Mound |first4=Sebastian |last4=Rost |title=Melting of the Earth's inner core |journal=Nature |volume=473 |pages=361–363 |date=May 19, 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10068 |issue=7347 |pmid=21593868 |bibcode=2011Natur.473..361G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As heat is transferred outward toward the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid region to freeze, causing the solid inner core to grow.

The white, square feldspar [[phenocrysts]] are much larger than crystals in the surrounding matrix; eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], Rock Creek Canyon, California.]]
'''Porphyritic''' is an adjective used in [[geology]], specifically for [[igneous rock]]s, for a rock that has a distinct difference in the size of the crystals, with at least one group of crystals obviously larger than another group.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, R. and Skinner, B., 1979, Rocks and Rock Minerals, pg. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Porphyritic rocks may be [[aphanite]]s or [[extrusive rock]], with large crystals or [[phenocryst]]s floating in a fine-grained [[groundmass]] of non-visible crystals, as in a porphyritic [[basalt]], or [[phanerite]]s or [[intrusive rock]], with individual crystals of the groundmass easily distinguished with the eye, but one group of crystals clearly much bigger than the rest, as in a porphyritic [[granite]].  Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture.  One main type of rock that has a porphyritic texture are [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], though not all porphyritic rocks are porphyries.

== Formation ==

Porphyritic rocks are formed when a column of rising [[magma]] is cooled in two stages.  In the first stage, the magma is cooled slowly deep in the crust, creating the large crystal grains, with a diameter of 2&amp;nbsp;mm or more.  In the final stage, the magma is cooled rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a [[volcano]], creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye typically referred to as the ground mass.

'''Project Mohole''' was an ambitious attempt in the early 1960s to drill through the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] into the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]], and to provide an Earth science complement to the high-profile [[Space Race]]. The project was initially led by the [[American Miscellaneous Society]] with funding from the [[National Science Foundation]].

== History ==
[[File:Mohopix-1.gif|thumb|200px|''CUSS I'']]

Phase One was executed in spring 1961. Five holes were drilled off the coast of [[Guadalupe Island]], [[Mexico]], the deepest to {{convert|601|ft|abbr=on}} below the sea floor in {{convert|11700|ft|abbr=on}} of water. This was unprecedented: not in the hole's depth but because of the depth of the ocean and because it was drilled from an untethered platform. Also, the [[core sample]] proved to be valuable, penetrating through [[Miocene]]-age sediments for the first time to reveal the lowest 13&amp;nbsp;m (44&amp;nbsp;ft) consisting of [[basalt]].

Project Mohole contracted with Global Marine  of Los Angeles for the use of its oil drillship ''CUSS I''.  A consortium of [[Continental Oil Company|Continental]], [[Union Oil Company|Union]], [[Superior Oil Company|Superior]] and [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] Oil Companies, CUSS had originally developed it in 1956 as a technological test bed for the nascent [[offshore oil industry]]. ''CUSS I'' was one of the first vessels in the world capable of drilling in water depth up to {{convert|11700|ft|abbr=on}}, while maintaining a position within a radius of {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Project Mohole expanded its operational range by inventing what is now known as [[dynamic positioning]].&lt;ref name="Van Keuren"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Keuren|first=David K.|title=The Machine in Neptune's Garden: Historical Perspectives on Technology and the Marine Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fj0sCBGo1DEC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=Global+Marine+of+Los+Angeles+CUSS+I&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_sKeXA0Kqb&amp;sig=vufDicL8pqzQy2n7zMlBL2x6QCc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NYEXU_eNCcnClQWC5oHICg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Global%20Marine%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20CUSS%20I&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 March 2014|publisher=Science History Publications|date=2004|isbn=0881353728|pages=183–210|chapter=Chapter 6: Breaking New Ground-The Origins of Scientific Ocean Drilling}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phase One proved that both the technology and expertise were available to drill into the [[Earth's mantle]].  It was intended as the experimental phase of the project, and did succeed in drilling to a depth of 601 feet below the sea floor.&lt;ref name=natac&gt;{{citation|title=Project Mohole, 1958-1966|publisher=National Academies|url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/history/mohole/|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IODP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iodp.org/project-mohole|title=Project Mohole|publisher=[[International Ocean Discovery Program|IODP]]|accessdate=5 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005146/http://www.iodp.org/project-mohole|archivedate = 6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, deeper drilling never took place. An attempted shift of operational control to the National Science Foundation proved unsatisfactory, and in short order the American Miscellaneous Society dissolved itself, Phase Two of the project was abandoned and the entire project was discontinued by Congress, which objected to increasing costs in 1966.&lt;ref name=natac /&gt;&lt;ref name="IODP"/&gt;

'''''Ravens in Winter''''' is a 1989 book by [[Bernd Heinrich]]. It is a study of the behaviour of [[Common raven|ravens]] in the forests of [[Maine]].

==Reception==
A review of ''Ravens in Winter'' by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote "The story related here, which is constructed from his [Heinrich's] field notes, moves slowly; we learn a good deal about scientific methods and a lot about patience. Overall, however, the book is suspenseful and exciting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/9780671678098 |title=Ravens in Winter: A Zoological Detective Story |date=October 1, 1989 |website=Publishers Weekly |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New Scientist]]'' review summarised the book concluding "It also contains Heinrich's own - and excellent - drawings of the various raven postures, a comprehensive review of the literature, beginning with the Bible, and even a section of the ravens of the Tower of London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 25, 1989 |title=Review: Altruistic ravens |author=Jonathan Beard |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd |volume=124 |issue=1692 |page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists acknowledge that "Heinrich's helpful ravens [as discussed in ''Ravens in Winter''] are now a classic example of animal altruism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2006 |title=Altruism: an accident of nature? |author=Sadie F.

[[File:Weeklysst.gif|thumb|right|Weekly average '''sea surface temperature''' for the [[World Ocean]] during the first week of February 2011, during a period of [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation#Effects of ENSO's cool phase (La Niña)|La Niña]].]]
[[File:ECCO2 Sea Surface Temperature and Flows.ogv|thumb|Sea surface temperature and flows.]]

'''Sea surface temperature''' (SST) is the water [[temperature]] close to the [[ocean]]'s surface. The exact meaning of ''surface'' varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between {{convert|1|mm|in|sigfig=1}} and {{convert|20|m|ft|sigfig=1}} below the [[sea]] surface.  [[Air mass]]es in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore.  Localized areas of heavy [[snow]] can form in [[rainband|bands]] downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass.  Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of [[tropical cyclogenesis]] over the [[Earth]]'s oceans.  Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper {{convert|30|m|ft|sigfig=1}} of the ocean.  SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days.  In addition, [[ocean current]]s such as the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]] (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-05-global-climate-verge-multi-decadal.html|doi=10.1038/nature14491|authors=Gerard D. McCarthy, Ivan D. Haigh, Joël J.M. Hirschi, Jeremy P. Grist &amp; David A. Smeed|date=27 May 2015|journal=Nature|title=Ocean impact on decadal Atlantic climate variability revealed by sea-level observations|bibcode = 2015Natur.521..508M|volume=521|pages=508–510|pmid=26017453}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major impact results from the global [[thermohaline]] circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.

'''Ocean temperature''' is related to [[ocean heat content]], an important topic in the debate over [[global warming]]. 

Coastal SSTs can cause offshore winds to generate [[upwelling]], which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a [[continental shelf]] are often warmer.  Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as the northwest coast of [[South America]].  Its values are important within [[numerical weather prediction]] as the SST influences the atmosphere above, such as in the formation of [[sea breeze]]s and [[advection fog#Types|sea fog]].  It is also used to calibrate measurements from [[weather satellite]]s.

==Measurement==
[[File:MODIS and AIRS SST comp fig2.i.jpg|right|thumb|Temperature profile of the surface layer of the ocean (a) at night and (b) during the day]]
There are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured.  Away from the immediate sea surface, general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement.  This is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths, especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients (a diurnal [[thermocline]]).&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;   Sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean, known as the near-surface layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tZary8a4HMwC&amp;dq=ocean+layers+book&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=ocean%20layers%20book&amp;f=false|page=xi|author1=Alexander Soloviev |author2=Roger Lukas |title=The near-surface layer of the ocean: structure, dynamics and applications|isbn=978-1-4020-4052-8|year=2006|publisher=シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermometers===
SST was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured.  [[Benjamin Franklin]] suspended a [[mercury thermometer]] from a ship while travelling between the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] in his survey of the [[Gulf stream]] in the late eighteenth century.  SST was later measured by dipping a [[thermometer]] into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface.  The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963.  These observations have a warm bias of around {{convert|0.6|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}} due to the heat of the engine room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A6ew-bJDIDIC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=measurement+of+sea+surface+temperature+bucket+of+water+book#v=onepage&amp;q=measurement%20of%20sea%20surface%20temperature%20bucket%20of%20water%20book&amp;f=false|pages=24–25|title=Data analysis methods in physical oceanography|author1=William J.

Thomson |year=2001|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-0-444-50757-0|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This bias has led to changes in the &lt;!-- scientific or public? --&gt; perception of [[global warming]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19772-ships-and-buoys-made-global-warming-look-slower-.html|journal=New Scientist|author=Michael Marshall|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2011-01-29|title=Ships and buoys made global warming look slower}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fixed [[weather buoy]]s measure the water temperature at a depth of {{convert|3|m|ft}}. Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burroughs|first=William James|title=Climate change : a multidisciplinary approach|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521690331|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies.

NOAA's &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.goes.noaa.gov/ GOES (Geostationary Orbiting Earth Satellites)]&lt;/span&gt; satellites are [[geostationary orbit|geo-stationary]] above the Western Hemisphere which enables to them to deliver SST data on an hourly basis with only a few hours of lag time.

There are several difficulties with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates from the [[Sea surface microlayer|top "skin" of the ocean]], approximately the top 0.01 [[millimetre|mm]] or less, which may not represent the [[bulk temperature]] of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth &lt;!-- clarify --&gt;efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jk1fIo51uwMC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=measurement+of+sea+surface+temperature+book#v=onepage&amp;q=measurement%20of%20sea%20surface%20temperature%20book&amp;f=false|page=279|author=Ian Stuart Robinson|title=Measuring the oceans from space: the principles and methods of satellite oceanography|publisher=Springer|year=2004|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-3-540-42647-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;  However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover.&lt;ref name="John"/&gt;  Within atmospheric sounder channels on [[weather satellite]]s, which peak just above the ocean's surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
El Niño is defined by prolonged differences in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The accepted definition is a warming or cooling of at least 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.9&amp;nbsp;°F) averaged over the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean.  Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2–7 years and lasts nine months to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensofaq.shtml#HOWOFTEN|title=ENSO FAQ: How often do El Niño and La Niña typically occur?|accessdate=2009-07-26|date=2005-12-19|author=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average period length is 5 years. When this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña "conditions"; when it occurs for more than that period, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña "episodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/enso/?year=2009&amp;month=6&amp;submitted=true|title=El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) June 2009|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign of an El Niño in the sea surface temperature pattern is when warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east Pacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific.  El Niño's warm rush of nutrient-poor tropical water, heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the [[Humboldt Current]]. When El Niño conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in Easterly Trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious.&lt;ref name="deadfish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml|title=El Niño|date=1998-04-28|accessdate=2009-07-17|author=WW2010|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea surface temperature affects the behavior of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] above, so their initialization into [[atmospheric model]]s is important.  While sea surface temperature is important for [[tropical cyclogenesis]], it is also important in determining the formation of sea fog and sea breezes.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hH2NkL_318wC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=sea+surface+temperature+forecasting+numerical+weather+prediction+book#v=onepage&amp;q=sea%20surface%20temperature%20forecasting%20numerical%20weather%20prediction%20book&amp;f=false|page=263|title=Oceanography from Space: Revisited|author=Vittorio Barale|year=2010|accessdate=2011-01-09|isbn=978-90-481-8680-8|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as {{convert|35|km|mi}} to {{convert|40|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/fm26377722407422/|author=Jun Inoue, Masayuki Kawashima, Yasushi Fujiyoshi and Masaaki Wakatsuchi|title=Aircraft Observations of Air-mass Modification Over the Sea of Okhotsk during Sea-ice Growth|issue=1|date=October 2005|doi=10.1007/s10546-004-3407-y|pages=111–129|issn=0006-8314|volume=117| journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology|bibcode = 2005BoLMe.117..111I }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, southwest of Northern Hemisphere [[extratropical cyclone]]s, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow [[lake-effect snow]] (or sea effect) bands. Those bands bring strong localized [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], often in the form of [[snow]], since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences—larger than {{convert|13|C-change|F-change|sigfig=2}}—between the water surface and the air above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=B.

Ocean temperature of at least 26.5[[degrees Celsius|°C]] (79.7[[degrees Fahrenheit|°F]]) spanning through at minimum a 50-[[metre]] depth is one of the precursors needed to maintain a [[tropical cyclone]] (a type of [[mesocyclone]]).&lt;ref name="A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=Subject: A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|accessdate=2011-01-27|year=2011|publisher=[[Hurricane Research Division]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SST&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster|first=PJ|title=Changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA136847986&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=mnastbens&amp;it=r&amp;p=PROF&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=335992f2037df3339c5901f7981d2045|publisher=Gale Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These warm waters are needed to maintain the [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics|warm core]] that fuels tropical systems.  This value is well above 16.1&amp;nbsp;°C (60.9&amp;nbsp;°F), the long term global average surface temperature of the oceans.&lt;ref name="SSTMEAN"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Matt Menne | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmb-faq/anomalies.php#mean | title = Global Long-term Mean Land and Sea Surface Temperatures | date = March 15, 2000 | accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this requirement can be considered only a general baseline because it assumes that the ambient atmospheric environment surrounding an area of disturbed weather presents average conditions. Tropical cyclones have intensified when SSTs were slightly below this standard temperature.

Tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500&amp;nbsp;[[hPa]] level, or 5.9&amp;nbsp;km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain [[lapse rate]] is required to force the atmosphere to be [[Baroclinic instability|unstable]] enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% [[relative humidity]], the required lapse rate is 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C/km.&lt;ref name="TCS EESC"&gt;{{cite web|year=2000|last=Kushnir|first=Yochanan|title=The Climate System|url=http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/atm_phys.html|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, the air temperature averages −7&amp;nbsp;°C (18&amp;nbsp;°F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this height, giving the air room to [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet-bulb]], or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500&amp;nbsp;hPa in a tropical atmosphere of {{convert|-13.2|C|F}} is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is {{convert|26.5|C|F}}, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1&amp;nbsp;°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1&amp;nbsp;°C change at 500&amp;nbsp;hpa.
Inside a [[cold-core low|cold cyclone]], 500&amp;nbsp;hPa temperatures can fall as low as {{convert|-30|C|F}}, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the [[troposphere]], roughly at the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500&amp;nbsp;hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=John M.

'''Spatial association''' is the degree to which things are similarly arranged in space. Analysis of the distribution patterns of two phenomena is done by map overlay. If the distributions are similar, then the spatial association is strong, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spatial Association|url=http://www.gtav.asn.au/CMS200/files/cms_files/Spatialassociationactivities.pdf|publisher=Geography Teachers' Association of Victoria|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Geographic Information System]], the analysis can be done quantitatively. For example, a set of observations (as points or extracted from raster cells) at matching locations can be intersected and examined by [[regression analysis]].

Like [[spatial autocorrelation]], this can be a useful tool for spatial prediction. In spatial modeling, the concept of spatial association allows the use of covariates in a regression equation to predict the geographic field and thus produce a map.

The story, which Tenn described as having been inspired by the [[Korean War]],&lt;ref&gt;Tenn 2001, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; portrays [[Earth]] as the battleground between two powerful alien races, the Troxxt and the Dendi, who repeatedly "liberate" it from each other.

At the time the story begins, the Troxxt and the Dendi have long since abandoned the (literally) shattered remnants of Earth as being too dangerous for civilized people; humanity is nearly extinct, with the few survivors having descended into starving savagery as they struggle for air.

==Plot summary==
The story is told from the point of view of the future descendants of the humans that were nearly annihilated by throughout the course of these constant "liberations". Each alien race convinces the inhabitants of Earth to assist them in their war against the other race, always making sure to paint themselves as the force of good and the opposing race as the evil aggressors. When the Earth is then "reliberated" by the other alien race, the inhabitants of Earth are reproached for having believed the lies told by their previous occupiers. This cycle of liberation and re-liberation continues until the Earth is left a shell of its former self. During the course of the occupation, most of the human race has been killed, its ecosystem has been destroyed, and the planet’s unstable orbit threatens to fling them all into space. The future inhabitants of Earth barely resemble their human ancestors, leading desperate lives on a ravaged planet, and ran from "water puddle to distant water puddle, across the searing heat of yellow sand", "sucked air", and "frantically grabbed at clusters of thick green weed".

==Critical response==
[[Nick Gevers]] has described "The Liberation of Earth" as "great",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rodger Turner, Webmaster |url=http://www.sfsite.com/06b/ip106.htm |title=The SF Site Featured Review: Immodest Proposals |publisher=Sfsite.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' columnist Rich Horton described it as "one of 1953's best shorts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Reviews/02Horton_1953Best.html |title=Locus Online: Rich Horton surveys the Best of 1953 |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2004-02-20 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in the anthology [[Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 15 (1953)|''Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 15'']] as one of the best science fiction short stories of 1953. It was also reprinted in the 2016 anthology ''The Big Book of Science Fiction''.

'''''The River''''', also known as '''''The Return'''''{{ref|name}} and '''''Hatchet: The Return'''''{{ref|name}}, is a 1991 [[Young adult literature|young adult]] novel by [[Gary Paulsen]].  It is the second installment in the ''Hatchet'' series, but chronologically the third with ''[[Brian's Winter]]'' serving as an alternative second book.

==Plot==
Brian Robeson, a 15-year-old boy who spent 54 days surviving alone in the Canadian wilderness the previous summer, is hired by the government to again live in the woods with only two knives and surviving only by his wits, so the military can learn his [[survival skills|survival techniques]]. Though reluctant at first, Brian eventually agrees. This time, Brian sets out for a remote Canadian location accompanied by Derek Holtzer, a government [[psychologist]].

Though the government stipulated the duo take emergency supplies, Brian insists they abandon everything but a knife and an emergency [[radio]], saying that it would be impossible to eat bugs and sleep in the rain if a tent and prepared food is within reach. During their stay, things take a grim turn when their camp is struck by lightning, which knocks Derek into a [[coma]] and destroys the radio. Knowing that Derek will die of [[dehydration]] long before anyone finds them, Brian builds a [[raft]] in a desperate bid to navigate down the unknown river to the nearest inhabited point known as Brannock's Trading Post for emergency aid. The biggest problem is the trading post is 100 miles down river. Despite rapids, the craft's unwieldiness, exhaustion, and a lack of geographical knowledge, they finally reach the trading post and Derek survives. After the two get back home, Derek buys Brian a [[canoe]] named ''The Raft'' as a thank you present.

'''Tugarinovite''' is a rare [[molybdenum]] [[oxide mineral]] with formula MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
It occurs as a primary mineral phase associated with [[metasomatism]] in a [[sulfur]] deficient [[Redox|reducing]] environment.  In the [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] it occurs with [[uraninite]], [[molybdenite]], [[galena]], [[zircon]] and [[wulfenite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

Tugarinovite was first described for an occurrence in the Lenskoye molybdenum–uranium deposit in the [[Amur Oblast|Amurskaya Oblast]], [[Russian Far East|Far-Eastern Region]], [[Russia]].  It was named for geochemist Ivan Alekseevich Tugarinov of the Vernadskii Institute in Moscow.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;
In addition to its type locality in Russia it has been reported from the [[Allende meteorite]] in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]], the [[Ryukyu Islands|Nansei Archipelago]] of [[Japan]] and [[Bohemia]] in the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

A '''''zapis''''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|запис}}, {{IPA-sh|zǎːpis|sr}}, literally "inscription"; plural: '''''zapisi''''' (записи)) is a [[tree]] in [[Serbia]] that is sacred for the village within whose bounds it is situated.&lt;ref name=agapkina&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Prayers are offered to God under the crown of the ''zapis'', where [[church services]] may also be held, especially during village festivals observed to supplicate God for protection against destructive weather conditions. In settlements without a church, ceremonies such as weddings and baptisms were once conducted under the tree. Folk tradition maintains that great misfortune will befall anyone that dares fell a ''zapis''. According to Serbian scholar [[Veselin Čajkanović]], the ''zapis'' is inherited from the [[Slavic mythology|pre-Christian religion]] of the [[Serbs]], in which it had been used as a temple.

==Religious practices==
The selected tree becomes a ''zapis'' through the rite of consecration performed by a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest, in which a cross is inscribed into its bark. The ''zapis'' is chosen from large trees, primarily [[oak]]s, but also [[elm]]s, [[Fraxinus|ash]]es, [[beech]]es, [[Pear|pear trees]], and [[hazel]]s. A large cross, often made of stone, may be erected beside the zapis, and the surrounding area may be fenced. The ''zapis'' is inviolable: it is believed that great misfortune will befall anyone that dares fell it. Climbing it, sleeping under it, and picking its fruits and twigs, are also forbidden. Even the branches and fruits that fall from the tree should not be collected.&lt;ref name=agapkina/&gt; A village may have more than one ''zapis'': the main one in the settlement or near it, and several others in the village's fields,&lt;ref name=cajkanovic&gt;{{cite book

The ''zapis'' plays an important role in rites connected with the festival known as ''krstonoše'', meaning "crossbearers", which is publicly celebrated within the village to supplicate God for protection against destructive weather conditions, as well as to ensure a good harvest. Not all villages celebrate ''krstonoše'' on the same day, but it usually falls between [[Easter]] and the eve of [[Apostles' Fast|St. Peter's Fast]]. Some villages have abandoned this festival. ''Krstonoše'' commences with villagers gathering at the church and forming a procession headed by a cross, an [[icon]], and church banners. The procession walks a closed line around the settlement, encircling as much of the village's territory as possible, and then returns to the church.&lt;ref name=vukovic&gt;{{Cite book

On its way, the procession stops by each ''zapis'' and at some crossroads, where the priest chants prayers.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; The cross inscribed in the ''zapis'''s bark is renewed, and the tree is [[Thurible|cense]]d. In eastern Serbia, a small hole is bored into the trunk and filled with cooking oil and [[incense]].&lt;ref name=cajkanovic/&gt; The service on this festival is held under the crown of the main ''zapis'', or in the church after the procession returns.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; During the service, the priest and the man elected for the host of the ''krstonoše'' hold together a round loaf of bread, rotate it three times counterclockwise, and break it into two halves. One half is given to the priest and the other to the man who will host the following year's ''krstonoše''. A feast for the participants in the procession may be prepared under the main ''zapis'' and they may also dance the ''[[Kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' there.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; A sheеp used to be sacrificed under the tree so that its blood spilled on the trunk and roots.&lt;ref name=agapkina/&gt;

Some villages and hamlets in Serbia also observe a festival commemorating a disaster that has befallen the settlement, such as a flood, fire, or lightning strike. The festival is called the ''zavetina'', the name being derived from the noun ''zavet'', meaning vow. The service on the ''zavetina'' may be held in the shelter of the ''zapis''.&lt;ref name=vukovic/&gt; In settlements without a church, ceremonies such as weddings and baptisms were conducted under the crown of the ''zapis''. People with health problems used to leave their clothes on the tree by night, believing this would help restore their health.&lt;ref name=agapkina/&gt; In the regions of Pek and Zvižd, in eastern Serbia, a fire used to be built under the tree on the eve of [[Lent]]. In [[Gruža (region)|Gruža]], money was lent under the ''zapis''.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic/&gt;

==Origin and similar traditions==
In his study on the cult of trees among ancient Serbs, [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Veselin Čajkanović]] states that the ''zapis'' is inherited from the Serbs' pre-Christian religion, in which it had been used as a temple.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2&gt;{{cite book

A ''zapis'' is primarily selected from oaks, the trees associated with [[Perun]]—the [[thunder god]] of the ancient Slavic religion. A Serbian legend relates the story of a king who always prayed to God under a pear tree rather than in a church, saying, "the pear tree is my church." His prayers were so effective that he eventually became a saint.&lt;ref name=cajkanovic2/&gt;

A reverence towards trees, similar to that extended upon the ''zapis'', has also been recorded in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. During Easter, in the region of [[Gevgelija]], the [[Eucharist]] was once given to selected pear trees. Each was surrounded with icons, after which a priest read from a [[Gospel]] facing the tree, sprinkled it with [[holy water]], and then put the consecrated bread under its bark. In other areas, there was a custom of placing a cross, a fireplace, and a table made of stone by a tree on a hillock near a river or lake.&lt;ref name=agapkina/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">'''Ṭūbā''' ({{lang-ar|طُـوْبَىٰ|lit=blessedness}}) is a term often associated with a [[tree]] that some Muslims believe grows in ''Al-[[Jannah]]'' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْـجَـنَّـة}}, the [[Islam]]ic [[Heaven]]).

The term is only mentioned once in the [[Koran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=13&amp;verse=29 Quran 13:29.] Retrieved 30 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of blessedness and it is not mentioned as a [[Tree]] by name. The only other source that relates the arguably same term to a tree is a [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bukhari/bh4/bh4_478.htm ''Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī'' 4:474]  Retrieved 30 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has caught the imagination of writers over the years. For example, [[Sohrevardi]] developed a story surrounding the old Persian mythology and suggests that it is indeed a Tree in the heaven where the mythical bird [[Simurgh]] lay eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I0LYAAAAMAAJ Sohrevardi's ''The Philosophy of Illumination''.] Retrieved 30 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1449, [[Mehmed Yazıcıoğlu]] wrote of a similar tree in ''The Creation of Paradise'' in his manuscript called ''Muhammediye'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11238/ ''Book of Muhammad'' (Turkish: ''Muhammediye'').] Retrieved 30 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/turkishpoetry1.asp "Medieval Sourcebook: The Legends &amp; Poetry of The Turks", selections.] from Charles F. Horne, ed., ''The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East''. Retrieved 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|In its courtyard's riven center, planted he the Tuba-Tree;
That a tree which hangeth downward, high aloft its roots are there:
Thus its radiance all the Heavens lighteth up from end to end,
Flooding every tent and palace, every lane and every square.
Such a tree the Tuba, that the Gracious One hath in its sap
Hidden whatsoe'er there be of gifts and presents good and fair;
Forth therefrom crowns, thrones, and jewels, yea, and steeds and coursers come,
Golden leaves and clearest crystals, wines most pure beyond compare.
For his sake there into being hath he called the Tuba-Tree,
That from Ebu-Qasim's hand might every one receive his share.}}

According to Islamic tradition, when the wife of the Prophet asked him the reason of kissing his daughter a lot. He replied that during Ascension, I ate the fruits of Tuba and when I returned I became intimate with my wife and Fatimah was born. So, whenever I kiss Fatimah I smell the fragrance of that tree of Paradise. &lt;ref&gt;Tafsir Bahrani https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=4&amp;tTafsirNo=110&amp;tSoraNo=13&amp;tAyahNo=29&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;Page=1&amp;Size=1&amp;LanguageId=1 &lt;/ref&gt;
