The '''AAAS Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility''' is given by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and honours scientists and engineers whose exemplary actions, often taken at significant personal cost, have served to foster scientific freedom and responsibility and increased scientific awareness throughout the world. &lt;ref name=aaas&gt;[https://www.aaas.org/page/aaas-award-scientific-freedom-and-responsibility AAAD Awards – AAAS Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility] AAAS webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;The establishment of this new Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility was announced by AAAS executive officer William D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21962">An '''adventure playground''' is a specific type of [[playground]] for children.  Adventure playgrounds can take many forms, ranging from "natural playgrounds" to "junk playgrounds", and are typically defined by an ethos of unrestricted [[play (activity)|play]], the presence of [[playwork| playworkers]] (or "wardens"), and the absence of adult-manufactured or rigid play-structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/playworkers-ph-ds-and-the-growing-adventure-playground-movement|title= Playworkers, Ph.Ds, and the Growing Adventure Playground Movement |last= Tao |first= Tao Holmes|date= November 6, 2015 |website= atlasobscura.com|publisher= Atlasobscura|access-date= January 29, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt; "Play is a process that is freely chosen, personally directed and intrinsically motivated.

== History ==
Harry Shier, in ''Adventure Playgrounds: an introduction'' (1984) defines an Adventure Playground this way:

{{Quote frame |quote=An Adventure Playground is an area fenced off and set aside for children. Within its boundaries children can play freely, in their own way, in their own time. But what is special about an Adventure Playground is that here (and increasingly in contemporary urban society, only here) children can build and shape the environment according to their own creative vision. |author=Harry Shier |title=Adventure Playgrounds: An Introduction |source=NPFA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shier|first= Harry|date= 1984|title= Adventure Playgrounds: an introduction |url= http://www.londonplay.org.uk/resources/0000/1190/1984_Intro_to_APs_Harry_Shier.pdf |location= London, UK|publisher= National Playing Fields Association|page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first ''planned'' playground of this type, the [[Emdrup Junk Playground]], opened in [[Emdrup]], Denmark, in 1943. In 1948, an adventure playground opened in [[Camberwell]], England.  The term "junk playground" is a  [[calque]] from the Danish term ''skrammellegeplads''. Early examples of adventure playgrounds in the UK were known as "junk playgrounds", "waste material playgrounds", or "bomb-site adventure playgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilson |first= Penny|date= 2010 |title= The Playwork Primer|url= http://www.allianceforchildhood.org/sites/allianceforchildhood.org/files/file/PlayworkPrimer_2010.pdf|location= |publisher= Alliance for Childhood |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilson|first= Reilly Bergin|date= 2014|title= Who Owns the Playground: Space and Power at Lollard Adventure Playground (1954-1961)|type= M.A.|chapter= |publisher= University of Leeds |docket= |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Owns_the_Playground.html?id=sk_psgEACAAJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "adventure playground" was first adopted in the United Kingdom to describe waste material playgrounds "in an effort to make the ‘junk’ playground concept more palatable to local authorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilson|first= Reilly Bergin|date= 2014|title= Who Owns the Playground: Space and Power at Lollard Adventure Playground (1954-1961)|type= M.A.|chapter= |publisher= University of Leeds |docket= |oclc= |page = 21|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Owns_the_Playground.html?id=sk_psgEACAAJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Denmark===
The first junk playgrounds were based on the ideas of [[C.Th. Sørensen|Carl Theodor Sørensen]], a Danish landscape architect, who noticed that children preferred to play everywhere but in the playgrounds that he designed. In 1931, inspired by the sight of children playing in a construction site, he imagined "A junk playground in which children could create and shape, dream and imagine a reality". His aim was to provide children living in cities the same opportunities for play that were enjoyed by children living in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adventureplaygrounds.hampshire.edu/history.html|title= History of Adventure Playgrounds |last= Sutton |first= Lia |date= 2011 |website= adventureplaygrounds.hampshire.edu/|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first adventure playground was set up by a Workers Cooperative Housing Association in [[Emdrup]], Denmark, during the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupation of the 1940s]].  The playground at [[Emdrup]] grew out of the [[Danish resistance movement|spirit of resistance]] to Nazi occupation and parents' fears that "their children's play might be mistaken for acts of sabotage by soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/36947-when-play-is-criminalized-racial-disparities-in-childhood|title= When Play Is Criminalized: Racial Disparities in Childhood|last=  Eisa |first= Nefertari Ulen|date=  July 25, 2016 |website=  truth-out.org|publisher= Truth Out |access-date= January 22, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Play advocates sometimes emphasize the importance of adventure playgrounds for children of color in the United States, where policing "can feel like a kind of occupation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/36947-when-play-is-criminalized-racial-disparities-in-childhood|title= When Play Is Criminalized: Racial Disparities in Childhood|last=  Eisa |first= Nefertari Ulen|date=  July 25, 2016 |website=  truth-out.org|publisher= Truth Out |access-date= January 22, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The UK===
[[Marjory Allen, Lady Allen of Hurtwood| Marjory Allen]], an English landscape architect and child welfare advocate, visited and subsequently wrote a widely-read article about the Emdrup Adventure playground titled ''Why Not Use Our Bomb Sites Like This?'' and published in the Picture Post in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Highmore|first= Ben |last2= |first2= |date= 2013 |title= Playgrounds and Bombsites: Postwar Britain's Ruined Landscapes|url= |journal= Cultural Politics |volume= 9|issue= 3|pages= |doi= 10.1215/17432197-2347009 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Marjory Allen, Lady Allen of Hurtwood| Marjory Allen's]] article is often credited with the introduction into the UK of "the idea of transforming bomb sites into 'junk playgrounds', historians of the Adventure playground movement have pointed to the role played by other experiments carried out by [[History of youth work|youth workers]] in the UK. For example, "Marie Paneth, an art therapist heavily influenced by Freud, independently developed the concept of permissive play as a tool for ameliorating childhood aggression in her work running a blitz-era play centre in London although not specifically incorporating the elements of a Junk/Adventure playground pointing to her role in the history of UK specific Playwork development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilson|first= Reilly Bergin|date= 2014|title= Who Owns the Playground: Space and Power at Lollard Adventure Playground (1954-1961)|type= M.A.|chapter= |publisher= University of Leeds |docket= |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Owns_the_Playground.html?id=sk_psgEACAAJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infed.org/youthwork/bm-pan.htm |title= Featured book: Marie Paneth (1944) Branch Street.

'''Anchoring''' or '''focalism''' is a [[cognitive bias]] for an individual to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (known as the "anchor") when making decisions.

The original description of the anchoring effect came from [[psychophysics]] where it was noticed when judging stimuli along a continuum that the first and last stimuli were used to compare the other stimuli. This is often referred to as end anchoring. This was applied to attitudes by [[Muzafer Sherif|Sherif]] et al. in 1958 in their article "Assimilation and contrast effects of anchoring stimuli on judgments".

During [[decision making]], anchoring occurs when individuals use this initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Those objects near the anchor tend to be assimilated toward it and those further away tend to be displaced in the other direction. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor. This bias occurs when interpreting future information using this anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car, set either before or at the start of negotiations, sets an arbitrary focal point for all following discussions. Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market value of the car.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{Citation | title = Anchoring Definition | publisher = Investopedia | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp | accessdate = September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focusing effect==
The '''focusing effect''' (or '''focusing illusion''') is a [[List of cognitive biases|cognitive bias]] that occurs when people place too much importance on one aspect of an event, causing an error in accurately predicting the [[utility]] of a future outcome.&lt;ref name="Vass"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zoltán Vass|title=A Psychological Interpretation of Drawings and Paintings. The SSCA Method: A Systems Analysis Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHmojkRIbcQC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=27 August 2013|publisher=Alexandra Publishing|isbn=978-963-297-474-3|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People focus on notable differences, excluding those that are less conspicuous, when making predictions about happiness or convenience. For example, when people were asked how much happier they believe Californians are compared to Midwesterners, Californians and Midwesterners both said Californians must be considerably happier, when, in fact, there was no difference between the actual happiness rating of Californians and Midwesterners. The bias lies in that most people focused on and overweighed the sunny weather and ostensibly easy-going lifestyle of [[California]] and devalued and underrated other aspects of life and determinants of happiness, such as low crime rates and safety from natural disasters like earthquakes (both of which large parts of California lack).&lt;ref name="SchkadeKahneman1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schkade|first1=D. Alan|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Does Living in California Make People Happy? A Focusing Illusion in Judgments of Life Satisfaction|journal=Psychological Science|volume=9|issue=5|year=1998|pages=340–346|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rise in income has only a small and transient effect on happiness and well-being, but people consistently overestimate this effect. Academics Daniel Kahneman, along with A. Krueger, D. Schkade, N. Schwarz &amp; A. Stone proposed that this is a result of a focusing illusion, with people focusing on conventional measures of achievement rather than on everyday routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=312 |issue=5782 |pages=1908–10 |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Alan B. Krueger |author3=David Schkade |author4=Norbert Schwarz |author5=Arthur A. Stone  |title=Would you be happier if you were richer?

==Adjustment heuristic==
'''Anchoring and adjustment''' is a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|psychological heuristic]] that influences the way people intuitively assess probabilities. According to this heuristic, people start with an implicitly suggested reference point (the "anchor") and make adjustments to it to reach their estimate. A person begins with a first approximation (anchor) and then makes incremental adjustments based on additional information. These adjustments are usually insufficient, giving the initial anchor a great deal of influence over future assessments.

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]], one of the first researchers to study anchoring.]]
The anchoring and adjustment heuristic was first theorized by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]. In one of their first studies, participants were asked to compute, within 5 seconds, the product of the numbers one through eight, either as &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6 \times 7 \times 8&lt;/math&gt; or reversed as &lt;math&gt;8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;. Because participants did not have enough time to calculate the full answer, they had to make an estimate after their first few multiplications. When these first multiplications gave a small answer – because the sequence started with small numbers – the median estimate was 512; when the sequence started with the larger numbers, the median estimate was 2,250. (The correct answer is 40,320.) In another study by Tversky and Kahneman, participants observed a roulette wheel that was predetermined to stop on either 10 or 65. Participants were then asked to guess the percentage of the United Nations that were African nations. Participants whose wheel stopped on 10 guessed lower values (25% on average) than participants whose wheel stopped at 65 (45% on average).&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|year=1974|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf|pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern has held in other experiments for a wide variety of different subjects of estimation.

As a second example, in a study by [[Dan Ariely]], an audience is first asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate and computer equipment. They were then asked to bid for these items, with the result that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers, which had become their anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Teach, "[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014027 Avoiding Decision Traps]", [[CFO (magazine)|''CFO'']] (1 June 2004). Retrieved 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulty of avoiding===
Various studies have shown that anchoring is very difficult to avoid. For example, in one study students were given anchors that were obviously wrong. They were asked whether [[Mahatma Gandhi]] died before or after age 9, or before or after age 140. Clearly neither of these anchors can be correct, but when the two groups were asked to suggest when they thought he had died, they guessed significantly differently (average age of 50 vs. average age of 67).&lt;ref name="StrackMussweiler1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strack|first1=Fritz|last2=Mussweiler|first2=Thomas|title=Explaining the enigmatic anchoring effect: Mechanisms of selective accessibility.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=3|year=1997|pages=437–446|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.3.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have tried to eliminate anchoring much more directly. In a study exploring the causes and properties of anchoring, participants were exposed to an anchor and asked to guess how many physicians were listed in the local phone book. In addition, they were explicitly informed that anchoring would "contaminate" their responses, and that they should do their best to correct for that. A control group received no anchor and no explanation. Regardless of how they were informed and whether they were informed correctly, all of the experimental groups reported higher estimates than the control group. Thus, despite being expressly aware of the anchoring effect, participants were still unable to avoid it.&lt;ref name="WilsonHouston1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Houston|first2=Christopher E.|last3=Etling|first3=Kathryn M.|last4=Brekke|first4=Nancy|title=A new look at anchoring effects: Basic anchoring and its antecedents.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=125|issue=4|year=1996|pages=387–402|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.125.4.387}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study found that even when offered monetary incentives, people are unable to effectively adjust from an anchor.&lt;ref name="SimmonsLeBoeuf2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simmons|first1=Joseph P.|last2=LeBoeuf|first2=Robyn A.|last3=Nelson|first3=Leif D.|title=The effect of accuracy motivation on anchoring and adjustment: Do people adjust from provided anchors?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=99|issue=6|year=2010|pages=917–932|doi=10.1037/a0021540|pmid=21114351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Several theories have been put forth to explain what causes anchoring, although some explanations are more popular than others, there is no consensus as to which is best.&lt;ref name="FurnhamBoo2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Boo|first2=Hua Chu|title=A literature review of the anchoring effect|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=40|issue=1|year=2011|pages=35–42|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study on possible causes of anchoring, two authors described anchoring as easy to demonstrate, but hard to explain.&lt;ref name="StrackMussweiler1997" /&gt; At least one group of researchers has argued that multiple causes are at play, and that what is called "anchoring" is actually several different effects.&lt;ref name="EpleyGilovich2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epley|first1=Nicholas|last2=Gilovich|first2=Thomas|title=When effortful thinking influences judgmental anchoring: differential effects of forewarning and incentives on self-generated and externally provided anchors|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=18|issue=3|year=2005|pages=199–212|doi=10.1002/bdm.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anchoring-and-adjusting===
In their original study, Tversky and Kahneman put forth a view later termed '''anchoring-as-adjustment'''. According to this theory, once an anchor is set, people adjust away from it to get to their final answer; however, they adjust insufficiently, resulting in their final guess being closer to the anchor than it would be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1992"/&gt; Other researchers also found evidence supporting the anchoring-and-adjusting explanation.&lt;ref name="EpleyGilovich2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epley|first1=N.|last2=Gilovich|first2=T.|title=Putting Adjustment Back in the Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic: Differential Processing of Self-Generated and Experimenter-Provided Anchors|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=5|year=2001|pages=391–396|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00372|pmid=11554672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later researchers criticized this model, because it is only applicable when the initial anchor is outside the range of acceptable answers. To use an earlier example, since Mahatma Gandhi obviously did not die at age 9, then people will adjust from there. If a reasonable number were given, though, there would be no adjustment. Therefore, this theory cannot, according to its critics, explain the anchoring effect.&lt;ref name="MussweilerStrack1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussweiler|first1=Thomas|last2=Strack|first2=Fritz|title=Hypothesis-Consistent Testing and Semantic Priming in the Anchoring Paradigm: A Selective Accessibility Model|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=35|issue=2|year=1999|pages=136–164|url=http://soco.uni-koeln.de/files/JESP35.pdf|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1364|access-date=2014-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129032727/http://soco.uni-koeln.de/files/JESP35.pdf|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the anchoring effect holds even when the anchor is subliminal. According to Tversky and Kahneman's theory, this is impossible, since anchoring is only the result of conscious adjustment.&lt;ref name="MussweilerEnglich2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussweiler|first1=Thomas|last2=Englich|first2=Birte|title=Subliminal anchoring: Judgmental consequences and underlying mechanisms|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=98|issue=2|year=2005|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2004.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of arguments like these, anchoring-and-adjusting has fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Selective accessibility===
In the same study that criticized anchoring-and-adjusting, the authors proposed an alternate explanation regarding '''selective accessibility''', which is derived from a theory called "confirmatory hypothesis testing". In short, selective accessibility proposes that when given an anchor, a judge (i.e. a person making some judgment) will evaluate the hypothesis that the anchor thinks is a suitable answer. Assuming it is not, the judge moves on to another guess, but not before accessing all the relevant attributes of the anchor itself. Then, when evaluating the new answer, the judge looks for ways in which it is similar to the anchor, resulting in the anchoring effect.&lt;ref name="MussweilerStrack1999" /&gt; Various studies have found empirical support for this hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ChapmanJohnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Gretchen B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Eric J.|title=Anchoring, Activation, and the Construction of Values|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=79|issue=2|year=1999|pages=115–153|doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2841}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation assumes that the judge considers the anchor to be a plausible value so that it is not immediately rejected, which would preclude considering its relevant attributes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Attitude change===
More recently, a third explanation of anchoring has been proposed concerning '''attitude change'''. According to this theory, providing an anchor changes someone's attitudes to be more favorable to the particular attributes of that anchor, biasing future answers to have similar characteristics as the anchor. Leading proponents of this theory consider it to be an alternate explanation in line with prior research on anchoring-and-adjusting and selective accessibility.&lt;ref name="WegenerPetty2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wegener|first1=Duane T.|last2=Petty|first2=Richard E.|last3=Detweiler-Bedell|first3=Brian T.|last4=Jarvis|first4=W.Blair G.|title=Implications of Attitude Change Theories for Numerical Anchoring: Anchor Plausibility and the Limits of Anchor Effectiveness|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=62–69|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlankenshipWegener2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blankenship|first1=Kevin L.|last2=Wegener|first2=Duane T.|last3=Petty|first3=Richard E.|last4=Detweiler-Bedell|first4=Brian|last5=Macy|first5=Cheryl L.|title=Elaboration and consequences of anchored estimates: An attitudinal perspective on numerical anchoring|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=6|year=2008|pages=1465–1476|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influencing factors==

===Mood===
A wide range of research has linked sad or depressed moods with more extensive and accurate evaluation of problems.&lt;ref name="BodenhausenGabriel2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=G. V.|last2=Gabriel|first2=S.|last3=Lineberger|first3=M.|title=Sadness and Susceptibility to Judgmental Bias: The Case of Anchoring|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=4|year=2000|pages=320–323|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00263}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, earlier studies hypothesized that people with more depressed moods would tend to use anchoring less than those with happier moods. However, more recent studies have shown the opposite effect: sad people are ''more'' likely to use anchoring than people with happy or neutral mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Englich | first1 = B. | last2 = Soder | first2 = K. | year = 2009 | title = Moody experts: How mood and expertise influence judgmental anchoring | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 41–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
Early research found that experts (those with high knowledge, experience, or expertise in some field) were more resistant to the anchoring effect.&lt;ref name="WilsonHouston1996" /&gt; Since then, however, numerous studies have demonstrated that while experience can sometimes reduce the effect, even experts are susceptible to anchoring. In a study concerning the effects of anchoring on judicial decisions, researchers found that even experienced legal professionals were affected by anchoring. This remained true even when the anchors provided were arbitrary and unrelated to the case in question.&lt;ref name="EnglichMussweiler2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Englich|first1=B.|last3=Strack|first3=Fritz|last2=Mussweiler|first2=Thomas|title=Playing Dice With Criminal Sentences: The Influence of Irrelevant Anchors on Experts' Judicial Decision Making|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=32|issue=2|year=2006|pages=188–200|doi=10.1177/0146167205282152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Research has correlated susceptibility to anchoring with most of the [[Big Five personality traits]]. People high in agreeableness and conscientiousness are more likely to be affected by anchoring, while those high in extraversion are less likely to be affected.&lt;ref name="ErogluCroxton2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eroglu|first1=Cuneyt|last2=Croxton|first2=Keely L.|title=Biases in judgmental adjustments of statistical forecasts: The role of individual differences|journal=International Journal of Forecasting|volume=26|issue=1|year=2010|pages=116–133|doi=10.1016/j.ijforecast.2009.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that those high in openness to new experiences were more susceptible to the anchoring effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McElroy | first1 = T. | last2 = Dowd | first2 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Susceptibility to anchoring effects: How openness-to-experience influences responses to anchoring cues | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 48–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive ability===
The impact of [[cognitive ability]] on anchoring is contested. A recent study on willingness to pay for consumer goods found that anchoring decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear.&lt;ref name="BergmanEllingsen2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergman|first1=Oscar|last2=Ellingsen|first2=Tore|last3=Johannesson|first3=Magnus|last4=Svensson|first4=Cicek|title=Anchoring and cognitive ability|journal=Economics Letters|volume=107|issue=1|year=2010|pages=66–68|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2009.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, however, found that cognitive ability had no significant effect on how likely people were to use anchoring.&lt;ref name="OechsslerRoider2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oechssler|first1=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|title=Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=72|issue=1|year=2009|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In negotiations==
In negotiations, anchoring is setting a boundary that outlines the basic constraints for a negotiation. The anchoring effect is where we set our estimation for the true value of the item at hand.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974" /&gt; In addition to the initial research conducted by Tversky and Kahneman, multiple other studies have shown that anchoring can greatly influence the estimated value of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, D. &amp; Guthrie, C. (2005). "Anchoring, information, expertise, and negotiation: New insights from meta-analysis". Ohio St. J. Disp. Resol., 597, 21. {{SSRN|900152}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although negotiators can generally appraise an offer based on multiple characteristics, studies have shown that they tend to focus on only one aspect. In this way, a deliberate starting point can strongly affect the range of possible counteroffers.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=5|issue=4|year=1992|pages=297–323|doi=10.1007/BF00122574}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of offer and counteroffer results in a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, multiple studies have shown that initial offers have a stronger influence on the outcome of negotiations than subsequent counteroffers.&lt;ref name="KristensenGärling1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristensen|first1=Henrik|last2=Gärling|first2=Tommy|title=The Effects of Anchor Points and Reference Points on Negotiation Process and Outcome|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=71|issue=1|year=1997|pages=85–94|doi=10.1006/obhd.1997.2713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the power of anchoring has been conducted during the Strategic Negotiation Process Workshops. During the workshop, a group of participants is divided into two sections: buyers and sellers. Each side receives identical information about the other party before going into a one-on-one negotiation. Following this exercise, both sides debrief about their experiences. The results show that where the participants anchor the negotiation had a significant effect on their success.&lt;ref name="Dietmeyer2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dietmeyer|first=Brian|title=Strategic Negotiation: A Breakthrough Four-Step Process for Effective Business Negotiation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ_lnQEACAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|isbn=978-0-7931-8304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2014}}

Anchoring affects everyone, even people who are highly knowledgeable in a field. Northcraft and Neale conducted a study to measure the difference in the estimated value of a house between students and real-estate agents. In this experiment, both groups were shown a house and then given different listing prices. After making their offer, each group was then asked to discuss what factors influenced their decisions. In the follow-up interviews, the real-estate agents denied being influenced by the initial price, but the results showed that both groups were equally influenced by that anchor.&lt;ref name="NorthcraftNeale1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Northcraft|first1=Gregory B|last2=Neale|first2=Margaret A|title=Experts, amateurs, and real estate: An anchoring-and-adjustment perspective on property pricing decisions|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=39|issue=1|year=1987|pages=84–97 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(87)90046-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring can have more subtle effects on negotiations as well. Janiszewski and Uy investigated the effects of precision of an anchor. Participants read an initial price for a beach house, then gave the price they thought it was worth. They received either a general, seemingly nonspecific anchor (e.g., $800,000) or a more precise and specific anchor (e.g., $799,800). Participants with a general anchor adjusted their estimate more than those given a precise anchor ($751,867 vs $784,671). The authors propose that this effect comes from difference in scale; in other words, the anchor affects not only the starting ''value'', but also the starting ''scale''. When given a general anchor of $20, people will adjust in large increments ($19, $21, etc.), but when given a more specific anchor like $19.85, people will adjust on a lower scale ($19.75, $19.95, etc.).&lt;ref name="JaniszewskiUy2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janiszewski |first1=Chris| last2=Uy|first2=Dan| title=Precision of the Anchor Influences the Amount of Adjustment|journal=Psychological Science |volume=19|issue=2|year=2008|pages=121–127| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02057.x| pmid=18271859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a more specific initial price will tend to result in a final price closer to the initial one.

'''''Bovine herpesvirus 2''''' (BoHV2) is a [[virus]] of the family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'' that causes two diseases in [[cattle]], '''bovine mammillitis''' and '''pseudo-lumpy skin disease'''.  BoHV2 is similar in structure to human [[herpes simplex virus]].&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carter, G.R. |author2=Flores, E.F. |author3=Wise, D.J. |year=2006|title=Herpesviridae|work=A Concise Review of Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap11/chapter.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudo-lumpy skin disease was originally discovered in [[South Africa]] where a similar but more serious disease caused by a [[poxvirus]], [[lumpy skin disease]], is also prevalent.  Symptoms include fever and skin nodules on the face, back, and [[perineum]].  The disease heals within a few weeks.  Bovine mammillitis is characterized by lesions restricted to the [[teat]]s and [[udder]].  BoHV-2 probably spreads through an [[arthropod]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]],&lt;ref name=Fenner_1993&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fenner, Frank J. |author2=Gibbs, E.

A review publication from 2011 presents a series of controversial but scientifically based conclusions concerning the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the infection (summary:  https://sites.google.com/site/bovineherpesvirus2/), among these that spread among cattle is preferably by the respiratory route, and that skin lesions result from viremic spread to epidermal foci and inflammation due to complement activation by the classical pathway at sites of virus propagation after formation of early antibody to BoHV2. Lesions may be aggravated by low skin temperature (e.g. in edematic or hairless skin areas) causing reduced blood circulation and hampered removal of cell-toxic inflammatory substances.&lt;ref&gt;Bitsch, Viggo (2011).

'''''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism''''' is a 1978 anthology about [[socialist feminism]] edited by Zillah R. Eisenstein.
 
The sociologist Rhonda F. Levine cites Eisenstein's work as a "superb discussion of the socialist-feminist position".&lt;ref name="Levine, Rhonda F. 2004, p8"&gt;Levine, Rhonda F. ''Legacies of the insurgent sociologist'' in ''Enriching the Sociological Imagination: How Radical Sociology Changed the Discipline'', Brill Press, 2004, 978-9004139923, p8&lt;/ref&gt; Levine goes on to describe the book as "one of the earliest statements of how a [[Marxist]] [[class analysis]] can combine with a [[feminist analysis]] of [[patriarchy]] to produce a theory of how gender and class intersect as systems of inequality".&lt;ref name="Levine, Rhonda F. 2004, p8"/&gt;

"Eisenstein defines the term 'capitalist patriarchy' as descriptive of the 'mutually reinforcing dialectical relationship between capitalist class structure and hierarchical sexual structuring."&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, Deborah L.

She believes that "The recognition of women as a sexual class lays the subversive quality of feminism for [[liberalism]] because liberalism is premised upon women's exclusion from public life on this very class basis. The demand for real equality of women with men, if taken to its logical conclusion, would dislodge the [[patriarchal]] structure necessary to a liberal society."&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', cited in ''Feminism and Philosophy: Essential Readings in Theory, Reinterpretation, and Application'', eds: Nancy Tuana, Rosemarie Tong, Westview Press 1995, {{ISBN|0-8133-2213-8}}, p5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1992">'''Card schemes''' are payment networks linked to [[payment cards]], such as debit or credit cards, of which a [[bank]] or any other eligible [[financial institution]] can become a member. By becoming a member of the scheme, the member then gets the possibility to issue or [[Acquiring bank|acquire]] cards operating on the network of that card scheme.

==Types==
The card schemes come in two main varieties - a '''three-party scheme''' (or '''closed scheme''') or a '''four-party scheme''' (or '''open scheme''').

===Three-party scheme===

[[File:card schemes3.jpg|thumb]]

A three-party scheme consists of three main parties as described in the adjacent diagram.

In this model, the issuer (having the relationship with the cardholder) and the acquirer (having the relationship with the merchant) is the same entity. This means that there is no need for any charges between the [[card issuer|issuer]] and the [[card acquirer|acquirer]]. Since it is a [[franchising|franchise]] setup, there is only one franchisee in each market, which is the incentive in this model. There is no competition within the brand; rather you compete with other brands.

Examples of this setup are [[Diners Club]], [[Discover Card]], and [[American Express]], although in recent times these schemes have also partnered with other issuers and acquirers in order to boost their circulation and acceptance, and Diners Club now operates as a four-party scheme in many regions.

===Four-party scheme===

[[File:card schemes4.jpg|thumb|left]]

In a four-party scheme, the issuer and acquirer are different entities, and this type of scheme is open for other institutions to join and issue their own cards. This signifies card schemes such as [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[Mastercard]], [[Verve Card]], [[UnionPay]] and [[RuPay]]. There are no limitations as to who may join the scheme, as long as the requirements of the scheme are met.

'''Carol Ann Christian''' (born 28 December 1950) is an American astronomer and [[science communicator]], who works for the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI; the science operations center for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]) as a scientist on the institute's outreach program.

Christian was born in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, and studied astronomy and physics at [[Boston University]], from which she graduated with a PhD in 1979 with a thesis on ''Investigations of distant field stars and clusters in the galactic anticenter''.&lt;ref name="bulib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigations of distant field stars and clusters in the galactic anticenter|url=http://buprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=requestTab&amp;ct=display&amp;fn=search&amp;doc=ALMA_BOSU121612692810001161&amp;indx=1&amp;recIds=ALMA_BOSU121612692810001161&amp;recIdxs=0&amp;elementId=0&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;displayMode=full&amp;frbrVersion=&amp;vid=BU&amp;institution=BOSU&amp;query=any%2Ccontains%2C99176783890001161&amp;vl(173035485UI0)=any&amp;dscnt=0&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28AZBOSU%29%2Cscope%3A%28BOSU%29%2Cscope%3A%28CRBU%29%2Cscope%3A%28ALMA_BOSU1%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe&amp;vl(freeText0)=99176783890001161&amp;vl(1UIStartWith0)=contains&amp;dstmp=1459737784634|publisher=Boston University Libraries|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then worked as an astronomer for [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="istcoll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall 2007 Colloquium Series|url=https://istcolloq.gsfc.nasa.gov/fall2007/speaker/christian.html|website=IS&amp;T Colloquium Series|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1995, Christian was selected as the first head of STScI's new Office of Public Outreach after a national search.&lt;ref name="madsen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madsen|first1=Claus; edited by André Heck|title=Astronomy Communication|date=2003|publisher=[[Springer Netherlands]]|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9401708010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has continued to act as an outreach scientist for the institute as a media spokesperson, educator and author. From 2003 to 2006, she worked as a scientific policy advisor for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. In 2010, she co-authored ''[[A Question and Answer Guide to Astronomy]]'' with Pierre-Yves Bely and Jean-René Roy.&lt;ref name="skyatnight"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Question &amp; Answer Guide To Astronomy|url=http://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/book/beginners/question-answer-guide-astronomy|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=Sky at Night Magazine|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">'''Collaborative engineering''' is defined by the [[International Journal of Collaborative Engineering]] as a discipline that "studies the interactive process of engineering collaboration, whereby multiple interested [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] resolve conflicts, bargain for individual or collective advantages, agree upon courses of action, and/or attempt to craft joint outcomes which serve their mutual interests."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalID=161 International Journal of Collaborative Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative engineering is quickly becoming a topic of great interest in recent years due to the explosion of internet technologies. This upsurge is partially due to the success of projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Linux]] that have proven the efficacy of internet collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2080">A '''Cypress forest''' is a western United States plant association typically dominated by one or more [[cypress]] species. Example species comprising the canopy include ''[[Cupressus macrocarpa]]''. In some cases these forests have been severely damaged by goats, cattle and other grazing animals.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;M.A. Rodriguez-Malagon et al., "The Guadalupe Island Recovery Track"&lt;/ref&gt; While cypress species are clearly dominant within a Cypress forest, other trees such as [[California Buckeye]], ''[[Aesculus californica]]'', are found in some Cypress forests.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The Guadalupe Island Cypress Forest is situated on [[Guadalupe Island]], offshore from [[Baja California]]. This forest was greatly destroyed by the introduction of [[grazing]] [[goat]]s, but [[conservation biology]] efforts have been conducted to assist in restoring the forest.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"/&gt;

Another example on the Pacific Coast mainland of [[Northern California]] is the [[Sargent's cypress]] Forest, located in coastal [[Marin County]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Sargent Forest&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS Bolinas Quadrangle&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dark matter''' is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] form of [[matter]] that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the [[universe]], and about a quarter of [[Universe#Composition|its total energy density]]. The majority of dark matter is thought to be non-[[baryon]]ic in nature, possibly being composed of some as-yet undiscovered [[subatomic particle]]s.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A small portion of dark matter could be baryonic. See [[Baryonic dark matter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its presence is implied in a variety of [[astrophysical]] observations, including [[gravitation]]al effects that cannot be explained unless more matter is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think dark matter to be ubiquitous in the universe and to have had a strong influence on its structure and evolution. The name dark matter refers to the fact that it does not appear to interact with observable [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[light]], and is thus invisible (or 'dark') to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], making it extremely difficult to detect using usual astronomical equipment.&lt;ref name="CERN Dark Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.cern/about/physics/dark-matter |title=Dark Matter |website=CERN Physics |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary evidence for dark matter is that calculations show that many [[galaxy|galaxies]] would fly apart instead of rotating, or would not have formed or move as they do, if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter.&lt;ref name="Siegfried"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Siegfried |first=T. |date=5 July 1999 |title=Hidden Space Dimensions May Permit Parallel Universes, Explain Cosmic Mysteries |url=http://www.physics.ucdavis.edu/~kaloper/siegfr.txt |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lines of evidence include observations in [[gravitational lensing]],&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trimble |first=V. |date=1987 |title=Existence and nature of dark matter in the universe |journal=[[Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=25 |pages=425–472 |bibcode=1987ARA&amp;A..25..425T |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.25.090187.002233 |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2hz008rs/qt2hz008rs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[cosmic microwave background]], from astronomical observations of the [[observable universe]]'s current structure, from the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]], from mass location during [[galactic collision]]s,&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/a-history-of-dark-matter&lt;/ref&gt; and from the motion of galaxies within [[galaxy cluster]]s.

Because dark matter has not yet been observed directly, it must barely interact with ordinary [[baryonic]] matter and radiation. The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of [[elementary particle]] that has [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|not yet been discovered]], in particular, [[weakly-interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), or [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs).&lt;ref name="Copi 1995" /&gt; Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken, but none has yet succeeded.&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt; Dark matter is classified as cold, warm, or hot according to its [[velocity]] (more precisely, its [[Free streaming|free streaming length]]). Current models favor a [[cold dark matter]] scenario, in which [[structure formation|structures emerge]] by gradual accumulation of particles.

=== Early history ===
The hypothesis of dark matter has an elaborate history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Swart|first1=J.

By using these measurements, he estimated the mass of the galaxy, which he determined is different from the mass of visible stars. Lord Kelvin thus concluded that "many of our stars, perhaps a great majority of them, may be dark bodies".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/a-history-of-dark-matter/|title=A history of dark matter|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 [[Henri Poincaré]] in "The Milky Way and Theory of Gases" used "dark matter", or "matière obscure" in French, in discussing Kelvin's work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1933, Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who studied [[groups and clusters of galaxies|galaxy clusters]] while working at the [[California Institute of Technology]], made a similar inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |journal=[[Helvetica Physica Acta]] |volume=6 |pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |date=1933 |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6 |pages=110–127}} See also {{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=86 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky applied the [[virial theorem]] to the [[Coma Cluster]] and obtained evidence of unseen mass that he called ''dunkle Materie'' ('dark matter'). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated that the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus mass must be hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together. This was the first formal inference about the existence of dark matter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Some details of Zwicky's calculation and of more modern values are given in {{Citation |first=M. |last=Richmond |title=Using the virial theorem: the mass of a cluster of galaxies |url=http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/gal_clus/gal_clus.html |accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due to an obsolete value of the [[Hubble constant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Katherine |last=Freese|title=The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=c2B8AgAAQBAJ}}|date=4 May 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same calculation today shows a smaller fraction, using greater values for luminous mass. However, Zwicky did correctly infer that the bulk of the matter was dark.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The first robust indications that the [[mass-to-light ratio]] was anything other than unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, [[Horace W. Babcock]] reported the rotation curve for the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda nebula]] (known now as the Andromeda Galaxy), which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode=1939LicOB..19...41B |doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1939LicOB.19.41B |title=The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula |journal=Lick Observatory Bulletins |volume=19 |pages=41–51|year=1939|last1=Babcock|first1=Horace W}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed it to either light absorption within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to missing matter.

=== 1970s ===

[[Vera Rubin]] and [[Kent Ford (astronomer)|Kent Ford]] in the 1960s and 1970s provided further strong evidence, also using galaxy rotation curves.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161227"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Vera Rubin, 88, Dies; Opened Doors in Astronomy, and for Women |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/science/vera-rubin-astronomist-who-made-the-case-for-dark-matter-dies-at-88.html |date=December 27, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkmatterphysics.com/Galactic-rotation-curves-of-spiral-galaxies.htm First observational evidence of dark matter].

At the same time that Rubin and Ford were exploring optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of new radio telescopes to map the 21&amp;nbsp;cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar atomic hydrogen ([[H I region|HI]]) often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, allowing the sampling of rotation curves—and thus of the total mass distribution—to a new dynamical regime.

== Technical definition ==
{{see also|Friedmann equations}}
In standard cosmology, matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], i.e., ''ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''. This is in contrast to radiation, which scales as the inverse fourth power of the scale factor '' ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; '', and a [[cosmological constant]], which is independent of ''a''. These scalings can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cubical box, doubling the length of the sides of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (''2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is larger because an increase in scale factor causes a proportional [[redshift]]. A cosmological constant, as an intrinsic property of space, has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University|author=Daniel Baumann|page=21−22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dark energy]] is a term often used nowadays as a substitute for cosmological constant. It is basically the same except that dark energy might depend on scale factor in some unknown way rather than necessarily being constant.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, "dark matter" means all components of the universe that are not visible but still obey ''ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''. In practice, the term "dark matter" is often used to mean only the non-baryonic component of dark matter, i.e., excluding "[[missing baryon problem|missing baryons]]." Context will usually indicate which meaning is intended.

=== Galaxy rotation curves ===
{{Main|Galaxy rotation curve}}
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|thumb|[[Galaxy rotation curve|Rotation curve]] of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). Dark matter can explain the 'flat' appearance of the velocity curve out to a large radius.]]
[[File:Comparison of rotating disc galaxies in the distant Universe and the present day.webm|thumb|Models of rotating disc galaxies in the present day (left) and ten billion years ago (right). In the present-day galaxy, dark matter—shown in red—is more concentrated near the center and it rotates more rapidly (effect exaggerated).]]

The arms of [[spiral galaxies]] rotate around the galactic center. The luminous mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the center to the outskirts. If luminous mass were all the matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it, similar to the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is a consequence of the [[shell theorem]] and the observation that spiral galaxies are spherically symmetric to a large extent (in 2D).&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Kepler's Second Law]], it is expected that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the center, similar to the Solar System. This is not observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Corbelli E. |author2=Salucci, P. | title=The extended rotation curve and the dark matter halo of M33|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2000|volume=311|issue=2|pages=441–447 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03075.x|arxiv = astro-ph/9909252 |bibcode = 2000MNRAS.311..441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distance from the center increases.

If Kepler's laws are correct, then the obvious way to resolve this discrepancy is to conclude that the mass distribution in spiral galaxies is not similar to that of the Solar System. In particular, there is a lot of non-luminous matter (dark matter) in the outskirts of the galaxy.

=== Velocity dispersions ===
{{main|Velocity dispersion}}
Stars in bound systems must obey the [[virial theorem]]. The theorem, together with the measured velocity distribution, can be used to measure the mass distribution in a bound system, such as elliptical galaxies or globular clusters. With some exceptions, velocity dispersion estimates of elliptical galaxies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Faber |first1=S. M. |last2=Jackson |first2=R. E. |date=1976 |title=Velocity dispersions and mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=204 |pages=668–683 |bibcode=1976ApJ...204..668F |doi=10.1086/154215}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not match the predicted velocity dispersion from the observed mass distribution, even assuming complicated distributions of stellar orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last1=Binny|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|date=1998|title=Galactic Astronomy|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=712-713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with galaxy rotation curves, the obvious way to resolve the discrepancy is to postulate the existence of non-luminous matter.

=== Galaxy clusters ===
[[Galaxy clusters]] are particularly important for dark matter studies since their masses can be estimated in three independent ways:

* From the scatter in radial velocities of the galaxies within clusters
* From [[X-ray]]s emitted by hot gas in the clusters. From the X-ray energy spectrum and flux, the gas temperature and density can be estimated, hence giving the pressure; assuming pressure and gravity balance determines the cluster's mass profile. 
* [[Gravitational lens]]ing (usually of more distant galaxies) can measure cluster masses without relying on observations of dynamics (e.g., velocity).

Generally, these three methods are in reasonable agreement that dark matter outweighs visible matter by approximately 5 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cosmological Parameters from Clusters of Galaxies|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=49|issue=1|pages=409–470|doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081710-102514|arxiv=1103.4829|bibcode=2011ARA&amp;A..49..409A|year=2011|last1=Allen|first1=Steven W|last2=Evrard|first2=August E|last3=Mantz|first3=Adam B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravitational lensing ===

One of the consequences of [[general relativity]] is that massive objects (such as a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]]) lying between a more distant source (such as a [[quasar]]) and an observer should act as a lens to bend the light from this source. The more massive an object, the more lensing is observed.

Strong lensing is the observed distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes through such a gravitational lens. It has been observed around many distant clusters including [[Abell 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=A.

=== Cosmic microwave background ===
{{Main|Cosmic microwave background}}
[[File:WMAP 2008 universe content.png|thumb|Estimated division of total energy in the universe into matter, dark matter and dark energy based on five years of WMAP data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Content of the Universe - Pie Chart |url=https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/080998/index.html |website=Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although both dark matter and ordinary matter are matter, they do not behave in the same way. In particular, in the early universe, ordinary matter was ionized and interacted strongly with radiation via [[Thomson scattering]]. Dark matter does not interact directly with radiation, but it does affect the CMB by its gravitational potential (mainly on large scales), and by its effects on the density and velocity of ordinary matter. Ordinary and dark matter perturbations, therefore, evolve differently with time and leave different imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

The cosmic microwave background is very close to a perfect blackbody but contains very small temperature anisotropies of a few parts in 100,000. A sky map of anisotropies can be decomposed into an angular power spectrum, which is observed to contain a series of acoustic peaks at near-equal spacing but different heights. 
The series of peaks can be predicted for any assumed set of cosmological parameters by modern computer codes such as CMBFast and CAMB, and matching theory to data, therefore, constrains cosmological parameters.&lt;ref name="Wayne Hu"&gt;The details are technical. See {{citeweb|author=Wayne Hu|title=Intermediate Guide to the Acoustic Peaks and Polarization|url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/intermediate.html|date=2001}} for an intermediate-level introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The first peak mostly shows the density of baryonic matter, while the third peak relates mostly to the density of dark matter, measuring the density of matter and the density of atoms.&lt;ref name="Wayne Hu" /&gt;

The CMB anisotropy was first discovered by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, though this had too coarse resolution to detect the acoustic peaks. 
After the discovery of the first acoustic peak by the balloon-borne [[BOOMERanG]] experiment in 2000, 
the power spectrum was precisely observed by [[WMAP]] in 2003-12, and even more precisely 
by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2013-15. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement]] |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck15" /&gt;

The observed CMB angular power spectrum provides powerful evidence in support of dark matter, as its precise structure is well fitted by the [[Lambda-CDM model]],&lt;ref name="Planck15"/&gt; but difficult to reproduce with any competing model such as [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skordis |first1=C. |display-authors=etal |title=Large Scale Structure in Bekenstein's theory of relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics |journal=Phys.

=== Structure formation ===
{{Main|Structure formation}}
[[File:COSMOS 3D dark matter map.png|thumb|Mass map|3D map of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, reconstructed from measurements of [[weak gravitational lensing]] with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |date=7 January 2007 |title=Hubble Maps the Cosmic Web of "Clumpy" Dark Matter in 3-D |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/01/image/a/grav |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Structure formation refers to the period after the Big Bang when density perturbations collapsed to form stars, galaxies, and clusters. Prior to structure formation, the [[FRW metric|Friedmann solutions]] to general relativity describe a homogeneous universe. Later, small anisotropies gradually grew and condensed the homogeneous universe into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Ordinary matter is affected by radiation, which is the dominant element of the universe at very early times. As a result, its density perturbations are washed out and unable to condense into structure.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{citeweb|author=A. H. Jaffe|title=Cosmology 2012: Lecture Notes|url=http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/sites/default/files/cosmology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there were only ordinary matter in the universe, there would not have been enough time for density perturbations to grow into the galaxies and clusters currently seen.

Dark matter provides a solution to this problem because it is unaffected by radiation. Therefore, its density perturbations can grow first. The resulting gravitational potential acts as an attractive [[potential well]] for ordinary matter collapsing later, speeding up the structure formation process.&lt;ref name="Jaffe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|title="Constraints on the composite photon theory|author=L.

=== Bullet Cluster ===
{{Main|Bullet Cluster}}
If dark matter does not exist, then the next most likely explanation is that general relativity—the prevailing theory of gravity—is incorrect. The Bullet Cluster, the result of a recent collision of two galaxy clusters, provides a challenge for modified gravity theories because its apparent center of mass is far displaced from the baryonic center of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Sky surveys and baryon acoustic oscillations ===
{{Main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}

Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are fluctuations in the density of the visible [[baryonic]] matter (normal matter) of the universe on large scales. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid of the early universe, and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Redshift-space distortions ===
Large galaxy [[redshift survey]]s may be used to make a three-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution. These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed [[redshift]]s; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding but more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. This effect causes superclusters to appear squashed in the radial direction, and likewise voids are stretched. Their angular positions are unaffected.
The effect is not detectable for any one structure since the true shape is not known, but can be measured by averaging over many structures assuming Earth is not at a special location in the Universe.

The effect was predicted quantitatively by Nick Kaiser in 1987, and first decisively measured in 2001 by the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=J. |title=A measurement of the cosmological mass density from clustering in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=Nature |year=2001 |volume=410 |issue=6825 |pages=169–73 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103143 |bibcode=2001Natur.410..169P |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1038/35065528 |pmid=11242069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results are in agreement with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

Dark matter can refer to any substance that interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g., stars and planets). Hence in principle it need not be composed of a new type of fundamental particle but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or neutrons.{{refn|name=BaryonicFootnote01|group=note|Astronomers define the term [[baryonic matter]] to refer to ordinary matter made of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s, including [[neutron stars]] and [[black holes]] from the collapse of ordinary matter.  Strictly speaking, electrons are [[lepton]]s not [[baryon]]s; but since their number is equal to the protons while their mass is far smaller, electrons give a negligible contribution to the average density of baryonic matter. Baryonic matter excludes other known particles such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrinos]]. Hypothetical primordial black holes are also generally defined as non-baryonic, since they would have formed from radiation, not matter.&lt;ref name=BaryonicSource01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Baryonic+Matter |title=Baryonic Matter |website=COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|access-date=9 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists think the dark matter is dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).

[[File:Fermi Observations of Dwarf Galaxies Provide New Insights on Dark Matter.ogv|thumb|[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi-LAT]] observations of dwarf galaxies provide new insights on dark matter.]]

=== Baryonic matter ===
{{Distinguish|Missing baryon problem}}
[[Baryon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) make up ordinary stars and planets. However, baryonic matter also encompasses less common [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, faint old [[white dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s, collectively known as [[massive compact halo object]]s (MACHOs), which can be hard to detect.{{sfn|Randall|2015|p=286}}

However, multiple lines of evidence suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of baryons:

* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars. 
* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7503-0405-4 |oclc=864166846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In contrast, [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] and other observations indicate that the total matter density is about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="planckesa2015" /&gt;
* Astronomical searches for [[gravitational microlensing]] in the [[Milky Way]] found that at most a small fraction of the dark matter may be in dark, compact, conventional objects (MACHOs, etc.); the excluded range of object masses is from half the Earth's mass up to 30 solar masses, which covers nearly all the plausible candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tisserand |first1=P. |last2=Le Guillou |first2=L. |last3=Afonso |first3=C. |last4=Albert |first4=J.

=== Non-baryonic matter ===

Candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such as [[axion]]s, [[sterile neutrino]]s, [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs), or [[supersymmetric]] particles. The three neutrino types already observed are indeed abundant, and dark, and matter, but because their individual masses—however uncertain they may be—are almost certainly tiny, they can only supply a small fraction of dark matter, due to limits derived from [[Observable universe|large-scale structure]] and high-[[redshift]] galaxies.&lt;ref name="bertone merritt" /&gt;

Unlike baryonic matter, nonbaryonic matter did not contribute to the formation of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the early universe ([[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]])&lt;ref name="Copi 1995" /&gt; and so its presence is revealed only via its gravitational effects, or [[weak lensing]]. In addition, if the particles of which it is composed are supersymmetric, they can undergo [[annihilation]] interactions with themselves, possibly resulting in observable by-products such as [[gamma rays]] and neutrinos (indirect detection).&lt;ref name="bertone merritt"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bertone |first1=G. |last2=Merritt |first2=D. |title=Dark Matter Dynamics and Indirect Detection |year=2005 |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]] |volume=20 |issue=14 |pages=1021–1036 |arxiv=astro-ph/0504422 |bibcode=2005MPLA...20.1021B |doi=10.1142/S0217732305017391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter aggregation and dense dark matter objects===
If dark matter is as common as observations suggest, an obvious question is whether it can form objects equivalent to [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, or [[black hole]]s. The answer has historically been that it cannot,&lt;ref name="curio"&gt;http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/95-the-universe/galaxies/general-questions/508-are-there-any-dark-stars-or-dark-galaxies-made-of-dark-matter-advanced&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |date=February 1, 2018 |website=Physics |url=https://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102 |title=Synopsis: A Way to Cool Dark Matter |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |quote=One widely held belief about dark matter is that it cannot cool off by radiating energy. If it could, then it might bunch together and create compact objects in the same way that baryonic matter forms planets, stars, and galaxies. Observations so far suggest that dark matter doesn't do that—it resides only in diffuse halos ... As a result, it is extremely unlikely there are very dense objects like stars made out of entirely (or even mostly) dark matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siegel"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/10/28/why-doesnt-dark-matter-form-black-holes/#4e5014943de1 Why Doesn't Dark Matter Form Black Holes?] - Forbes column, authored by [https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/#2f9e270c683e Ethan Siegel], whose Forbes biography identifies the author as a "Ph.D. astrophysicist, author, and science communicator, who professes physics and astronomy... numerous awards for science writing ... including the award for best science blog by the Institute of Physics.&lt;/ref&gt; because of two factors:

* ''It lacks an efficient means to lose energy:''&lt;ref name="curio" /&gt; Ordinary matter forms dense objects because it has numerous ways to lose energy. Losing energy would be essential for object formation, because a particle that gains energy during compaction or falling "inward" under gravity, and cannot lose it any other way, will heat up and increase [[velocity]] and [[momentum]]. Dark matter appears to lack means to lose energy, simply because it is not capable of interacting strongly in other ways except through gravity. The [[Virial theorem]] suggests that such a particle would not stay bound to the gradually forming object—as the object began to form and compact, the dark matter particles within it would speed up and tend to escape.
* ''It lacks a range of interactions needed to form structures:''&lt;ref name="siegel" /&gt; Ordinary matter interacts in many different ways. This allow it to form more complex structures. For example, stars form through gravity, but the particles within them interact and can emit energy in the form of [[neutrino]]s and [[electromagnetic radiation]] through [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] when they become energetic enough. [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can bind via the [[strong interaction]] and then form [[atom]]s with [[electron]]s largely through [[electromagnetic interaction]]. But there is no evidence that dark matter is capable of such a wide variety of interactions, since it only seems to interact through gravity and through some means no stronger than the [[weak interaction]] (although this is speculative until dark matter is better understood).

This question has been debated heavily during recent years. In 2016–2017 the idea of dense dark matter or dark matter being black holes, including [[primordial black hole]]s, made a comeback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |title=Is dark matter made of black holes? |journal=Science |date=9 February 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0721}}&lt;/ref&gt; following results of [[Gravitational wave|gravitation wave]] detection. These were again ruled out in December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2156252-ancient-black-holes-ruled-out-as-source-of-all-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt; but research and theories based on these still continue as at 2018, including approaches to dark matter cooling,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2160305-there-could-be-entire-stars-and-planets-made-out-of-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102|pmid=29481169|title=Collapsed Dark Matter Structures|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=120|issue=5|pages=051102|year=2018|last1=Buckley|first1=Matthew R|last2=Difranzo|first2=Anthony|arxiv=1707.03829|bibcode=2018PhRvL.120e1102B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question is by no means settled.

== Classification of dark matter: cold, warm or hot ==
Dark matter can be divided into ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Joseph |last=Silk|title=The Big Bang: Third Edition| url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XLwe1lUmz5kC| page=82}}| date=6 December 2000| publisher=Henry Holt and Company| isbn=978-0-8050-7256-3| chapter=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories refer to velocity rather than an actual temperature, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion—this is an important distance called the [[free streaming]] length (FSL). Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation. The categories are set with respect to the size of a [[protogalaxy]] (an object that later evolves into a dwarf galaxy): dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according as their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar (warm), or much larger (hot) than a protogalaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=N. |last1=Vittorio |author2=J. Silk |date=1984 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=285 |pages=L39–L43 |title=Fine-scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |doi=10.1086/184361 |bibcode=1984ApJ...285L..39V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Masayuki |last1=Umemura |author2=Satoru Ikeuchi |title=Formation of Subgalactic Objects within Two-Component Dark Matter |date=1985 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=299 |pages=583–592 |doi=10.1086/163726 |bibcode=1985ApJ...299..583U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixtures of the above are also possible: a theory of [[mixed dark matter]] was popular in the mid-1990s, but was rejected following the discovery of [[dark energy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cold dark matter leads to a bottom-up formation of structure while hot dark matter would result in a top-down formation scenario;{{Clarification needed|date=September 2018}} the latter is excluded by high-redshift galaxy observations.&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt;

=== Alternative definitions ===
These categories also correspond to [[fluctuation spectrum]] effects and the interval following the Big Bang at which each type became non-relativistic. Davis ''et al.'' wrote in 1985:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=M. |author2=Efstathiou, G. |author3=Frenk, C. S. |author4=White, S. D. M. |title=The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=292 |date=May 15, 1985 |pages=371–394 |doi=10.1086/163168 |bibcode=1985ApJ...292..371D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Candidate particles can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their effect on the [[Mixed dark matter|fluctuation spectrum]] (Bond ''et al.'' 1983). If the dark matter is composed of abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before recombination, then it may be termed "hot". The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ... A second possibility is for the dark matter particles to interact more weakly than neutrinos, to be less abundant, and to have a mass of order 1&amp;nbsp;keV. Such particles are termed "warm dark matter", because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description. [[Gravitino]]s and [[photino]]s have been suggested (Pagels and Primack 1982; Bond, Szalay and Turner 1982) ... Any particles which became nonrelativistic very early, and so were able to diffuse a negligible distance, are termed "cold" dark matter (CDM). There are many candidates for CDM including supersymmetric particles. | M. Davis, G. Efstathiou, C. S. Frenk, and S. D. M. White | The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter}}

Another approximate dividing line is that warm dark matter became non-relativistic when the universe was approximately 1 year old and 1 millionth of its present size and in the [[radiation-dominated era]] (photons and neutrinos), with a photon temperature 2.7 million K. Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2''ct'' (speed of light multiplied by time) in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2 light-years. A region of this size would expand to 2 million light-years today (absent structure formation). The actual FSL is approximately 5 times the above length, since it continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic. In this example the FSL would correspond to 10 million light-years, or 3 mega[[parsec]]s, today, around the size containing an average large galaxy.

The 2.7 million K photon temperature gives a typical photon energy of 250 electron-volts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for warm dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV–TeV mass [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than one year after the Big Bang and thus have FSLs much smaller than a protogalaxy, making them cold. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have FSLs much larger than a protogalaxy, thus qualifying them as hot.

=== Cold dark matter ===
{{Main|Cold dark matter}}
[[Cold dark matter]] offers the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations. It is dark matter composed of constituents with an FSL much smaller than a protogalaxy. This is the focus for dark matter research, as hot dark matter does not seem capable of supporting galaxy or galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates slowed early.

The constituents of cold dark matter are unknown. Possibilities range from large objects like MACHOs (such as black holes&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=M. R.

The 1997 [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] in 2013, claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many researchers remain skeptical, as negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the DAMA results.

Many [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models offer dark matter candidates in the form of the WIMPy [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle]] (LSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Supersymmetric dark matter |journal=Physics Reports |date=1 March 1996 |pages=195–373 |volume=267 |issue=5–6 |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(95)00058-5 |first=Gerard |last=Jungman |first2=Marc |last2=Kamionkowski |first3=Kim |last3=Griest |arxiv=hep-ph/9506380 |bibcode=1996PhR...267..195J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, heavy sterile neutrinos exist in non-supersymmetric extensions to the [[Standard Model|standard model]] that explain the small [[neutrino]] mass through the [[seesaw mechanism]].

=== Warm dark matter ===
{{Main|Warm dark matter}}
[[Warm dark matter]] comprises particles with an FSL comparable to the size of a protogalaxy. Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies. Some researchers consider this a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass ~ 300 eV to 3000 eV.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

No known particles can be categorized as warm dark matter. A postulated candidate is the [[sterile neutrino]]: a heavier, slower form of neutrino that does not interact through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], unlike other neutrinos. Some modified gravity theories, such as [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]], require "warm" dark matter to make their equations work.

=== Hot dark matter ===
{{Main|Hot dark matter}}
[[Hot dark matter]] consists of particles whose FSL is much larger than the size of a protogalaxy. The [[neutrino]] qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment|detected in 1956]]. Neutrinos' [[Neutrino mass|mass]] is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; that of an [[electron]]. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to WIMPs.

The three known [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of neutrinos are the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau''. Their masses are slightly different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It is hard to determine an exact [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50 ''eV/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3 ''eV/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, observed neutrinos cannot explain dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/neutrinos.html |title=Neutrinos as Dark Matter |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=21 September 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because galaxy-size density fluctuations get washed out by free-streaming, hot dark matter implies that the first objects that can form are huge [[supercluster]]-size pancakes, which then fragment into galaxies. [[List of deep fields|Deep-field observations]] show instead that galaxies formed first, followed by clusters and superclusters as galaxies clump together.

== Detection of dark matter particles ==
If dark matter is made up of sub-atomic particles, then millions, possibly billions, of such particles must pass through every square centimeter of the Earth each second.&lt;ref name="Gaitskell 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaitskell |first=Richard J. |title=Direct Detection of Dark Matter |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |volume=54 |pages=315–359 |bibcode=2004ARNPS..54..315G |date=2004 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Number per second"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEUTRALINO DARK MATTER |url=http://www.picassoexperiment.ca/dm_neutralino.php |accessdate=26 December 2011}}

Although [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] are popular search candidates,&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt; the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]] (ADMX) searches for [[axion]]s. Another candidate is heavy [[hidden sector]] particles that only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.

These experiments can be divided into two classes: direct detection experiments, which search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within a detector; and indirect detection, which look for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays.&lt;ref name="bertone merritt" /&gt;

=== Direct detection ===
{{details|Weakly interacting massive particles#Direct detection}}
Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy recoils (typically a few [[keV]]s) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are passing through the Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy as, e.g., [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light or [[phonon]]s, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. To do this effectively, it is crucial to maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from [[cosmic ray]]s. Examples of underground laboratories with direct detection experiments include the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory|Stawell mine]], the [[Soudan mine]], the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]], the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] and the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]].

These experiments mostly use either cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these techniques focus strongly on their ability to distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].

Currently there has been no well-established claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drees|first1=M.|last2=Gerbier|first2=G.|title=Dark Matter|journal=Chin.

Indirect detection experiments search for the products of the self-annihilation or decay of dark matter particles in outer space. For example, in regions of high dark matter density (e.g., the [[Galactic Center|centre of our galaxy]]) two dark matter particles could [[Annihilation|annihilate]] to produce [[gamma ray]]s or Standard Model particle-antiparticle pairs.&lt;ref name="Bertone2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gianfranco |last=Bertone |title=Particle Dark Matter: Observations, Models and Searches |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkUgAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=83–104 |chapter=Dark Matter at the Centers of Galaxies |arxiv=1001.3706 |isbn=978-0-521-76368-4|bibcode = 2010arXiv1001.3706M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively if the dark matter particle is unstable, it could decay into standard model (or other) particles.

=== Collider searches for dark matter ===
An alternative approach to the detection of dark matter particles in nature is to produce them in a laboratory. Experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) may be able to detect dark matter particles produced in collisions of the LHC [[proton]] beams. Because a dark matter particle should have negligible interactions with normal visible matter, it may be detected indirectly as (large amounts of) missing energy and momentum that escape the detectors, provided other (non-negligible) collision products are detected.&lt;ref name="kane watson"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Kane, G. |author2=Watson, S. |title=Dark Matter and LHC:. what is the Connection? |journal=Modern Physics Letters A |year=2008 |volume=23 |pages=2103–2123 |doi=10.1142/S0217732308028314 |bibcode=2008MPLA...23.2103K |arxiv=0807.2244 |issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Constraints on dark matter also exist from the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider|LEP]] experiment using a similar principle, but probing the interaction of dark matter particles with electrons rather than quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=P.J.|last2=Harnik|first2=R.|last3=Kopp|first3=J.|last4=Tsai|first4=Y.|title=LEP Shines Light on Dark Matter|journal=Phys.

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{More|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Because dark matter remains to be conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. The most common method is to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The best-known theories of this class are [[MOND]] and its relativistic generalization [[tensor-vector-scalar gravity]] (TeVeS),&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The failures of the Standard Model of Cosmology require a new paradigm |author=Pavel Kroupa |display-authors=etal |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=4 |doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030 |arxiv = 1301.3907 |bibcode = 2012IJMPD..2130003K }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[f(R) gravity]]&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The dark matter problem from f(R) gravity viewpoint |author=Salvatore Capozziello |author2=Mariafelicia De Laurentis |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=October 2012|volume=524|issue=9–10|doi=10.1002/andp.201200109|bibcode = 2012AnP...524..545C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[entropic gravity]].&lt;ref name="physorgnewtheory"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= Delta Institute for Theoretical Physics | title=New theory of gravity might explain dark matter | url=https://phys.org/news/2016-11-theory-gravity-dark.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternatives to general relativity|Alternative theories]] abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alternatives to Dark Matter and Dark Energy|author=Phillip D.

A problem with alternative hypotheses is that the observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the "observational evidence" section above). Explaining any individual observation is possible but explaining all of them is very difficult. Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein's gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is that while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/05/09/dark-matter-vs-modified-gravity-a-trialogue/ |title=Dark Matter vs. Modified Gravity: a Trialogue |author-link=Sean M.

It has been argued that the dark matter hypothesis is a [[conventionalism#Epistemology|conventionalist]] hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis that adds no empirical content and hence is unfalsifiable in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merritt |first1=David |title=Cosmology and convention |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |date=February 2017 |volume=57 |issue=2017 |pages=41–52 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2016.12.002|arxiv=1703.02389 |bibcode=2017SHPMP..57...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[dimensional analysis]], a '''dimensionless quantity''' is a [[quantity]] to which no [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] is assigned. It is also known as a '''bare number''' or '''pure number''' or a '''quantity of dimension one'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/sites/JCGM/VIM/JCGM_200e_FILES/MAIN_JCGM_200e/01_e.html#L_1_8|title='''1.8''' (1.6) '''quantity of dimension one''' dimensionless quantity|work=International vocabulary of metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]|year=2008|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding unit of measurement in the [[International System of Units|SI]] is '''one''' (or '''1''') unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|title=The International System of Units (SI)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Peter J.|last2=Phillips|first2=William D.|date=2015-06-01|title=Dimensionless units in the SI|url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/dimensionless-units-si|journal=Metrologia|language=en|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not explicitly shown. Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], and [[economics]]. Examples of quantities to which dimensions are regularly assigned are [[length]], [[time]], and [[speed]], which are measured in dimensional units, such as [[metre]], [[second]] and [[metre per second]]. This is considered to aid intuitive understanding. However, especially in mathematical physics, it is often more convenient to drop the assignment of explicit dimensions and express the quantities without dimensions, e.g., addressing the speed of light simply by the dimensionless number {{math|1}}.

== History ==
{{See also|Dimensional analysis#History}}
Quantities having dimension 1, ''dimensionless quantities'', regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of [[dimensional analysis]]. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] and Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] led significant developments in the modern concepts of [[dimension]] and [[Unit (measurement)|unit]].  Later work by British physicists [[Osborne Reynolds]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics.  Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, [[Edgar Buckingham]] proved the [[Buckingham π theorem|{{pi}} theorem]] (independent of French mathematician [[Joseph Bertrand]]'s previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities.  

Numerous dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s,  particularly in the areas of [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. Measuring ''ratios'' in the (derived) unit ''dB'' ([[decibel]]) finds widespread use nowadays.  

In the early 2000s, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] discussed naming the unit of 1 as the "[[Uno (unit)|uno]]", but the idea of just introducing a new SI-name for 1 was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf |title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 15th Meeting |date=17–18 April 2003 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130201238/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 16th Meeting |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130200835/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dybkaer, René |title=An ontology on property for physical, chemical, and biological systems |journal=APMIS Suppl. |issue=117 |pages=1–210 |year=2004 |pmid=15588029 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2005/2703/bw1_dybkaer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pure numbers ==
All '''[[number|pure numbers]]''' are dimensionless quantities, for example [[1 (number)|1]], [[imaginary unit|{{mvar|i}}]], [[pi|{{pi}}]], [[Euler's number|{{mvar|e}}]], and [[Golden ratio|{{mvar|φ}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym5u5IlYWcg|title=Pure Numbers and Significant Digits|first=|last=Khan Academy|date=21 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units of number such as the [[dozen]], [[Gross (unit)|gross]], [[googol]], and [[Avogadro's number]] may also be considered dimensionless.

== Ratios, proportions, and angles ==
Dimensionless quantities are often obtained as [[ratio]]s of [[quantity|quantities]] that are not dimensionless, but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/6.055/old/S2008/notes/apr02a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include calculating [[slope]]s or [[Conversion of units|unit conversion factors]]. A more complex example of such a ratio is [[engineering strain]], a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length. Since both quantities have the dimension ''length'', their ratio is dimensionless. Another set of examples is [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]s or [[mole fraction]]s often written using [[parts-per notation]] such as ppm (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), ppb (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;), and ppt (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;), or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units ([[kilogram|kg]]/kg or [[mole (unit)|mol]]/mol). For example, [[alcohol by volume]], which characterizes the concentration of [[ethanol]] in an [[alcoholic beverage]], could be written as mL / 100 mL.

Other common proportions are percentages [[%]]&amp;nbsp;(=&amp;nbsp;0.01), &amp;nbsp;[[per mil|‰]]&amp;nbsp;(=&amp;nbsp;0.001) and angle units such as [[radians]], [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|180}}) and  [[gradian|grads]](=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|200}}). In [[statistics]] the [[coefficient of variation]] is the ratio of the [[standard deviation]] to the [[average|mean]] and is used to measure the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] in the [[statistical data|data]].

== Buckingham {{pi}} theorem ==
{{main|Buckingham π theorem}}
The Buckingham {{pi}} theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by [[Boyle's Law]] – they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold.

Another consequence of the theorem is that the [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] dependence between a certain number (say, ''n'') of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] can be reduced by the number (say, ''k'') of [[independent variable|independent]] [[dimension]]s occurring in those variables to give a set of ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' independent, dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]]. For the purposes of the experimenter, different systems that share the same description by dimensionless [[quantity]] are equivalent.

=== Example ===
To demonstrate the application of the {{pi}} theorem, consider the [[electric power|power]] consumption of a [[stirrer]] with a given shape.
The power, ''P'', in dimensions [M · L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], is a function of the [[density]], ''ρ'' [M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], and the [[viscosity]] of the fluid to be stirred, ''μ'' [M/(L · T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its [[diameter]], ''D'' [L], and the [[Angular velocity|angular speed]] of the stirrer, ''n'' [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of ''n'' = 5 variables representing our example.  Those ''n'' = 5 variables are built up from ''k'' = 3 fundamental dimensions, the length: L ([[SI]] units: [[meters|m]]), time: T ([[second|s]]), and mass: M ([[kilograms|kg]]).

According to the {{pi}}-theorem, the ''n'' = 5 variables can be reduced by the ''k'' = 3 dimensions to form ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' = 5 − 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. These quantities are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = {\frac{\rho n D^2}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;, commonly named the [[Reynolds number]] which describes the fluid flow regime, and &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{p} = \frac{P}{\rho n^3 D^5}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[power number]], which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.

== Dimensionless physical constants ==
{{main|Dimensionless physical constant}}
Certain universal dimensioned physical constants, such as the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, the [[universal gravitational constant]], [[Planck's constant]], [[Coulomb's constant]], and [[Boltzmann's constant]] can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for [[time]], [[length]], [[mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and [[temperature]] are chosen. The resulting [[system of units]] is known as the [[natural units]], specifically regarding these five constants, [[Planck units]]. However, not all [[physical constant]]s can be normalized in this fashion. For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units, cannot be defined, and can only be determined experimentally:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html |title=How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? |last1=Baez |first1=John |date=April 22, 2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=October 7, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''α'' ≈ 1/137, the [[fine structure constant]], which characterizes the magnitude of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] between electrons.
* ''β'' (or ''μ'') ≈ 1836, the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]]. This ratio is the [[rest mass]] of the [[proton]] divided by that of the [[electron]]. An analogous ratio can be defined for any [[elementary particle]];
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1, a coupling constant characterizing the [[strong force|strong nuclear force]];
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1.75 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[gravitational coupling constant]] which is the square of the ratio of the mass of the electron to the [[Planck mass]], which characterizes the magnitude of the [[gravitation|gravitational interaction]] between electrons.  It is because, fundamentally, this number is so small that it is meaningful to say "Gravity is an extremely weak fundamental force in comparison to either the electromagnetic force or the strong nuclear force."

== Other quantities produced by nondimensionalization ==
{{Main|List of dimensionless quantities}}

Physics often uses dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]] to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena.  These may be found by applying the [[Buckingham π theorem|Buckingham {{pi}} theorem]] or otherwise may emerge from making [[partial differential equations]] unitless by the process of [[nondimensionalization]]. Engineering, economics, and other fields often extend these ideas in [[design]] and analysis of the relevant systems.

=== Physics and engineering ===
* [[Fresnel number]] – wavenumber over distance
* [[Mach number]] – ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid.
{{further|Dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics}}
* [[Beta (plasma physics)]] – ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, used in magnetospheric physics as well as fusion plasma physics.
* [[Damköhler numbers]] (Da) – used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale (reaction rate) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system.
* [[Thiele modulus]] – describes the relationship between diffusion and reaction rate in porous catalyst pellets with no mass transfer limitations.
* [[Numerical aperture]] – characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.
* [[Sherwood number]] – (also called the mass transfer Nusselt number) is a dimensionless number used in mass-transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the convective mass transfer to the rate of diffusive mass transport.
* [[Schmidt number]] – defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and mass diffusivity, and is used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes.
* [[Reynolds number]] is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow, incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow. It is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipp.mpg.de/~dpc/nrl/ |title=NRL Plasma Formulary: Dimensionless Numbers of Fluid Mechanics |last1=Huba |first1=J. D. |date=2007 |website= |publisher=Naval Research Laboratory |access-date=October 7, 2015 |quote=p. 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemistry ===
* [[Relative density]] – density relative to [[water]]
* [[Relative atomic mass]], [[Standard atomic weight]]
* [[Equilibrium constant]]

=== Other fields ===
* [[Cost of transport]] is the [[efficiency]] in moving from one place to another

'''''Endemic Bird Areas of the World: Priorities for Biodiversity Conservation''''' represents an effort to document in detail the [[endemism|endemic]] [[biodiversity]] [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] importance of the world's [[Endemic Bird Area]]s.

The authors are Alison J. Stattersfield, Michael J. Crosby, Adrian J. Long, and David C. Wege, with a foreword by [[Queen Noor of Jordan]]. ''Endemic Bird Areas of the World: Priorities for Biodiversity Conservation'' contains 846 pages, and is a 1998 publication by [[Birdlife International]], No. 7 in their Birdlife Conservation Series.

==Six Introductory Sections==
The book has six introductory sections: 
* "Biodiversity and Priority setting"
* "Identifying Endemic Bird Areas"
* "Global Analyses"
* "The Prioritization of Endemic Bird Areas"
* "The Conservation Relevance of Endemic Bird Areas"
* "Endemic Bird Areas as Targets for Conservation Action"

==Six Regional Introductions==
These are then followed by six Regional Introductions, in which Endemic Bird Areas are grouped into six major regions:
* [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]
* [[South America]]
* [[Africa]], Europe, and the [[Middle East]]
* Continental [[Asia]]
* [[Maritime Southeast Asia|South-east Asian Islands]], [[New Guinea]] and Australia
* [[Pacific Islands]]

==Endemic Bird Areas==
The bulk of the book consists of accounts of each of the 218 Endemic Bird Areas. Each account contains the following information:
* summary statistics about the EBA
* A "General Characteristics" section
* A section giving an overview of the [[restricted-range endemic bird]] species found in the EBA
* A Threats and Conservation section describing the threats posed to the EBA's biodiversity interest, and any significant measure in which are in place to counter these
* An annotated list of the restricted-range endemics found in the EBA

==Secondary Bird Areas==
The book concludes with a short section giving brief details of 138 [[Endemic Bird Area|secondary area]]s, again grouped into the six regions.

==Details==
''Endemic Bird Areas of the World: Priorities for Biodiversity Conservation'' follows on from work presented in the 1992 publication ''[[Putting biodiversity on the map: priority areas for global conservation]]''.

The '''Carl F. Eyring Science Center''' (ESC) is one of the science buildings on the [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) campus in [[Provo, Utah]].  It was built in 1950 and named after [[Carl F. Eyring]] in 1954.

The ESC houses the departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geology, and Food Science and Nutrition.  The Department of Chemistry has in the past been located at the ESC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=51304 | year=1991 | author1=Xie | first1=W. L. | title=Expression of a mitogen-responsive gene encoding prostaglandin synthase is regulated by mRNA splicing | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=88 | issue=7 | pages=2692–2696 | last2=Chipman | first2=J.

In 1968 an underground physics research lab was added to the north end of the building.  Research on plasma, atomic processes, lasers, high-pressure physics, nanotechnology, [[acoustics]], and cold fusion have been conducted here. It is the home of two modern TEMs.

The [[Royden G. Derrick]] Planetarium is also in the building.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org.uk/church_world_news.php?id=141&lt;/ref&gt; This 119-seat facility with a {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} acoustically-treated dome was built in 2005 to replace the smaller, outdated Sarah Barrett Summerhays Planetarium.  In the summer of 2006 a new dome was installed on the ESC's observatory to better allow for astronomical study on campus. The building also has several acoustics labs including two [[anechoic chamber]]s and two [[reverberation chamber|reverberation chambers]] for performing acoustics research.

The 5th and 6th floors of the ESC constitute the [[Orson Pratt]] Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.byu.edu/opo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the ESC, [[James A. Jensen]]'s dinosaur displays were often in the lobby.  However, since the building of the [[BYU Earth Science Museum]], dinosaur displays are less common.

The main lobby of the building is noted for its [[Foucault pendulum]].  It also houses a student-run restaurant, the Pendulum Court, during the fall and winter semesters.

The ESC was the first building at BYU to have an elevator.

'''Gustav Herglotz''' (2 February 1881 – 22 March 1953) was a [[German Bohemian]] [[mathematician]]. He is best known for his works on the [[theory of relativity]] and [[seismology]].

==Biography==
Herglotz studied Mathematics and Astronomy at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1899, and attended lectures by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. In this time of study, he had a friendship with his colleagues [[Paul Ehrenfest]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Heinrich Tietze]]. In 1900 he went to the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU Munich]] and achieved his [[Doctorate]] in 1902 under [[Hugo von Seeliger]]. Afterwards, he went to the [[University of Göttingen]], where he [[Habilitation|habilitated]] under [[Felix Klein]]. In 1904 he became [[Privatdozent]] for [[Astronomy]] and [[Mathematics]] there, and in 1907 [[Professor extraordinarius]]. In 1908 he became Professor extraordinarius in Vienna, and in 1909 at the [[University of Leipzig]]. From 1925 (until becoming [[Emeritus]] in 1947) he again was in Göttingen as the successor of [[Carl Runge]] on the chair of applied mathematics. One of his students was [[Emil Artin]].

==Work==
Herglotz worked in the fields of [[seismology]], [[number theory]], [[celestial mechanics]], theory of [[electrons]], [[special relativity]], [[general relativity]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[refraction]] theory.

*In 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Herglotz, Gustav |year=1904 |title=Über die Berechnung retardierter Potentiale|journal=Gött. Nachr. |issue=6 |pages=549 - 556|url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN252457811_1904&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herglotz defined relations for the [[Electromagnetic four-potential|electrodynamic potential]] which are also valid in [[special relativity]] even before that theory was fully developed. [[Hermann Minkowski]] (during a conversation reported by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]) pointed out that the four-dimensional symmetry of electrodynamics is latently contained and mathematically applied in Herglotz' paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sommerfeld, Arnold |year=1910 |title=Zur Relativitätstheorie II: Vierdimensionale Vektoranalysis|trans-title=Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:On the Theory of Relativity II: Four-dimensional Vector Analysis|On the Theory of Relativity II: Four-dimensional Vector Analysis]] |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=338 |issue=14 |pages=649–689|doi=10.1002/andp.19103381402|bibcode=1910AnP...338..649S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Herglotz, Gustav|year=1907|title=Über das Benndorfsche Problem der Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeit der Erdbebenstrahlen|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|volume=8 |pages=145-147}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became interested in the theory of [[earthquake]]s, and together with [[Emil Wiechert]], he developed the Wiechert–Herglotz method for the determination of the velocity distribution of Earth's interior from the known propagation times of [[seismic wave]]s (an inverse problem). There, Herglotz solved a special integral equation of Abelian type. 

*The [[Herglotz-Noether theorem]] stated by Herglotz (1909)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Herglotz, Gustav|year=1910|orig-year=1909|title=Über den vom Standpunkt des Relativitätsprinzips aus als starr zu bezeichnenden Körper|trans-title=Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:On bodies that are to be designated as "rigid"|On bodies that are to be designated as "rigid" from the standpoint of the relativity principle]]|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=336|issue=2 |pages=393–415|doi=10.1002/andp.19103360208|bibcode = 1910AnP...336..393H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently by [[Fritz Noether]] (1909), was used by Herglotz to classify all possible forms of rotational motions satisfying [[Born rigidity]]. In the course of this work, Herglotz showed that the [[Lorentz transformation]]s correspond to [[hyperbolic motion]]s in &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;, by which he classified the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic groups (see [[Möbius transformation#Lorentz transformation]]).

*In 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Herglotz|first=G.|title=Über Potenzreihen mit positivem, reellen Teil im Einheitskreis|journal=Ber. Verh. Sachs. Akad. Wiss. Leipzig|volume=63|pages= 501–511|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; he formulated the [[Herglotz representation theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Agler]], John Harland, and Benjamin J. Raphael (2008) ''Classical Function Theory, Operator Dilation Theory, and Machine Computations on Multiply-Connected Domains'', [[Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society]] #892, {{ISSN|0065-9266}}&lt;/ref&gt; which concerns [[holomorphic function]]s ''f'' on the [[unit disk]] D,  with Re ''f'' ≥ 0 and ''f''(0) = 1, represented as an [[integral]] over the boundary of D with respect to a [[probability measure]] &amp;mu;.: The theorem asserts that such a function exists if and only if  there is a &amp;mu; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in D \ \ f (z) \ = \ \int_{\partial D} \frac{\lambda + z}{\lambda - z}\ d\mu(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt; The theorem also asserts that the probability measure is unique to ''f''.

*In 1911, he formulated a relativistic [[theory of elasticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Herglotz, Gustav|year=1911|title=Über die Mechanik des deformierbaren Körpers vom Standpunkte der Relativitätstheorie|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=341|issue=13|pages=493–533|doi=10.1002/andp.19113411303|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k153397.image.f509|bibcode = 1911AnP...341..493H }}; English translation by David Delphenich: [http://www.neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/herglotz_-_rel._cont._mech..pdf On the mechanics of deformable bodies from the standpoint of relativity theory].&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of that work, he obtained the [[Lorentz transformation#Vector transformations|vector Lorentz transformation]] for arbitrary velocities (see [[History of Lorentz transformations#Herglotz (1911)]]).&lt;ref name=pauli /&gt;

Wissensch. zu Leipzig, pp.&amp;nbsp;199–203 (1916).&lt;/ref&gt; he also contributed to [[general relativity]]. Independently of previous work by [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1916), he showed as to how the contracted [[Riemann tensor]] and the [[Curvature invariant (general relativity)|curvature invariant]] can be geometrically interpreted.&lt;ref name=pauli&gt;{{Citation

'''Henryk Daniel Robert Dołęga Dziedzicki''' (1847, [[Warsaw]] - 1921, Warsaw) was a [[Poland|Polish]]  [[physician]] and [[entomologist]].

He studied medicine at the [[University of Warsaw]]. In the years 1872-1873, he took part in an expedition to [[Egypt]], financed and organized by [[Aleksander Branicki]]. On 28 September 1874 he received the title of doctor of Medicine of the University of Warsaw.

Dziedzicki was an active member of the scientific society of Warsaw and a Member of Entomological Associations in Saint Petersburg, Berlin and Vienna. His sister married the entomologist [[Johann Andreas Schnabl]].

He especially revised the family [[Mycetophilidae]] , where detailed differences in the construction of the genitalia were used for identification. He described about 120 new species from the family Mycetophilidae and two new genera ''[[Heteropygium]]'' and ''[[Allophallus]]''.

Taxa named to honour him are 
*''Helophilus henricii'' Schnabl, 1880, 
*''Phronia dziedzickii'' [[Carl August Lundström|Lundstrom]], 1906
*''Sciophila dziedzickii'' [[Frederick Wallace Edwards|Edwards]], 1925

'''Horticulture Netting or Vegetable Support Net'''

==Origin==
[[File:Malla espaldera en tomate.jpg|thumb|When one uses trellising net the pedunculum of the fruit of the plant will lean on the mesh, preventing that the weight of the fruits will choke the fruit like it happens often with raffia twine.]]
Starting in the 1960s, in [[Europe]] a new rigid mesh and net product made out of [[polypropylene]] started being used.  The most famous factories were located in [[England]] and [[Italy]], given the fact that these two countries where the most advanced in machine tooling and [[extrusion]], then with the passing of time this technology found its way into other parts of the world, and today it is very easy to find  who manufactures this type of base product anywhere in the world

==Stretching and Molecular Orientation==
Once the semi-finished extruded product is ready (in this phase it is when colors and [[UV]] stabilizers are added to the PP mix), the product is passed thru a stretching section, this is where the strength and other mechanical properties are given as the [[Plastic Extrusion|polymer molecules are aligned]]. The net is first oriented longitudinally in hot water and then transversally in a ramose. The final result is a net with a lot of tensile strength (between 50 and 70&amp;nbsp;kg per meter) that weighs between 6 and 9 grams per square meter, and a mesh size that may reach up to 30x30 cm  according to the technical capacity of the manufacturer.

==Available Sizes==
Smaller mesh sizes (between 10 and 18&amp;nbsp;cm) are usually used for horizontal tutoring of flowers, especially [[carnations]], [[Chrysanthemum|mums]] and [[snaps]], because in [[floriculture]] growers prefer an opening that will support vertically the flower without letting it tilt or bend because it would lose its commercial value.  Larger sized meshes are preferred for vegetable support. especially [[cucurbits]], [[solanaceae]] and [[legumes]].  The reason [[horticulturalists]] prefer a larger mesh size (which simulates the hand weaved raffia systems) is so one can work the two furrows on both sides of the walking isle, without damaging the crop or the plant during harvesting or trimming work. [[File:Malla tutora instalada en la primera capa de un cultivo de margaritas.jpg|thumb|When the netting is used for tutoring flowers, one may install horizontally many layers of netting or move the first layer up as the plants grow.]]

==[[Floriculture]]==
Flower support netting is installed in many layers over the flower bed.  At the extremes of the furrow a net fastening and support system is installed so that the mesh can be stretched tightly over the growing flowers.  In between the two extremities of the flower bed, intermediate supports are necessary as to insure that mesh openings lay on top of each other's symmetrically and layer after layer so that flowers may grow straight.

==[[Horticulture]]==
The great majority of horticultural applications of plant support netting are vertical, even though there are also great horizontal uses.   When it is used vertically to provide support to the vegetable trellis, the netting is fastened to a line of posts or supports (metal, bamboo or wood) distanced from 1.5 to up to 8 meters (depending to the type of crop, soil type, climate etc.) where the furrow ends have posts that are larger and stronger and preferably have a tension string or twine on top that is anchored on both sides of the furrow and tensioned in between posts.

Once the posts are installed (in many cases where the farmer decides for a bit of extra support by installing a tension string on the top of the poles) one may proceed with the installation of the trellis netting, unrolling the net from post to post and fastening it both to the post.  This task takes about two workers per hectare per day.  It is advisable to install the netting before transplanting plants from the nursery trays or just a few days after the seed went in the ground so that plants are not damaged during installation of the support net.

Depending on the type of crop and plant to be trellised one can use netting of many different heights (these vary from 50&amp;nbsp;cm to up to more than 3 meters for use in [[greenhouses]] or shade house).  When choosing the height of the vegetable trellis netting one should keep in mind that the net should be installed 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm above the soil.  So a net 1.5 in height will provide a trellis or espalier between 1.80 and 1.90 m (so the post sizes should be around 2.2 and 2.5 m), and this would be the ideal support system measurement for most cucumber open field varieties.  The ideal size for square mesh is approx. 25x25 cm.
[[File:Lo fácil que es podar plantas usando malla con cuadros de 25x25.jpg|thumb|Pruning and harvesting is easy when using a 25x25cm (10"x10") mesh, as the hands of the worker can easily reach into the plant and not damage either the plant or the fruits.]]
Inside a [[greenhouse]] this netting could be attached to the existing aerial structure and left hanging down to the furrows, this type of installation can call for a net that is 3 meters high, this net size is ideal for many hybrids species.
It is also worth mentioning the use of a large mesh tutoring net (for example the 25x25cm size) installed horizontally over [[tomatoes]] or [[Bell peppers|peppers]] in open field, using a support system similar to the one used in flowers.  In such a system, the plant grows in between the meshes and the branches loaded with [[fruits]] will lean passively over the meshes completely eliminating the need for further labor in fastening and tying operations.
[[File:Como se amarra el pié de la planta de tomate en un sistema de doble malla.jpg|thumb|Detail of how to tie the netting (in a double wall system) near the foot of the tomato plant while still small.  This system allows the reduction of labor as the plant will grow upward without the need of manual tutoring just by leaning on the mesh.]]
[[File:Instalacion de doble hilera de malla espaldera en surcos de tomate.jpg|thumb|It is advisable to install two walls of trellising net in tomatoes, peppers, chilis or eggplant since the branches of solanaceae need somewhere to lean on in order to grow fully and sustain a full load of fruit.]]

==[[Phytosanitary]] Conditions==
Climate Change is causing many great damages in [[agriculture]]. Strong out of season rains are forcing many traditionally "on ground" cultivation methods like the ones used for [[cucumbers]] or [[melons]] to be now grown on trellises vertically so to improve aeration and solar exposure of the foliage thus reducing the rate of mycosis attacks caused by humidity trapped between the solid and the leaf system, further avoiding direct solid contact of the fruit since this would develop spots on the vegetables thus reducing their market value.

Another important aspect to be considered when deciding the type of plant support for vegetables is the rate of mechanical transmission of viruses (for example mosaic virus) via the hands of the workers.  No matter how many precautions a grower may take to keep a high standard of sanitization in the fields (clothes change, washing hands in milk or stepping the shoes on a clorox trap) all one needs to lose control over the virus is for one worker to handle a cigarette or to touch an infected plant to   begin the exponential contagion rate in the whole field as if it were any aphids or trips.  For this reason, contrary to the raffia tutoring system where a lot of labor is required to tie by hand the plant to the twine during many phases of growth, the use of horticulture netting diminished a great deal for the need of a worker to walk the furrows handling the plants, thus reducing the possibility of spreading the disease.

[[Cucurbitaceae]] naturally seek the closest support point, and the netting offers multiple support points for the trellising needs of the plant thanks to the square mesh structure.  Also in the case of [[solanaceae]] (especially tomatoes or peppers) one can achieve a great reduction of hand labor by installing the net on both sides of the plant (or as a V shape) all along the furrow, creating sort of a sandwich system that holds the plant on both sides, allowing new branches to lean on the mesh without the need to spend money of labor otherwise needed to fasten and tie the plant to the structure.

==Vertical Tutoring Tips==
Each time a plant is handled, pruned or tied to the support system it will cause a few days of stress.  During this re-adjustment period, instead of feeding its fruits at full efficiency, the plant will send its nutrients to the foliage so that it can reposition itself efficiently (there are mathematical models that prove the efficiency of the natural leaves alignment to the sun).  During the pruning work and manual guidance of the plant, we increase the risk of contagion, especially virus, due to the handling of the workers, whom without knowing, could be transmitting a pathogen mechanically from plant to plant like any harmful insect.

Cultivating the type of determined bushy plants, like eggplant, tomato, chili and peppers, many growers decided to guide/tutor their plants with two "walls" of netting, one on each side of the furrow, therefore creating a growing system where the branches will be supported on their own without any need for manual tutoring.  With this system, the lower string of the bottom mesh nearest the soil on one side of the plant is tied gently (leaving about 4–10&amp;nbsp;cm, 2-4 inches in between the two nets) with the lowest string on the other side (this job is done when the plant is about 40&amp;nbsp;cm in height, 16 inches).  As the plant keeps growing, the distance in between the two walls of net also keeps increasing (30–60&amp;nbsp;cm) so that  each higher branch will be supported by the nearest mesh and be able to reach full vegetative development.
      
By allowing the plant to grow at 360 degrees, and to fully express its vegetative vigor, it will allow any fumigation to reach vegetable matter and leaves far into the plant mass so that the chemical may attack the targeted pathogens effectively and therefore reduce the recurrence of diseases and further chemical uses.

==RE-usable==
In most cases trellising net made out of stretched polypropylene is re-usable, and will last many crop cycles.  The ideal technique to fully maximize the investment in the agricultural implements from the first cycle, and to amortize this cost over many crops (mulching, irrigation, posts, cables, filters, netting), is to alternate a cycle of solanaceae or cucurbitaceae with one of leguminous or some other nitrogen fixer.  Giving for granted that during the previous cycle there had been a good phytosanitary management, and that there are no harmful colonies of pests to the next crop, once may proceed—after the last fruits are harvested—with cutting the old plant still on the tutor net,   and while the old plant dries up one may place the seed of the next crop (or wait a few days and transplant directly what comes from the nursery once the old plant matter is removed from the trellis).  In a few days the old plant can be easily removed and re-incorporated into the soil.

==How to recognize a good Trellising net==
[[File:Malla para entutorar usada en tomate indeterminado.jpg|thumb|In the case of certain undetermined hybrid varieties of cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers or melons the horticulture net is used by either weaving the shoots diagonally or upwards or using fastening clips.]]
Polypropylene loses tensile and physical properties once recycled or after a prolonged solar exposure.  Virgin polypropylene and a good quality netting will be noticeable from the shines and gloss, while an extruded net containing recycled PP will be opaque and not reflect light as much.  Considering crop netting must support the weight of a plant and also resist to natural elements like wind and rain, it is advisable to make sure one pay attention to the product before installing a net that might cause the whole crop to fall to the ground.  One more detail to keep an eye on is the color of the netting.  White is advisable because it will be visible at all times of the day and prevent accidental cuts during pruning and harvesting, the same cannot be said about black or green nets that will tend to hide among the leaves, stems and fruits.

==Advantages==
Growing on a horticulture trellis increases plant density since each plant will find expansion surface vertically on the netting mesh.  As the plant grows vertically, besides the already mentioned benefits of increased aeration and sun exposure, the plant´s flowers and fruits are protected from accidental crushing due to the worker walking along the furrows. There is also a greater rate of flower pollination since the flowers are more exposed to insects as leaves will not tend to grow over flowers completely covering them.  By taking care of the plant from accidental damages one extends the life span of the plant and the increasing the number of fruits harvested during a longer period.

Research done by Dr. [[Katey Walter]] (second from right) found that melting [[permafrost]] will release [[methane]], one of the most potent [[greenhouse gases]].]]
The '''International Arctic Research Center''', or '''IARC''', established in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/about/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; is a research institution focused on integrating and coordinating study of [[Climate change in the Arctic]]. The primary partners in IARC are [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. Participants include organizations from [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], Japan, [[Norway]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the United States.

==Overview==
The Center is located at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], in the [[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]] Building. The '''Keith B. Mather Library''' is the science library housed in the Akasofu Building, serving IARC and the [[Geophysical Institute]] of UAF. The building also houses the UAF atmospheric sciences department, the Center for Global Change and the Fairbanks forecast office of the [[National Weather Service]].

Study projects are focused within four major themes:
* Arctic [[ocean]] models and observation
* Arctic [[atmosphere]]: feedbacks, [[radiation]], and [[weather]] analysis
* [[Permafrost]]/Frozen soil models and observations
* Arctic [[biota (ecology)|biota]]/[[vegetation]] ([[ecosystem model]]s)

IARC is devoting specific effort to answering the following three questions:
#To what extent is climate change due to natural vs man-made causes? 
#What parameters, processes and interactions are needed to understand and predict future climate change? 
#What are the likely impacts of climate change?

'''Jacob Breyne''' (14 January 1637 – 25 January 1697) was a Polish merchant, [[naturalist]], and artist, born in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Breyne, Jacob (1637-1697) on JSTOR|url=http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000032350|language=en|doi=10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000032350}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Prussia]] (a fief of the [[Crown of Poland]]). He was the father of [[Johann Philipp Breyne]].

==Biography==
Breyne was interested in plants from a young age, and collected specimens from around Danzig. He recorded where they were found and included [[ecological]] notes on each plant. He also collected specimens and plant illustrations from elsewhere, including the famous portfolio of paintings of [[Cape of Good Hope]] plants. These artworks were purchased in 1956, by Sir [[Ernest Oppenheimer]]. 

In 1661 Breyne made his first trip of many to the [[Netherlands]]. He became acquainted with prominent members of the community there who kept gardens which included some of the most beautiful and rare plants. A large number of the plants Breyne drew came from Van Beverningk, from Oud-Teilingen Sassenheim near [[Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=mkfdQ3l1YQUC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Jacob%2BBreyne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S-4WFkEpU_&amp;sig=ijKoHYnsNorp7QMoD6rfo0bHANU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9uZKdrdTXAhWDDuwKHT4PCFYQ6AEIVzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacob%2BBreyne&amp;f=false|title=Botanical Exploration of Southern Africa|last=Gunn|first=Mary|last2=Codd|first2=L.E.W.|publisher=A.A.

Breyne died in Danzig in 1697.

[[Image:Kobon triangles.gif|right|frame|Kobon triangles generated with 3, 4 and 5 straight line segments.]]

The '''Kobon triangle problem''' is an unsolved problem in [[combinatorial geometry]] first stated by [[Kobon Fujimura]]. The problem asks for the largest number ''N''(''k'') of nonoverlapping triangles whose sides lie on an [[arrangement of lines|arrangement of ''k'' lines]]. Variations of the problem consider the [[projective plane]] rather than the Euclidean plane, and require that the triangles not be crossed by any other lines of the arrangement.&lt;ref name="forge"&gt;{{citation|title=Straight line arrangements in the real projective plane|first1=D.|last1=Forge|first2=J. L.|last2=Ramírez Alfonsín|journal=[[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]|volume=20|issue=2|pages=155–161|year=1998|doi=10.1007/PL00009373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saburo Tamura]] proved that the largest integer not exceeding ''k''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)/3 provides an upper bound on the maximal number of nonoverlapping triangles realizable by ''k'' lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=KobonTriangle|title=Kobon Triangle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a tighter upper bound was found by Johannes Bader and Gilles Clément, by proving that Tamura's upper bound couldn't be reached for any ''k'' congruent to 0 or 2 (mod 6).&lt;ref name="bacl"&gt;[http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/sop/publicationListFiles/cb2007a.pdf G. Clément and J. Bader. Tighter Upper Bound for the Number of Kobon Triangles. Draft Version, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum number of triangles is therefore at most one less than Tamura's bound in these cases. Perfect solutions (Kobon triangle solutions yielding the maximum number of triangles) are known for ''k'' = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpuzzle.com/MAA/45-Kobon/mathgames_02_08_06.html Ed Pegg Jr. on Math Games]&lt;/ref&gt; For ''k'' = 10, 11 and 12, the best solutions known reach a number of triangles one less than the upper bound.

As proved by G. Clément and J. Bader,&lt;ref name="bacl"/&gt; the solutions for ''k'' &gt; 2 are bounded above by 
: &lt;math&gt;k(k-2)/3&lt;/math&gt;, when ''k''=={3, 5} (mod 6);
: &lt;math&gt;(k+1)(k-3)/3&lt;/math&gt;, when ''k''=={0, 2} (mod 6);
: &lt;math&gt;(k^2-2k-2)/3&lt;/math&gt;, when ''k''=={1, 4} (mod 6).

(The floor function is handled by noting that the expression ''k''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) is a multiple of 3 in the first case and 2 more than a multiple of 3 in the third case; Clément and Bader only improved the bound on the middle case.)

Given a perfect solution with ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;3 lines, other Kobon triangle solution numbers can be found for all ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''-values where
:&lt;math&gt;k_{n+1} = 2\cdot k_{n} - 1,&lt;/math&gt;
by using the procedure by D. Forge and J. L. Ramirez Alfonsin.&lt;ref name="forge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johannesbader.ch/#kobon "Matlab code illustrating the procedure of [[D. Forge]] and [[J. L. Ramirez Alfonsin]]", Retrieved on 9 May 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solution for ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 leads to the maximal number of nonoverlapping triangles for ''k'' = 5,9,17,33,65,...

&lt;!-- This article uses UK English --&gt;
The marine environment supplies many kinds of [[habitat]]s that support marine life. [[Marine life]] depends in some way on the [[seawater|saltwater]] that is in the sea (the term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an [[ecological]] or [[Natural environment|environmental]] area inhabited by one or more living  [[species]].&lt;ref name="Dickinson 63"&gt;Dickinson, C.I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds.'' The Kew Series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abercrombie 66"&gt;Abercrombie, M., Hickman, C.J. and Johnson, M.L. 1966.''A Dictionary of Biology.'' Penguin Reference Books, London&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine habitats''' can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the [[shoreline]] out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.

Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] and [[demersal zone]]s. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.

Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like [[coral]]s, [[kelp]], [[mangrove]]s and [[seagrass]]es, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.

==Overview==
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Only 29 percent of the world surface is land. The rest is ocean, home to the marine habitats. The oceans are nearly four kilometres deep on average and are fringed with coastlines that run for nearly 380,000 kilometres.|alt=Two views of the ocean from space]]

In contrast to terrestrial habitats, marine habitats are shifting and ephemeral. Swimming organisms find areas by the edge of a [[continental shelf]] a good habitat, but only while [[upwelling]]s bring nutrient rich water to the surface. Shellfish find habitat on sandy beaches, but storms, tides and currents mean their habitat continually reinvents itself.

The presence of [[seawater]] is common to all marine habitats. Beyond that many other things determine whether a marine area makes a good habitat and the type of habitat it makes. For example:
* temperature – is affected by geographical [[latitude]], [[ocean currents]], [[weather]], the discharge of rivers, and by the presence of [[hydrothermal vent]]s or [[cold seep]]s
* sunlight – [[photosynthetic]] processes depend on how deep and [[turbid]] the water is
* nutrients – are transported by ocean currents to different marine habitats from [[land runoff]], or by upwellings from the deep sea, or they sink through the sea as [[marine snow]]
* salinity – varies, particularly in [[estuaries]] or near [[river delta]]s, or by hydrothermal vents
* dissolved gases – oxygen levels in particular, can be increased by wave actions and decreased during [[algal bloom]]s
* acidity – this is partly to do with dissolved gases above, since the acidity of the ocean is largely controlled by how much carbon dioxide is in the water.
* turbulence –  [[ocean wave]]s, fast currents and the agitation of water affect the nature of habitats
* cover – the availability of cover such as the adjacency of the [[Benthic zone|sea bottom]], or the presence of [[Pelagic fish#Floating objects|floating objects]]
* the occupying organisms themselves – since organisms modify their habitats by the act of occupying them, and some, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, create further habitats for other organisms.

The ocean occupies 71 percent of the world surface, averaging nearly four kilometres in depth. There are five major oceans, of which the [[Pacific Ocean]] is nearly as large as the rest put together. Coastlines fringe the land for nearly 380,000 kilometres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Marine habitats can be broadly divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Pelagic habitats are the habitats of the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are the habitats that are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Ocean currents==
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|left|[[Ocean gyre]]s rotate clockwise in the north and counterclockwise in the south]]

In marine systems, [[ocean current]]s have a key role determining which areas are effective as habitats, since ocean currents transport the basic nutrients needed to support marine life.&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean"&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/oceans.htm Ocean Habitats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523231058/http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/oceans.htm |date=2011-05-23 }} ''Marietta College''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plankton]] are the life forms that inhabit the ocean that are so small (less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm) that they cannot effectively propel themselves through the water, but must drift instead with the currents. If the current carries the right nutrients, and if it also flows at a suitably shallow depth where there is plenty of sunlight, then such a current itself can become a suitable habitat for photosynthesizing tiny algae called [[phytoplankton]]. These tiny plants are the [[Primary production|primary producers]] in the ocean, at the start of the [[food chain]]. In turn, as the population of drifting phytoplankton grows, the water becomes a suitable habitat for [[zooplankton]], which feed on the phytoplankton. While phytoplankton are tiny drifting plants, zooplankton are tiny drifting animals, such as the [[larvae]] of [[fish]] and [[marine invertebrate]]s. If sufficient zooplankton establish themselves, the current becomes a candidate habitat for the [[forage fish]] that feed on them. And then if sufficient forage fish move to the area, it becomes a candidate habitat for larger [[predatory fish]] and other marine animals that feed on the forage fish. In this dynamic way, the current itself can, over time, become a moving habitat for multiple types of marine life.

[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|This [[algae bloom]] occupies sunlit [[epipelagic]] waters off the southern coast of England. The algae are maybe feeding on nutrients from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the edge of the continental shelf]]

Ocean currents can be generated by differences in the density of the water. How dense water is depends on how saline or warm it is. If water contains differences in salt content or temperature, then the different densities will initiate a current. Water that is saltier or cooler will be denser, and will sink in relation to the surrounding water. Conversely, warmer and less salty water will float to the surface. Atmospheric winds and pressure differences also produces surface currents, [[Ocean wave|waves]] and [[seiche]]s. Ocean currents are also generated by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon ([[tide]]s), and seismic activity ([[tsunami]]).&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean" /&gt;

The rotation of the Earth affects the direction ocean currents take, and explains which way the large circular [[ocean gyre]]s rotate in the image above left. Suppose a current at the equator is heading north. The Earth rotates eastward, so the water possesses that rotational momentum. But the further the water moves north, the slower the earth moves eastward. If the current could get to the North Pole, the earth wouldn't be moving eastward at all. To conserve its rotational momentum, the further the current travels north the faster it must move eastward. So the effect is that the current curves to the right. This is the [[Coriolis effect]]. It is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. The effect is opposite south of the equator, where currents curve left.&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean" /&gt;

==Marine topography==
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|300px|Map of underwater topography (1995 [[NOAA]])]]

Marine (or seabed or ocean) [[topography]] refers to the shape the land has when it interfaces with the ocean. These shapes are obvious along coastlines, but they occur also in significant ways underwater. The effectiveness of marine habitats is partially defined by these shapes, including the way they interact with and shape [[ocean current]]s, and the way sunlight diminishes when these landforms occupy increasing depths. Tidal networks depend on the balance between sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics however, anthropogenic influences can impact the natural system more than any physical driver.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Coco, Z. Zhou, B. van Maanen, M. Olabarrieta, R. Tinoco, I. Townend. Morphodynamics of tidal networks: Advances and challenges. Marine Geology Journal. 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine topographies include [[List of landforms#Coastal and oceanic landforms|coastal and oceanic landforms]] ranging from coastal [[Estuary|estuaries]] and [[shoreline]]s to [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[coral reef]]s. Further out in the open ocean, they include underwater and [[deep sea]] features such as ocean rises and [[seamount]]s.

[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|360px|right|Coastlines can be volatile habitats]]
{{see also|Coast|Coastal biogeomorphology|Coastal fish}}

[[Coast|Marine coasts]] are dynamic environments which constantly change, like the ocean which partially shape them. The Earth's natural processes, including [[weather]] and [[sea level rise|sea level change]], result in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and resculpturing of coasts as well as the flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[drowned river valley]]s.

The main agents responsible for deposition and [[erosion]] along coastlines are [[wind wave|waves]], [[tide]]s and [[Ocean current|currents]]. The formation of coasts also depends on the [[lithology|nature of the rocks]] they are made of – the harder the rocks the less likely they are to erode, so variations in rock hardness result in coastlines with different shapes.

[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2002), p.421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sedimentology|sedimentologist]] [[Francis Shepard]] classified coasts as ''primary'' or ''secondary''.&lt;ref name="Shepard"&gt;Shepard FP (1937) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30056777 Revised "Classification of Marine Shorelines"] ''The Journal of Geology,'' '''45'''(6): 602–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Primary coasts are shaped by non-marine processes, by changes in the land form. If a coast is in much the same condition as it was when sea level was stabilised after the last ice age, it is called a primary coast.&lt;ref name="Shepard" /&gt; "Primary coasts are created by erosion (the wearing away of soil or rock), deposition (the buildup of sediment or sand) or tectonic activity (changes in the structure of the rock and soil because of earthquakes). Many of these coastlines were formed as the sea level rose during the last 18,000 years, submerging river and glacial valleys to form bays and fjords."&lt;ref name=ONR&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches2.htm Habitats: Beaches - Coasts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426043554/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches2.htm |date=2011-04-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a primary coast is a [[river delta]], which forms when a river deposits soil and other material as it enters the sea.&lt;ref name=ONR /&gt;
* Secondary coasts are produced by marine processes, such as the action of the sea or by creatures that live in it. Secondary coastlines include [[sea cliff]]s, [[barrier island]]s, [[mud flat]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s and [[salt marsh]]es.&lt;ref name=ONR /&gt;

[[File:Elevation.jpg|thumb|260px|left|{{legend|#03FCDE|The global continental shelf, highlighted in cyan, defines the extent of coastal habitats, and occupies 5% of the total world area.}}]]

Continental coastlines usually have a [[continental shelf]], a shelf of relatively shallow water, less than 200 metres deep, which extends 68&amp;nbsp;km on average beyond the coast. Worldwide, continental shelves occupy a total area of about 24 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (9 million sq mi), 8% of the ocean's total area and nearly 5% of the world's total area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-62.html Continental shelf areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202232634/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-62.html |date=2008-12-02 }} ''Earth trends''. Retrieved 25 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIAWorld&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World] The World Factbook, CIA. Retrieved 26 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal habitats are generally [[Photic zone|photic]], situated in the sunlit [[epipelagic zone]]. This means the conditions for [[photosynthetic]] processes so important for [[primary production]], are available to coastal marine habitats. Because land is nearby, there are large discharges of nutrient rich [[land runoff]] into coastal waters. Further, periodic [[upwelling]]s from the deep ocean can provide cool and nutrient rich currents along the edge of the continental shelf.

As a result, coastal marine life is the most abundant in the world. It is found in [[tidal pool]]s, [[fjord]]s and [[estuaries]], near sandy shores and rocky coastlines, around [[coral reef]]s and on or above the continental shelf. [[Coastal fish]] include small forage fish as well as the larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. [[Forage fish]] thrive in inshore waters where high [[Primary production|productivity]] results from [[upwelling]] and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.&lt;ref name="Moyle572"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 572&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] between species that occupy adjacent marine habitats. For example, [[fringing reef]]s just below [[low tide]] level have a mutually beneficial relationship with [[mangrove]] forests at high tide level and [[sea grass]] meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or [[erosion|erode]] the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of [[silt]], fresh water and [[pollution|pollutants]]. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Coastal habitats are the most visible marine habitats, but they are not the only important marine habitats. Coastlines run for 380,000 kilometres, and the total volume of the ocean is 1,370 million cu km. This means that for each metre of coast, there is 3.6 cu km of ocean space available somewhere for marine habitats.

[[File:La Désirade.JPG|thumb|right|Waves and currents shape the intertidal shoreline, eroding the softer rocks and transporting and grading loose particles into shingles, sand or mud]]

===Intertidal===
[[Intertidal zone]]s, those areas close to shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life lives within this zone.

Shore habitats range from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].

===Sandy shores===
[[File:The White Rocks near Portrush (1) - geograph.org.uk - 785899.jpg|thumb|right|Sandy shores provide shifting homes to many species]]
{{see also|Beach}}

Sandy shores, also called [[beach]]es, are coastal shorelines where [[sand]] accumulates. Waves and currents shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. [[Longshore current]]s flow parallel to the beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand. These currents transport large amounts of sand along coasts, forming [[Spit (landform)|spits]], [[barrier island]]s and [[tombolo]]s. Longshore currents also commonly create [[offshore bar]]s, which give beaches some stability by reducing erosion.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics"&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches1.htm Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121836/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches1.htm |date=2011-05-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy shores are full of life, The grains of sand host [[diatom]]s, [[bacteria]] and other microscopic creatures. Some fish and turtles return to certain beaches and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] eggs in the sand. Birds habitat beaches, like [[gull]]s, [[loon]]s, [[sandpiper]]s, [[tern]]s and [[pelican]]s. [[Aquatic mammal]]s, such sea lions, recuperate on them. [[Clam]]s, [[Littorinidae|periwinkle]]s, [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]], [[starfish]] and [[sea urchin]]s are found on most beaches.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Animal &amp; Plant Life"&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches3.htm Habitats: Beaches - Animal &amp; Plant Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121525/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches3.htm |date=2011-05-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sand is a [[sediment]] made from small grains or [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] with diameters between about 60&amp;nbsp;µm and 2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth CK (1922) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/30063207 "A scale of grade and class terms for clastic sediments"] ''J. Geology,'' '''30''': 377–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Mud (see [[Marine habitats#Mudflats|mudflats]] below) is a sediment made from particles finer than sand. This small particle size means that mud particles tend to stick together, whereas sand particles do not. Mud is not easily shifted by waves and currents, and when it dries out, cakes into a solid. By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting [[sand dune]]s. Beyond the high tide mark, if the beach is low-lying, the wind can form rolling hills of sand dunes. Small dunes shift and reshape under the influence of the wind while larger dunes stabilise the sand with vegetation.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics" /&gt;

Ocean processes grade loose sediments to [[Particle size (grain size)|particle sizes]] other than sand, such as [[gravel]] or [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]s. Waves breaking on a beach can leave a [[berm]], which is a raised ridge of coarser pebbles or sand, at the high tide mark. [[Shingle beach]]es are made of particles larger than sand, such as cobbles, or small stones. These beaches make poor habitats. Little life survives because the stones are churned and pounded together by waves and currents.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics" /&gt;

===Rocky shores===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tidepool]]s on rocky shores make turbulent habitats for many forms of marine life]]
{{see also|Rocky shore|Tidal pool}}

The relative solidity of [[rocky shore]]s seems to give them a permanence compared to the shifting nature of sandy shores. This apparent stability is not real over even quite short geological time scales, but it is real enough over the short life of an organism. In contrast to sandy shores, plants and animals can anchor themselves to the rocks.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats"&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/rocky_shores.htm Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524105825/http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/rocky_shores.htm |date=2011-05-24 }} ''Marietta College''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition can develop for the rocky spaces. For example, [[barnacle]]s can compete successfully on open intertidal rock faces to the point where the rock surface is covered with them. Barnacles resist desiccation and grip well to exposed rock faces. However, in the crevices of the same rocks, the inhabitants are different. Here [[mussel]]s can be the successful species, secured to the rock with their [[byssal]] threads.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats" /&gt;

Rocky and sandy coasts are vulnerable because humans find them attractive and want to live near them. An increasing proportion of the humans live by the coast, putting pressure on coastal habitats.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats" /&gt;

===Mudflats===
[[File:Bnstiltpair.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mudflat]]s become temporary habitats for [[Bird migration|migrating birds]]]]
{{See also|Bay mud}}

[[Mudflat]]s are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as [[bays]], [[bayous]], [[lagoons]], and [[estuaries]]. Mudflats may be viewed [[geologic]]ally as exposed layers of [[bay mud]], resulting from deposition of [[estuarine]] [[silt]]s, [[clay]]s and marine animal [[detritus]].  Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the [[intertidal zone]], and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.

Mudflats are typically important regions for wildlife, supporting a large population, although levels of biodiversity are not particularly high. They are of particular importance to [[migratory bird]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]] mudflats have been classified as a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] priority habitat.

===Mangrove and salt marshes===

{{see also|Mangrove|Ecological values of mangrove|Salt marsh}}

[[Mangrove swamp]]s and [[salt marsh]]es form important coastal habitats in tropical and temperate areas respectively.

Mangroves are species of shrubs and medium size trees that grow in [[saline water|saline]] coastal sediment habitats in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]] &amp;ndash; mainly between [[latitude]]s {{formatnum:25}}° N and {{formatnum:25}}° S. The saline conditions tolerated by various species range from [[brackish water]], through pure [[seawater]] (30 to 40 [[Salinity|ppt]]), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 90 ppt).&lt;ref name="Mathias"&gt;[http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html Mangal (Mangrove). ''World Vegetation''. Mildred E.

The term "mangrove" is used generally to cover all of these species, and it can be used narrowly to cover just mangrove trees of the genus ''[[Rhizophora]]''.

Mangroves form a distinct characteristic saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat, called a ''mangrove swamp'' or ''mangrove forest'''.&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth, Peter J. (1999) ''The Biology of Mangroves'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;What page?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; {{ISBN|0-19-850222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mangrove swamps are found in [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action.  Mangroves dominate three quarters of tropical coastlines.&lt;ref name=NHMI/&gt;

===Estuaries===
[[File:Conwy Estuary - geograph.org.uk - 575854.jpg|thumb|right|[[Estuaries]] occur when rivers flow into a coastal bay or inlet. They are nutrient rich and have a transition zone which moves from freshwater to saltwater.]]

An [[estuary]] is a partly enclosed [[coastal]] body of [[water]] with one or more [[river]]s or [[stream]]s flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open [[sea]].&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;Pritchard, D. W. (1967) ''What is an estuary: physical viewpoint''. p. 3–5 ''in:'' G. H. Lauf (ed.) ''Estuaries'', A.A.A.S. Publ. No. 83, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and ocean environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflow of both seawater and freshwater provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.&lt;ref name="McLusky"&gt;McLusky, D.S. and Elliott, M. (2004) "The Estuarine Ecosystem: ecology, threats and management." New York: Oxford University Press Inc. {{ISBN|0-19-852508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most estuaries were formed by the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"&gt;Wolanski, E. (2007) "Estuarine Ecohydrology." Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-444-53066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are amongst the most heavily populated areas throughout the world, with about 60% of the world’s population living along estuaries and the coast. As a result, estuaries are suffering degradation by many factors, including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation; overgrazing and other poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands; eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, PCBs, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"/&gt;

Estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide habitats for [[salmon]] and [[sea trout]] nurseries,&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn M. Gillanders, [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2003/247/m247p281.pdf Evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats for mobile marine fauna: an important component of nurseries]. 2003. ''Marine Ecology Progress Series''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Bird migration|migratory]] bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer A. Gill, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6845/abs/412436a0.html The buffer effect and large-scale population regulation in migratory birds]. 2001. ''Nature'' 412, 436-438&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main characteristics of estuarine life are the variability in [[salinity]] and [[sedimentation]]. Many species of [[fish]] and [[invertebrate]]s have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed [[osmoconformer]]s and [[osmoregulator]]s. Many animals also [[burrowing|burrow]] to avoid [[predation]] and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux. [[Phytoplankton]] are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the [[tide]]s. Their productivity is largely dependent on the [[turbidity]] of the water. The main phytoplankton present are [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]] which are abundant in the sediment.

===Kelp forests===
{{further|Kelp forest}}
[[File:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kelp forest]]s provide habitat for many marine organisms]]

[[Kelp forest]]s are underwater areas with a high density of [[kelp]]. They form some of the most productive and dynamic [[ecosystem]]s on Earth.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"&gt;Mann, K.H. 1973. Seaweeds: their productivity and strategy for growth. Science 182: 975-981.&lt;/ref&gt;   Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called ''kelp beds''. Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout [[temperate]] and [[polar region|polar]] coastal oceans.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"/&gt;

Kelp forests provide a unique three-dimensional habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes. Over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in [[Trophic dynamics|trophic]] ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem. For example, kelp forests can influence coastal [[oceanographic]] patterns&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G.A. and C.D. Winant. 1983. Effect of a kelp forest on coastal currents. Continental Shelf Report 2: 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and provide many [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"&gt;Steneck, R.S., M.H. Graham, B.J. Bourque, D. Corbett, J.M. Erlandson, J.A. Estes and M.J. Tegner. 2002. Kelp forest ecosystems: biodiversity, stability, resilience and future. Environmental Conservation 29: 436-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans have contributed to kelp forest degradation. Of particular concern are the effects of [[overfishing]] nearshore ecosystems, which can release [[herbivores]] from their normal population regulation and result in the over-grazing of kelp and other algae.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"&gt;Sala, E., C.F. Bourdouresque and M. Harmelin-Vivien. 1998. Fishing, trophic cascades, and the structure of algal assemblages: evaluation of an old but untested paradigm. Oikos 82: 425-439.&lt;/ref&gt; This can rapidly result in transitions to barren landscapes where relatively few species persist.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"&gt;Dayton, P.K. 1985a. Ecology of kelp communities. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 16: 215-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently considered an [[ecosystem engineer]], kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.G., J. H. Lawton and M. Shachak. 1997. Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers. Ecology 78: 1946-1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In algae (Kingdom: [[Protista]]), the body of an individual organism is known as a [[thallus]] rather than as a plant (Kingdom: [[Plantae]]). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus;
:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features;
:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.
In addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.

The environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose &gt; 50 E m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"&gt;Druehl, L.D. 1981.

===Seagrass meadows===
[[File:White-spotted puffer.jpg|thumb|right|[[White-spotted puffer]]s like living in seagrass areas]]

[[Seagrass]]es are [[flowering plant]]s from one of four plant families which grow in marine environments. They are called ''seagrasses'' because the leaves are long and narrow and are very often green, and because the plants often grow in large meadows which look like grassland. Since seagrasses [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and are submerged, they must grow submerged in the [[photic zone]], where there is enough sunlight. For this reason, most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms.

Seagrasses form extensive beds or meadows, which can be either monospecific (made up of one species) or multispecific (where more than one species co-exist). Seagrass beds make highly diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s. They are home to [[phylum|phyla]] such as juvenile and adult fish, [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] and free-living [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] and [[Microphyte|microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s.  Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific [[review]]s and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is a highly important link in the food chain, with hundreds of species feeding on seagrasses worldwide, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s.

Seagrasses are [[ecosystem engineer]]s in the sense that they partly create their own habitat. The leaves slow down water-currents increasing [[sedimentation]], and the seagrass [[root]]s and [[rhizome]]s stabilize the seabed. Their importance to associated species is mainly due to provision of shelter (through their three-dimensional structure in the water column), and due to their extraordinarily high rate of [[primary production]]. As a result, seagrasses provide coastal zones with [[ecosystem services]], such as [[fishing ground]]s, [[Wind wave|wave]] protection, [[oxygen]] production and protection against coastal [[erosion]]. Seagrass meadows account for 15% of the ocean’s total carbon storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Coral reefs ===
[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{Main|Coral reef}}

[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.

Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Niño]] weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA (1998) Record-breaking coral bleaching occurred in tropics this year. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Press release (October 23, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRS (1998) Statement on Global Coral Bleaching in 1997-1998. International Coral Reef Society, October 15, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some reefs are recovering, but scientists say that between 50% and 70% of the world's coral reefs are now endangered and predict that [[global warming]] could exacerbate this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, D., Burke, L., McManus, J., et al.

==Open ocean==
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|left|Elevation-area graph showing the proportion of land area at given heights and the proportion of ocean area at given depths]]
{{See also|Pelagic fish}}

The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of nutrients, yet because it is so vast, it has more overall [[primary production]] than any other marine habitat. Only about 10 percent of marine species live in the open ocean. But among them are the largest and fastest of all marine animals, as well as the animals that dive the deepest and migrate the longest. In the depths lurk animal that, to our eyes, appear hugely alien.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/ Blue Planet: Open ocean] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface waters===
[[File:Starr 061214-2478 Chenopodium oahuense.jpg|thumb|right|In the open ocean, sunlit surface [[epipelagic]] waters get enough light for photosynthesis, but there are often not enough nutrients. As a result, large areas contain little life apart from migrating animals.&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;]]

The surface waters are sunlit. The waters down to about 200 metres are said to be in the [[epipelagic zone]]. Enough sunlight enters the epipelagic zone to allow [[photosynthesis]] by [[phytoplankton]]. The epipelagic zone is usually low in nutrients. This partially because the organic debris produced in the zone, such as excrement and dead animals, sink to the depths and are lost to the upper zone. Photosynthesis can happen only if both sunlight and nutrients are present.&lt;ref name=sunlit&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/surface_waters/ Ocean ecology: sunlit surface waters] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, like at the edge of continental shelves, nutrients can [[upwell]] from the ocean depth, or [[land runoff]] can be distributed by storms and ocean currents. In these areas, given that both sunlight and nutrients are now present, phytoplankton can rapidly establish itself, multiplying so fast that the water turns green from the chlorophyll, resulting in an [[algal bloom]]. These nutrient rich surface waters are among the most biologically productive in the world, supporting billions of tonnes of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;

"Phytoplankton are eaten by [[zooplankton]] - small animals which, like phytoplankton, drift in the ocean currents. The most abundant zooplankton species are [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]: tiny [[crustacean]]s that are the most numerous animals on Earth. Other types of zooplankton include [[jelly fish]] and the [[larvae]] of fish, [[marine worm]]s, [[starfish]], and other marine organisms".&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt; In turn, the zooplankton are eaten by [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] animals, including some [[seabird]]s, small [[forage fish]] like herrings and sardines, [[whale shark]]s, [[manta ray]]s, and the largest animal in the world, the [[blue whale]]. Yet again, moving up the [[foodchain]], the small forage fish are in turn eaten by larger predators, such as tuna, marlin, sharks, large squid, seabirds, dolphins, and [[toothed whale]]s.&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;

===Deep sea===
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|left|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]
{{see also|Deep sea|Deep sea communities}}

The [[deep sea]] starts at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses most of its energy in the water. Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light a unique evolution known as [[bio-luminescence]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic life forms adapted to living in these deeper zones.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the [[aphotic zone]]'s energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]]. In deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The "snowflakes" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:PSM V23 D086 The deep sea fish eurypharynx pelecanoides.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] eel can swallow a fish much larger than itself]]

The fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s. "&lt;ref name="Moyle591"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Haedrich1996"&gt;Haedrich RL (1996) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203565/abstract "Deep-water fishes: evolution and adaptation in the earth's largest living spaces"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''49'''(sA):40-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.&lt;ref name="Moyle586"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 586&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] is a deep sea eel with an enormous loosely hinged mouth. It can open its mouth wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than itself, and then expand its stomach to accommodate its catch.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R.W.N.|author= McCosker, John E.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 90|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sea floor==

===Vents and seeps===
[[File:Explorer Ridge Zooarium chimney.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zooid|Zooarium]] chimney provides a habitat for vent biota]]

[[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[marine biome]]s and many new [[marine microorganism]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations.

===Trenches===
The deepest recorded [[oceanic trench]]es measure to date is the [[Mariana Trench]], near the [[Philippines]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at 10,924&amp;nbsp;m (35,838&amp;nbsp;ft). At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white [[flatfish]], a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' when it dove to the bottom in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seamounts===
Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed.

'''Markarian 335''' is a [[Seyfert galaxy]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]], located 324 million light-years away in the constellation of [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]].

The central black hole in this active galaxy nucleus is notable for its [[corona]]'s spinning rate (at about 20 percent the speed of light) and its change in brightness from 2007 to 2014.  The geometry of the corona has been deduced from [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] blurring of the reflection of the [[accretion disc]].  An [[x-ray]] flare in 2013 is interpreted as an aborted jet.&lt;ref name=wilkins/&gt;

It consisted of a [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]], renamed the '''[[Carl Sagan]] Memorial Station''', and a lightweight (10.6&amp;nbsp;kg/23&amp;nbsp;lb) wheeled [[robot]]ic [[Mars rover]] named ''[[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/pathfinder.html |title=Mars Pathfinder |work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the first rover to operate outside the Earth–Moon system.

Launched on December 4, 1996 by [[NASA]] aboard a [[Delta II]] booster a month after the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997 on [[Mars]]'s [[Ares Vallis]], in a region called [[Chryse Planitia]] in the [[Oxia Palus quadrangle]]. The [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the Martian surface.
The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to analyze the Martian [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[climate]], geology and the composition of its [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and soil. It was the second project from NASA's [[Discovery Program]], which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto "cheaper, faster and better" promoted by the then administrator, [[Daniel Goldin]]. The mission was directed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), a division of the [[California Institute of Technology]], responsible for NASA's [[Mars Exploration Program]]. The project manager was JPL's [[Tony Spear]].

This mission was the first of a series of missions to Mars that included rovers, and was the first successful lander since the two ''[[Viking program|Vikings]]'' landed on the red planet in 1976. Although the [[Soviet Union]] successfully sent rovers to the Moon as part of the [[Lunokhod program]] in the 1970s, its attempts to use rovers in its [[Mars program]] failed.

In addition to scientific objectives, the ''Mars Pathfinder'' mission was also a "proof-of-concept" for various technologies, such as [[airbag]]-mediated touchdown and automated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] mission. The ''Mars Pathfinder'' was also remarkable for its extremely low cost relative to other robotic space missions to Mars. Originally, the mission was conceived as the first of the [[Mars Environmental Survey]] (MESUR) program.

==Mission objectives==
* To prove that the development of "faster, better and cheaper" spacecraft was possible (with three years for development and a cost under $150&amp;nbsp;million).
* To show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one fifteenth the cost of a [[Viking program|Viking]] mission. (For comparison, the Viking missions cost $935&amp;nbsp;million in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://solarviews.com/history/SP-4212/ch8-6.html |chapter=Viking Lander: Building A Complex Spacecraft - Reorganizations and Additional Cutbacks |url=http://solarviews.com/history/SP-4212/contents.html |title=On Mars: Exploration of the Red Planet 1958-1978 |first1=Edward Clinton |last1=Ezell |first2=Linda Neuman |last2=Ezell |pages=268–270 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |location=Washington, D.C. |year=1984 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in 1997 dollars.)
* To demonstrate NASA's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of $280&amp;nbsp;million, including the launch vehicle and mission operations.

The ''Mars Pathfinder'' conducted different investigations on the Martian soil using three scientific instruments.

The ''[[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]]'' rover had an Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer ([[APXS]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Determination of the chemical composition of Martian soil and rocks: The alpha proton X ray spectrometer |author1=R.

The rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one. These instruments could investigate the geology of the Martian surface from just a few millimeters to many hundreds of meters, the [[geochemistry]] and evolutionary history of the rocks and surface, the [[magnetic]] and [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties of the land, as well as the magnetic properties of the dust, atmosphere and the [[rotation]]al and [[orbit]]al dynamics of the planet.
[[File:h rover-comp wheels 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wheel size comparison: ''Sojourner'', [[Mars Exploration Rover]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]]]]
Three [[navcam|navigation cameras]] were on board the rover: Two black and white 0.3-[[megapixel]] cameras were located on the front (768 horizontal [[pixel]]s × 484 vertical pixels configured in 4×4+100 pixel blocks), coupled with five [[laser]] stripe projectors, which enabled [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover's path. A third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back, near the APXS, and rotated by 90°. It provided images of the APXS's target area and the rover's tracks on the ground. The pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way, that out of the 16 pixel of a 4×4 pixel block, 12 pixel were sensitive to green, 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to [[infrared]] as well as blue. As all cameras had [[camera lens|lenses]] made out of [[zinc selenide]], which blocks light below a [[wavelength]] of 500&amp;nbsp;nm, no blue light actually reached these "blue/infrared" pixels, which therefore recorded only infrared.

All three cameras were [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] manufactured by [[Eastman Kodak Company]], and were controlled by the rover's [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. They all had auto-exposure and capabilities for handling bad pixels, and the image parameters (exposure time, compression used, etc.) were included in the transmitted images as part of the [[image header]]. The rover could [[data compression|compress]] the front cameras' images using the [[block truncation coding]] (BTC) algorithm, but it could only do the same for the back camera's images if the colour information was discarded. The cameras' [[optical resolution]] was sufficient to resolve 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm details across a 0.65&amp;nbsp;m range.&lt;ref name="sojcam" /&gt;

==Landing site==
The landing site was an ancient flood plain in Mars's northern hemisphere called "[[Ares Vallis]]" ("the valley of Ares", the ancient Greek equivalent of the ancient Roman deity Mars) and is among the rockiest parts of Mars. Scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood. After the landing, at {{Coord|19.13|N|33.22|W|globe:Mars|display=inline,title}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/science/geology.html |title=Mars Pathfinder Science Results |work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded, the lander received the name ''The [[Carl Sagan]] Memorial Station'' in honor of the [[astronomer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars lander renamed for Sagan|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/sagansta.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry, descent and landing==
[[File:Atmospheric entry.gif|thumb|left|200px|1990s illustration of Mars atmospheric entry]]
''Mars Pathfinder'' entered the Martian atmosphere and landed using an innovative system involving an entry capsule, a supersonic [[parachute]], followed by solid rockets and large airbags to cushion the impact.

''Mars Pathfinder'' directly entered Mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1&amp;nbsp;km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that was derived from the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370&amp;nbsp;m/s (830&amp;nbsp;mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68&amp;nbsp;m/s (about 160&amp;nbsp;mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20&amp;nbsp;m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6&amp;nbsp;km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.

[[File:Pathfinder Air Bags - GPN-2000-000484.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Pathfinder'' air bags are tested in June 1995]]
Once the lander was 355 m above the ground, airbags were inflated in less than a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer [[vectran]] bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15&amp;nbsp;m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98&amp;nbsp;m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0&amp;nbsp;m/s between 15 and 25&amp;nbsp;m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5&amp;nbsp;m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14&amp;nbsp;m/s and limited the impact to only 18&amp;nbsp;G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7&amp;nbsp;m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).

The entire entry, descent and landing (EDL) process was completed in four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/edl/edl1.html |title=Entry Descent and Landing |work=JPL/NASA Mars Pathfinder |year=2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the lander stopped rolling, the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander "petals". Designed to right itself from any initial orientation, the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal. 74 minutes after landing, the petals were deployed with ''Sojourner'' rover and the solar panels attached on the inside.

[[File:Pan segment1.gif|thumb|left|200px|IMP image of landing site in 1997]]
The lander arrived at night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. The lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30° north latitude and 33.52° west longitude in Ares Vallis, only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200&amp;nbsp;km wide landing site ellipse. During [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|Sol]] 1, the first Martian solar day the lander spent on the planet, the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags hadn't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of ''Sojourner''{{'}}s descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag. The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, ''Sojourner'' was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps.

The ''Mars Pathfinder'' entry descent and landing system design was used (with some modification) on the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] mission. Likewise, many design aspects of the ''Sojourner'' rover (e.g. the [[rocker-bogie]] mobility architecture and the navigation algorithms) were also successfully used on the Mars Exploration Rover mission.

==Rover operations==
{{further|Sojourner (rover)}}

===''Sojourner'' deployment===
The ''Sojourner'' rover exit from the lander occurred on Sol 2, after its landing on July 4, 1997. As the next sols progressed it approached some rocks, which the scientists named "[[Barnacle Bill (Mars)|Barnacle Bill]]", "[[Yogi Rock|Yogi]]", and "[[Scooby-Doo]]", after famous [[cartoon]] characters. The rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil, while the lander took pictures of the ''Sojourner'' and the surrounding terrain, in addition to making climate observations.

The ''Sojourner'' is a six-wheeled 65&amp;nbsp;cm long vehicle, 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide, 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall and weighing 10.5&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/mar-09/02_MEPAG_McCuistion_Mar_09.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mars – the search for life |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 28, 2009 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maximum speed reached one centimeter per second. ''Sojourner'' travelled approximately 100 metres in total, never more than 12&amp;nbsp;m from the ''Pathfinder'' station. During its 83 [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sols]] of operation, it sent 550 photographs to Earth and analyzed the [[chemistry|chemical]] properties of 16 locations near the lander. (See also [[Rover (space exploration)|Space exploration rovers]])

===''Sojourner''{{'}}s rock analysis===
[[File:Sojourner and Barnacle Bill.jpg|thumb|''Sojourner'' next to the rock [[Barnacle Bill (Mars)|Barnacle Bill]]]]
The first analysis on a rock started on Sol 3 with Barnacle Bill. The [[APXS|Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer]] (APXS) was used to determine its composition, the spectrometer taking ten hours to make a full scan of the sample. It found all the elements except [[hydrogen]], which constitutes just 0.1 percent of the rock's or soil's mass.

The APXS works by irradiating rocks and soil samples with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], which consist of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s). The results indicated that "Barnacle Bill" is much like Earth's [[andesite]]s, confirming past [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.  The discovery of andesites shows that some Martian rocks have been remelted and reprocessed.  On Earth, Andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock while some of the iron and magnesium settle out.  Consequently, the final rock contains less iron and magnesiums and more silica.  Volcanic rocks are usually classified by comparing the relative amount of alkalis (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with the amount of silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from Mars.&lt;ref name="Golombek, M 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/marspath/apxs.html |title=APXS Composition Results |work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruckner, J. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bruckner |first1=J. |first2=G. |last2=Dreibus |first3=R. |last3=Rieder |first4=H. |last4=Wanke |year=2001 |title=Revised Data of the Mars Pathfinder Alpha Proton X-ray spectrometer: Geochemical Behavior of Major and Minor Elements |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the Yogi rock again using the APXS showed that it was a [[basalt]]ic rock, more primitive than Barnacle Bill. Yogi's shape and texture show that it was probably deposited there by a [[flood]].

Another rock, named Moe, was found to have certain marks on its surface, demonstrating erosion caused by the wind. Most rocks analyzed showed a high content of [[silicon]]. In another region known as Rock Garden, ''Sojourner'' encountered crescent moon-shaped dunes, which are similar to [[dunes|crescentic dunes]] on Earth.

By the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the journal ''Science'' (December 5, 1997), it was believed that the rock Yogi contained a coating of dust, but was similar to the rock Barnacle Bill.  Calculations suggest that the two rocks contain mostly the minerals orthopyroxene (magnesium-iron silicate), feldspars (aluminum silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), quartz (silicon dioxide), with smaller amounts of magnetite, ilmenite, iron sulfide, and calcium phosphate.&lt;ref name="Golombek, M 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruckner, J. 2001"/&gt;

The mission was jeopardised by a [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] software bug in the lander,&lt;ref&gt;Parallel sparking: Many chips make light work, Douglas Heaven, ''New Scientist'' magazine, issue 2930, 19 August 2013, p44.

The problem, which was reproduced and corrected from Earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software, was due to [[Reset (computing)|computer resets]] caused by [[priority inversion]]. No scientific or engineering data was lost after a computer reset, but all the following operations were interrupted until the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/mbj/Mars_Pathfinder/Authoritative_Account.html |title=What really happened on Mars? - Authoritative Account |first=Glenn E. |last=Reeves |work=Microsoft.com |date=December 15, 1997 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/mbj/Mars_Pathfinder/ |title=What really happened on Mars? |first=Michael B. |last=Jones |work=Microsoft.com |date=December 16, 1997 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four resets occurred (on July 5, 10, 11 and 14) during the mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oarval.org/missionsr2.htm| title= The Mars Pathfinder Mission Status Reports &amp;mdash; Second Week|publisher = Office of the Flight Operations Manager &amp;ndash; Mars Pathfinder Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; before patching the software on July 21 to enable [[priority inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oarval.org/missionsr3.htm| title= The Mars Pathfinder Mission Status Reports &amp;mdash; Third Week|publisher = Office of the Flight Operations Manager &amp;ndash; Mars Pathfinder Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results from ''Pathfinder''==
[[File:Mars sunset PIA00920.jpg|thumb|Close-up of Mars sky at sunset, by ''Mars Pathfinder'' (1997)]]
The lander sent more than 2.3 billion bits of information including 16,500 pictures and made 8.5 million measurements of the [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature and wind speed.&lt;ref name=jplpathfinder&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars-pathfinder/|title=Mars Pathfinder and Sojourner|work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By taking multiple images of the sky at different distances from the Sun, scientists were able to determine that the size of the particles in the pink haze was about one [[micrometre]] in radius.  The color of some soils was similar to that of an iron oxyhydroxide phase which would support the theory of a warmer and wetter climate in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. et al.  1997.  "Results from the Mars Pathfinder Camera" ''Science'': 278.  1758–1765&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pathfinder'' carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust. Eventually, all but one of the magnets developed a coating of dust.  Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure [[magnetite]] or just one type of [[maghemite]]. The dust probably was an aggregate possibly cemented with [[ferric oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, S.  et al.  1997.  "Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Pathfinder Lander:  Preliminary Results".  ''Science'':278.  1768–1770.&lt;/ref&gt; Using much more sophisticated instruments, [[Spirit Rover|Mars ''Spirit'' rover]] found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars.  Magnetite was found in the soil and that the most magnetic part of the soil was dark.  Magnetite is very dark.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen, P. et al.  2004.  "Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Exploration rover Spirit at Gusev Crater".  ''Science'': 305. 827–829.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Doppler tracking]] and [[two-way ranging]], scientists added earlier measurements from the ''Viking'' landers to determine that the non-hydrostatic component of the polar [[moment of inertia]] is due to the [[Tharsis bulge]] and that the interior is not melted. The central metallic core is between 1300&amp;nbsp;km and 2000&amp;nbsp;km in radius.&lt;ref name="Golombek, M 1997"&gt;Golombek, M. et al. 1997.

Although the mission was planned to last from a week to a month, the rover operated successfully for almost three months. Communication failed after 7 October,&lt;ref name=batteryfailure/&gt; with a final data transmission received from Pathfinder at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997. Mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months, but the mission was terminated on March 10, 1998. During the extended operation a high-resolution stereo panorama of the surrounding terrain was being made, and the Sojourner rover was to visit a distant ridge, but the panorama was only about one-third completed and the ridge visit had not begun when communication failed.&lt;ref name=batteryfailure/&gt;

The on-board battery—designed to operate for one month—may have failed after repeated charging and discharging. The battery was used to heat the probe's electronics to slightly above the expected nighttime temperatures on Mars. With the failure of the battery, colder-than-normal temperatures may have caused vital parts to break, leading to loss of communications.&lt;ref name=batteryfailure&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/1997/10/27-04.html |title=Mars Pathfinder Nearing Its End |work=sciencemag.org |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasafacts&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/mpf.pdf NASA facts - Mars Pathfinder]&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission had exceeded its goals in the first month.

==Naming the rover==
[[File:Pathfinder01.jpg|thumb|300px|''Sojourner'' takes its Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer measurement of the [[Yogi Rock]]]]
The name ''Sojourner'' was chosen for the ''Mars Pathfinder'' rover after a year-long, worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments. The students were asked to address in their essays how a planetary rover named for their heroine would translate these accomplishments to the Martian environment.

Initiated in March 1994 by [[The Planetary Society]] of Pasadena, California, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the contest got under way with an announcement in the January 1995 issue of the National Science Teachers Association's magazine ''Science and Children'', circulated to 20,000 teachers and schools across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Names First Rover to Explore the Surface of Mars |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning essay, which suggested naming the rover for [[Sojourner Truth]], was selected from among 3,500 essays and was submitted by 12-year-old Valerie Ambroise of Bridgeport, CT.  First runner-up was Deepti Rohatgi, 18, of Rockville, MD, who suggested [[Marie Curie]]. Second runner-up was Adam Sheedy, 15, of Round Rock, TX, who submitted the name of the late astronaut [[Judith Resnik]], who perished in the 1986 ''Challenger'' space shuttle explosion. Other popular suggestions included [[Sacajewea]] and [[Amelia Earhart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html |title=Pathfinder Rover Gets Its Name |work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Other Minds''''' is a 2016 bestseller by [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] on the evolution and nature of consciousness. It compares the situation in [[cephalopods]], especially the [[octopus]] and the [[cuttlefish]], with that in [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Complex active bodies that enable and perhaps require a measure of intelligence have evolved three times, in [[arthropod]]s, cephalopods, and [[vertebrate]]s. The book reflects on the nature of cephalopod intelligence in particular, constrained by their short lifespan, and embodied in large part in their partly autonomous arms which contain more [[nerve cell]]s than their brains.

The book has been admired by reviewers, the ''[[New York Times]]'' for example calling it "never dogmatic, yet startlingly incisive".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Context==

[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] is an Australian [[Philosophy of Science|philosopher of science]], specialising in the [[philosophy of mind]] and its relationship with the [[philosophy of biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Peter Godfrey-Smith|url=http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/peter.godfrey-smith.php|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an experienced diver.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Book==

''Other Minds'' was published by [[Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux]] in the USA in 2016. It was first published in the United Kingdom by William Collins in 2017. It is illustrated with 17 colour plates and monochrome photographs and diagrams in the text. All the photographs of [[octopus]]es and [[cuttlefish]] were taken underwater by Godfrey-Smith. He acknowledges the influence of [[Daniel Dennett]]'s philosophy.{{sfn|Godfrey-Smith|2018|p=239}}

Godfrey-Smith's premise in this book is the fact that intelligence has evolved separately in two groups of animals: in [[cephalopod]]s like octopuses and cuttlefish, and in [[vertebrate]]s like birds and humans. He notes that studying cephalopods is "probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien",&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; but that "the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He describes many encounters with octopuses in the book, as he dives in the shallow waters off Australia, especially in a favoured place that he names "Octopolis" where many of the animals gather. Octopuses are, he notes, inquisitive, observant, even friendly, but the architecture of their nervous systems is entirely different from the vertebrate plan. The octopus's intelligence is distributed throughout its body: there are almost twice as many nerve cells in their eight muscular arms as in their brain.

Intelligence is, Godfrey-Smith argues, predicated upon the "complex active bodies".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Three groups of [[bilateria]]n [[animal]]s with that kind of [[body plan]] evolved in the [[Cambrian]] period, some 500 million years ago: the [[arthropod]]s (such as crabs and insects), the vertebrates, and within the [[mollusc]]s, the cephalopods.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Godfrey-Smith disagrees with an old philosophical idea that [[consciousness]] suddenly [[Emergent evolution|emerged]] from unthinking matter; it is an active relationship with the world, built up in small steps with separate capabilities for perceiving the world, taking action with muscles, remembering the simplest of events. Such capabilities, in Godfrey-Smith's view, are present in some degree even in bacteria, which detect chemicals in their environment, and in insects such as bees, which recall the locations of food sources. As for feeling, both crabs and octopuses protect a part of their body that is injured: they evidently feel [[pain]] and are [[sentience|sentient]] to this extent. Neither language nor a worldview is needed for a measure of intelligence in these "''other minds''" that share planet Earth.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Reception==

[[Carl Safina]], in ''[[The New York Times]]'', calls Godfrey-Smith "a rare philosopher", both knowledgeable and curious, who good-naturedly explores the world for insights, "never dogmatic, yet startlingly incisive."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/books/review/other-minds-peter-godfrey-smith.html | title=Thinking in the Deep: Inside the Mind of an Octopus | date= 27 December 2016 | publisher=[[New York Times]] | author=Safina, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gloomy Octopus-Octopus tetricus.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|left|''[[Octopus tetricus]]'', the species found at "Octopolis"]]

[[Philip Hoare]], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', quotes [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s couplet "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner|Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs / Upon the slimy sea.]]" to evoke the "eldritch other[ness]" of octopus intelligence, "with its more-than-the usual complement of limbs, bulbous eyes, seeking suckers and keratinous beaks voraciously devouring anything in its slippery path."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/15/other-minds-peter-godfrey-smith-review-octopus-philip-hoare | title=Other Minds by Peter Godfrey-Smith review – the octopus as intelligent alien | date= 15 March 2017 | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | author=Hoare, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the book "entirely overturns" such preconceptions, with what Godfrey-Smith calls "an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behaviour" forming a "fascinating case study". In Hoare's view, Godfrey-Smith's empathy with the animals comes from his personal observation, scuba diving in the Pacific Ocean near his university in Sydney. He concludes that "perhaps these animals, so incredibly sensate, learning from each other's behaviour, shifting in shape and colour, are more social than we ever suspected."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

[[Olivia Judson]], in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', admits to a love affair with octopuses, having read [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]]'s 1973 ''Octopus and Squid: The Soft Intelligence''. She notes that Godfrey-Smith follows the neuroscientist [[Stanislas Dehaene]] in suggesting that "there's a particular style of processing—one that we use to deal especially with time, sequences, and novelty—that brings with it conscious awareness, while a lot of other quite complex activities do not." She argues that the ability of octopuses to learn new skills, of the kind that may demand consciousness, indicates the possibility of "an awareness that in some ways resembles our own."&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/what-the-octopus-knows/508745/ | title=What the Octopus Knows | publisher=''The Atlantic'' | author=Judson, Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P1160335 peter godfrey-smith reading.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] reads from ''Other Minds'', 2018]]

The biologist Meehan Crist, in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', calls the book an "elegantly materialist telling", describing cephalopod intelligence as "subjective experience ... deeply embodied in physical form."&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |last=Crist |first=Meehan |title=Exploring the origins of consciousness, cephalopod and human, with Peter Godfrey-Smith in 'Other Minds' |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-other-minds-octopus-20161128-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the animals' neurons are in their partly-autonomous arms, "'for an octopus, its arms are partly self – they can be directed and used to manipulate things. But from the central brain's perspective they are partly non-self too, partly agents of their own.' This is as alien a mind as we could hope to encounter."&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; Crist notes, too, that Godfrey-Smith reflects on the short (1–2 years) lifespan of octopuses. He wonders, in what Crist calls "a precipitous existential abyss", why they have such a large nervous system, so costly to build and to run, to learn about the world, when they have almost no time to use the knowledge.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

The ecologist [[Marlene Zuk]], in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', calls Godfrey-Smith "something of an [[Oliver Sacks]] of cephalopods" and his subjects "uncannily personable without being at all human."&lt;ref name=LARB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zuk |first1=Marlene |title=Squishy Sentience |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/squishy-sentience/#! |publisher=Los Angeles Review of Books |accessdate=8 April 2018 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that he meets two obstacles to seeing cephalopods as "rubbery versions of people": they are barely social, interacting mainly to mate; and they have such short lifespans that experience can never become very well-developed.&lt;ref name=LARB/&gt; She remarks that [[sexual selection]] is not covered, though given how important it has been to humans (she speculates that human brains may have grown under the influence of "selection for mate attraction"), "it is tempting to wonder how it has influenced the octopus."&lt;ref name=LARB/&gt;

The [[neuroscientist]] [[Stephen Rose]], in the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'', calls ''Other Minds'' "a delightfully written book and a model of engaged science writing."&lt;ref name=THES/&gt; He writes that Godfrey-Smith handles both biology and philosophy "profoundly but without ever talking down to his audience."&lt;ref name=THES&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Rose |title=Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life, by Peter Godfrey-Smith |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-other-minds-godfrey-smith-william-collins#survey-answer |work=[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake Baer in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' compares octopuses and philosophers: "They are both given to exploring their worlds, they both have a reputation for peculiarity, they both handle multiple subjects with ease."&lt;ref name=NYM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/03/whats-it-like-to-be-an-octopus.html | title=What's It Like to Be an Octopus? | date= 9 March 2017 | publisher=''New York Magazine'' | author=Baer, Drake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octopus eyes, too, look and work much like those of vertebrates; but there, Baer remarks, the similarities end. Cephalopods are "immensely foreign", with "a distributed sense of self" and a "lived reality" quite unlike human consciousness, a feature that, he notes, Godfrey-Smith calls "the most difficult aspect of octopus experience to imagine".&lt;ref name=NYM/&gt;

The filmmaker Jasper Sharp in ''Interalia Magazine'' writes that once in Seoul he ate ''[[san-nakji]]'', freshly butchered raw octopus, "its severed tentacles still twitching." He notes that Godfrey-Smith's suggestion that cephalopods possess both intelligence, with a nervous system of some 500 million neurons, and perhaps consciousness "makes the recollection all the more disturbing."&lt;ref name=IAM&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Jasper |title=Book Review: Peter Godfrey-Smith 'Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness.' |url=https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/jasper-sharp-book-review-peter-godfrey-smith-minds-octopus-sea-deep-origins-consciousness/ |publisher=Interalia Magazine |accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp marvels at the fact, explained by Godfrey-Smith, that despite their shimmering colour displays, cephalopods lack colour receptors in their eyes: they cannot see their own patterns, and cannot therefore reflect on their own visual communications as humans reflect on their own speech: unless, indeed, the photoreceptors in their skin enable them to do this. He concludes that Godfrey-Smith "arrives at no fixed conclusion as to whether these strange creatures actually possess a form of consciousness, nor what this word actually means in relation to non-human species, but if the book provokes more questions than it answers, this is in no way a criticism."&lt;ref name=IAM/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">{{DISPLAYTITLE:pH-sensitive polymers}}
'''pH sensitive''' or '''pH responsive polymers''' are materials which will respond to the changes in the [[pH]] of the surrounding medium by varying their dimensions. Materials may swell, collapse, or change depending on the pH of their environment. This behavior is exhibited due to the presence of certain [[functional group]]s in the polymer chain. pH-sensitive materials can be either acidic or basic, responding to either basic or acidic pH values. These polymers can be designed with many different architectures for different applications. Key uses of pH sensitive polymers are controlled drug delivery systems, [[biomimetics]], micromechanical systems, separation processes, and surface functionalization.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kocak|first=G.|last2=Tuncer|first2=C.|last3=Bütün|first3=V.|date=2016-12-20|title=pH-Responsive polymers|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C6PY01872F|journal=Polym. Chem.|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=144–176|doi=10.1039/c6py01872f|issn=1759-9962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

pH sensitive polymers can be broken into two categories: those with acidic groups (such as -COOH and -SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H) and those with basic groups (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The mechanism of response is the same for both, only the stimulus varies. The general form of the polymer is a backbone with functional "pendant groups" that hang off of it. When these functional groups become ionized in certain pH levels, they acquire a charge (+/-). Repulsions between like charges cause the polymers to change shape.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Meléndez-Ortiz, H Iván; H.C. Varca (2016. "State of the art of smart polymers: from fundamentals to final applications." ''Polymer Science: research advances, practical applications and educational aspects.'' Formatex Research Center. pp. 476-487.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PH-sensitive polymer summary.jpg|thumb|A summary of how polyacids and polybases behavior under different pH conditions.]]

=== Polyacids ===

Polyacids, also known as anionic polymers, are polymers that have acidic groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examples of acidic functional groups include carboxylic acids (-COOH), sulfonic acids (-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H), phosphonic acids, and boronic acids. Polyacids accept protons at low pH values. At higher pH values, they deprotonate and become negatively charged.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The negative charges create a repulsion that causes the polymer to swell. This swelling behavior is observed when the pH is greater than the pKa of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Polybases ===

Polybases are the basic equivalent of polyacids and are also known as cationic polymers. They accept protons at low pH like polyacids do, but they then become positively charged. In contrast, at higher pH values they are neutral. Swelling behavior is seen when the pH is less than the pKa of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Natural polymers ===

Although many sources talk about synthetic pH sensitive polymers, natural polymers can also display pH-responsive behavior. Examples include [[chitosan]], [[hyaluronic acid]], and [[dextran]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chitosan, a frequently used example, is cationic. Since DNA is negatively charged, DNA could be attached to chitosan as a way to deliver genes to cells.{{cn|date=December 2017}}  Natural polymers have appeal because they display good biocompatibility, which makes them useful for biomedical applications. However, a disadvantage to natural polymers is that researchers can have more control over the structure of synthetic polymers and so can design those polymers for specific applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Hyaluronic acid.svg|left|thumb|Chemical structure of hyaluronic acid]]
[[File:Dextran.png|right|thumb|Chemical structure of dextran]]
[[File:Chitosan chemical structural formula.svg|center|thumb|Chemical structure of Chitosan]]

=== Multi-stimuli polymers ===

Polymers can be designed to respond to more than one external stimulus, such as pH and temperature. Often, these polymers are structured as a copolymer where each polymer displays one type of response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Architectures ==

pH sensitive polymers have been created with linear block copolymer, star, branched, dendrimer, brush, and comb architectures. Polymers of different architectures will self-assemble into different structures. This self-assembly can occur due to the nature of the polymer and the solvent, or due to a change in pH. pH changes can also cause the larger structure to swell or deswell. For example, block copolymers often form micelles, as will star polymers and branched polymers. However, star and branched polymers can form rod or worm-shaped micelles rather than the typical spheres. Brush polymers are usually used for modifying surfaces since their structure doesn’t allow them to form a larger structure like a micelle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Synthesis ==

pH sensitive polymers can be synthesized using several common polymerization methods. Functional groups may need to be protected so that they do not react depending on the type of polymerization. The masking can be remooved after polymerization so that they regain their pH-sensitive functionality. [[Living polymerization]] is often used for making pH sensitive polymers because molecular weight distribution of the final polymers can be controlled. Examples include group transfer polymerization (GTP), [[Atom-transfer radical-polymerization|atom transfer radical polymerization]] (ATRP), and [[Reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization|reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer]] (RAFT).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Graft copolymers are a popular type to synthesize because their structure is a backbone with branches. The composition of the branches can be changed to achieve different properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hydrogels can be produced using emulsion polymerization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Characterization ==

=== Contact angle ===
Several methods can be used to measure the [[contact angle]] of a water drop on the surface of a polymer. The contact angle value is used to quantify wettability or hydrophobicity of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
=== Degree of swelling ===
Equal to (swollen weight-deswelled weight)/deswelled weight *100% and determined by massing polymers before and after swelling. This indicates how much the polymer swelled upon a change in pH.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== pH critical point ===
The pH at which a significant structural change in how the molecules are arranged is observed. This structural change does not involve breaking bonds, but rather a change in conformation. For example, a swelling/deswelling transition would constitute a reversible conformational change. The value of the pH critical point can be determined by examining swelling percentage as a function of pH. Researchers aim to design molecules that transition at a pH that matters for the given application.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Surface changes ===
[[Confocal microscopy]], [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy,]] [[Raman spectroscopy]], and [[Atomic-force microscopy|atomic force microscopy]] are all used to determine how the surface of a polymer changes in response to pH.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Purification and separation ===

pH sensitive polymers have been considered for use in membranes. A change in pH could change the ability of the polymer to let ions through, allowing it to act as a filter.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Surface modification ===

pH sensitive polymers have been used to modify the surfaces of materials. For example, they can be used to change the wettability of a surface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Biomedical Use&lt;/big&gt;'''

pH sensitive polymers have been used for drug delivery. For example, they can be used to release of insulin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-28|title=Polymeric hydrogels for oral insulin delivery|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365912007596|journal=Journal of Controlled Release|volume=165|issue=2|pages=129–138|doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.11.005|issn=0168-3659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk''' is the possibility of losing something of value. Values (such as [[physical health]], [[social status]], emotional well-being, or financial wealth) can be gained or lost when taking risk resulting from a given action or inaction, foreseen or unforeseen (planned or not planned). Risk can also be defined as the intentional interaction with [[uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cline|first1=Preston B. |title=The Merging of Risk Analysis and Adventure Education|journal=Wilderness Risk Management|date=3 March 2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=43–45|url=https://www.outdoored.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/wrmc_proceedings_05_adventure_cline.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty is a potential, unpredictable, and uncontrollable outcome; risk is a consequence of action taken in spite of uncertainty.

[[Risk perception]] is the subjective judgment people make about the severity and probability of a risk, and may vary person to person. Any human endeavour carries some risk, but some are much riskier than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Risk|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/risk/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=9 May 2014|last1=Hansson |first1=Sven Ove|first2=Edward N. |last2=Zalta|date=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
[[File:3 Alarm Building Fire.jpg|thumb|Firefighters at work]]

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites the earliest use of the word in English (in the spelling of ''risque'' from its from French original,  'risque' ) as of 1621, and the spelling as ''risk'' from 1655. It defines ''risk'' as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Exposure to) the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# Risk is an influence affecting strategy caused by an incentive or condition that inhibits transformation to quality excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quest for Ascendant Quality|last=Elias|first=Victor|publisher=On QUEST|year=2017|isbn=9780999080115|location=Sparta, NJ USA|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has an effect on at least one [project] objective. (This definition, using project terminology, is easily made universal by removing references to projects).&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (4th Edition) ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
# The probability of something happening multiplied by the resulting cost or benefit if it does. (This concept is more properly known as the 'Expectation Value' or 'Risk Factor' and is used to compare levels of risk)
# The probability or threat of quantifiable damage, injury, liability, loss, or any other negative occurrence that is caused by external or internal vulnerabilities, and that may be avoided through preemptive action.
# Finance: The possibility that an actual return on an investment will be lower than the expected return.
# Insurance: A situation where the probability of a variable (such as burning down of a building) is known but when a mode of occurrence or the actual value of the occurrence (whether the fire will occur at a particular property) is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/risk.html|title=risk|last=|first=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A risk is not an uncertainty (where neither the probability nor the mode of occurrence is known), a peril (cause of loss), or a hazard (something that makes the occurrence of a peril more likely or more severe).
# Securities trading: The probability of a loss or drop in value. Trading risk is divided into two general categories: (1) [[Systematic risk]] affects all securities in the same class and is linked to the overall capital-market system and therefore cannot be eliminated by diversification. Also called [[market risk]]. (2) Non-systematic risk is any risk that isn't market-related. Also called non-market risk, extra-market risk or diversifiable risk.&lt;!-- Needs sorting out --&gt;
# [[Workplace]]: Product of the consequence and probability of a hazardous event or phenomenon. For example, the risk of developing cancer is estimated as the incremental probability of developing cancer over a lifetime as a result of exposure to potential carcinogens (cancer-causing substances).

=== International Organization for Standardization ===

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] publication [[ISO 31000]] (2009) / ISO Guide 73:2002 definition of risk is the 'effect of uncertainty on objectives'. In this definition, uncertainties include events (which may or may not happen) and uncertainties caused by ambiguity or a lack of information. It also includes both negative and positive impacts on objectives. Many definitions of risk exist in common usage, however this definition was developed by an international committee representing over 30 countries and is based on the input of several thousand subject matter experts.

=== Other ===

Very different approaches to risk management are taken in different fields, e.g. "Risk is the unwanted subset of a set of uncertain outcomes" (Cornelius Keating).

:Risk can be seen as relating to the [[probability]] of uncertain future events.&lt;ref name=FAIRW/&gt; For example, according to [[Factor Analysis of Information Risk]], risk is:&lt;ref name=FAIRW&gt;[http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf "An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf |date=18 November 2014 }};.&lt;/ref&gt; the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss.  In computer science this definition is used by [[The Open Group]].&lt;ref name=OGC081&gt;Technical Standard Risk Taxonomy {{ISBN|1-931624-77-1}} Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

:OHSAS (Occupational Health &amp; Safety Advisory Services) defines risk as the combination of the probability of a hazard resulting in an adverse event, and the severity of the event.&lt;ref&gt;"Risk is a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure(s)" (OHSAS 18001:2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

:In [[information security]] risk is defined as "the potential that a given [[threat (computer)|threat]] will exploit [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] of an [[asset]] or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization".&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 27005:2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Financial risk]] is often defined as the unpredictable variability or [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of returns, and this would include both potential better-than-expected and worse-than-expected returns. References to negative risk below should be read as also applying to positive impacts or opportunity (e.g. for "loss" read "loss or gain") unless the context precludes this interpretation.

:The related terms "[[threat]]" and "[[hazard]]" are often used to mean something that could cause harm.

==Practice areas==
Risk is ubiquitous in all areas of life and risk management is something that we all must do, whether we are managing a major organisation or simply crossing the road.  When describing risk however, it is convenient to consider that risk practitioners operate in some specific practice areas.

===Economic risk===

Economic risks can be manifested in lower incomes or higher expenditures than expected. The causes can be many, for instance, the hike in the price for raw materials, the lapsing of deadlines for construction of a new operating facility, disruptions in a production process, emergence of a serious competitor on the market, the loss of key personnel, the change of a political regime, or natural disasters.

===Health===
Risks in personal health may be reduced by [[primary prevention]] actions that decrease early causes of illness or by [[secondary prevention]] actions after a person has clearly measured clinical signs or symptoms recognised as risk factors. Tertiary [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] reduces the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion of [[risk factors]] with individual patients to obtain [[informed consent]] for secondary and tertiary prevention efforts, whereas public health efforts in primary prevention require education of the entire population at risk. In each case, careful communication about risk factors, likely outcomes and [[certainty]] must distinguish between causal events that must be decreased and associated events that may be merely consequences rather than causes.

In epidemiology, the '''lifetime risk''' of an effect is the ''[[cumulative incidence]]'', also called ''incidence proportion'' over an entire lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |vauthors=Rychetnik L, Hawe P, Waters E, Barratt A, Frommer M |date=July 2004 |volume=58 |pages=538–45 |doi=10.1136/jech.2003.011585 |pmid=15194712 |pmc=1732833 |title=A glossary for evidence based public health |issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health, safety, and environment===
In terms of occupational health &amp; safety management, the term 'risk' may be defined as the most likely consequence of a hazard, combined with the likelihood or probability of it occurring.

Health, safety, and environment (HSE) are separate practice areas; however, they are often linked. The reason for this is typically to do with organizational management structures; however, there are strong links among these disciplines. One of the strongest links between these is that a single risk event may have impacts in all three areas, albeit over differing timescales. For example, the uncontrolled release of radiation or a toxic chemical may have immediate short-term safety consequences, more protracted health impacts, and much longer-term environmental impacts. Events such as Chernobyl, for example, caused immediate deaths, and in the longer term, deaths from cancers, and left a lasting environmental impact leading to birth defects, impacts on wildlife, etc.

Over time, a form of risk analysis called environmental risk analysis has developed. Environmental risk analysis is a field of study that attempts to understand events and activities that bring risk to human health or the environment.&lt;ref name="Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurjar|first=Bhola Ram|author2=Mohan, Manju |title=Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries|journal=Risk: Health, Safety &amp; Environment|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/risk13&amp;id=5&amp;collection=journals&amp;index=journals/risk|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human health and environmental risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome (See [[adverse outcome pathway]]). As such, risk is a function of hazard and exposure. Hazard is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed, e.g. the toxicity of a chemical compound. Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard. Therefore, the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero, given a person's (or other organism's) biological makeup, activities and location (See [[exposome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Vallero, Daniel A. (2016). "Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach." Amsterdam: Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-407776-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of health risks are when certain behaviours, such as [[risky sexual behaviour]]s, increase the likelihood of contracting HIV.&lt;ref name = Potter2013 &gt;{{cite book | last = Potter | first = Patricia | title = Fundamentals of nursing | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780323079334 | page=386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information technology and information security===
{{Main|IT risk}}
'''Information technology risk''', or '''IT risk''', '''IT-related risk''', is a risk related to information technology. This relatively new term was developed as a result of an increasing awareness that information security is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports.

The increasing dependencies of modern society on information and computers networks (both in private and public sectors, including military)&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Information assurance|Information security}}
'''Information security''' means protecting information and [[information system]]s from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|44|3542}}(b)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Information security grew out of practices and procedures of [[computer security]].&lt;br /&gt;
Information security has grown to '''information assurance (IA)''' i.e. is the practice of managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. &lt;br /&gt;
While focused dominantly on information in digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital but also analogue or physical form. &lt;br /&gt;
Information assurance is interdisciplinary and draws from multiple fields, including accounting, fraud examination, [[forensic science]], [[management science]], [[systems engineering]], [[security engineering]], and [[criminology]], in addition to computer science.

So, ''[[#Information technology risk|IT risk]]'' is narrowly focused on computer security, while ''information security'' extends to risks related to other forms of information (paper, microfilm). ''Information assurance'' risks include the ones related to the consistency of the business information stored in IT systems and the information stored by other means and the relevant business consequences.

===Insurance===
[[Insurance]] is a risk treatment option which involves risk sharing. It can be considered as a form of contingent capital and is akin to purchasing an [[Option (finance)|option]] in which the buyer pays a small premium to be protected from a potential large loss.

Insurance risk is often taken by insurance companies, who then bear a pool of risks including market risk, credit risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk, longevity risks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Elyasiani | first2 = Elyas | last3 = Mansur | first3 = Iqbal | year = 2008 | title = Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Interdependencies in Insurer Stock Returns: A System-GARCH Model | journal = The Journal of Risk and Insurance | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 873–891 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6975.2008.00289.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.568.4087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business and management===
Means of assessing risk vary widely between professions. Indeed, they may define these professions; for example, a doctor manages medical risk, while a civil engineer manages risk of structural failure. A professional [[code of ethics]] is usually focused on risk assessment and mitigation (by the professional on behalf of client, public, society or life in general).

In the workplace, incidental and [[inherent risk]]s exist. Incidental risks are those that occur naturally in the business but are not part of the core of the business. Inherent risks have a negative effect on the operating profit of the business.

===In human services===
The experience of many people who rely on human services for support is that 'risk' is often used as a reason to prevent them from gaining further independence or fully accessing the community, and that these services are often unnecessarily risk averse.&lt;ref&gt;A Positive Approach To Risk Requires Person Centred Thinking, Neill et al., Tizard Learning Disability Review http://pierprofessional.metapress.com/content/vr700311x66j0125/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "People's autonomy used to be compromised by institution walls, now it's too often our risk management practices", according to [[John O'Brien (human services thinker)|John O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;John O'Brien cited in Sanderson, H. Lewis, J. A Practical Guide to Delivering Personalisation; Person Centred Practice in Health and Social Care p211&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Fischer and Ewan Ferlie (2013) find that contradictions between formal risk controls and the role of subjective factors in human services (such as the role of emotions and ideology) can undermine service values, so producing tensions and even intractable and 'heated' conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan |title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High reliability organisations (HROs)===
A [[high reliability organisation]] (HRO) is an organisation that has succeeded in avoiding catastrophes in an environment where [[normal accident]]s can be expected due to risk factors and [[Complex system|complexity]].  Most studies of HROs involve areas such as nuclear aircraft carriers, air traffic control, aerospace and nuclear power stations. Organizations such as these share in common the ability to consistently operate safely in complex, interconnected environments where a single failure in one component could lead to catastrophe. Essentially, they are organisations which appear to operate 'in spite' of an enormous range of risks.

Some of these industries manage risk in a highly quantified and enumerated way. These include the [[nuclear power]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aircraft industries]], where the possible failure of a complex series of engineered systems could result in highly undesirable outcomes. The usual measure of risk for a class of events is then: ''R'' = probability of the event × the severity of the consequence.

The total risk is then the sum of the individual class-risks;  see below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety, Reliability and Risk Analysis: Theory, Methods and Applications|last=Sebastián Martorell, Carlos Guedes Soares, Julie Barnett|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781482266481|location=|pages=671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nuclear industry, consequence is often measured in terms of off-site radiological release, and this is often banded into five or six-decade-wide bands.{{Clarify|reason=define "decade-wide bands":  factor of 10 regarding what?|date=August 2013}}

The risks are evaluated using fault tree/event tree techniques (see [[safety engineering]]). Where these risks are low, they are normally considered to be "broadly acceptable". A higher level of risk (typically up to 10 to 100 times what is considered broadly acceptable) has to be justified against the costs of reducing it further and the possible benefits that make it tolerable—these risks are described as "Tolerable if [[ALARP]]", where ALARP stands for "as low as reasonably practicable". Risks beyond this level are classified as "intolerable".

The level of risk deemed broadly acceptable has been considered by regulatory bodies in various countries—an early attempt by UK government regulator and academic [[F. R. Farmer]] used the example of hill-walking and similar activities, which have definable risks that people appear to find acceptable. This resulted in the so-called Farmer Curve of acceptable probability of an event versus its consequence.

The technique as a whole is usually referred to as probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) (or probabilistic safety assessment, PSA). See [[WASH-1400]] for an example of this approach.

===Finance===
{{Main|Financial risk}}

In finance, risk is the chance that the return achieved on an investment will be different from that expected, and also takes into account the size of the difference. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. In a view advocated by Damodaran, risk includes not only "[[downside risk]]" but also "upside risk" (returns that exceed expectations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Investment Philosophies: Successful Investment Philosophies and the Greatest Investors Who Made Them Work |first=Aswath |last=Damodaran |page=15 |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-34503-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard the [[standard deviation]] of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment as providing some historical measure of risk; see modern portfolio theory. Financial risk may be market-dependent, determined by numerous market factors, or operational, resulting from fraudulent behaviour (e.g. [[Bernard Madoff]]).

A fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return (see [[modern portfolio theory]]). The greater the potential return one might seek, the greater the risk that one generally assumes. A free market reflects this principle in the pricing of an instrument: strong demand for a safer instrument drives its price higher (and its return correspondingly lower) while weak demand for a riskier instrument drives its price lower (and its potential return thereby higher). For example, a US Treasury bond is considered to be one of the safest investments. In comparison to an investment or speculative grade corporate bond, US Treasury notes and bonds yield lower rates of return. The reason for this is that a corporation is more likely to default on debt than the US government. Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a correspondingly higher rate of return.

A popular [[risk measure]] is [[Value-at-Risk]] (VaR).

There are different types of VaR: long term VaR, marginal VaR, factor VaR and shock VaR. The latter is used in measuring risk during the extreme market stress conditions.

In finance, ''risk'' has no single definition.

Extreme value methods with applications to finance. London: CRC. {{ISBN|978-1-43983-574-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "risk is a possibility of an undesirable event".

In financial markets, one may need to measure [[credit risk]], information timing and source risk, probability model risk, operational risk and [[legal risk]] if there are regulatory or civil actions taken as a result of "[[investor's regret]]".

With the advent of automation in financial markets, the concept of "real-time risk" has gained a lot of attention.  Aldridge and Krawciw&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, I., Krawciw, S., 2017. Real-Time Risk: What Investors Should Know About Fintech, High-Frequency Trading and Flash Crashes. Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-1119318965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; define real-time risk as the probability of instantaneous or near-instantaneous loss, and can be due to flash crashes, other market crises, malicious activity by selected market participants and other events.  A well-cited example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-knightcapital-results-idUSBRE89G0HI20121017|title=Knight Capital posts $389.9 million loss on trading glitch|first=John|last=McCrank|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of real-time risk was a US $440 million loss incurred within 30 minutes by Knight Capital Group (KCG) on 1 August 2012; the culprit was a poorly-tested runaway algorithm deployed by the firm. Regulators have taken notice of real-time risk as well.  Basel III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm|title=Basel III: international regulatory framework for banks|date=7 December 2017|website=www.bis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires real-time risk management framework for bank stability.

It is not always obvious if [[financial instruments]] are "[[Hedge (finance)|hedging]]" (purchasing/selling a financial instrument specifically to reduce or cancel out the risk in another investment) or "speculation" (increasing measurable risk and exposing the investor to catastrophic loss in pursuit of very high windfalls that increase expected value).

Some people may be "[[risk seeking]]", i.e. their [[utility function]]'s second derivative is positive. Such an individual willingly pays a premium to assume risk (e.g. buys a lottery ticket).

=== {{anchor|Risk in auditing}} Financial auditing ===
{{Main|Audit risk}}
The [[audit risk|financial audit risk model]] expresses the risk of an [[auditor]] providing an inappropriate opinion (or material misstatement) of a commercial entity's financial statements. It can be analytically expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt; \text{AR} = \text{IR} \times \text{CR} \times \text{DR}&lt;/math&gt;
where AR is ''audit risk'', IR is ''[[Inherent risk (accounting)|inherent risk]]'', CR is ''control risk'' and DR is ''detection risk''.

Note: As defined, audit risk does not consider the impact of an auditor misstatement and so is stated as a simple probability. The impact of misstatement must be considered when determining an acceptable audit risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Risk Management and Corporate Governance: Interconnections in Law: Chapter: Risk Management from an accounting perspective | author = Arco van de Ven |pages = 16–17 |editors = Marijn van Daelen, Christoph van der Elst }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
[[File:AT YOUR OWN RISK.svg|thumb|166px|'''AT YOUR OWN RISK'''&lt;br /&gt;Popular labelling]]
Security risk management involves protection of assets from harm caused by deliberate acts. A more detailed definition is: "A security risk is any event that could result in the compromise of organizational assets i.e. the unauthorized use, loss, damage, disclosure or modification of organizational assets for the profit, personal interest or political interests of individuals, groups or other entities constitutes a compromise of the asset, and includes the risk of harm to people. Compromise of organizational assets may adversely affect the enterprise, its business units and their clients. As such, consideration of security risk is a vital component of risk management."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Talbot and Miles Jakeman ''Security Risk Management Body of Knowledge'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human factors===
{{Main|Decision theory|Prospect theory}}
One of the growing areas of focus in risk management is the field of [[human factors]] where behavioural and organizational psychology underpin our understanding of risk based decision making. This field considers questions such as "how do we make risk based decisions?", "why are we irrationally more scared of sharks and terrorists than we are of motor vehicles and medications?"

In [[decision theory]], regret (and anticipation of regret) can play a significant part in decision-making, distinct from [[risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;Virine, L., &amp; Trumper, M. ProjectThink. Gower. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virine, L., &amp; Trumper, M. Project Risk Analysis Made Ridiculously Simple. World Scientific Publishing. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;(preferring the status quo in case one becomes worse off).

[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]&lt;ref&gt;Amos Tversky / Daniel Kahneman, 1981. "The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice."{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fundamental problem with all forms of risk assessment. In particular, because of [[bounded rationality]] (our brains get overloaded, so we take mental shortcuts), the risk of extreme events is discounted because the probability is too low to evaluate intuitively. As an example, one of the leading causes of death is [[road accident]]s caused by [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] – partly because any given driver frames the problem by largely or totally ignoring the risk of a serious or fatal accident.

For instance, an extremely disturbing event (an attack by hijacking, or [[moral hazard]]s) may be ignored in analysis despite the fact it has occurred and has a nonzero probability. Or, an event that everyone agrees is inevitable may be ruled out of analysis due to greed or an unwillingness to admit that it is believed to be inevitable. These human tendencies for error and [[wishful thinking]] often affect even the most rigorous applications of the [[scientific method]] and are a major concern of the [[philosophy of science]].

All [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision-making under uncertainty]] must consider [[cognitive bias]], [[cultural bias]], and notational bias: No group of people assessing risk is immune to "[[groupthink]]": acceptance of obviously wrong answers simply because it is socially painful to disagree, where there are [[conflicts of interest]].

Framing involves other information that affects the outcome of a risky decision.  The right prefrontal cortex has been shown to take a more global perspective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schatz | first1 = J. | last2 = Craft | first2 = S. | last3 = Koby | first3 = M. | last4 = DeBaun | first4 = M.

Rightward tapping or listening had the effect of narrowing attention such that the frame was ignored.  This is a practical way of manipulating regional cortical activation to affect risky decisions, especially because directed tapping or listening is easily done.

===Psychology of risk taking===

A growing area of research has been to examine various psychological aspects of risk taking. Researchers typically run randomised experiments with a treatment and control group to ascertain the effect of different psychological factors that may be associated with risk taking. Thus, positive and negative feedback about past risk taking can affect future risk taking. In an experiment, people who were led to believe they are very competent at decision making saw more opportunities in a risky choice and took more risks, while those led to believe they were not very competent saw more threats and took fewer risks.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Norris, and Peter R. Dickson. "How believing in ourselves increases risk taking: perceived self-efficacy and opportunity recognition." Decision Sciences 25, no. 3 (1994): 385–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance===
The concept of risk-based maintenance is an advanced form of [[Reliability centred maintenance]]. In case of chemical industries, apart from probability of failure, consequences of failure is also very important. Therefore, the selection of maintenance policies should be based on risk, instead of reliability. Risk-based maintenance methodology acts as a tool for maintenance planning and decision making to reduce the probability of failure and its consequences. In risk-based maintenance decision making, the maintenance resources can be used optimally based on the risk class (high, medium, or low) of equipment or machines, to achieve tolerable risk criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389406007345 | doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.069 | pmid=16887261 | volume=142 | issue=3 | title=Risk-based maintenance—Techniques and applications | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials | pages=653–661 | last1 = Arunraj | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Maiti | first2 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'But despite the number of agencies involved, cybersecurity generally seems to have slipped in importance for the administration&lt;/ref&gt;===
Closely related to information assurance and security risk, cybersecurity is the application of system security engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2016/NIST-Releases-SP-800-160-Sys-Security-Engineering|title=NIST Releases SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering|first=Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of|last=Commerce|date=15 November 2016|website=csrc.nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to address the compromise of company cyber-assets required for business or mission purposes. In order to address cyber-risk, cybersecurity applies security to the supply chain, the design and production environment for a product or service, and the product itself in order to provide efficient and appropriate security commensurate with the value of the asset to the mission or business process.

==Risk assessment and analysis==
{{Main|Risk assessment|Operational risk management}}
Since risk assessment and management is essential in security management, both are tightly related. Security assessment methodologies like [[CRAMM]] contain risk assessment modules as an important part of the first steps of the methodology. On the other hand, risk assessment methodologies like [[Mehari]] evolved to become security assessment methodologies.
An [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard on risk management (Principles and guidelines on implementation) was published under code [[ISO 31000]] on 13 November 2009.

===Quantitative analysis===
There are many formal methods used to "measure" risk.

Often the probability of a negative event is estimated by using the frequency of past similar events. Probabilities for rare failures may be difficult to estimate. This makes risk assessment difficult in hazardous industries, for example nuclear energy, where the frequency of failures is rare, while harmful consequences of failure are severe.

Statistical methods may also require the use of a [[Loss function|cost function]], which in turn may require the calculation of the cost of loss of a human life. This is a difficult problem. One approach is to ask what people are willing to pay to insure against death&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first = Steven|last = Landsburg|title = Is your life worth $10&amp;nbsp;million?|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2079475/|work = Everyday Economics|publisher = Slate|date = 3 March 2003|accessdate = 17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or radiological release (e.g. GBq of radio-iodine), {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but as the answers depend very strongly on the circumstances it is not clear that this approach is effective.

Risk is often measured as the [[expected value]] of an undesirable outcome. This combines the probabilities of various possible events and some assessment of the corresponding harm into a single value. See also [[Expected utility]].  The simplest case is a binary possibility of ''Accident'' or ''No accident''. The associated formula for calculating risk is then:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{R} = (\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \times  (\text{expected loss in case of the accident})&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, then total risk is a loss of 10, the product of 0.01 and 1000.

Situations are sometimes more complex than the simple binary possibility case. In a situation with several possible accidents, total risk is the sum of the risks for each different accident, provided that the outcomes are comparable:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{R} =  \sum_\text{For all accidents} (\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \times  (\text{expected loss in case of the accident})&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, and a probability of 0.000001 of suffering an accident of type ''B'', with a loss of 2,000,000, then total loss expectancy is 12, which is equal to a loss of 10 from an accident of type ''A'' and 2 from an accident of type ''B''.

One of the first major uses of this concept was for the planning of the [[Delta Works]] in 1953, a flood protection program in the [[Netherlands]], with the aid of the mathematician [[David van Dantzig]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wired Magazine]], [https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/17-01/ff_dutch_delta?currentPage=3 Before the levees break], page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The kind of risk analysis pioneered there has become common today in fields like nuclear power, [[aerospace]] and the [[chemical industry]].

In statistical decision theory, the [[risk function]] is defined as the expected value of a given [[loss function]] as a function of the [[decision rule]] used to make decisions in the face of uncertainty.

===Fear as intuitive risk assessment===
People may rely on their [[fear processing in the brain|fear]] and hesitation to keep them out of the most profoundly unknown circumstances. Fear is a response to perceived danger. Risk could be said to be the way we collectively measure and share this "true fear"—a fusion of rational doubt, irrational fear, and a set of unquantified biases from our own experience.

The field of [[behavioural finance]] focuses on human risk-aversion, asymmetric regret, and other ways that human financial behaviour varies from what analysts call "rational". Risk in that case is the degree of [[uncertainty]] associated with a [[return (finance)|return]] on an asset.  Recognizing and respecting the irrational influences on human decision making may do much to reduce disasters caused by naive risk assessments that presume rationality but in fact merely fuse many shared biases.

==Anxiety, risk and decision making==

===Fear, anxiety and risk===
According to one set of definitions, fear is a fleeting emotion ascribed to a particular object, while [[anxiety]] is a trait of fear (this is referring to "trait anxiety", as distinct from how the term "anxiety" is generally used) that lasts longer and is not attributed to a specific stimulus (these particular definitions are not used by all authors cited on this page).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartley | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 2012| title = Anxiety and Decision-Making | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 | pmid = 22325982 | pmc = 3864559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show a link between anxious behaviour and risk (the chance that an outcome will have an unfavorable result).&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gertner. What Are We Afraid Of, Money 32.5 (2003): 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Forgas introduced [[valence (psychology)|valence]] based research where emotions are grouped as either positive or negative (Lerner and Keltner, 2000). Positive emotions, such as happiness, are believed to have more optimistic risk assessments and negative emotions, such as anger, have pessimistic risk assessments.  As an emotion with a negative valence, fear, and therefore anxiety, has long been associated with negative risk perceptions.  Under the more recent appraisal tendency framework of Jennifer Lerner et al., which refutes Forgas' notion of valence and promotes the idea that specific emotions have distinctive influences on judgments, fear is still related to pessimistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Jennifer S. | last2 = Keltner | first2 = Dacher | year = 2000 | title = Beyond Valence: Toward A Model of Emotion-Specific Influences on Judgment and Choice | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 473–493 | doi=10.1080/026999300402763| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.6023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have demonstrated that increases in anxiety and increases in [[risk perception]] are related and people who are habituated to anxiety experience this awareness of risk more intensely than normal individuals.&lt;ref name="Jon"&gt;Jon K. Maner, Norman B. Schmidt, The Role of Risk Avoidance in Anxiety, Behavior Therapy, Volume 37, Issue 2, June 2006, pp. 181–189, {{ISSN|0005-7894}}, 10.1016/j.beth.2005.11.003.&lt;/ref&gt; In decision-making, anxiety promotes the use of biases and quick thinking to evaluate risk.  This is referred to as affect-as-information according to Clore, 1983.  However, the accuracy of these risk perceptions when making choices is not known.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Constans | first1 = Joseph I. | year = 2001| title = Worry propensity and the perception of risk | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 721–729 | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7967(00)00037-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences of anxiety ===
Experimental studies show that brief surges in anxiety are correlated with surges in general risk perception.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt; Anxiety exists when the presence of threat is perceived (Maner and Schmidt, 2006).&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt; As risk perception increases, it stays related to the particular source impacting the mood change as opposed to spreading to unrelated risk factors.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt; This increased awareness of a threat is significantly more emphasised in people who are conditioned to anxiety.&lt;ref name="Jon_a"&gt;Jon K. Maner, J. Anthony Richey, Kiara Cromer, Mike Mallott, Carl W. Lejuez, Thomas E. Joiner, Norman B. Schmidt, Dispositional anxiety and risk-avoidant decision-making, Personality and Individual Differences, Volume 42, Issue 4, March 2007, pp. 665–675, {{ISSN|0191-8869}}, 10.1016/j.paid.2006.08.016.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anxious individuals who are predisposed to generating reasons for negative results tend to exhibit pessimism.&lt;ref name="Jon_a" /&gt; Also, findings suggest that the perception of a lack of control and a lower inclination to participate in risky decision-making (across various behavioural circumstances) is associated with individuals experiencing relatively high levels of trait anxiety.&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt; In the previous instance, there is supporting clinical research that links emotional evaluation (of control), the anxiety that is felt and the option of risk avoidance.&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt;

There are various views presented that anxious/fearful emotions cause people to access involuntary responses and judgments when making decisions that involve risk.  Joshua A. Hemmerich et al. probes deeper into anxiety and its impact on choices by exploring "risk-as-feelings" which are quick, automatic, and natural reactions to danger that are based on emotions.  This notion is supported by an experiment that engages physicians in a simulated perilous surgical procedure.  It was demonstrated that a measurable amount of the participants' anxiety about patient outcomes was related to previous (experimentally created) regret and worry and ultimately caused the physicians to be led by their feelings over any information or guidelines provided during the mock surgery.  Additionally, their emotional levels, adjusted along with the simulated patient status, suggest that anxiety level and the respective decision made are correlated with the type of bad outcome that was experienced in the earlier part of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua A. Hemmerich, Arthur S. Elstein, Margaret L. Schwarze, Elizabeth Ghini Moliski, William Dale, Risk as feelings in the effect of patient outcomes on physicians' future treatment decisions: A randomized trial and manipulation validation, Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine, Volume 75, Issue 2, July 2012, pp. 367–376, {{ISSN|0277-9536}}, 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.03.020.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another view of anxiety and decision-making is dispositional anxiety where emotional states, or [[mood (psychology)|moods]], are cognitive and provide information about future pitfalls and rewards (Maner and Schmidt, 2006).  When experiencing anxiety, individuals draw from personal judgments referred to as pessimistic outcome appraisals.  These emotions promote biases for risk avoidance and promote risk tolerance in decision-making.&lt;ref name="Jon_a" /&gt;

===Dread risk===
It is common for people to dread some risks but not others: They tend to be very afraid of epidemic diseases, nuclear power plant failures, and plane accidents but are relatively unconcerned about some highly frequent and deadly events, such as traffic crashes, household accidents, and medical errors. One key distinction of dreadful risks seems to be their potential for catastrophic consequences,&lt;ref name="Slovic P 1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slovic | first1 = P | year = 1987 | title = Perception of risk | journal = Science | volume = 236 | issue = 4799 | pages = 280–285 | doi=10.1126/science.3563507| bibcode = 1987Sci...236..280S }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatening to kill a large number of people within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer G (2004) Dread risk, 11 September, and fatal traffic accidents. Psych Sci 15:286−287.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, immediately after the 11 September attacks, many Americans were afraid to fly and took their car instead, a decision that led to a significant increase in the number of fatal crashes in the time period following the 9/11 event compared with the same time period before the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaissmaier | first1 = W. | last2 = Gigerenzer | first2 = G. | year = 2012 | title = 9/11, Act II: A fine-grained analysis of regional variations in traffic fatalities in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 1449–1454 | doi=10.1177/0956797612447804| pmid = 23160203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein S 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lichtenstein | first1 = S | last2 = Slovic | first2 = P | last3 = Fischhoff | first3 = B | last4 = Layman | first4 = M | last5 = Combs | first5 = B | year = 1978 | title = Judged frequency of lethal events | journal =  Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory| volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–578 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.4.6.551| hdl = 1794/22549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why people fear dread risks. First, the psychometric paradigm&lt;ref name="Slovic P 1987"/&gt; suggests that high lack of control, high catastrophic potential, and severe consequences account for the increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks. Second, because people estimate the frequency of a risk by recalling instances of its occurrence from their social circle or the media, they may overvalue relatively rare but dramatic risks because of their overpresence and undervalue frequent, less dramatic risks.&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein S 1978"/&gt; Third, according to the preparedness hypothesis, people are prone to fear events that have been particularly threatening to survival in human evolutionary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Öhman | first1 = A | last2 = Mineka | first2 = S | year = 2001 | title = Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning | journal = Psychol Rev | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 483–522 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.3.483| pmid = 11488376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that in most of human evolutionary history people lived in relatively small groups, rarely exceeding 100 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = KR | last2 = Walker | first2 = RS | last3 = Bozicevic | first3 = M | last4 = Eder | first4 = J | last5 = Headland | first5 = T | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Co-residence patterns in hunter-gatherer societies show unique human social structure | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6022 | pages = 1286–1289 | doi=10.1126/science.1199071| pmid = 21393537 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331.1286H }}&lt;/ref&gt; a dread risk, which kills many people at once, could potentially wipe out one's whole group. Indeed, research found&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galesic | first1 = M | last2 = Garcia-Retamero | first2 = R | year = 2012 | title = The risks we dread: A social circle account | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e32837 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032837| pmid = 22509250 | pmc = 3324481 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...732837G }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people's fear peaks for risks killing around 100 people but does not increase if larger groups are killed. Fourth, fearing dread risks can be an ecologically rational strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bodemer | first1 = N. | last2 = Ruggeri | first2 = A. | last3 = Galesic | first3 = M. | year = 2013 | title = When dread risks are more dreadful than continuous risks: Comparing cumulative population losses over time | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | page = e66544 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066544| pmid = 23840503 | pmc = 3694073 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...866544B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides killing a large number of people at a single point in time, dread risks reduce the number of children and young adults who would have potentially produced offspring. Accordingly, people are more concerned about risks killing younger, and hence more fertile, groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = XT | year = 1996 | title = Evolutionary hypotheses of risk-sensitive choice: Age differences and perspective change | journal = Ethol Sociobiol | volume = 17 | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00103-4| citeseerx = 10.1.1.201.816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety and judgmental accuracy===
The relationship between higher levels of risk perception and "judgmental accuracy" in anxious individuals remains unclear (Joseph I. Constans, 2001).  There is a chance that "judgmental accuracy" is correlated with heightened anxiety.  Constans conducted a study to examine how worry propensity (and current mood and trait anxiety) might influence college student's estimation of their performance on an upcoming exam, and the study found that worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias (errors in their risk assessments), even after variance attributable to current mood and trait anxiety had been removed.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt; Another experiment suggests that trait anxiety is associated with pessimistic risk appraisals (heightened perceptions of the probability and degree of suffering associated with a negative experience), while controlling for depression.&lt;ref name="Jon" /&gt;

==Other considerations==
===Risk and uncertainty===
In his seminal work ''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'', [[Frank Knight]] (1921) established the distinction between risk and uncertainty.
{{quote|... Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. The term "risk," as loosely used in everyday speech and in economic discussion, really covers two things which, functionally at least, in their causal relations to the phenomena of economic organization, are categorically different. ... The essential fact is that "risk" means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomenon depending on which of the two is really present and operating. ... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or "risk" proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We ... accordingly restrict the term "uncertainty" to cases of the non-quantitive type.:&lt;ref&gt;Frank Hyneman Knight "Risk, uncertainty and profit" pg. 19, Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Prize Essays, no. 31. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin. 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, [[Knightian uncertainty]] is immeasurable, not possible to calculate, while in the Knightian sense risk is measurable.

Another distinction between risk and uncertainty is proposed by Douglas Hubbard:&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hubbard "How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business" pg. 46, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Douglas Hubbard "The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009. Page 22 of https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066599/files/37549842/download?verifier=ar2VjVOxCU8sEQr23I5LEBpr89B6fnwmoJgBinqj&amp;wrap=1&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Uncertainty''': The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. The "true" outcome/state/result/value is not known.
:'''Measurement of uncertainty''': A set of probabilities assigned to a set of possibilities. Example: "There is a 60% chance this market will double in five years"
:'''Risk''': A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.
:'''Measurement of risk''': A set of possibilities each with quantified probabilities and quantified losses. Example: "There is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs".

In this sense, one may have uncertainty without risk but not risk without uncertainty. We can be uncertain about the winner of a contest, but unless we have some personal stake in it, we have no risk. If we bet money on the outcome of the contest, then we have a risk. In both cases there are more than one outcome. The measure of uncertainty refers only to the probabilities assigned to outcomes, while the measure of risk requires both probabilities for outcomes and losses quantified for outcomes.

===Risk attitude, appetite and tolerance===
{{Main|Risk aversion}}

The terms ''risk attitude'', ''appetite'', and ''tolerance'' are often used similarly to describe an organisation's or individual's attitude towards risk-taking. One's attitude may be described as ''risk-averse'', ''risk-neutral'', or ''risk-seeking''. Risk tolerance looks at acceptable/unacceptable deviations from what is expected.{{unclear inline|date=May 2017}} Risk appetite looks at how much risk one is willing to accept. There can still be deviations that are within a risk appetite. For example, recent research finds that insured individuals are significantly likely to divest from risky asset holdings in response to a decline in health, controlling for variables such as income, age, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_23.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Health and the Savings of Insured versus Uninsured, Working-Age Households in the U.S.'', November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambling is a risk-increasing investment, wherein money on hand is risked for a possible large return, but with the possibility of losing it all. Purchasing a lottery ticket is a very risky investment with a high chance of no return and a small chance of a very high return. In contrast, putting money in a bank at a defined rate of interest is a risk-averse action that gives a guaranteed return of a small gain and precludes other investments with possibly higher gain.  The possibility of getting no return on an investment is also known as the [[rate of ruin]].

===Risk as a vector quantity===
Hubbard also argues that defining risk as the product of impact and probability presumes, unrealistically, that decision-makers are [[risk-neutral]].&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA"/&gt; A risk-neutral person's utility is proportional to the [[expected value]] of the payoff. For example, a risk-neutral person would consider 20% chance of winning $1&amp;nbsp;million exactly as desirable as getting a certain $200,000. However, most decision-makers are not actually risk-neutral and would not consider these equivalent choices. This gave rise to [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]]. Hubbard proposes to instead describe risk as a [[Vector space|vector]] quantity that distinguishes the probability and magnitude of a risk. Risks are simply described as a set or function{{vague|date=May 2017}} of possible payoffs (gains or losses) with their associated probabilities. This array is collapsed into a scalar value according to a decision-maker's [[risk aversion|risk tolerance]].

'''Shenzhou 4''' ({{zh|c=神舟四号}})&amp;nbsp;– launched on December 29, 2002&amp;nbsp;– was the fourth unmanned launch of the Chinese [[Shenzhou spacecraft]]. Two dummy astronauts were used to test the life support systems. (A live astronaut was not used until ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' on October 15, 2003.)

The spacecraft was equipped for a manned flight, even featuring a [[sleeping bag]], [[food]], and [[medication]]. The windows were constructed of a new material that was designed to stay clear even after reentry to allow an astronaut to confirm that the [[parachute]]s have deployed properly. It was said that the spacecraft flown on ''Shenzhou 4'' had no major differences to that used on ''[[Shenzhou 5]]''. It flew with the ability for manual control and emergency landing, systems needed for a manned flight. A week before the launch, astronauts trained in the spacecraft to familiarise themselves with its systems.

Initially the spacecraft was in a {{convert|198|km}} by {{convert|331|km}} orbit inclined at 42.4°. This was raised to {{convert|330|km}} by {{convert|337|km}} at 23:35 UTC on December 29, 2002. On January 4 and January 5, 2003 several smaller manoeuvres were thought to have taken place. The rate of [[orbital decay]] seemed higher after January 1, suggesting that the orbital module's solar panels may have been deployed for the first time. Compared to ''[[Shenzhou 3]]'' the orbital period of ''Shenzhou 4'' was much more tightly bounded with smaller manoeuvres.

The launch of Shenzhou 4 was watched by officials including Chairman of the [[National People's Congress]] [[Li Peng]]; Vice Premier and member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] [[Wu Bangguo]]; [[Jia Qinglin]], also a member of the Standing Committee; [[Cao Gangchuan]], vice-chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]]; [[Song Jian]], vice-chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]]; and [[Li Jinai]], head of the General Armament Department of the [[People's Liberation Army]].

The spacecraft carried 100 [[peony]] [[seed]]s to investigate the effect of [[weightlessness]] on plants grown from them. The 52 experiments onboard investigated areas in [[physics]], [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[earth observation]], [[material science]], and [[astronomy]].

Four tracking ships were used for the mission&amp;nbsp;— one off the coast of South Africa in the South Atlantic Ocean, one in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia, one in the North Pacific Ocean south of Japan, and one in the South Pacific Ocean west of New Zealand.

The reentry module landed safely about {{convert|40|km}} from [[Hohhot]], [[Inner Mongolia]]. As with previous flights, the command for reentry to begin was given by a tracking ship off the coast of South Africa. It was thought before the flight that the Chinese would attempt a [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|water landing]] to test the emergency system but this did not happen. The orbital module remained in orbit until September 9, 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4960">'''Signal Corps Radios''' were [[U.S. Army]] military communications components that comprised "sets". Under the Army Nomenclature System, the abbreviation '''SCR''' initially designated "Set, Complete Radio", but was later misinterpreted as "Signal Corps Radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Getting the message through: A Branch History of the U.S. Army Signal Corps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noEBBvjbwVMC&amp;pg=PA172|year=1996|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-087281-5|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Scr300.png|thumb|right|200px|Example of a Signal Corps Radio set: the [[SCR-300]]-A]]

==Nomenclature==
The term SCR was part of a nomenclature system developed for the [[U.S. Signal Corps]], used at least as far back as [[World War I]]. Three-letter designators beginning with "SC" were used to denote complete systems, while one and two-letter designators (such as "BC", for basic component, "FT" for mounting, etc.) were used for components. Only a few system designators were used:

:::SCM   Set, Complete, Meteorological
:::SCR   Set, Complete, Radio
:::SCS   Set, Complete, System

==SCR radio sets==
The U.S. Signal Corps used the term "sets" to denote specific groupings of individual components such as transmitters, receivers, power supplies, handsets, cases, and antennas.  SCR radio sets ranged from the relatively small [[SCR-536]] "handie talkie" to high-powered, truck-mounted mobile communications systems like the [[SCR-299]] and large [[microwave radar]] systems such as the [[SCR-584 radar]].

==SCS==
The SCS designator was applied to groups of SCR-numbered sets comprising an extensive system, such as multiple radio sets employed in a ground-based fighter direction/control center.  The SCR designator could be a single transmitting or receiving set, or a full set of both transmitting and receiving equipment.

==Additional Designators==
An additional designator, "RC" was used for subsystems or groups of accessories. The [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System]] which came into use in 1943 absorbed or superseded the SC designations.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mote|first1=Ray|title=World War Two Nomenclature Systems|url=http://www.hypertools.com/nomenclature.html|publisher=Electric Radio Magazine, June/July 1995|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCR communication radios by branch use==
This is only a general list, quite a few radios crossed over between branches.&lt;ref name=TM11227&gt;{{cite web|title=TM 11-227 RADIO COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT APRIL 1944|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/246660060/TM-11-227-RADIO-COMMUNICATION-EQUIPMENT-APRIL-1944|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir David's long-beaked echidna''' (''Zaglossus attenboroughi''), also known as '''Attenborough's long-beaked echidna''' or the '''Cyclops long-beaked echidna''', is one of the three species from the genus ''[[Zaglossus]]'' that occurs in [[New Guinea]]. It is named in honour of Sir [[David Attenborough]], an eminent [[naturalist]]. It lives in the [[Cyclops Mountains]], which are near the cities of [[Sentani (town)|Sentani]] and [[Jayapura]] in the Indonesian province of [[Western New Guinea|Papua]].

==Description==
It is the smallest member of the genus, being closer in size to the [[short-beaked echidna]]. The male is larger than the female, and can be differentiated by the spurs on its hind legs.

The echidna is not a social animal, and comes together with its own kind only once a year, in July, to mate. The female will lay the eggs after about eight days, and the babies will stay in the mother's pouch for around eight weeks or until their spines develop.

Subsequent systematic revision of Zaglossus by Flannery &amp; Groves (1998) identified three allopatric species and several subspecies occurring across the island, and these authors erected the new species Z. attenboroughi (Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna) to describe a single echidna specimen (Plate 1) collected in 1961 at 1,600 m near the top of Mount Rara, in the Cyclops Mountains of northern Dutch New Guinea (now the Indonesian province of Papua).

==Conservation==
The species was described from a single damaged specimen collected in the Dutch colonial era (c. 1961), and has apparently not been collected since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flannery | first = T.F. | author2 = C.P.

However, biological surveys of Papua province are notoriously incomplete; it is possible that the animal still exists there or in related mountain ranges. The echidna is endangered by hunting and [[habitat loss]]. In fact, in the 1900s, it was thought to be [[extinct]] until some of their "nose pokes" were found in the mountains of New Guinea. These "nose pokes" are very distinct and represent the echidna's feeding techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=2&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of this hardy-built animal consists of [[earthworm]]s, [[termite]]s, insect larvae and [[ant]]s. This animal is so high in the endangered-species list that locals are being educated on this creature and asked to stop their tradition of hunting and killing it and sharing it with rivals as a peace offering.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070718-echidna.html&lt;/ref&gt; As reported on July 15, 2007, researchers from [[EDGE of Existence programme|EDGE]] visiting Papua's Cyclops Mountains had recently discovered [[burrow]]s and tracks thought to be those of ''Zaglossus attenboroughi''.

The organization's mission is to "bring rigorous, credible scholarship to political, social and economic questions"  through a collegiality of Catholic scholars, professors, researchers, practitioners, and writers who "approach their work in both a scholarly and evangelical spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicsocialscientists.org/Content/Organization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201234009/http://www.catholicsocialscientists.org/Content/Organization/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-01|title=index.asp|website=www.catholicsocialscientists.org|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization publishes the Catholic Social Science Review - an interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal of original articles and reviews in the social sciences and the humanities.

They are expected to strictly observe the highest scholarly and professional requirements of their disciplines as they examine their data in light of Church teaching and the Natural Law. In this way, the Society seeks to obtain objective knowledge about the social order, provide solutions to vexing social problems, and further the cause of Christ.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1979-80 unmanned Soviet space flight, a test flight of a new [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] craft which docked with the orbiting [[Salyut 6]] [[space station]].

*Launched: 16 December 1979
*Landed: 25 March 1980

==Mission highlights==

Four months had passed since the last Salyut 6 crew ([[Soyuz 32]]) had landed, and since the same amount of time had passed between the previous space station's long-duration crews, a December 1979 launch was considered a real possibility by observers. However, though the secretive Soviets did launch a craft that month, it was not what observers expected.&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

Soyuz T-1 was launched 16 December, and was the fourth unmanned test flight of a modified version of the Soyuz spacecraft, the first to be given a "Soyuz" designation.&lt;ref name=newkirk&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Newkirk

 | year=   1990

 | location = Houston, Texas 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, it approached the space station, but overshot it. A second dock attempt was made 19 December, and Soyuz T-1 successfully docked at the forward port.&lt;ref name=newkirk/&gt;

The Soyuz lifted the orbit of the space station on 25 December and remained docked to it for 95 days, during which time the station remained unoccupied. It undocked on 23 March 1980, performed several days of tests, then was de-orbited 25 March.&lt;ref name=newkirk/&gt; The landing date was outside a normal landing window as the craft was being flight-rated over the standard two-and-a-half months and the Soviets were planning to launch [[Soyuz 35]] during the next launch window in April.&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

The mission was unusual for several reasons. Unlike other previous long unmanned missions, Soyuz T-1 was not powered down while docked to the space station. And, its recovery saw a change from the norm as well. Previous Soyuz missions saw the entire spacecraft de-orbit. But with the Soyuz T craft, the orbital module was separated prior to retro-fire, to save propellant. This allowed for more maneuvers prior to de-orbit.&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

'''Technopolis''' is a [[Flanders|Flemish]] technology education centre located near [[Mechelen]].

==Flanders Technology International==
Technopolis is an initiative which grew out of the '''Flanders Technology International''' (FTI) Foundation, which was an initiative of the [[Flemish government]]. Since 7 October 1999, the FTI offices are located within the premises of the Technopolis centre and the name of the organization was changed to Technopolis. The goal of the organization is to stimulate [[biotechnology]] and micro-electronics, and to increase the visibility of science in [[Flanders]].

==Exhibition==
The Technopolis [[science museum]] was founded on 26 February 2000. It has a permanent interactive (hands-on) exhibition for [[science]] and [[technology]] on display.

'''''The Probability Broach''''' is a 1979 novel by American [[science fiction]] writer [[L. Neil Smith]]. It is set in an [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]], the so-called [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatin]] Universe, where a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] society has formed on the [[North American]] continent, styled the [[North American Confederacy]] (''NAC''). This history was created when the [[Declaration of Independence]] has the word ''unanimous'' added to the preamble, to read that governments "derive their just power from the ''unanimous'' [[consent of the governed]]".

==Plot summary==
Edward William "Win" Bear is a [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] who works for the [[Denver Police Department]] in a version of the [[United States]] in an alternate history of 1987 to be controlled by an anti-business, [[ecofascism|ecofascist]] faction complete with a new police force created in 1984 called the Federal Security Police (FSP, or "SecPol" as it is more commonly known) reminiscent of the [[Gestapo]]. [[Henry M. Jackson]] is [[President of the United States|president]], citizens' freedoms are very limited, and many laws and regulations have been passed. Examples include [[hoarding]] precious metals, such as silver and gold, is illegal and due to strict [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control policies]], only the police and citizens with federal permits are allowed to carry guns.

Bear is called to investigate the unusual murder of physicist Vaughn Meiss; he eventually finds himself projected into the [[North American Confederacy]] by means of the "Probability Broach", an inter-dimensional conduit originally developed as a means for [[interstellar travel]] in the North American Confederacy by a [[bottlenose dolphin]] physicist, named Ooloorie Eckickeck P'Wheet, and her human compatriot, Dr. Dora Jayne Thorens.

Win encounters his NAC counterpart, Edward William "Ed" Bear, and Ed's neighbors, most notably the "healer" Clarissa Olson and Lucy Kropotkin, who is later revealed to be 135 years old. Lucy's life becomes the vantage point by which Win is acclimated to life in the NAC and Laporte, the NAC equivalent to Denver. Win and Ed unravel the mystery of the Meiss murder and learn that he was killed to hide an effort by SecPol to conquer the NAC with the help of [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] forces on the NAC side, led by John Jay Madison, a.k.a. the infamous [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] expatriate and 1918 war hero [[Manfred von Richthofen]], known here as the Red Knight of Prussia. Win, Ed, Lucy and Clarissa lead the effort to notify the nascent NAC government of the threat. En route to the meeting of the [[Continental Congress]], Ed and Clarissa are kidnapped, leaving Win and Lucy to reveal the plot.

After fighting (and winning) a duel with a SecPol agent, Win and Lucy rescue their friends and track Madison and the Hamiltonians to a small town outside Laporte. Win sets off an explosion that eliminates all of the Hamiltonians.

Win elects to remain in the NAC and marries Clarissa. Ed marries Lucy, who at the time of the story is awaiting a delayed "regeneration" because of an accident involving massive radiation exposure, and they then set out for the asteroid belt to build a new life for themselves on the NAC frontier.

The Continental Congress agrees to begin a massive propaganda campaign to force Win's United States (and the rest of the globe) toward a similar [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatinist]] revolution.

==Awards==
''The Probability Broach'' won the 1982 [[Prometheus Award]], which L. Neil Smith himself had created, and which is awarded by the Libertarian Futurist Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfs.org/awards.htm Prometheus Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

He conceived of the idea during the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']] while still in South America, before he had seen a coral island, and wrote it out as [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]]'s orders from the [[Admiralty]] included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Keeling Islands]] in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] and [[subsidence]] of vast areas of the Earth's [[Oceanic crust|crust]] under the oceans.&lt;ref name=cr&gt;{{citation|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_CoralReefs.html |title=Introduction to Coral reefs |author=Gordon Chancellor |year=2008 |publisher=Darwin Online |accessdate=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was the first volume of three Darwin wrote about the geology he had investigated during the voyage, and was widely recognised as a major scientific work that presented his deductions from all the available observations on this large subject.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; In 1853, Darwin was awarded the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal for the monograph and for his work on [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref name=b509&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory that coral reefs formed as the islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided has been supported by modern investigations, and is no longer disputed, while the cause of the subsidence and uplift of areas of crust has continued to be a subject of discussion.&lt;ref name=r524&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|1982|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A320&amp;pageseq=6 524]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of coral atoll formation==

When the ''Beagle'' set out in 1831, the formation of [[coral]] [[atoll]]s was a scientific puzzle. Advance notice of her sailing, given in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' of 24 December, described investigation of this topic as "the most interesting part of the ''Beagle'''s survey" with the prospect of "many points for investigation of a scientific nature beyond the mere occupation of the surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824 and 1825, French naturalists [[Jean René Constant Quoy|Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard|Gaimard]] had observed that the coral [[organisms]] lived at relatively shallow depths, but the islands appeared in deep oceans. In books that were taken on the ''Beagle'' as references, [[Henry De la Beche]], [[Frederick William Beechey]] and [[Charles Lyell]] had published the opinion that the coral had grown on underwater mountains or volcanoes, with atolls taking the shape of underlying [[volcanic crater]]s.&lt;ref name=herb186&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=28 186–190]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Admiralty]] instructions for the voyage stated:
{{quote|The circularly-formed Coral Islands in the Pacific occasionally afford excellent land-locked harbours, with a sufficient entrance, and would be well adapted to any nice astronomical observations which might require to be carried on in undisturbed tranquillity. While these are quietly proceeding, and the chronometers rating, a very interesting inquiry might be instituted respecting the formation of these coral reefs&amp;nbsp;.... A modern and very plausible theory has been put forward, that these wonderful formations, instead of ascending from the bottom of the sea, have been raised from the summits of extinct volcanoes&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=instructs&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=61 38–39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1827, Darwin learnt about [[marine invertebrate]]s while assisting the investigations of the [[anatomy|anatomist]] [[Robert Edmond Grant]], and during his last year at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1831, he had studied geology under [[Adam Sedgwick]]. So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the ''Beagle'' expedition, as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy's aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while the ship's complement carried out its [[hydrographic survey]]. FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell's ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' before they left. On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St Jago]] island in January 1832, Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell's [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time, and thought that he could write his own book on geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{citation|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_GeologyOfBeagle.html |title=Geology of The Voyage of The Beagle |author=Freeman, R.

While the ''Beagle'' surveyed the coasts of South America from February 1832 to September 1835, Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising. After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship, he experienced the [[1835 Concepción earthquake]]. In the following months he speculated that as the land was [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]], large areas of the ocean bed [[subsidence|subsided]]. It struck him that this could explain the formation of atolls.&lt;ref name=herb186/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=100 98–99]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Santiago&gt;{{citation|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.18.html |title='State this with clearness': an introduction to the Santiago Notebook |author=Gordon Chancellor |author2=John van Wyhe |publisher=Darwin Online |date=August 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's theory followed from his understanding that coral [[polyp]]s thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where the level of the underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

==Darwin's investigations to test his theory==
[[File:Papeete - Lagon.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Hills sloping down to a lagoon with boats at anchor; the lagoon is sheltered by a wide shallow coral reef from the breaking waves of the ocean.|Darwin saw the coral reef and lagoon around [[Tahiti]].]]
By the time that the ''Beagle'' set out for the [[Galápagos Islands]] on 7 September 1835, Darwin had thought out the essentials of his theory of atoll formation. While he no longer favoured the concept that atolls formed on submerged volcanos, he noted some points on these islands which supported that idea: 16 volcanic craters resembled atolls in being raised slightly more on one side, and five hills appeared roughly equal in height. He then considered a topic which was compatible with either theory, the lack of coral reefs around the Galápagos Islands. One possibility was a lack of [[calcareous]] matter around the islands, but his main proposal, which FitzRoy had suggested to him, was that the seas were too cold. As they sailed on, Darwin took note of the records of sea temperature kept in the ship's "Weather Journal".&lt;ref name=herb188&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=30 188–190]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had his first glimpse of coral atolls as they passed [[Puka-Puka|Honden Island]] on 9 November and sailed on through the Low or Dangerous Archipelago ([[Tuamotus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=396 364–378]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at [[Tahiti]] on 15 November, Darwin saw it "encircled by a Coral reef separated from the shore by channels &amp; basins of still water".&lt;ref name=s2&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1835|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He climbed the hills of Tahiti, and was strongly impressed by the sight across to the island of [[Moorea|Eimeo]], where "The mountains abruptly rise out of a glassy lake, which is separated on all sides, by a narrow defined line of breakers, from the open sea. – Remove the central group of mountains, &amp; there remains a Lagoon Isd." Rather than recording his findings about the coral reefs in his notes about the island, he wrote them up as the first full draft of his theory, an essay titled ''Coral Islands'', dated 1835. They left Tahiti on 3 December, and Darwin probably wrote his essay as they sailed towards New Zealand where they arrived on 21 December. He described the [[polyp]] species building the coral on the barrier wall, flourishing in the heavy surf of breaking waves particularly on the windward side, and speculated on reasons that corals in the calm lagoon did not grow so high. He concluded with a "remark that the general horizontal uplifting which I have proved has &amp; is now raising upwards the greater part of S. America &amp; as it would appear likewise of N. America, would of necessity be compensated by an equal subsidence in some other part of the world."&lt;ref name=herb188/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1835|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1576&amp;pageseq=16 12–17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keeling Islands===

Below is a cross section showing steep sided reefs enclosing a shallow lagoon.|An 1889 map of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Keeling Islands]] based on the Admiralty Chart includes a section across the atoll showing the steep slopes FitzRoy's soundings found outside the reef.]]

FitzRoy's instructions set detailed requirements for geological survey of a circular [[coral]] [[atoll]] to investigate how [[coral reef]]s formed, particularly if they rose from the bottom of the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of [[tide]]s by measurement with specially constructed gauges.&lt;ref name=instructs/&gt; FitzRoy chose the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Keeling Islands]] in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous [[Sounding line|soundings]] to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with [[tallow]] hardened with [[Lime (material)|lime]]; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=748 629–637].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These soundings were taken personally by FitzRoy, and the tallow from each sounding was cut off and taken on board to be examined by Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F271&amp;pageseq=25 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impressions taken on the steep outside slope of the reef were marked with the shapes of living corals, and otherwise were clean down to about 10&amp;nbsp;[[fathom]]s (18&amp;nbsp;m); then at increasing depths, the tallow showed fewer such impressions and collected more grains of sand until it was evident that there were no living corals below about 20–30&amp;nbsp;[[fathom]]s (36–55&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F14&amp;pageseq=480 467–468].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin carefully noted the location of the different types of coral around the reef and in the lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F271&amp;pageseq=23 5–17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his diary, he described, "examining the very interesting yet simple structure &amp; origin of these islands. The water being unusually smooth, I waded in as far as the living mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks. In some of the gullies &amp; hollows, there were beautiful green &amp; other colored fishes, &amp; the forms &amp; tints of many of the Zoophites were admirable. It is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of organic beings with which the sea of the tropics, so prodigal of life, teems", though he cautioned against the "rather exuberant language" used by some naturalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=445  413–419].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they left the islands after eleven days, Darwin wrote out a summary of his theory in his diary: {{quote|Throughout the whole group of Islands, every single atom, even from the most minute particle to large fragments of rocks, bear the stamp of once having been subjected to the power of organic arrangement. Capt. FitzRoy at the distance of but little more than a mile from the shore sounded with a line 7200 feet long, &amp; found no bottom. Hence we must consider this Isld as the summit of a lofty mountain; to how great a depth or thickness the work of the Coral animal extends is quite uncertain.... Under this view, we must look at a Lagoon Isd as a monument raised by myriads of tiny architects, to mark the spot where a former land lies buried in the depths of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=450 418].}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Publication of theory==
When the ''Beagle'' returned on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 [[University of Cambridge]] Professor of Botany [[John Stevens Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835b|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May wrote to [[John Herschel]] that he was "very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first, for it accounted for so much... the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=344 324–325]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 31 May 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's first literary project was his ''Journal and Remarks'' on the [[natural history]] of the expedition, now known as ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how the presence or absence of coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.3&amp;pageseq=572 553–569]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about [[transmutation of species]], and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.&lt;ref name=pj13&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2006|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1–76&amp;pageseq=23 13 recto, 1837 – verso, 1838]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tasks included finding experts to examine and report on his collections from the voyage. Darwin proposed to edit these reports, writing his own forewords and notes, and used his contacts to lobby for government sponsorship of publication of these findings as a large book. When a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|£]]1,000 was allocated at the end of August 1837, Darwin stretched the project to include the geology book that he had conceived in April 1832 at the first landfall in the voyage. He selected [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] as the publisher, and gave them unrealistic commitments on the timing of providing the text and illustrations. He assured the Treasury that the work would be good value, as the publisher would only require a small commission profit, and he himself would have no profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=186, 367–369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter378a&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-378a.html |title= Letter 378a – Darwin, C.

Beagle]]'' on his collections, and began writing about the geology of volcanic islands.&lt;ref name=pj13/&gt;

In January 1838, Smith, Elder &amp; Co. advertised the first part of Darwin's geology book, ''Geological observations on volcanic islands and coral formations'', as a single octavo volume to be published that year. By the end of the month Darwin thought that his geology was "covering so much paper, &amp; will take so much time" that it could be split into separate volumes (eventually ''Coral reefs'' was published first, followed by ''Volcanic islands'' in 1844, and ''South America'' in 1846). He also doubted that the treasury funds could cover all the geological writings. The first part of the zoology was published in February 1838, but Darwin found it a struggle to get the experts to produce their reports on his collections, and overwork led to illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter400&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-400.html |title= Letter 400 – Darwin, C. R. to Henslow, J. S., (21 Jan 1838) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a break to visit Scotland, he wrote up a major paper on the geological "roads" of [[Glen Roy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=381–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 1838 he noted in his diary, "Began Coral Paper: requires much reading".&lt;ref name=pj15&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2006|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1–76&amp;pageseq=28 15 verso, 1838]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1838 Darwin proposed to his cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], and they married in January 1839. As well as his other projects he continued to work on his ideas of [[evolution]] as his "prime hobby", but repeated delays were caused by [[Charles Darwin's illness|his illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=10 186–187]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sporadically restarted work on ''Coral Reefs'', and on 9 May 1842 wrote to Emma, telling her he was {{quote|gloomy &amp; tired— the government money has gone much quicker than I thought &amp; the expences of the coral-volume are greater being, as far as we can judge from 130£ to 140£.— How I am publish the remainder I know not, without taking 2 or 300£ out of the funds—&amp; what will you say to that.— I am stomachy &amp;  be blue deviled— I am daily growing very very old, very very cold &amp; I daresay very sly.

===Publication and subsequent editions===
''The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs'' was published in May 1842, priced at 15 [[shilling]]s, and was well received. A second edition was published in 1874, extensively revised and rewritten to take into account [[James Dwight Dana]]'s 1872 publication ''Corals and Coral Islands'', and work by [[Joseph Jukes]].&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure of book===
The book has a tightly logical structure, and presents a bold argument. Illustrations are used as an integral part of the argument, with numerous detailed charts and one large world map marked in colour showing all reefs known at that time. A brief introduction sets out the aims of the book.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

[[File:Coral reefs in papua new guinea.JPG|thumb|alt=underwater view of fish swimming around diverse corals.|The first chapters of the book describe the kinds of corals forming each part of the various types of reef.]]
The first three chapters describe the various types of [[coral reef]], each chapter starting with a section giving a detailed description of the reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes [[atoll]]s and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the ''Beagle'' survey findings on the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Keeling Islands]]. The second chapter similarly describes a typical [[Coral reef#Types|barrier reef]] then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.&lt;ref name=recap/&gt;

The fourth chapter on the distribution and growth of coral reefs examines the conditions in which they flourish, their rate of growth and the depths at which the reef building [[polyp]]s can live, showing that they can only flourish at a very limited depth. In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F271&amp;pageseq=116 98–118]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth chapter he examines the geographical distribution of types of reef and its geological implications, using the large coloured map of the world to show vast areas of atolls and barrier reefs where the ocean bed was subsiding with no active volcanos, and vast areas with fringing reefs and volcanic outbursts where the land was rising. This chapter ends with a recapitulation which summarises the findings of each chapter and concludes by describing the global image as "a magnificent and harmonious picture of the movements, which the crust of the earth has within a late period undergone".&lt;ref name=recap&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F271&amp;pageseq=164 147–148]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large appendix gives a detailed and exhaustive description of all the information he had been able to obtain on the reefs of the world.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

This logical structure can be seen as a prototype for the organisation of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', presenting the detail of various aspects of the problem, then setting out a theory explaining the phenomena, followed by a demonstration of the wider explanatory power of the theory. Unlike the ''Origin'' which was hurriedly put together as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his planned "big book", ''Coral Reefs'' is fully supported by citations and material gathered together in the Appendix. ''Coral Reefs'' is arguably the first volume of Darwin's huge treatise on his philosophy of nature, like his succeeding works showing how slow gradual change can account for the history of life. In presenting types of reef as an evolutionary series it demonstrated a rigorous methodology for historical sciences, interpreting patterns visible in the present as the results of history. In one passage he presents a particularly [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] view of a struggle for survival – "In an old-standing reef, the corals, which are so different in kind on different parts of it, are probably all adapted to the stations they occupy, and hold their places, like other organic beings, by a struggle one with another, and with external nature; hence we may infer that their growth would generally be slow, except under peculiarly favourable circumstances."&lt;ref name=cr/&gt;

===Reception===
Having successfully completed and published the other books on the geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of [[barnacle]]s. Two volumes on ''Lepadidae'' ([[goose barnacle]]s) were published in 1851. While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles, Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the [[Royal Society]] had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] wrote telling him that "Pordock proposed you for the Coral Islands &amp; Lepadidae, Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone, &amp; then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles that you would have [smiled] to hear."&lt;ref name=b509/&gt;

===Late 19th Century controversy and tests of the theory===
A major scientific controversy over the origin of coral reefs took place in the late 19th Century, between supporters of Darwin's theory (such as the American geologist [[James Dwight Dana]], who early in his career had seen coral reefs in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838–42 [[United States Exploring Expedition]]), and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer [[John Murray (oceanographer)|John Murray]], who participated in the 1872–76 [[Challenger expedition]]. Murray's theory challenged Darwin's notion of subsidence, proposing instead that coral reefs formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals. Amongst Murray's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist [[Alexander Emanuel Agassiz|Alexander Agassiz]], who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine coral reefs in search of evidence to support Murray's theory, and to discredit Darwin.&lt;ref name="Dobbs"&gt;Dobbs, D. (2005): ''Reef Madness: Charles Darwin, Alexander Agassiz, and the Meaning of Coral''. Pantheon Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-375-42161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of expeditions to test Darwin's theory by drilling on [[Funafuti]] atoll in the Ellice Islands (now part of [[Tuvalu]]) was conducted by the [[Royal Society of London]] for the purpose of investigating whether basalt or traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898, attaining a final depth of {{convert|1114|ft|6|in|m}}, still in coral. Professor [[Edgeworth David]] of the [[University of Sydney]] was a member of the 1896 expedition and leader of the 1897 expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Branagan, D.F. (2005): ''T.W. Edgeworth David: A Life: Geologist, Adventurer and "Knight in the Old Brown Hat"'', National Library of Australia, Canberra, pp. 85–105. {{ISBN|0 642 10791 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David, Mrs Edgeworth, ''Funafuti or Three Months On A Coral Atoll: an unscientific account of a scientific expedition'', London: John Murray, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; At the time these results were regarded as inconclusive and it was not until the 1950s when, prior to carrying out nuclear bomb tests on [[Enewetak Atoll|Eniwetok]], deep exploratory drilling through {{convert|4200|ft|m}} of coral to the underlying basalt finally vindicated Darwin's theory.&lt;ref name="Dobbs" /&gt; However, the geologic history of atolls is more complex than Darwin (1842) and Davis (1920 &amp; 1928) envisioned.&lt;ref name="WRD"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=|last1= Dickinson |first1=William R. |title= Pacific Atoll Living: How Long Already and Until When?|url= http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/19/3/pdf/i1052-5173-19-3-4.pdf|year= 2009 |journal= GSA Today |volume=19|issue=3|pages=4–10 |doi=10.1130/gsatg35a.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Darwin's findings and modern views==
Darwin's interest on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, he was looking for confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's [[sounding line|soundings]] at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20&amp;nbsp;fathoms (37&amp;nbsp;m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30&amp;nbsp;fathoms (55&amp;nbsp;m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100&amp;nbsp;m, still a small fraction of the depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000&amp;nbsp;m. Darwin recognised the importance of [[red algae]], and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.&lt;ref name=rosen520&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|1982|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A320&amp;pageseq=2 520–524]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bicolor parrotfish.JPG|thumb|left|alt=a large bright blue fish with its scales and tailfin outlined in red, swimming above intricate corals.|Darwin's investigations showed how coral eating organisms such as [[parrotfish]] controlled the growth of coral, and formed mudbanks.]]
In assessing the geology of the reef, Darwin showed his remarkable ability to collect facts and find patterns to reconstruct geological history on the basis of the very limited evidence available. He gave attention to the smallest detail. Having heard that [[parrotfish]] browsed on the living coral, he dissected specimens to find finely ground coral in their intestines. He concluded that such fish, and coral eating invertebrates such as [[Holothuroidea]], could account for the banks of fine grained mud he found at the Keeling Islands; it showed also "that there are living checks to the growth of coral-reefs, and that the almost universal law of 'consume and be consumed,' holds good even with the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks, which are able to withstand the force of the open ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1842|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F271&amp;pageseq=32 14–15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His observations on the part played by organisms in the formation of the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft (1,500&amp;nbsp;m), as the first test bores conducted by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] on [[Enewetak]] Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610&amp;nbsp;ft (1,405&amp;nbsp;m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by [[Tectonics|tectonic movements]], but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft (1,000&amp;nbsp;m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that [[glaciers|glacial]] effects can cause changes in sea level.&lt;ref name=rosen520/&gt;

In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast areas where the seabed was being elevated were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge areas where the ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern [[plate tectonics]], which he did not anticipate.&lt;ref name=rosen520/&gt;

The '''UKRC''' ('''UK Resource Centre''') is a UK organisation for the provision of advice, services and policy consultation regarding the under-representation of women in science, engineering, technology and the built environment (SET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theukrc.org/ |title=Welcome to |publisher=The UKRC |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is funded by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and was launched in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/science/science-and-society/stem-skills/diversity-in-science/women-in-science |title=The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |publisher=Bis.gov.uk |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central base is located in [[Bradford]] in the North of England but there are also centres in South East England, South Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theukrc.org/about-us |title=About us |publisher=The Ukrc |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129034550/http://www.theukrc.org/about-us |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UKRC works to promote gender equality in SET with employers and professional bodies; education institutions; women's organisations and networks; policy institutes; sector skills councils; the government and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/diversity/ukrc.htm |title=The UK Resource Centre (UKRC) for Women in SET |publisher=Raeng.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes implementing the [[Athena SWAN]] Charter.

In 2011 it took over the leadership of the [[WISE Campaign]] and became UKRC-WISE. In late 2012 it took on the WISE name.

| [[Oslo Report]]
|{{sort|UK|}}[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|20px]] German scientist [[Hans Ferdinand Mayer]] anonymously sent information and a sample of German technology to the British embassy in Oslo.

'''Vacuum cooling''' is known to be the most rapid [[cooling]] technique{{cn|date=October 2016}} for any [[porous]] product which has free water and works on the principle of [[evaporative cooling]]. Vacuum cooling is generally used for cooling food products having a high water content and large porosities, due to its efficacy in losing water from both within and outside the products. This is the most widely used  technique for rapid cooling of food product which has been proven to be one of the most efficient and economical method of cooling and storage of vegetables, fruits, flowers &amp; more.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 

This cooling technology not only strongly improves the  product quality, but also increases the [[shelf life]] of product and at the same time it reduces the cooling costs compared to the conventional cooling method available.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Principle==
The technology is based on the phenomenon that as the [[vapour pressure]] on a liquid reduces, its [[boiling point]] reduces. The boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the external pressure.  When the pressure above a liquid is reduced, the vapour pressure needed to induce boiling is also reduced, and the boiling point of the liquid decreases. By reducing pressure we can even boil off water at lower temperatures. This rapid evaporation of moisture from the surface and within the products due to the low surrounding pressure, absorbs the necessary [[latent heat]] for [[Phase transition|phase change]] from the product itself. This latent heat required for evaporation is obtained  mostly from the [[sensible heat]] of the product and  as a consequence of this evaporation the temperature of the product falls and the product can be cooled down to its desired [[storage temperature]].

==Process==
An airtight  chamber is maintained by removing air from the inside of the chamber using a [[vacuum pump]]. The products to be cooled are kept in that airtight chamber. As the pressure is reduced the boiling point of water reduces and water starts to evaporate, taking the heat from the product. As a consequence of this evaporation the product temperature begins to decrease. This cooling process of the products continues until it reaches the desired product temperature.

For maintaining steady cooling process, it is necessary to evacuate the chamber continuously.

Other factors that determine the cooling process are surface area of product, available for [[heat transfer]] and also the product sensitivity during losing water.

==Advantages==
As the product is cooled uniformly throughout the body without any temperature gradient in the body, the shelf life of the product increases.

==Disadvantage==
Sometimes excess moisture loss during the cooling process will deteriorate the product quality and therefore there is a limit to the cooling process. This problem is to be taken care of by maintaining the required pressure, temperature and time of cooling.

{{JFKseries}}
"'''We choose to go to the Moon'''" is the famous [[tagline]] of a speech about the effort to reach the [[Moon]] delivered by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] to a large crowd gathered at [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] on September 12, 1962. The speech was intended to persuade the American people to support the [[Apollo program]], the national effort to [[Moon landing|land a man on the Moon]].

In his speech, Kennedy characterized space as a new frontier, invoking the pioneer spirit that dominated American folklore. He infused the speech with a sense of urgency and destiny, and emphasized the freedom enjoyed by Americans to choose their destiny rather than have it chosen for them. Although he called for competition with the [[Soviet Union]], he also proposed making the Moon landing a joint project.

The speech resonated widely and is still remembered, although at the time there was disquiet about the cost and value of the Moon-landing effort. Kennedy's goal was posthumously realized in July 1969, with the successful [[Apollo 11]] mission.

==Background==
When [[John F. Kennedy]] became [[President of the United States]] in January 1961, many Americans perceived that the United States was losing the [[Space Race]] with the [[Soviet Union]], which had successfully launched the first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], almost four years earlier. The perception increased when, on April 12, 1961, Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first man in space before the U.S. could launch its first [[Project Mercury]] astronaut.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=29}} American prestige was further damaged by the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] fiasco five days later.{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|p=109}}{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=209}}

Convinced of the political need for an achievement which would decisively demonstrate America's space superiority, Kennedy asked his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], in his role as chairman of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Council]], to identify such an achievement. He specifically asked him to investigate whether the United States could beat the Soviet Union in putting a laboratory in space, or orbiting a man around the Moon, or landing a man on the Moon, and to find out what such a project would cost. Johnson consulted with officials of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). Its new [[List of Administrators and Deputy Administrators of NASA|Administrator]], [[James E. Webb]], told him that there was no chance of beating the Russians to launching a space station, and it was uncertain as to whether NASA could orbit a man around the Moon first, so the best option would be to attempt to land a man on the Moon. This would also be the most expensive option; Webb believed it would require $22 billion to achieve it by 1970. Johnson also consulted with [[Wernher von Braun]]; military leaders, including [[Lieutenant General]] Bernard Schriever; and three captains of industry: [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] from [[CBS]], [[Donald C. Cook]] from [[American Electric Power]], and [[George R. Brown]] from [[Brown &amp; Root]].{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|pp=109–112}} 

Kennedy stood before Congress on May 25, 1961, and proposed that the US "should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Excerpt from the 'Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs' |publisher=NASA |date=May 24, 2004 |access-date=May 24, 2015 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/jfk_speech_text.html#.VWIGJ0_tmkp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone was impressed; a [[Gallup Poll]] indicated that 58 percent of Americans were opposed.{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|pp=109–112}} 

Kennedy's goal gave a specific mission to NASA's [[Apollo program]]. This required the expansion of NASA's [[Space Task Group]] into a [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]]. [[Houston]], Texas was chosen as the site, and the [[Humble Oil|Humble Oil and Refining Company]] donated the land during 1961, with [[Rice University]] as an intermediary.{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|p=162}} Kennedy took a two-day visit to Houston in September 1962 to view the new facility. He was escorted by astronauts [[Scott Carpenter]] and [[John Glenn]], and shown models of the [[Gemini spacecraft|Gemini]] and [[Apollo spacecraft]]; he also viewed the [[Mercury spacecraft]], in which Glenn had made America's first orbital flight. He took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a speech to drum up support for the nation's space effort.{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=211}}&lt;ref name="The Rice Thresher"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/49181/rt050i01.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |access-date=March 11, 2018 |title='Visiting Professor' Kennedy Pushes Space Age Spending |first=Eugene |last=Keilen |date=September 19, 1962 |newspaper=The Rice Thresher |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech delivery==
[[File:President Kennedy speech on the space effort at Rice University, September 12, 1962.ogv|thumb|Kennedy's speech on the nation's space effort delivered at Rice Stadium on September 12, 1962 (17m 28s)]]
On September 12, 1962, a warm and sunny day, President Kennedy delivered his speech before a crowd of 40,000 people in the [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice University football stadium]], many of them school children.&lt;ref name="The Rice Thresher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt; The middle portion of the speech has been widely quoted, and reads as follows:
{{quote|We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.

There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, [[Transatlantic flight|fly the Atlantic]]?  Why does Rice play Texas?

We choose to go to the Moon!  We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{cite web|title=John F. Kennedy Moon Speech – Rice Stadium |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 19, 2018| url=https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The joke referring to the [[Rice–Texas football rivalry]] was handwritten by Kennedy into the speech text,&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.rice.edu/2012/08/30/jfks-1962-moon-speech-still-appeals-50-years-later/  |title=JFK’s 1962 Moon Speech Still Appeals 50 Years Later |first=Jade |last=Boyd |date=August 30, 2012 |publisher=Rice University |access-date=March 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the part of the speech remembered by sports fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Austin American-Statesman |url=https://www.hookem.com/2015/09/08/now-53-years-later-jfk-asks-why-does-rice-play-texas/ |title=Now 53 years later, JFK asks, 'Why does Rice play Texas?' |date=September 8, 2015 |first=Brian |last=Davis |access-date=March 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Rice has beaten Texas in 1965 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/rice/article/When-Rice-beat-Texas-Oct-16-1994-6497488.php |access-date=March 20, 2018 |title=When Rice beat Texas: October 16, 1994 |first=Jonathan |last=Feigen |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=September 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the speech Kennedy also made a joke about the heat. The jokes elicited cheers and laughter from the audience. While these side comments may have diminished the rhetorical power of the speech, and do not resonate outside Texas, they stand as a reminder of the part Texas played in the space race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Medium |url=https://medium.com/@BrantleyWorks/why-does-rice-play-texas-fede9ee5d762 |first=Brantley |last=Hightower |date=April 20, 2016 |title=Why Does Rice Play Texas? |access-date=March 20, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
[[File:JFKWHP-KN-C23687 Address at Rice University.jpg|thumb|The crowd at Rice University watching Kennedy's speech]]
Kennedy's speech used three strategies: "a characterization of space as a beckoning frontier; an articulation of time that locates the endeavor within a historical moment of urgency and plausibility; and a final, cumulative strategy that invites audience members to live up to their pioneering heritage by going to the Moon."{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=214}}

When addressing the crowd at Rice University, he equated the desire to explore space with the pioneering spirit that had dominated American folklore since the nation’s foundation.{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=214}} This allowed Kennedy to reference back to his [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy#Inaugural address|inaugural address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/BqXIEM9F4024ntFl7SVAjA.aspx |title=Inaugural Address, 20 January 1961 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum |access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when he declared to the world "Together let us explore the stars". When he met with [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]] in June 1961, Kennedy proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev did not take up the offer.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=32}}

Kennedy verbally condensed human history to fifty years, in which "only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/USG-15-29-2.aspx |last=Kennedy |first=John |author-link=John F. Kennedy |title=Rice University, 12 September 1962 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; With this extended metaphor, Kennedy sought to imbue a sense of urgency and change in his audience.{{sfn|Jordan|2003|pp=217–218}} Most prominently, the phrase "We choose to go to the Moon" in the Rice speech was repeated three times consecutively, followed by an explanation that climaxes in his declaration that the challenge of space is "one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win."&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

Considering the line before rhetorically asked the audience why they choose to compete in tasks that challenge them, Kennedy highlighted here the nature of the decision to go to space as being a choice, an option that the American people have elected to pursue. Rather than claim it as essential, he emphasized the benefits such an endeavor could provide – uniting the nation and the competitive aspect of it. As Kennedy told Congress earlier, "whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share."&lt;ref name="Urgent National Needs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/United-States-Congress-Special-Message_19610525.aspx |access-date=March 10, 2018  |last=Kennedy |first=John |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs, May 25, 1961 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; These words emphasized the freedom enjoyed by Americans to choose their destiny rather than have it chosen for them. Combined with Kennedy's overall usage of rhetorical devices in the Rice University speech, they were particularly apt as a declaration that began the American space race.{{sfn|Jordan|2003|pp=219–220}}

Kennedy was able to describe a romantic notion of space in the Rice University speech with which all citizens of the United States, and even the world could participate, vastly increasing the number of citizens interested in space exploration. He began by talking about space as the new frontier for all of mankind, instilling the dream within the audience.{{sfn|Jordan|2003|pp=220–221}} He then condensed human history to show that within a very brief period of time space travel will be possible, informing the audience that their dream is achievable. Lastly, he uses the first-personal plural "we" to represent all the people of the world that would allegedly explore space together, but also involves the crowd.{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=224}}

Webb|James Webb]], Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]], NASA Launch Center director [[Kurt Debus]], Lieutenant General [[Leighton I. Davis]] and Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]].|alt=|left]]
Paul Burka, the executive editor of ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' magazine, a Rice alumnus who was present in the crowd that day, recalled 50 years later that the speech "speaks to the way Americans viewed the future in those days. It is a great speech, one that encapsulates all of recorded history and seeks to set it in the history of our own time. Unlike today’s politicians, Kennedy spoke to our best impulses as a nation, not our worst."&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt; Ron Sass and [[Robert Curl]] were among the many members of the Rice University faculty present. Curl was amazed by the cost of the space exploration program. They recalled that the ambitious goal did not seem so remarkable at the time, and that Kennedy's speech was not regarded as so different from one delivered by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at Rice's [[Tudor Fieldhouse|Autry Court]] in 1960; but that speech has long since been forgotten, while Kennedy's is still remembered.&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;

The speech did not stem a rising tide of disquiet about the Moon landing effort. There were many other things that the money could be spent on. Eisenhower declared, "To spend $40 billion to reach the Moon is just nuts."{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|p=197}} [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] argued that the civilian space program was pushing the more important military one aside. Senator [[William Proxmire]] feared that scientists would be diverted away from military research into space exploration. A budget cut was only narrowly averted.{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|pp=197–198}} Kennedy gave a speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on September 20, 1963, in which he again proposed a joint expedition to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-046-041.aspx |access-date=March 11, 2018 |title=Address at 18th U.N. General Assembly|date=20 September 1963|publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khrushchev remained cautious about participating, and responded with a statement in October 1963 in which he declared that the Soviet Union had no plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon.{{sfn|Young|Silcock|Dunn|1969|pp=202–207}} However, his military advisors persuaded him that the offer was a good one, as it would enable the Soviet Union to acquire American technology.&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Politico |title=JFK Proposes Joint Lunar Expedition with Soviets, September 20, 1963 |first=Andrew |last=Glass |date=September 20, 2017 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/20/jfk-proposes-joint-lunar-expedition-with-soviets-sept-20-1963-242843 |access-date=March 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy ordered reviews of the [[Apollo project]] in April, August and October 1963. The final report was received on November 29, 1963, a week after Kennedy's assassination.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=32}}

== Legacy ==
The idea of a joint Moon mission was abandoned after Kennedy's death,&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt; but the Apollo Project became a memorial to him. His goal was fulfilled in July 1969, with the successful [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon landing]]. This accomplishment remains an enduring legacy of Kennedy's speech, but his deadline demanded a necessarily narrow focus, and there was no indication of what should be done next once it was achieved.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=29}}{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=32}} Apollo did not usher in an era of lunar exploration, and no further missions were sent to the Moon after [[Apollo 17]] in 1972. Subsequent planned Apollo missions were cancelled.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=32}} The [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]] projects never captured the public imagination the way the Apollo Project did, and NASA would struggle to realize its visions with inadequate resources. Ambitious visions of space exploration were proclaimed by Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1989 and [[George W. Bush]] in 2004, but the future of the American space program remained uncertain.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=33}}

[[Image:WimshurstElectricMachine.jpg|thumb|Suppose that the conditions are as in the figure, with the segment A1 positive and the segment B1 negative. Now, as A1 moves to the left and B1 to the right, their potentials will rise on account of the work done in separating them against attraction. When A1 and neighboring sectors comes opposite the segment B2 of the B plate, which is now in contact with the brush Y, they will cause a displacement of electricity along the conductor between Y and Y1 bringing a negative charge, larger than the positive charge in A1 alone, on Y and sending a positive charge to the segment touching Y1. As A1 moves on, it passes near the brush Z and is partially discharged into the external circuit. It then passes on until, on touching the brush X, has a new charge, this time negative, driven into it by induction from B2 and neighboring sectors. As the machine turns, the process causes exponential increases in the voltages on all positions, until sparking occurs limiting the increase.]]

The '''Wimshurst influence machine''' is an [[electrostatic generator]], a machine for generating high [[voltage]]s developed between 1880 and 1883 by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[inventor]] [[James Wimshurst]] (1832–1903).

It has a distinctive appearance with two large contra-rotating discs mounted in a vertical plane, two crossed bars with metallic brushes, and a [[spark gap]] formed by two metal spheres.

==Description==
These machines belong to a class of electrostatic generators called [[influence machine]]s, which separate [[electric charge]]s through [[electrostatic induction]], or ''influence'', not depending on friction for their operation. Earlier machines in this class were developed by [[Wilhelm Holtz]] (1865 and 1867), [[August Toepler]] (1865), J. Robert Voss (1880), and others. The older machines are less efficient and exhibit an unpredictable tendency to switch their polarity. The Wimshurst does not have this defect.

In a Wimshurst machine, the two insulated discs and their metal sectors rotate in opposite directions passing the crossed metal neutralizer bars and their brushes. An imbalance of charges is induced, amplified, and collected by two pairs of metal combs with points placed near the surfaces of each disk. These collectors are mounted on insulating supports and connected to the output terminals. The positive feedback increases the accumulating charges exponentially until the dielectric breakdown voltage of the air is reached and an [[electric spark]] jumps across the gap.

The machine is theoretically not self-starting, meaning that if none of the sectors on the discs has any electrical charge there is nothing to induce charges on other sectors. In practice, even a small residual charge on any sector is enough to start the process going once the discs start to rotate. The machine will only work satisfactorily in a dry atmosphere. It requires mechanical [[power (physics)|power]] to turn the disks against the electric field, and it is this energy that the machine converts into the electric power of the spark. The steady state output of the Wimshurst machine is a direct (non-alternating) [[current (electricity)|current]] that is proportional to the area covered by the metal sector, the rotation speed, and a complicated function of the initial charge distribution. The insulation and the size of the machine determine the maximum output voltage that can be reached. The accumulated spark energy can be increased by adding a pair of [[Leyden jar]]s, an early type of [[capacitor]] suitable for high voltages, with the jars’ inner plates independently connected to each of the output terminals and the jars’ outer plates interconnected. A typical Wimshurst machine can produce sparks that are about a third of the disc's diameter in length and several tens of microamperes.

The available voltage gain can be understood by noting that the charge density on oppositely charged sectors, between the neutralizer bars, is nearly uniform across the sectors, and thus at low voltage, while the charge density on same charged sectors, approaching the collector combs, peaks near the sector edges, at a consequently high voltage relative to the opposite collector combs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Wimshurst machines were used during the 19th century in physics research.   They were also occasionally used to generate high voltage to power the first-generation Crookes [[X-ray tube]]s during the first two decades of the 20th century, although [[Electrostatic generator#Holtz_machine|Holtz machines]] and [[induction coil]]s were more commonly used.  Today they are only used in science museums and education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics.

==Operation==
The two contra-rotating insulating discs (usually made of glass) have a number of metal sectors stuck onto them. The machine is provided with four small earthed brushes (two on each side of the machine on conducting shafts at 90° to each other), plus a pair of charge-collection combs. The conducting shafts, that hold the brushes on a typical Wimshurst machine, would form the shape of an "X", if one could see through the insulating disks, as they are perpendicular to each other. The charge-collection combs are typically mounted along the horizontal and equally contact the outer edges of both front and back discs. The collection combs on each side are usually connected to respective [[Leyden jar]]s.

Any small charge on either of the two discs suffices to begin the charging process. Suppose, therefore, that the back disc has a small, net electrostatic charge. For concreteness, assume this charge is positive (red) and that the back disc ([A] lower chain) rotates counter-clockwise (right to left). As the charged sector (moving red square) rotates to the position of the brush ([Y] down arrow tip) next to front disc ([B] upper chain near center), it induces a polarization of charge on the conducting shaft ([Y-Y1] upper horizontal black line) holding the brush, attracting negative (green) charge to the near side ([Y] upper square becoming green), so that positive (red) charge accumulates on the far side (across the disc, 180 degrees away) ([Y1] upper square becoming red). The shaft's polarized charges attach to the nearest sectors on disc B, resulting in negative charge on B [Y] closer to the original positive charge on A, and positive charge on the opposite side of B [Y1]. After an additional 45° rotation ([Z] near lower chain middle), the positive (red) charge on A (lower chain) is repelled by a positive (red) charge on B ([Z] upper chain) approaching. The first collection comb ([Z] arrow-tipped lines to triangles) encountered allows both positive (red) charges to leave the sectors neutral (squares becoming black), and accumulate in the Leyden jar anode (red triangle) attracted to the Leyden jar cathode (green triangle). The charge completes the cycle across the discs when a spark (yellow zigzag) discharges the Leyden jar (red and green triangles).

As B rotates 90° clockwise (left to right), the charges that have been induced on it line up with the brushes next to disc A [X, X1]. The charges on B induce the opposite polarization of the A-brushes' shaft, and the shaft's polarization is transferred to its disc. Disc B keeps rotating and its charges are accumulated by the nearest charge-collection combs.

Disc A rotates 90° so that its charges line up with the brush of disc B [Y, Y1], where an opposite charge-polarization is induced on the B conducting shaft and the nearest sectors of B, similar to the description two paragraphs above.

The process repeats, with each charge polarization on A inducing polarization on B, inducing polarization on A, etc. All of these induced positive and negative charges are collected by combs to charge the Leyden jars, electrical charge-storage devices similar to capacitors. The mechanical energy required to separate the opposing charges on the adjacent sectors provides the energy source for the electrical output.
