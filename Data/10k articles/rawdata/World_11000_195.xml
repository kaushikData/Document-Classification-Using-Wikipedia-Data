{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}
The '''1973 enlargement of the European Communities''' was the first enlargement of the European Communities (EC), now the [[European Union]] (EU). [[Denmark]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) acceded to the EC on 1 January 1973. [[Gibraltar]] and [[Greenland]] also joined the EC as part of the United Kingdom and Denmark respectively, but the [[Faroe Islands]], the [[British Overseas Territories]] and the [[Crown Dependencies|Crown dependencies of the United Kingdom]] did not join the EC.

Ireland and Denmark both held referenda in 1972 in [[Third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|May]] and [[Danish European Communities membership referendum, 1972|October]] respectively, and the UK held a [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|referendum in 1975]], on membership of the EC, all which approved membership of the EC. [[Norway]] planned to accede, but this was rejected in a [[Norwegian European Communities membership referendum, 1972|referendum held in September 1972]]. Norway later [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|reapplied]] to join, but voters again rejected the proposal in a [[Norwegian European Union membership referendum, 1994|1994 referendum]].

Greenland later [[Withdrawal of Greenland from the European Community|withdrew from the EC]] on 1 January 1985 after a [[Greenlandic European Community membership referendum, 1982|referendum in 1982]]. This was followed by the UK holding a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum in 2016]] on membership which resulted in the [[Brexit|United Kingdom voting to leave the now EU]].

==Background==
The United Kingdom was recovering from the [[Second World War]] and Ireland remained economically dependent on the latter, which represented nearly 75% of its exports and this was codified in the Anglo-Irish Free trade agreement of 1966.&lt;ref name="Histoire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-pour-tous.fr/dossiers/90-histoire-de-la-construction-europeenne/1422-1er-elargissement-de-la-cee-1er-janvier-1973.html|title=1er élargissement de la CEE (1er Janvier 1973)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) was established and was formed by [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. These countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of the founding members of the [[European Community]] (EC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |publisher=TIME |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFTA was founded by a convention known as the Stockholm Convention in 1960, with the aim of liberalisation of trade in goods amongst its member states.
On 31 July 1961 the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2002/9/3/a5c95873-aca0-4e9f-be93-53a36918041d/publishable_en.pdf |title=Address given by Harold Macmillan on the United Kingdom's application for membership to the EC |date=31 July 1961 |publisher=Le Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland&lt;ref name=Europa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/ireland_in_the_eu/index1_en.htm|title=Ireland in the EU - Joining the European Community|publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Denmark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3583801.stm |title=A timeline of the EU |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to join the EC.

'''''Alo!''''' is a daily tabloid newspaper published in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

Launched by [[Ringier AG]] (owners of another Serbian daily ''[[Blic (newspaper)|Blic]]'') on October 15, 2007, ''Alo!'' attempts to establish itself on the saturated Serbian daily tabloid market through aggressive campaign that announces it as 'Najveće dnevne novine u Srbiji' ("The biggest daily in Serbia") - referring to its format size. Its editor-in-chief is Ana Ćubela and it is published on 16 pages every day. On October 12, 2009, the daily has changed the format and design, where the newspaper's slogan "Najveće dnevne novine u Srbiji" has dropped, introducing the new billboard campaign "Cela slika na manjem formatu" ("A whole picture on less format").

It also tries to gain market share by initially setting its price at [[Serbian dinar|RSD]]9, which is lower than other established Serbian tabloids such as ''[[Blic (newspaper)|Blic]]'', ''[[Press (newspaper)|Press]]'', and ''[[Kurir]]'' that are mostly sold at RSD10 and RSD15. ''Alo!''s first two issues were distributed for free.&lt;small&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071017064629/http://ndnv.org/vest.php?id=3634]&lt;/small&gt;

''Alo!'' appeared on the Serbian market around the time many other similar tabloid dailies such as ''[[Pravda (Serbia)|Pravda]]'', ''[[Sutra (newspaper)|Sutra]]'', and ''[[Gazeta (Serbia)|Gazeta]]'' hit the stands as well, raising questions of their financial viability and political allegiance.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/world/text.php?vest=74513]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=268767]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110217085242/http://kablovskiforum.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?p=24440]&lt;/small&gt;

In 2010, when Ringier AG and [[Axel Springer AG]] launched a new joint venture Ringier Axel Springer Media AG, ''Alo!'' got incorporated among the assets of the newly created company.

'''Bettine van Vuuren''' is a Professor of Zoology and Director of the Centre for Ecological Genomics and Wildlife Conservation [http://www.molzoolab.co.za/]  at the [[University of Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uj.ac.za/contact/Pages/Prof-Bettine-Jansen-van-Vuuren%25E2%2580%258B.aspx|title=Prof Bettine van-Vuuren|website=www.molzoolab.co.za/|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Bettine van Vuuren studied at the [[University of Pretoria]], [[South Africa]]. She received a B.Sc. (Hons) Zoology in 1992 and M.Sc. in 1995. She was awarded a PhD in Zoology in 2000 on the topic ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Molecular phylogeny of duiker antelope (Mammalia: Cephalophini) ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/dspace/handle/2263/24033|title=Molecular phylogeny of duiker antelope (Mammalia : Cephalophini)|last=Jansen van Vuuren|first=Bettine|date=2007-04-20|website=dspace|publisher=University of Pretoria|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently relocated to the [[University of Stellenbosch]] and in 2001 took up a postdoctoral position at the [[Montpellier 2 University|University of Montpellier II]], [[France]].  Her research focused on game mammals in French Guiana and the results contributed towards the development of hunting laws for the protection of Neotropical game species. In 2002, she returned to Stellenbosch University. She was invited to become a core team member of the Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (CIB) (2005 to 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.sun.ac.za/cib/news/news_cib_celebrates_successes.htm|title=Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology Celebrates Success|date=2009|website=academic.sun.ac.za|publisher=Centre of Invasion Biology|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sun.ac.za/english/faculty/science/Documents/SUScience2011.pdf|title=Fakulteit Natuurwetenskappe Jaarverslag|last=|first=|date=2011|website=sun.ac.za|publisher=Stellenbosch University|trans-title=Faculty of Science Annual Report|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2011, she accepted a position at the University of Johannesburg (where she established the Molecular Zoology Laboratory), and in 2016 / 2017 she was awarded a University of Johannesburg research centre (Centre for Ecological Genomics and Wildlife Conservation). She has been involved with the supervision of &gt; 40 PhD and MSc students and hosted &gt;10 postdoctoral fellows.  She is a member of the Zoological Society of Southern Africa, the International Biogeography Society and the Southern African Wildlife Management Association.

== Career and impact ==

van Vuuren believes that aspects of her research must have practical conservation and management application. She has driven research documenting genetic patterns for several of Africa's economically important game species (such as roan and sable antelope, black rhino, nyala and buffalo). Through ongoing interaction, she feeds her research back to nature conservation, industry and the general public.  To this end, she was involved (2005-2007, and again in 2013-2014) with the Draft Regulations for the Biodiversity Act (#10 of 2004) as the Coordinator for the listing on invasive vertebrate species (excluding fishes) and was largely responsible, in collaboration with Dr Preston (Deputy Director General: Environmental Programmes, Department of Environmental Affairs), for the listing of mammal species and associated distribution maps. She serves, when required, as a scientific adviser to the Department of Environmental Affairs: Directorates Biodiversity and Conservation (this work relates mostly to the translocation and permitting of antelope species), as well as Environmental Programmes (this includes work from an alien invasive perspective).

In addition to studying spatial patterns on the African continent, her research has a strong Antarctic / sub-Antarctic focus. She has worked extensively on [[Marion Island]] (of the [[Prince Edward Islands]]) as a project leader and was the first female Chief Scientist in the [[South African National Antarctic Programme|South African National Antarctic Programme's]] annual relief voyage in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.sun.ac.za/cib/annualreports/CIB_Annual_Report_2006.pdf|title=Annual Report|last=|first=|date=2006|website=academic.sun.ac.za|publisher=Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.nrf.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10907/89/002rog2011.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y,http://www.nrf.ac.za/sites/default/files/documents/NRF%20Grant%20Register%20Vol12.pdf|title=Register of Grants|last=|first=|date=2011|website=ir.nrf.ac.za/|publisher=National Research Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antarcticbiogeography.org/the-team/|title=Team Members|website=antarcticbiogeography.org|publisher=Functional Biogeography of the Antarctic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She serves on the South African ICS Committee for the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and was the National Alternate Delegate to the recent SCAR Delegates meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the South African representative to SCAR Life Sciences, and also the South African representative and co-Chair of a SCAR Action Group (focused on integrated sciences for the sub-Antarctic).  Van Vuuren is an official South African delegate to the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] and the Vice-Chair of the Standing Scientific Group on Life Sciences since 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/ssg-ls/ls-members|title=Membership|last=|first=|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South African representative on for the Action Group on Integrated Science for the Sub-Antarctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/scar_media/documents/publications/bulletins/Bulletin190.pdf|title=Report of the XXXIII SCAR Delegates’ Meeting|last=|first=|date=2014|website=scar.org|publisher=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is recognized nationally and internationally and attained leadership positions in academia and science outside a university setting (President: ZSSA – two terms; Vice-Chair: FBIP Steering Committee; Vice-Chair: ICSU SANC for the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR); SA Delegate to SCAR; SA Representative on various SCAR Life Science groups and working groups; etc.). She has strong national (academia, SANBI, government, industry, etc.) and international (CIBIO Portugal, University of Kiel Germany, Australian Antarctic Division, University of Queensland Australia etc.) collaborations.

'''Deutsche Welle''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈvɛlə}}; "German wave" in German) or '''DW''' is [[Germany]]'s public [[International broadcasting|international broadcaster]]. DW also known as Voice of Germany (VOG).The service is available in 30 languages. DW's satellite television service consists of channels in English, German, Spanish, and Arabic. While funded by the German government, the work of DW is regulated by the Deutsche Welle Act,&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle Act"&gt;{{cite web|title = Deutsche Welle Act|url = http://p.dw.com/p/17MtP|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate = 2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that content is always independent of government influence. DW is a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU).

DW offers regularly updated articles on its news website and runs its own center for international media development, DW Akademie. The broadcaster's stated goals are to convey Germany as a "liberal, democratic state based on the rule of law", to produce reliable news coverage and to provide access to the German language.&lt;ref name="English profile"&gt;{{cite web|title = Profile DW|url = http://www.dw.com/en/about-dw/profile/s-30688|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate = 2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DW has been broadcasting since 1953. It is headquartered in Bonn, where its radio programmes are produced. Television broadcasts are produced almost entirely in Berlin. Both locations create content for DW's news website.

As of 2018, around 1,500 employees and 1,500 freelancers from 60 countries work for Deutsche Welle in its offices in Bonn and Berlin.&lt;ref name="German profile"&gt;{{cite web|title = Profil DW|url = https://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/DE/Bundesregierung/BeauftragtefuerKulturundMedien/medien/deutscheWelle/_node.html|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate = 2017-11-06|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DW, its output reaches 157 million people worldwide every week. The Director-General of DW is [[Peter Limbourg]].

==History==
DW's first shortwave broadcast took place on 3 May 1953 with an address by the then West German President, [[Theodor Heuss]]. On 11 June 1953, [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] public broadcasters signed an agreement to share responsibility for Deutsche Welle.  At first, it was controlled by [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]] (NWDR). In 1955, NWDR split into [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] (WDR), WDR assumed responsibility for Deutsche Welle programming. In 1960, Deutsche Welle became an independent public body after a court ruled that broadcasting ''from'' Germany was part of the federal government's foreign-affairs function.  On 7 June 1962 DW joined [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] as a national broadcasting station.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} {{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/blob/410184/fb231184dbeb8473b6ce405adec4274f/wd-10-012-14-pdf-data.pdf |title=Data |website=www.bundestag.de |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsche Welle was originally headquartered in the West German city of [[Cologne]].  After [[German reunification|reunification]], when much of the government relocated to Berlin, the station's headquarters moved to Bonn.

&amp;nbsp;* partly by [[Deutschlandfunk]] (until 1993)

===German reunification===
With [[German reunification]] in 1990, [[Radio Berlin International]] (RBI), [[East Germany| East Germany's international broadcaster]] ceased to exist. Some of the RBI staff joined Deutsche Welle and DW inherited some broadcasting facilities, including transmitting facilities at [[Nauen]], as well as RBI's frequencies.

'''DW (TV)''' began as '''RIAS-TV''', a television station launched by the [[West Berlin]] broadcaster [[Radio in the American Sector|RIAS]] (Radio in the American Sector / Rundfunk im Amerikanischen Sektor) in August 1988. The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] the following year and German reunification in 1990 meant that RIAS-TV was to be closed down. On 1 April 1992, Deutsche Welle inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German and English-language television channel broadcast via [[satellite]], DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours German, 10 hours English, 2 hours Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo.

Deutsche Welle took over some of the former independent radio broadcasting service [[Deutschlandfunk]]'s foreign-language programming in 1993, when Deutschlandfunk was absorbed into the new [[Deutschlandradio]].

In addition to radio and television programming, DW sponsored some published material.  For example, the South-Asia Department published ''German Heritage: A Series Written for the South Asia Programme'' in 1967 and in 1984 published ''African Writers on the Air''.  Both publications were transcripts of DW programming.

===Internet presence===
In September 1994, Deutsche Welle was the first public broadcaster in Germany with an internet presence, initially '''www-dw.gmd.de''', hosted by the GMD Information Technology Research Center. For its first two years, the site listed little more than contact addresses, although DW's ''News Journal'' was broadcast in [[RealAudio]] from Real's server beginning in 1995, and ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'s'' initial web presence, which included news articles from the newspaper, shared the site. In 1996, it evolved into a news website using the URL '''dwelle.de'''; in 2001, the URL changed to '''www.dw-world.de''', and was changed again in 2012, to '''www.dw.de'''. Deutsche Welle purchased the domain '''dw.com''', which previously belonged to [[DiamondWare]], in 2013; DW had attempted to claim ownership of the address in 2000, without success. DW eventually moved to the '''www.dw.com''' domain on 22 June 2015.

DW's news site is in seven core languages ([[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], English, German, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese for Brazil]], and Russian), as well as a mixture of news and information in 23 other languages in which Deutsche Welle broadcasts. [[Persian language|Persian]] became the site's eighth focus language in 2007.

German and European news is DW's central focus, but the site also offers background information about Germany and German language courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/learn-german/s-2469|title=Learn German|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dw.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Deutsch, Warum Nicht?''''' (literally: ''German, Why Not?'') is a personal course for learning the German language, created by Deutsche Welle and the [[Goethe-Institut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/learn-german/deutsch-warum-nicht/s-2548 ''Deutsch, Warum Nicht?'']. ''Deutsche Welle''. Retrieved 5 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In 2001, Deutsche Welle (in conjunction with ARD and [[ZDF]]) founded the [[German TV]] subscription TV channel for North American viewers. The project was shut down after four years owing to low subscriber numbers. It has since been replaced by the [[DW-TV]] channel (also a subscription service).

Unlike most other international broadcasters, DW-TV does not charge terrestrial stations for use of its programming, and as a result, ''[[Journal (Deutsche Welle)|Journal]]'' and other programmes are rebroadcast on numerous [[public broadcasting]] stations in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.  In the [[Philippines]], selected Anglophone programmes are shown nationwide on [[Net 25]].

Deutsche Welle is still suffering from financial and staffing cuts.  Its budget was reduced by about €75&amp;nbsp;million over five years, and of the 2,200 employees it had in 1994, only 1,200 remain. Further cuts are still expected.{{when|date=April 2018}}

In 2003, the German government passed a new "Deutsche Welle Act", which defined DW as a tri-media organization, making the Deutsche Welle website an equal partner with DW-TV and DW Radio. The website is available in 30 languages, but focuses on German, English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Arabic. Persian became the eighth focus language in 2007.

In March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels, namely DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+. DW-TV Asia (DW-TV Asien in German) contains 16 hours of German programming and 8 hours in English, whilst DW-TV Asia+ contains 18 hours of English programmes plus 6 hours of German programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/two-dedicated-channels-provide-gateway-to-europe/a-3930041 Two New Dedicated Channels Provide Gateway to Europe: Two DW-TV channel launched in Asia] Deutsche Welle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, DW-TV's carriage in the United Kingdom on [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] channel 794 ceased, although the channel continues to be available via other European satellites receivable in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2055640587|title=No more DW-TV on Sky/Astra|work=Boards|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, DW announced a major reduction of service including the closure of most of its FM services in the Balkans (except for [[Romani language|Romani]]), but that it would expand its network of FM partners in Africa. The radio production for Hausa, Kiswahili, French, and Portuguese for Africa were optimized for FM broadcasts and DW also produces a regional radio magazine daily in English, to be rebroadcast by partners in Africa.

Audio content in Arabic is distributed online, via mobile, or rebroadcast by partners.

DW announced it would focus on FM partnerships for Bengali, Urdu, Dari/Pashtu, and Indonesian for South Asia, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

On 1 November 2011, DW discontinued shortwave broadcasts in German, Russian, Persian, and Indonesian and ended its English service outside Africa. Chinese programming was reduced from 120 minutes to 60 minutes a week.

=== Rebranding television news ===
On 22 June 2015, DW TV launched a 24-hour English-language news channel with a new design and a new studio as part of a rebrand to '''[[DW News]]'''. Previously, DW's news programmes were called '''[[Journal (Deutsche Welle)|Journal]]''' and broadcast in English in 3, 15 and 30-minute blocks. The new channel offers 30-minute updates every hour and 60-minute programmes twice a day on weekdays. DW News broadcasts from Berlin but frequently has live social media segments hosted from a specially-designed studio in Bonn. The German, Spanish and Arabic channels also received a new design.

At the same time, DW's news website moved from a .de [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] to .com and added a social media stream to its front page. The refreshed DW services were launched under the tagline 'Made for Minds'.

==Shortwave relay stations==

===Transmitter sites in Germany===
The [[Jülich radio transmitter]] site began operation in 1956 with eleven 100&amp;nbsp;kW [[Telefunken]] transmitters.

The Wertachtal site was authorized in 1972 and began service with four 500&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters. By 1989 there were 15 transmitters, four of which relayed the [[Voice of America]].

The Nauen transmitter site was inherited from Radio Berlin International. RBI's Russian-made three 500&amp;nbsp;kW and one 100&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters were replaced by four Telefunken 500&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters and four rotatable antennas. Deutsche Welle no longer uses any of transmitters in Germany.

===Shortwave relay stations outside Germany===

*[[Trincomalee]], [[Sri Lanka]] (1984 to 2013) sold to Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation
**3 × 250&amp;nbsp;kW shortwave transmitters
**1 × 400&amp;nbsp;kW mediumwave transmitter
**20 antennas (to be verified)
*Kigali, [[Rwanda]]: A relay station in Kigali, Rwanda, was inaugurated on 30 August 1963, and provided coverage for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/transmitting-from-the-hilltops-of-kigali/a-15692249|title=Transmitting from the hilltops of Kigali|work=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relay station closed 28 March 2015.

DW used a relay station in Malta had three SW and one 600&amp;nbsp;kW-MW transmitter and gave partial coverage of the Americas, Southern Asia and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 51.&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated on 29 July 1974 in exchange for a grant of almost 1&amp;nbsp;million GBP. The station closed in January 1996.

Formerly, DW shared a transmitting station on [[Antigua]] in the [[Caribbean]] with the BBC. It was inaugurated on 1 November 1976 and closed on 31 March 2005. It had a relay-exchange with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] that allowed DW to use two 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters in Sackville, New Brunswick until that facility closed down in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relay stations leasing transmitter time to DW===

The '''Di Teramo''' is an indigenous [[breed]] of [[goat|domestic goat]] from the [[province of Teramo]], in [[Abruzzo]] in southern Italy,&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; and is raised only in that area. Numbers are very low; the breed was listed as endangered by the [[FAO]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; It is further threatened by cross-breeding with the [[Garganica]] breed.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

The Di Teramo is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; Numbers were estimated at 500 in 1983;&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; at the end of 2013 the registered population was 58.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

==Use==

The [[goat's milk|milk]] yield for [[pluriparous]] nannies is 250–400&amp;nbsp;kg per [[lactation]] of 180–240 days.&lt;ref name=aspa3/&gt;

It was opened in 1905, when the city council of Christiania bought the farm Dikemark, in Asker. Patients were moved from the "Christiania municipal insanity asylum" (Sindssygeasyl) to the newly established Dikemark psychiatric hospital.

The hospital consists of the following departments: National Coordination Unit for Sentences to Compulsory Mental Health Care, Psychosis Unit 1, Psychosis Unit 2, Regional Competence Service for Psychiatry and Developmental Disorders, Regional Section of Psychiatry and Developmental Disorders (PUA), Regional Security Section (RSA), Section for Psychosis Treatment and Security Psychiatric C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2312">'''Favonae''' is a Latinization of Greek '''Phauonai''', the name of a [[Germanic people]] in [[Ptolemy]]’s ''[[Geography]]'' (2.10) located in eastern [[Scandinavia]]. They are not found elsewhere in classical sources. Moreover, Ptolemy’s view of the north is so distorted that the location of his east Scandinavia remains uncertain.

However, the [[Greek language|Greek]] spelling, Phau-, gives a possible clue to its meaning. It looks like [[Old English]] feaw-, "few", which, following the analogy of [[Harudes]], would have come from *faw-. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20050904023000/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE377.html American Heritage Dictionary] lists the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root as *pau- "few, little", becoming *fau- in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] *fawaz  by [[Grimm's Law]].

There is a name of the same meaning in modern [[Sweden]]: [[Småland]], which would have been at a location known to Ptolemy in southeastern Scandinavia. It means "small land", which name refers to its broken and uncultivatable terrain; i.e., the province includes only small land for settlement purposes. As the name is based on the terrain, it would have been most likely kept over the centuries. The terrain encouraged emigration from [[Kalmar]] to [[Minnesota]], where the land was much bigger.

As the name of the Favonae is based on the terrain, they might well have been known by some other, ethnic name, not reported by Ptolemy.

There is a notable suggestion by Kendrick, published in 1930 (see under [[Dauciones]]), that the Favonae were not in Sweden but were on the coast of [[Finland]] opposite. This hypothesis is based entirely on the argument that the [[Levonii]] of Ptolemy are the Swedes proper and therefore the east of them must be Finland. However, Kendrick also argues that the [[Chaideinoi]] could not have been in Hedemark because the latter was too remote for Ptolemy. If Hedemark is to be considered remote, then Finland must be even more so; moreover, Ptolemy does mention the Finns and does not identify them with the Favonae. Kendrick does not supply us with any names from Finland.

'''Gaolbalization''' is the practice of one country selling its excess [[prison]] population to another country that has excess capacity.

The phrase was coined in 2012 by American [[law professor]] [[Eugene Kontorovich]] to refer to a deal made in 2009 between [[Belgium]] and [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], in which the Netherlands agreed to house approximately 500 Belgian inmates in Tilburg prison near the border with Belgium, in exchange for an annual payment of £26 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.volokh.com/2012/11/19/prisoner-offshoring-or-gaolbalization/|title = Prisoner Offshoring, or Gaolbalization|last = Kontorovich|first = Eugene|date = 19 November 2012|work = The Volokh Conspiracy|accessdate = 9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Norwegian [[Justice Minister|justice minister]] announced that [[Norway]] would begin renting several hundred prison spaces in the Netherlands, as the Norwegian prisoner population had outstripped Norway's capacity to house them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/08/us-norway-netherlands-prison-idUSKBN0H325820140908|title = Norway to rent Dutch prisons to cut convict queue|last = |first = |date = 8 September 2014|work = Reuters|accessdate = 9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/09/more-gaolbalization-the-international-market-in-unwanteds/|title = More "gaolbalization" – the international market in unwanteds|last = Kontorovich|first = Eugene|date = 9 September 2014|work = Washington Post|accessdate = 9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kontorovich argues that gaolbalization of prisoners is part of a broader pattern in which countries are creating [[international markets]] for the efficient housing of populations such as [[pirates]], [[Human migration|migrants]] and [[refugees]]. Several countries, he wrote, have begun outsourcing the housing of asylum-seeking refugees to other countries, and countries including European countries and the United States, have transferred pirates they have caught, to be tried and imprisoned in [[Kenya]] and [[the Seychelles]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Legal scholars say there has been little formal study of these arrangements, and argue that gaolbalization may suggest that countries are departing from traditional theories of punishment, and are instead normalizing prisons as a staple of contemporary social and economic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2456422|title = Inmates for Rent, Sovereignty for Sale: The Global Prison Market|last = Levin|first = Benjamin|date = 18 June 2014|journal = Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal, Vol. 23, No. 3, 2014|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Conference for Women Leaders''' is a biennial conference held by [[MASHAV]] – Israel’s Agency for International Development Cooperation—at Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Golda Meir Mount Carmel International Training Center (MCTC), in [[Haifa]] and [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], on [[Economic development|development]] themes of current interest for women in both [[Developing country|developing]] and [[Industrialized country|industrialized]] countries, often on topics declared by the [[United Nations]] to be of international concern.

==History==
The conferences have been taking place for the past 54 years, since the founding of MCTC in 1961 by former Prime Minister Ms. [[Golda Meir]], then Minister of Foreign Affairs. To date, 28 such conferences have been held in cooperation with various international organizations such as [[UNESCO]], IOM, [[UNIFEM]], [[UNDP]], and OSAGI.

Conference participants are key players in the political, economic, and social arenas from around the world, including Ministers, Members of Parliament, and Heads of national and international governmental and non-governmental organizations. The conference program comprises panel discussions, professional study visits, working groups, and official visits to the [[Knesset]] (the Israeli Parliament) and the Residence of the President of the State of Israel.

Each conference’s conclusions and recommendations form a document known as the [[Haifa Declaration (International Women Leaders Conference)|Haifa Declaration]], stating future concrete steps to be taken. A Draft Declaration is handed to the President of the State of Israel at the end of the Conference.

==Recent conferences==
The 25th Conference, held in 2007 in cooperation with UNESCO, dealt with the subject of Women’s Leadership for [[Sustainable Development]]. In 2009, The [[Global Financial Crisis]] – Implications for Women was the topic of the joint conference with the UN’s Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI; later merged into [[UN Women]]). 

MCTC’s Jubilee Conference in 2011 on Science, Technology and Innovation: Education and Training for Women and Girls was, once again, held in cooperation with UNESCO. 

In 2013 MCTC hosted the 28th Conference in the series, this time on the subject of The Post-2015 and Sustainable Development Goals Agenda: Ensuring the Centrality of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in the Next Framework, in cooperation with UN-Women and UNDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mctc.co.il/public/files/attachments/235/LnvqAg.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report on the 28th International Women Leaders Conference (2013), including the Haifa Declaration|website=Mctc.co.il|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 29th International Conference for Women Leaders will be held in October 2015, addressing the issue of Promoting [[Gender Equality]] through Economic Empowerment: Implementing the Post-2015 Development Agenda. 

It will be the first conference to take place after the United Nations Summit in September, in which the post-2015 development agenda was adopted, and will address the measurable targets and indicators needed to be developed in order to promote economic growth and employment.

'''Izidorius Mockus''' codenames ''Rikas'', ''Rykas'', ''Jovaras'' (1920 – June 16 or July 10, 1950) was a Lithuanian [[forest brothers|forest brother]] who led Rolandas' squad (a part of [[Butigeidis corps]], [[Kęstutis military district|Kęstutis district]]). 

He was born in the village of [[Rudžiai]] (currently [[Eržvilkas elderate]], [[Jurbarkas District Municipality]]) in a family of peasants. He was the oldest of three children. The family possessed 13 [[hectares]] of land, spanning from [[Milaičiai Manor]] from the one side to the river [[Šaltuona]] in the other. Mockus' father died when Mockus was about 18 years old.

At the time of [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|the Second occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union]], Mockus joined forest brothers and eventually became a leader of Rolandas' squad (a part of the larger [[Kęstutis military district|Kęstutis district]]). His younger sister Ona, codename ''Genovaitė'', also joined the resistance as an active supporter (''ryšininkė'' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), but was captured and deported to [[Siberia]] in late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mūsųlaikas.lt/naujiena/kultura-ir-istorija/dingusio-milaiciu-dvaro-istorija Dingusio Milaičių dvaro istorija (Lithuanian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mockus was killed in 1950 after the betrayal while convoying his fellow brother-in-arms [[Jonas Stoškus-Eimutis]] in Šakalinė forest, near the Lake Bivainiai (currently [[Tauragė district municipality]]). In total, 10 partisans were killed in this operation, conducted by the Soviet forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genocid.lt/UserFiles/File/Atmintinos_datos/2015/201506_KA_BR_part_zutis.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial in [[Tauragė]], dedicated to local partisans previously buried in the former prison yard of Tauragė [[NKVD]], also includes the name of Izidorius Mockus.

'''Julie Fagerholt''' (born 17 April 1968) is a Danish fashion designer and founder of the luxury clothing brand Heartmade. She also creates ''[[haute couture]]''. Her customers include [[Crown Princess Mary of Denmark]].&lt;ref name=cover&gt;{{cite web|title=Chit-chat: Julie Fagerholt|url=http://cover.dk/blog/chit-chat-julie-fagerholt/|website=Cover|accessdate=2 March 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Julie Fagerholt grew up in [[Skovshoved]] north of Copenhagen, the daughter of Ninja Tholstrup Bramsen, a child psychologist, and Nils Fagerholt, an architect and a professor at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/kultur/prinsessen-i-pilestraede|title=Prinsessen fra Pilestræde|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=29 January 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her education at the [[Danmarks Designskole|Danish Design School]] in 1993. In 1998, she set up her company Heartmade in a courtyard on [[Pilestræde]] in Copenhagen.

Originally focusing on ''haute couture'', the brand has mainly produced prét-à-porter collections since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/da/copenhagen/heartmade-gdk808018|title=Heartmade|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=29 January 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, her first collection won ''The Golden Button'',&lt;ref name="danishfashioninstitute.dk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Julie Fagerholt Heartmade|url=http://danishfashioninstitute.dk/en/node/822|publisher=Danish Fashion Institute|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009212144/http://www.danishfashioninstitute.dk/en/node/822|archivedate=9 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Danish fashion award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciff.dk/news-julie-fagerholt-heartmade-exhibits-at-ciff.html|title=Julie Fagerholt Heartmade exhibits at CIFF|publisher=Copenhagen International Fashion Fair|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her company has a flagship store at Pilestræde 45 in Copenhagen. Fagerholt ascribes some of her success to designing the kind of clothes she thinks she needs for herself but she is also inspired by ethnic clothing, for example from India.&lt;ref name="cover" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1373">'''Kina-sut-kamuy''' (キナスッカムイ) is the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[kamuy]]'' (''god'') of snakes.  He is a benevolent figure who is called upon for protection against various calamities.

==Mythology==
Kina-sut-kamuy is depicted as generally benevolent and helpful to humans.  He controls the behavior of snakes, protecting those who venerate him from their bites.  In Ainu mythology, snake spirits are believed to possess people and cause a variety of ailments such as eye disease and paralysis, and Kina-sut-kamuy is appealed to in order to exorcise these spirits from a victim.  He also offers communities protection against other diseases, particularly [[typhoid fever|typhoid]].&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;Ashkenazy, Michael. ''Handbook of Japanese Mythology''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Clio, 2003. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

He is generally said to be the brother of [[Nusa-kor-kamuy]], but the two are sometimes regarded as a single entity.

The '''Paris Club''' ({{lang-fr|Club de Paris}}) is a group of officials from major creditor countries whose role is to find co-ordinated and sustainable solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor countries. As debtor countries undertake reforms to stabilize and restore their macroeconomic and financial situation, Paris Club creditors provide an appropriate debt treatment. 

Paris Club creditors provide debt treatments to debtor countries in the form of rescheduling, which is [[debt relief]] by postponement or, in the case of concessional rescheduling, reduction in debt service obligations during a defined period (flow treatment) or as of a set date (stock treatment).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clubdeparis.org/en&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris Club was created gradually from 1956, when the first negotiation between [[Argentina]] and its public creditors took place in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;A survey of some of the early activities of the Paris Club is in Alexis Rieffel, "The Paris Club, 1978-1983", ''Colombia Jour of Transnational Law'', 1984, 23(1) 83-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Club treats public claims (that is to say, those due by governments of debtor countries and by the private sector), guaranteed by the public sector to Paris Club members. A similar process occurs for public debt held by private creditors in the [[London Club]], which was organized in 1970 on the model of the Paris Club as an informal group of commercial banks meet to renegotiate the debt they hold on sovereign debtors.

Creditor countries meet ten times a year in Paris for ''Tour d'Horizon'' and negotiating sessions.  To facilitate Paris Club operations, the French Treasury provides a small secretariat, and a senior official of the French Treasury is appointed chairman.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21482.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1956, the Paris Club has signed 433 agreements with 90 different countries covering over US$583 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clubdeparis.org/en&lt;/ref&gt;

Other official creditors can also participate in negotiation sessions or in monthly "Tours d'Horizon" discussions, subject to the agreement of permanent members and of the debtor country. When participating in Paris Club discussions, invited creditors act in good faith and abide by the practices described below. The following creditors have participated in some Paris Club agreements or Tours d'Horizon in an ad hoc manner: [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Argentina]], [[People's Bank of China|People's Bank of]] [[China]], [[Kuwait]], [[Mexico]], [[Morocco]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[South Africa]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]].

===Observers===
Observers are invited to attend the negotiating sessions of the Paris Club but they cannot participate in the negotiation itself, nor sign the agreement that formalizes the result of negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/communications/page/observers&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three categories of observers:

1) representatives of international institutions:
* [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)
* [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD)
* [[European Commission]]
* [[African Development Bank]]
* [[Asian Development Bank]]
* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD)
* [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IADB)

2) representatives of permanent members of the Paris Club which have no claims concerned by the debt treatment (for example creditors whose claims are covered by the de minimis provision) or that are not creditors of the debtor country concerned but nevertheless want to attend the negotiation meeting;

3) representatives of non Paris Club countries which have claims on the debtor country concerned but are not in a position to sign the Paris Club agreement as ad hoc participants, provided that permanent members and the debtor country agree on their attendance.

==Organisation==

===The Secretariat===

The Secretariat was established to prepare more effectively negotiating sessions. The Secretariat is composed of a dozen people from the Treasury of the French Ministry of Finance and Public Accounts.

The Secretariat's role is primarily to safeguard the common interests of creditor countries participating in the Club, and to facilitate the reaching of a consensus between them at each level of the discussions. To achieve this, the Secretariat prepares negotiating sessions according to a specific method.

In the early stages of discussions, the Secretariat analyses the debtor country's payment capacity and provides creditors with a first proposal for a treatment. This proposal is discussed by the creditors (whose positions during the negotiation are transcribed in the so-called "magic table"). The Secretariat is also responsible for drafting the minutes of negotiation.

The Secretariat also helps to ensure compliance with the various covenants contained in the minutes and maintains external relations with third States creditors and commercial banks, in particular to ensure the greatest possible respect of comparability clause treatment.

===The Chair===

Since 1956, the Presidency of the Paris Club is ensured by the French Treasury.

The Chairperson of the Paris Club is Odile Renaud Basso, Director General of the French Treasury. The co-Chairman is the head of the Department of Multilateral Affairs and Development Treasury (Guillaume Chabert). The Vice-Chairman is the Deputy in charge of Multilateral Financial Affairs and Development at the Treasury (Cyril Rousseau). One of these three co-Chairmen must chair every meeting of the Paris Club.

In particular, during negotiation sessions, the Chairman of the Paris Club plays the role of intermediary between creditors, who elaborate debt treatment proposals, and the representative of the debtor country, usually the Minister of Finance. He is responsible for submitting to the debtor's delegation terms agreed upon by creditors. If the debtor - which is common - refuses the first offer of creditors, the actual negotiation begins, the Chairman acting as a shuttle between the debtor and creditors.

==Paris Club principles==
• '''Solidarity''': All members of the Paris Club agree to act as a group in their dealings with a given debtor country and be sensitive to the effect that the management of their particular claims may have on the claims of other members.

• '''Consensus''': Paris Club decisions cannot be taken without a consensus among the participating creditor countries.

• '''Information sharing''': The Paris Club is a unique information-sharing forum. Paris Club members regularly share views and information with each other on the situation of debtor countries, benefit from participation by the IMF and World Bank, and share data on their claims on a reciprocal basis. In order for discussions to remain productive, deliberations are kept confidential.

• '''Case by case''': The Paris Club makes decisions on a case-by-case basis in order to tailor its action to each debtor country's individual situation. This principle was consolidated by the Evian Approach.

• '''Conditionality''': The Paris Club only negotiates debt restructurings with debtor countries that: 1) need debt relief. Debtor countries are expected to provide a precise description of their economic and financial situation, 2) have implemented and are committed to implementing reforms to restore their economic and financial situation, and 3) have a demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program. This means in practice that the country must have a current program supported by an appropriate arrangement with the IMF (Stand-By, Extended Fund Facility, Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Policy Support Instrument). The level of the debt treatment is based on the financing gap identified in the IMF program. In the case of a flow treatment, the consolidation period coincides with the period when the IMF arrangement shows a need for debt relief. When the flow treatment extends over a long period of time (generally more than one year), the Paris Club agreement is divided into phases. The amounts falling due during the first phase are treated as soon as the agreement enters into force. Subsequent phases are implemented following completion of conditions mentioned in the Agreed Minutes, including non-accumulation of arrears and approval of the reviews of the IMF program.

• '''Comparability of treatment''': A debtor country that signs an agreement with its Paris Club creditors should not accept from its non-Paris Club commercial and bilateral creditors terms of treatment of its debt less favorable to the debtor than those agreed with the Paris Club.

==Meetings==

Paris Club creditor countries generally meet 10 times per year.  Each session includes a one-day meeting called a “Tour d'Horizon” during which Paris Club creditors discuss debt situations of debtor countries, or methodological issues regarding the debt issues more broadly.&lt;ref name="paris-club-meetings"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The session may also include negotiation meetings with one or more debtor countries.

===Negotiations===

A debtor country is invited to a negotiation meeting with its Paris Club creditors when it has concluded an appropriate programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that demonstrates that the country is not able to meet its external debt obligations and thus needs a new payment arrangement with its external creditors (conditionality principle). Paris Club creditors link the debt restructuring to the IMF programme because the economic policy reforms are intended to restore a sound macroeconomic framework that will lower the probability of future financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="paris-club-meetings"&gt;http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/communications/page/paris-club-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty permanent members of the Paris Club may participate in the negotiation meetings, as participating creditors if they have claims towards the invited debtor country, as observers if not.&lt;ref name="paris-club-meetings"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other official bilateral creditors may be invited to attend negotiation meetings on an ad-hoc basis, subject to the agreement of permanent members and of the debtor country.&lt;ref name="paris-club-meetings"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of international institutions, notably the IMF, the World Bank and the relevant regional development bank also attend the meeting as observers.&lt;ref name="paris-club-meetings"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The debtor country is usually represented by the Minister of Finance. They generally lead a delegation comprising officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.&lt;ref name="paris-club-meetings"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Steps in a negotiation====

After a few words from the chairman to welcome everybody and to open the meeting, the official meeting begins with a statement by the minister of the debtor country, who presents in particular the requested debt treatment.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This statement is followed by statements by the IMF and the World Bank, and, if appropriate, by representatives of other international institutions.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/communications/page/steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

The representatives of creditor countries may then request additional information or clarification from the minister regarding the situation in the debtor country.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After responding to any questions, the delegation of the debtor country then leaves the main room and stays in another room during the entire session.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Creditors then discuss among themselves a proposed debt treatment. Once creditors agree on a treatment, the chairman of the meeting will then present this proposed treatment to the delegation of the debtor country. If the debtor country disagrees and asks for amendments to the creditors' proposal, the chairman will then convey this request to the creditors, who discuss it and consider a new proposal. This process continues until a common agreement between creditors and the debtor country is reached.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an agreement is reached on the terms of the treatment, a document called the Agreed Minutes formalizes the accord in writing in French and in English.  This agreement is drafted by the Paris Club Secretariat and then approved by the creditors and the debtor.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegation of the debtor country then returns to the main room and the Agreed Minutes are signed by the Chairman, the minister of the debtor country and the head of delegation of each participating creditor country.&lt;ref name="steps-in-a-negotiation-meeting"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A press release mutually agreed to by the creditors and the debtor country representatives is released for publication upon completion of the negotiation session.&lt;ref&gt;Rieffel, Alexis. “The role of the Paris Club in managing debt problems”. Princeton: Princeton University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris Club Terms==
On October 8, 2003, Paris Club members announced a new approach that would allow the Paris Club to provide debt cancellation to a broader group of countries.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21482.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The new approach, named the “Evian Approach” introduces a new strategy for determining Paris Club debt relief levels that is more flexible and can provide debt cancellation to a greater number of countries than was available under prior Paris Club rules.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Evian Approach’s introduction, debt cancellation was restricted to countries eligible for IDA loans from the World Bank under Naples Terms or HIPC countries under Cologne terms.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers believe that strong U.S. support for Iraq debt relief was an impetus for the creation of the new approach.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of using economic indicators to determine eligibility for debt relief, all potential debt relief cases are now divided into two groups: HIPC and non-HIPC countries. HIPC countries will
continue to receive assistance under Cologne terms, which sanction up to 90% debt cancellation.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Non-HIPC countries are assessed on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-HIPC countries seeking debt relief first undergo an IMF debt sustainability analysis.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis determines whether the country suffers from a liquidity problem, a debt sustainability problem, or both. If the IMF determines that the country suffers from a temporary liquidity problem, its debts are rescheduled until a later date.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If the country is also determined to suffer from debt sustainability problems, where it lacks the long-term resources to meet its debt obligations and the amount of debt adversely affects its future ability to pay, the country is eligible for debt cancellation.&lt;ref name="RS21482"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies for heavily indebted poor countries===

The great difficulties of some developing countries to break the cycle of debt led creditor countries of the Paris Club to adopt more ambitious policies.

In October 1988, creditors decided to implement a new treatment for the debt of the poorest countries. This new treatment called " Toronto terms " implements for the first time a reduction of the stock of debt of poor countries. The level of reduction was defined as 33.33%. Twenty countries benefited from Toronto terms between 1988 and 1991.

In December 1991, creditors decided to  increase the level of cancellation of 33.33% as defined in Toronto, to 50% under the "London terms". These agreements benefited to 23 countries.

Going even further, in December 1994, creditors decided to implement a new treatment called "Naples terms", which can be implemented on a case by case basis. Thus, for the poorest and most indebted countries, the level of cancellation of eligible credit is increased to 50% or even 67% (as of September 1999, all treatments carry a 67% debt reduction). In addition, stock of treatments can be applied in each case for countries that have complied satisfactorily previous commitments. Up to 2008, 35 of 39 countries have reached the completion point of the [[Heavily indebted poor countries|Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] HIPCs.

Finally, in September 1996, the joint proposal of the Development Committee of the World Bank and the IMF Interim Committee, the international financial community has recognized that the debt situation of a number of very poor countries, of which three quarters are located in sub-Saharan Africa remained extremely difficult, even after having used traditional mechanisms. A group of 39 countries,&lt;ref&gt;[[Afghanistan]], [[Benin]], [[Bolivia]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Comoros]], [[Côte d’Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]],  [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[Liberia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mozambique]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Niger]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Sao Tome and Principe]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Togo]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]]&lt;/ref&gt; were identified as being potentially eligible for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPCs.

'''Since the start of the HIPC initiative, debt relief granted to the 36 post-decision point countries at end-2011 amounts to almost 35 percent of these countries’ 2010 GDP, around USD 128 Bn in nominal terms'''. The total debt relief effort provided under the HIPC initiative is shared by multilateral creditors (44.5%), the Paris Club (36.3%), non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (13.1%) and private creditors (6.1%). Hence, the HIPC initiative represents a genuine and significant financial effort from Paris Club member countries, especially considering that they indirectly contribute to debt relief granted by multilateral creditors, as they are major shareholders of these international financial institutions.

'''According to the IMF and the World Bank, debt relief granted since the beginning of the HIPC Initiative reduced beneficiary countries’ debt burden by about 90 percent relative to pre-decision point levels'''. Debt relief has also allowed beneficiary countries to reduce their debt service and to increase social spending. According to the IMF and the World Bank, for the 36 post-decision point countries, poverty reducing spending increased by more than 3 percentage points of GDP, on average, between 2001 and 2010, while debt service payments declined by a similar amount. Such progress is consistent with the HIPC initiative’ objective, namely, to reallocate the increased spending capacity towards the fight against poverty and to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.

'''Apart from the HIPC initiative, the Paris Club adopted a new framework for debt restructuring in 2003, the Evian approach'''. Through the Evian framework, the Paris Club’s goal is to take into account debt sustainability considerations, to adapt its response to the financial situation of debtor countries, and to contribute to current efforts to ensure an orderly, timely and predictable resolution of economic and financial crises. The approach aims at providing a tailored response to debtor countries’ payment difficulties. Countries with unsustainable debt may be granted a comprehensive debt treatment, provided that they are committed to policies that will secure an exit from the Paris Club process,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=L’Angevin, Clotilde, « Debt Relief as a Development Tool: The Role of the Paris Club", ECDPM. 2013.

==Paris Forum==
The '''Paris Forum''' is an annual event, jointly organized by the '''Paris Club''' and the rotating Presidency of the [[G20]], since 2013. The conference gathers representatives from creditor and debtor countries, and is a forum for frank and open debate on the global evolutions in terms of sovereign financing and on the prevention and resolution of sovereign debt crises.
As international financial markets and capital flows are increasingly integrated, non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors are representing a larger share in the financing of developing and emerging countries. The objective of the Forum, in this context, is to foster close and regular dialogue between stakeholders, in order to create an international financial environment favorable to sustainable growth in developing countries. In particular, the Paris Forum aims at enhancing the involvement of emerging countries, be they creditors or debtors, in international debates on sovereign financing, in order to make discussions as open and frank as possible. The Paris Forum annually gathers more than thirty representatives from sovereign creditors and debtors, of which the members of the [[G20]], the members of the Paris Club, and countries from the different regions of the world.

==Accomplishments==
The Paris club has played a role in debt crisis resolution for a period greater than 50 years, in emerging and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Paris Club|author=Trichet, J-C |date=2014-06-21|url=http://www.bis.org/review/r060623a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules and principles that are established for negotiations of different types of debt treatments have proven to be highly efficient towards resolving of various debt crises. Pragmatism and flexibility are important features in the past activity of the Paris club, with the decisions of the group influenced primarily by and technical criteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paris Club’s role in the financing of development|author=Courbe, T |date=2014-06-21|url=https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/doha/chapter5/Courbe_ExternalDebt.ppt}}&lt;/ref&gt; although sometimes also by political criteria.

The Paris Club granted in [https://web.archive.org/web/20141224140507/http://www.clubdeparis.org/sections/communication/archives-2004/irak6017 November 2004] a cancellation of 80% of the stock of debt owed by [[Iraq]], cancelling nearly 30 billion of dollars of claims, also granting a moratorium payment until 2008. In February 2006, the United States announced a relief Afghanistan's debt of 108 million of dollars.

In 2005, after the tsunami which affected the countries bordering the Indian Ocean, the Paris Club decided to temporarily suspend some of repayments of affected countries. In [https://web.archive.org/web/20141224131512/http://www.clubdeparis.org/sections/communication/archives-2010/haiti-20100119 January 2010], the Paris Club also cancelled [[Haiti]]'s debt to help it overcome the consequences of the earthquake of 12 January.

Russia had, in [https://web.archive.org/web/20141011022028/http://www.clubdeparis.org/sections/communication/archives-2005/remboursement-anticipe May 2005], begun to repay its debt to Paris Club countries. On 21 August 2006, Russia repaid the remainder of its debt to the Paris Club. [https://web.archive.org/web/20141224140410/http://www.clubdeparis.org/sections/communication/archives-2007/gabon8480 Gabon] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20141224131820/http://www.clubdeparis.org/sections/communication/archives-2007/jordanie8601 Jordan] both bought their debt back, in 2007, at market value.

In [https://web.archive.org/web/20141226113130/http://www.clubdeparis.org/sections/communication/archives-2013/myanmar-20130128 January 2013], the Paris Club treated 10 billion of dollars of debt owed by [[Myanmar]] to the Paris Club, cancelling 50% of arrears and rescheduling the rest over 15 years, including 7 years of grace.

There are many other contributions of Paris Club which are deemed notable. The recent deal with the creditors of the Paris Club  and the [[Argentina|Argentinian Government]] on 28 and 29 May 2014, is a landmark deal, where an arrangement was made to clear the debt in the arrears which are due to the creditors of the Paris Club in a span of 5 years. The deal covers some amount of 9.7 billion of dollars of debts by 30 April 2014. Additionally, there is flexible structure to get the arrears cleared with a minimum of 1,150 million of dollars by May 2015, with the payment due to be paid by May 2016. The debt accumulated for Argentina is due to the 2001-02 Argentinian default crises, where there is default amount of 132 billion of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Argentina in deal with Paris Club to pay $10bn debts|publisher=BBC News|date=2014-06-21|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27616255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Paris Club==
Critics argue that the Paris Club is not transparent.  In 2006, a significant number of non-governmental organizations have requested the change of rules of the Paris Club, especially for transparency.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.probeinternational.org/2006/06/06/civil-society-statement-paris-club-50-illegitimate-and-unsustainable/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris Club created a new website in 2009 which reiterated the terms of all treatment given to 90 debtor countries. Since 2008, the Paris Club has published an [http://annual%20report annual report]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.  The report includes detailed data on claims that its members hold on foreign states. The total amount of debt to the Paris Club at [http://end%202013 end 2013]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, excluding late interest, amounted to $373.1 billion. This amount included $165.8 billion of ODA debts and $207.3 billion in non-ODA debts.

The '''Prague Society for International Cooperation''' is an organization dedicated to [[business]], [[politics]] and [[academia]] in [[Central Europe]]. A rigorous agenda is achieved through transparent [[Business networking|networking]], off-the-record dialogues and numerous international functions in order to develop a new generation of responsible, intellectuals who work towards a common goal in a post-communistic society. The most notable function of the Prague Society would be the [[Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award]], jointly given every year with the [http://globalpanel.org Global Panel Foundation] to those with the vision to work towards the common good. The Society believes that the innovative process has been hindered based on a reluctance to share information and communicate.

== History ==
As far back as the end of the 18th century, [[science fiction]] elements can be found in [[Serbian literature]], but its  modern period foundation is considered to commence with "Posle milijon godina" (After Million of Years), written by [[Dragutin Ilić]] in 1889, which is also considered the first [[science fiction]] theatrical play in the history of the [[world literature]]. [[Lazar Komarčić]]'s novel "Jedna ugašena zvezda" (An Extinct Star) followed, with publication in 1902.

Today, [[Zoran Živković (writer)]], winner of the [[World Fantasy Award]], is considered one of the best-known [[Serbians|Serbian]] [[science fiction]] authors, and perhaps the best known.

'''Web4Dev''' is the name given a series of international conferences first convened in 2003 by the World Bank. Attendees, who include [[UN system]] organizations, international development agencies, international development [[NGO]]s and, on occasion, commercial partners, use the conferences to discuss how the internet related technologies can be applied to support the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The community is now co-ordinated by UN System Chief Executives Board Secretariat.

The sixth annual conference was held in February 2010 in [[Brasilia]], under the oversight of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29506&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Brasilia Office hosts sixth edition of Web4Dev conference|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Ocean Atlas''' ('''WOA''') is a [[data]] product of the [[Ocean Climate Laboratory]] of the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] ([[United States|U.S.]]).  The WOA consists of a [[climatology]] of [[Field (geography)|fields]] of ''[[in situ#Earth and atmospheric sciences|in situ]]'' [[ocean]] properties for the [[World Ocean]].  It was first produced in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/indpub.html#World%20Ocean%20Atlas%201994 |title=World Ocean Atlas 1994 series |accessdate=2008-10-22 |publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]] |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on the earlier ''Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean''&lt;ref&gt;Levitus, S.

==Dataset==
The fields that make up the WOA dataset consist of [[objectivity (science)|objectively]]-analysed [[Earth|global]] grids at 1[[degree (angle)|°]] [[Image resolution#Spatial resolution|spatial resolution]].  The fields are [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], and data are typically [[interpolation|interpolated]] onto 33 standardised [[water column|vertical intervals]]&lt;ref&gt;Standardised intervals are at 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500 m&lt;/ref&gt; from the surface (0 m) to the [[Abyssal zone|abyssal]] [[Seabed|seafloor]] (5500 m).  In terms of [[Time|temporal]] resolution, averaged fields are produced for annual, [[season]]al and [[month]]ly time-scales.  The WOA fields include ocean [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[dissolved oxygen]], [[apparent oxygen utilisation]] (AOU), [[percent]] [[oxygen saturation]], [[phosphate]], [[silicic acid]], and [[nitrate]].  Early editions of the WOA additionally included fields such as [[Mixed layer|mixed layer depth]] and [[sea surface height]].

In addition to the averaged fields of ocean properties, the WOA also contains fields of [[Statistics|statistical]] information concerning the constituent data that the averages were produced from.  These include fields such as the number of data points the average is derived from, their [[standard deviation]] and [[standard error]].  A lower horizontal resolution (5°) version of the WOA is also available.  The WOA dataset is primarily available as [[Data compression|compressed]] [[ASCII]], but since WOA 2005 a [[netCDF]] version has also been produced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2383">:''"This article is about the Norwegian Legend.  For the Lumsk album, see [[Åsmund Frægdegjevar (album)]].''

'''''Åsmund Frægdegjevar''''' is a medieval [[Norway|Norwegian]] legend and ballad (classification: [[The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad|TSB]] E 145) with several variations all detailing the adventures of a hero by the same name who is hired by the king to rescue a princess. It is based on a [[fornaldarsaga]].

==Summary==
The story starts as many fairytales do: the fair princess has been captured and imprisoned in a faraway castle, and the King commissions a hero, in this case Åsmund, to rescue her. He and his brothers take the King's flagship [[Ormen Lange (longship)|Ormin Lange]] to the castle of the ogre Skomegyvri, where the princess is imprisoned. However, his brothers will not enter with him, so he goes alone.

He finds the princess with relative ease walking through the castle, and immediately falls in love with her. But she is under a spell of the [[ogre]], and believing that Skomegyvri is her mother, will not leave with him. He then takes her by force.

On his way out, the ogre appears. They fight a long battle both physically and with curses and spells, but Åsmund eventually kills Skomegyvri. The princess being free from the spell, they plunder the castle and return home with all the ogre's treasure.

==Parallels==
The ballad tells a similar story to an [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic saga]], where the hero is known as Ásmundur Flagðagæfa.
