It was originally thought to have been left by a [[tortoise]], but is now attributed to an [[Synapsid|evolutionary precursor to mammals]].]]
The '''19th century in ichnology''' refers to advances made between the years [[1800]] and [[1899 in paleontology|1899]] in the scientific study of [[trace fossils]], the preserved record of the [[behavior]] and [[Physiology|physiological processes]] of ancient life forms, especially [[fossil footprints]]. The 19th century was notably the first century in which fossil footprints received scholarly attention. British [[paleontologist]] [[William Buckland]] performed the first true scientific research on the subject during the early [[:Category:1830s in paleontology|1830s]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-25-27" /&gt;

A slab of [[Permian]]-aged [[sandstone]] had been discovered in Scotland which preserved a series of unusual footprints. After acquiring the specimen, Buckland experimented with modern animals to ascertain the trackmaker and concluded that the Scottish footprints were made by [[tortoises]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-25-27" /&gt; Later in the century famed advocate of evolution [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] would refute this attribution and these footprints, called ''[[Chelichnus]]'', would remain without an identified trackmaker until scientists recognized that they were actually made by an evolutionary [[Synapsid|precursor to mammals]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-27-28" /&gt;

The 1830s also saw the discovery and investigation of unusual [[hand]]-shaped footprints from [[Triassic]] rocks in [[Germany]] that were later named ''[[Chirotherium]]''. The identification of the ''Chirotherium'' trackmaker proved elusive and suggestions from researchers included everything from [[monkeys]] to giant [[toads]] and [[kangaroos]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-chirotherium-54-55" /&gt; ''Chirotherium'' proved to be an enduring ichnological mystery that would not be solved until long into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-chirotherium-57-58" /&gt;

Some of the most important ichnological research of the 19th century occurred across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[Paleontology in the United States|in the]] [[United States]]. [[Dinosaur footprints]] were first discovered there in [[1802 in paleontology|1802]] when a [[Massachusetts]] farm boy stumbled upon [[bird]]-like footprints in sandstone  that the local [[clergy]] mistakenly attributed to the [[raven]] that [[Noah]] released from his [[Noah's Ark|ark]] during the [[Biblical Flood]].&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-58" /&gt; The region's footprints came to the attention of scholars during the mid 1830s when further bird-like dinosaur tracks were discovered elsewhere [[Paleontology in Massachusetts|in the state]]. These became the lifelong preoccupation of prominent ichnologist [[Edward Hitchcock]]. Hitchcock thought the tracks were made by giant [[flightless birds]].&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-58-60" /&gt;

Late in the 19th century prisoners [[Paleontology in Nevada|in Nevada]] discovered a major [[Ice Age]] track site at what was once an ancient [[lake]] shore. Many of the trackmakers were familiar animals like [[mammoths]] or even more modern animals like [[deer]] and [[wolves]], but this track site also seemed to preserve the tracks of a [[sandal]]-wearing [[giant (mythology)|giant]].&lt;ref name="lockley-hunt-man-277" /&gt; The tracks received significant scholarly and popular attention like satire by [[Mark Twain]] who attributed the giant tracks to primitive Nevadan legislators. However, the true identity of the "giant" trackmaker was recognized by paleontologists [[Joseph Le Conte]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] as a giant [[ground sloth]], possibly of the genus ''[[Mylodon]]''.&lt;ref name="lockley-hunt-man-278-279" /&gt;

===1800s===
'''[[1802 in paleontology|1802]]'''{{anchor|1802}}
* ''Spring:'' A boy named Pliny Moody uncovered a piece of [[sandstone]] with mysterious three-toed tracks about 30&amp;nbsp;cm (1 foot) long while plowing in his father's fields near [[South Hadley, Massachusetts]]. The local clergy thought the tracks had been left by the [[raven]] that [[Noah]] sent out from the [[Noah's Ark|ark]] to look for dry land during the [[Biblical Flood]].&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-58" /&gt;

===1820s===

'''[[1820s in paleontology|1820s]]'''
* A slab of [[Permian]] sandstone preserving 24 small footprints came into the possession of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] Reverend [[Henry Duncan (minister)|Henry Duncan]]. Duncan visited the quarry where his slab was originally excavated in [[Corncockle Muir]] to see if he could find more of the fascinating impressions and successfully recovered more of them. He notified leading paleontologist [[William Buckland]] of [[Oxford University]] about his discovery.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-25" /&gt;

'''Late [[1820s in paleontology|1820s]]'''
* Fossil footprints were reported from [[Cheshire]], England in [[Triassic]] rocks known at the time as the [[New Red Sandstone]]. This is the earliest written record of fossil footprints now referred to the [[ichnogenus]] ''[[Chirotherium]]''.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-chirotherium-53" /&gt;

'''[[1828 in paleontology|1828]]'''{{anchor|1828}}
* A newspaper article was published that discussed fossil footprints, and is now regarded as the earliest written record of the subject.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-27" /&gt;

===1830s===
'''[[1831 in paleontology|1831]]'''{{anchor|1831}}
* Buckland published the first scientific description of fossil footprints about the tracks discovered at Corncockle Muir. He attributed the footprints to ancient [[tortoises]] because after having various modern reptiles walk over stretches of [[pie]] crust [[dough]], the tracks left by tortoises most closely resembled those from the Permian sandstone.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-27" /&gt;

'''[[1834 in paleontology|1834]]'''{{anchor|1834}}
[[File:Cheirotherium single print lg.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Chirotherium]]'']]
* A man named [[Helmut Barth]] was building a garden house in [[Hildburghausen]], Germany when he discovered strange, hand-shaped tracks in the sandstone he was using in the construction.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-chirotherium-53-54" /&gt; Barth's discovery would be named ''Chirotherium'' by [[Johan Jacob Kaup]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-chirotherium-54" /&gt;

'''[[1835 in paleontology|1835]]'''{{anchor|1835}}
* While the streets of [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]] were being paved, locals noticed footprints impressed in the stone. The townspeople thought the tracks were left by [[turkeys]].&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-58" /&gt; They informed James Deane, a local doctor and naturalist about the footprints. Deane found the tracks intriguing and wrote to another local scholar, [[Edward B. Hitchcock]] about the find.&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-59" /&gt; Hitchcock spent the rest of the summer investigating the local footprints fossils.&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-59-60" /&gt;

'''[[1836 in paleontology|1836]]'''{{anchor|1836}}
* Edward Hitchcock published the results of his research into the fossil footprints. He thought the trackmakers were large [[flightless birds]].&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-60" /&gt;

'''[[1847 in paleontology|1847]]'''{{anchor|1847}}
* A man surnamed Cotta wrote a letter including the first documented mention of the many Permian tracks preserved in the "[[Rotliegendes]]" of central Germany's [[Thuringian forest]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-rotliegendes-39" /&gt; "Rotliegendes" is German for "red layers" referring to a Permian sandstone layer rich in rusted [[iron]] minerals known elsewhere as the "New Red Sandstone".&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-rotliegendes-38" /&gt; The tracks Cotta reported were later named ''[[Saurichnites cottae]]'' in his honor.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-rotliegendes-39" /&gt;

'''[[1850 in paleontology|1850]]'''{{anchor|1850}}
* [[Sir William Jardine]] argued against Owen's referral of the Corncockle Muir "tortoise" footprints to ''[[Testudo (genus)|Testudo]]'' because the name applied to a specific group of modern [[turtles]] rather than to footprints. He coined the name ''[[Chelichnus]]'', meaning "turtle track" to replace Owen's use of ''Testudo'', but preserved the specific epithet "''duncani''".&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-27" /&gt;

'''[[1851 in paleontology|1851]]'''{{anchor|1851}}
* More Permian ''Chelichnus'' tracks were discovered in the highlands of Scotland, not far from [[Cummingstone]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-28" /&gt;
* [[Samuel H. Beckles]] began publishing research on the dinosaur footprints from the [[Wealden]], although he did not recognize their dinosaurian origins.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-conandoyle-201" /&gt;

'''[[1852 in paleontology|1852]]'''{{anchor|1852}}

'''[[1854 in paleontology|1854]]'''{{anchor|1854}}
* Beckles continued to publish research on the dinosaur footprints from the Wealden, referring to them as Ornithoidichnites following the nomenclature devised by Edward Hitchcock for some American tracks. Despite his use of a term implying an avian trackmaker, Beckles admitted that he did not know what kind of animals made the tracks.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-conandoyle-201" /&gt;

'''[[1858 in paleontology|1858]]'''{{anchor|1858}}
* Edward Hitchcock published a summary of his research into the fossil footprints of the [[Connecticut Valley]] area. He continued to attribute the tracks to large flightless birds that he named their footprints "ornithichnites", meaning "stone bird footprints". He divided the trackmakers into two groups, the leptodactylous birds with narrow toes and the pachydactylous birds with thick toes. He also described seven new ichnospecies for the tracks he studied.&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-60" /&gt; He also described the ichnogenus ''[[Grallator]]''.&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-theropoda-98" /&gt;

===1860s===

'''[[1860 in paleontology|1860]]'''{{anchor|1860}}
* A British scientists surnamed Williamson interpreted the ''Chirotherium'' trackmaker as a [[crocodile]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-chirotherium-56" /&gt;

'''[[1862 in paleontology|1862]]'''{{anchor|1862}}
* [[Oppel]] interpreted some tracks from the [[Solnhofen lithographic limestone]] as the tracks of [[pterosaurs]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-turtleshop-178" /&gt;

'''[[1864 in paleontology|1864]]'''{{anchor|1864}}

'''[[1865 in paleontology|1865]]'''{{anchor|1865}}
* A posthumous "supplement" to Hitchcock's monograph on the Connecticut Valley tracks was published.&lt;ref name="weishampel-young-footprints-61" /&gt;
* 1860: Some English dinosaur footprints were recognized as ''Iguanodon'' tracks. They were the first dinosaur tracks to be recognized as belonging to an individual genus.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-correct-195" /&gt;

===1870s===
[[File:Sollas sm.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[William Johnson Sollas]]]]
'''[[1877 in paleontology|1877]]'''{{anchor|1877}}
* [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] argued against Buckland and Owen's attribution of ''Chelichnus duncani'' to ancient tortoises, instead concluding that it was impossible to identify the trackmaker with the knowledge of time.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-earliest-28" /&gt;

'''[[1879 in paleontology|1879]]'''{{anchor|1879}}
* Some Welsh dinosaur tracks that had been previously displayed in front of the Jolly Sailor Pub in [[Newton Nottage]] were acquired by the [[Cardiff Museum]].&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-welshdino-79" /&gt;
* [[T. H. Thomas]] reported the Welsh dinosaur footprints to the scientific literature and noted their similarity to the "Ornithichnites" of Connecticut.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-welshdino-79" /&gt;
* [[W. J. Sollas]] independently published a report of the Welsh dinosaur footprints.&lt;ref name="lockley-meyer-welshdino-79" /&gt;

'''[[:Category:1880s in paleontology|Early 1880s]]'''

* Inmates of [[Nevada State Prison]] uncovered a large [[Pleistocene]] fossil track site while excavating sandstone. The track sites was a [[lake]]shore 50,000 years ago where familiar [[Ice Age]] animals like birds, [[deer]], [[mammoths]], and [[wolves]] left behind their footprints. However, ten of the roughly 50 trails seemed to have been left by an even stranger trackmaker; a sandaled [[giant (mythology)|giant]].&lt;ref name="lockley-hunt-man-277" /&gt;
'''[[1880 in paleontology|1880]]'''{{anchor|1880}}

'''Wireless dating''', '''Widating''' or '''Bluedating''' (from ''[[Bluetooth]]'') is a form of [[dating]] which makes use of [[mobile phone]] and [[Bluetooth]] technologies. Subscribers to the service enter details about themselves and about their ideal partner, as they would for other on-line dating services. When their mobile phone comes in the vicinity of that of another subscriber (a radius of about 10 meters) the phones exchange details of the two people. If there is a match, then both users are alerted and can seek each other out and directly [[online chat|chat]] using Bluetooth ([[bluechat]]). Settings can include an option which restricts alerts to subscribers who have a friend in common.

A group of researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ([[ETH Zurich]]) have developed a dating application called [https://web.archive.org/web/20050226125844/http://www.csg.ethz.ch/research/projects/Blue_star Bluedating] running on mobile phones with Bluetooth. There is also an implementation of wireless dating called '''Serendipity''' being pioneered by [[MIT]]'s Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Reported in ''New Scientist Magazine'' 20 March 2004.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1108">'''Cash flow loan''' is a type of debt financing, in which a bank lends funds, generally for [[working capital]], using the expected cash flows that a borrowing company generates as collateral for the loan. 

To secure repayment the bank covenants a borrower on such levels and ratios as [[enterprise value]], [[EBITDA]], total interest coverage ratio, total debt/EBITDA, and so on. They will also take a charge over the assets of the business to provide the lender with the ability to take control of the cash flows in the event of default.

In contrast, an [[asset-based loan]] is lent against company's assets. Senior stretch loan is the mix of the two.

Cashflow loans are usually senior term loans or [[subordinated debt]], being used for funding growth or financing an acquisition.

'''Charles Baker Adams''' (January 11, 1814 – January 19, 1853)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Adams, Charles Baker|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American educator and [[naturalist]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]] in 1814, the son of Charles J. Adams.
He graduated from [[Amherst College]] in 1834 with high honors (having transferred from Yale University to Amherst in 1832), and became an assistant to [[Edward Hitchcock]] in the Geological Survey of New York in 1836. In 1837, he became a tutor and a lecturer in geology at Amherst College. He left to become professor of chemistry and natural history at [[Middlebury College]] in 1838, remaining in that position through 1847.

He served as the first state geologist of Vermont from 1845 through 1848. In 1847, he left Middlebury to become professor of astronomy, zoology, and natural history at Amherst College, a position he retained till his death in 1853, aged 39. He visited the West Indies several times in the interest of science, and wrote on [[conchology]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
With the assistance of Alonzo Gray of [[Brooklyn, New York]], he published an elementary work on [[geology]].

He was the author of eleven numbers of ''Contributions to Conchology'', monographs on ''[[Stoastoma]]'' and ''[[Vitrinella]]'', and ''Catalogue of Shells Collected in [[Panama]]'' (New York, 1852).

In [[physics]], '''coefficients of fractional parentage (cfp's)''' can be used to obtain anti-symmetric many-body states for like particles. In a [[jj-coupling]] scheme they are defined by the following relation.

: &lt;math&gt;
\Psi_{1\ldots N}(j^N\alpha JM)= \sum_{\alpha_1 J_1}
\langle j^{N-1}(\alpha_1 J_1);j J\mid\} j^N \alpha J \rangle
\left[\Psi_{1\ldots N-1}(j^{N-1}\alpha_1 J_1)\otimes
\psi_N(j)\right]^J_M
 &lt;/math&gt;

The state &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{1\ldots N}(j^N\alpha JM)&lt;/math&gt; is normalized and totally anti-symmetric with respect to [[permutation]]s of all its [[N particle|{{math|''N''}} particles]], while the state &lt;math&gt; \Psi_{1\ldots N-1}(j^{N-1}\alpha_1 J_1) &lt;/math&gt; is normalized and totally anti-symmetric with respect to all its {{math|''N'' − 1}} particles.

Several possible solutions to the core-cusp problem have been proposed. Many recent studies have shown that including [[baryonic]] feedback (particularly feedback from [[supernova]]e and [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]]) can "flatten out" the core of a galaxy's dark matter profile, since feedback-driven gas outflows produce a time-varying [[gravitational potential]] that transfers energy to the orbits of the collisionless dark matter particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navarro|first1=Julio|title=The cores of dwarf galaxy haloes|journal=MNRAS|date=December 1996|volume=283|issue=3|pages=L72-L78|doi=10.1093/mnras/283.3.72L|display-authors=etal|arxiv = astro-ph/9610187 |bibcode = 1996MNRAS.283L..72N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pontzen|first1=Andrew|title=How supernova feedback turns dark matter cusps into cores|journal=Nature|date=2012|volume=421|issue=4|pages=3464–3471|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20571.x|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1106.0499 |bibcode = 2012MNRAS.421.3464P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works have shown that the core-cusp problem can be solved outside of the most widely accepted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm: simulations with [[Warm dark matter|warm]] or [[Self-interacting dark matter|self-interacting]] dark matter also produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovell|first1=Mark|title=The haloes of bright satellite galaxies in a warm dark matter universe|journal=MNRAS|date=March 2012|volume=420|issue=3|pages=2318–2324|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.20200.x|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1104.2929 |bibcode = 2012MNRAS.420.2318L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elbert|first1=Oliver|title=Core formation in dwarf haloes with self-interacting dark matter: no fine-tuning necessary|journal=MNRAS|date=October 2015|volume=453|issue=1|pages=29–37|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1470|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1412.1477 |bibcode = 2015MNRAS.453...29E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation results==

According to W.J.G. de Blok "The presence of a cusp in the centers of CDM halos is one of the earliest and strongest results derived from N-body cosmological simulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=de Blok |author2=W. J. G. |title=The core-cusp problem|year=2009|arxiv=0910.3538|bibcode = 2010AdAst2010E...5D |doi = 10.1155/2010/789293 |volume=2010 |journal=Advances in Astronomy |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical simulations for CDM structure formation predict some structure properties that conflict with astronomical observations.

==Observations==

The discrepancies range from galaxies to clusters of galaxies. "The main one that has attracted a lot of attention is the cuspy halo problem, namely that CDM models predict halos that have a high density core or have an inner profile that is too steep compared to observations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hui, L.|title=Unitarity Bounds and the Cuspy Halo Problem|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2001|volume=86|pages=3467–3470|arxiv=astro-ph/0102349|bibcode = 2001PhRvL..86.3467H |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3467|pmid=11328000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential solutions==

The conflict between numerical simulations and [[astronomical observation]]s creates numerical constraints related to the core/cusp problem. Observational constraints on halo concentrations imply the existence of theoretical constraints on cosmological parameters. According to [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], Barker, and de Blok,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McGaugh, S.S. |author2=Barker, M.K. |author3=de Blok, W.J.G. |title=A limit on the cosmological mass density and power spectrum from the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=Feb 20, 2003|volume=584|pages=566–576|arxiv = astro-ph/0210641 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...584..566M |doi = 10.1086/345806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there might be 3 basic possibilities for interpreting the halo concentration limits stated by them or anyone else:
#"CDM halos must have cusps, so the stated limits hold and provide new constraints on cosmological parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Valenzuela, O. |author2=Rhee, G. |author3=Klypin, A. |author4=Governato, F.,Stinson, G. |author5=Quinn, T. |author6=Wadsley, J. |title=Is There Evidence for Flat Cores in the Halos of Dwarf Galaxies?

#"Something (e.g. feedback, modifications of the nature of dark matter) eliminates cusps and thus the constraints on cosmology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Governato, F. |author2=Brook, C. |author3=Mayer, L. |author4=Brooks, A.,Rhee, G. |author5=Jonsson, P. |author6=Willman, B. |author7=Stinson, G. |author8=Quinn, T. |author9=Madau, P. |title=Bulgeless dwarf galaxies and dark matter cores from supernova-driven outflows|journal=Nature|date=Jan 20, 2010|volume=463|pages=203–206|arxiv = 0911.2237 |bibcode = 2010Natur.463..203G|doi = 10.1038/nature08640 |pmid=20075915}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The picture of halo formation suggested by CDM simulations is wrong."

One approach to solving the cusp-core problem in galactic halos is to consider models that modify the nature of dark matter; theorists have considered [[Warm dark matter|warm]], [[fuzzy cold dark matter|fuzzy]], [[Self-interacting dark matter|self-interacting]], and [[meta-cold dark matter|meta-]]cold dark matter, among other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McGaugh, S.S. |author2=de Blok, W.J.G. |author3=Schombert, J.M. |author4=Kuzio de Naray, R. |author5=Kim, J.H. |title=The rotation velocity attributable to dark matter at intermediate radii in disk galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=659|date=April 10, 2007|pages=149–161|arxiv = astro-ph/0612410 |bibcode = 2007ApJ...659..149M |doi = 10.1086/511807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1448">In many scientific fields, the '''degrees of freedom''' of a system is the number of parameters of the system that may vary independently. For example, a point in the plane has two degrees of freedom for [[translation (geometry)|translation]]: its two [[coordinates]]; a non-infinitesimal object on the plane might have additional degrees of freedoms related to its [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]].

In [[mathematics]], this notion is formalized as the [[dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimension]] of a [[manifold]] or an [[algebraic variety]]. When ''degrees of freedom'' is used instead of ''dimension'', this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined.
See:
* [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)]], number of independent motions that are allowed to the body or, in case of a [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] made of several bodies, number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism
* [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)]], a term used in explaining dependence on parameters, or the dimensions of a phase space
* [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)]], the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary
* [[Degrees of freedom problem]], the problem of controlling motor movement given abundant degrees of freedom

'''Earth''' is one of the [[classical element]]s, in some systems numbering four along with [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[water (classical element)|water]].

==European tradition==
[[File:La Terre Benoit Massou original.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''Earth'' (1681) by Benoît Massou, a statue of the ''[[Grande Commande]]'', with allegorical attributes inspired by [[Cesare Ripa]]’s ''Iconologia''.]]
Earth is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world.  Due to the [[hero cult]]s, and [[chthonic]] [[List of Greek mythological figures#Chthonic deities|underworld deities]], the element of ''earth'' is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later [[occultism]].

[[Empedocles]] of Acragas {{nowrap|(c. 495 –}} {{nowrap|c. 435 BCE)}} proposed four ''[[arche|archai]]'' by which to understand the [[cosmos]]: ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'','' [[Air (classical element)|air]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', and ''earth''. [[Plato]] {{nowrap|(427 –}} {{nowrap|347 BCE)}} believed the elements were geometric forms (the [[platonic solid]]s) and he assigned the [[cube]] to the element of ''earth'' in his dialogue ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22–23; [[Gregory Vlastos]], ''Plato's Universe'', pp. 66–82.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) believed ''earth'' was the heaviest element, and his theory of ''[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|natural place]]'' suggested that any ''earth–laden'' substances, would fall quickly, straight down, towards the center of the ''cosmos''.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Classical [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] myth, various goddesses 
represented the Earth, seasons, crops and fertility, including [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]; the [[Horae]] (goddesses of the seasons), and [[Proserpina]]; and [[Hades]] ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) who ruled the souls of dead in the [[Underworld]].

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Melancholia|Black bile]] was the humor identified with earth, since both were cold and dry. Other things associated with earth and black bile in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of [[fall]], since it increased the qualities of cold and aridity; the melancholic temperament (of a person dominated by the black bile humour); the [[Femininity|feminine]]; and the southern point of the compass.

[[Image:Alchemy earth symbol.svg|thumb|100px|left|Alchemical symbol for earth]]

In [[alchemy]], earth was believed to be primarily dry, and secondarily cold, (as per Aristotle). Beyond those classical attributes, the chemical substance [[salt]], was associated with earth and its [[alchemical symbol]] was a downward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Prithvi}}
'''Prithvi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|pṛthvī}}'', also ''{{IAST|pṛthivī}}'') is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''earth'' and [[mother goddess]]. According to one such tradition, she is the personification of the [[Earth]] itself; according to another, its actual [[mother]], being ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Tattwa]]'', the essence of the element earth.

As ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Mata]]'', or "[[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]", she contrasts with ''[[Dyaus Pita]]'', "[[Sky Father|father sky]]". In the [[Rigveda]], ''earth'' and sky are frequently addressed as a [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]], often indicated by the idea of two complementary "half-shells." In addition, the element Earth is associated with [[Budha]] or Mercury who represents communication, business, mathematics and other practical matters.

==Ceremonial magic==
Earth and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] system. Zelator is the elemental grade attributed to earth; this grade is also attributed to the [[Qabbalistic]] sphere [[Malkuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of earth is the [[Pentacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of earth is [[Uriel (archangel)|Uriel]], the angel is Phorlakh, the ruler is Kerub, the king is Ghob, and the earth [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[gnome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is considered to be passive; it is represented by the symbol for [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], and it is referred to the lower left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

It is sometimes represented by its [[Tattva]] or by a downward pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it.

==Modern witchcraft==
Earth is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n and [[Pagan]] traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, witchcraft for tomorrow, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other traditions==
In [[East Asia]], [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] is sometimes seen as the equivalent of ''earth'' and is represented by the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)]], known as 白虎 (''Bái Hǔ'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], ''Byakko'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Bạch Hổ'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and ''Baekho'' (백호, [[Hanja]]:白虎) in [[Korean language|Korean]].  ''Earth'' is represented in the [[Aztec]] religion by a house; to the [[Hindu]]s, a lotus; to the [[Scythians]], a plough; to the [[Culture of Greece|Greeks]], a wheel; and in [[Christian]] [[iconography]]; bulls and birds.

[[File:ECSP.jpg|thumb|]]The '''Environmental Change and Security Program (ECSP)''' is one of several programs and projects that make up the Global Resilience and Sustainability Program at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]. ECSP was founded in 1994 to study the connections among environmental, health, and [[Global population|population]] dynamics and their links to conflict, [[Human security|human insecurity]], and [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref name="About ECSP"&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/about-ecsp About ECSP]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

ECSP holds events and publishes research and multimedia content with the aim of connecting scholars, policymakers, the media, and practitioners. The program currently has three primary topical focus areas:&lt;ref name="About ECSP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10706">'''Filter theory''' is a sociological theory concerning [[dating]] and [[mate selection]]. It proposes that [[social structure]] limits the number of eligible candidates for a mate.&lt;ref name="Regan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela C. Regan|title=The mating game: a primer on love, sex, and marriage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-a85Iu2NCoC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=12 October 2011|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5705-2|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, this takes place due to [[homogamy (sociology)|homogamy]], as people seek to date and marry only those similar to them (characteristics that are often taken into account are age, race, social status and religion).&lt;ref name="Regan2008"/&gt; Homogamy is the idea of marriage between spouses who share similar characteristics, where heterogamy denotes marriage between spouses of different characteristics. The idea of "opposites attract: is heterogamous as well as the idea that one spouse has complementing, not similar characteristics to the other.&lt;ref name=Winch&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winch|first1=Robert|title=Mate-Selection A Study of Complementary Needs|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

* Helpful terms in defining filter theory are "[[endogamy]]", which indicates that both partners come from the same group (ethnicity, religion, culture, age similarity, lifestyle, etc) and may also carry cultural sanctions against marrying outside of one's own group;&lt;ref name="Winch"/&gt;{{rp|4}} and "[[exogamy]]" which indicates marrying out of one's own social group. Examples of exogamy include marrying outside of one's own race or religion.

== Psychology perspective ==

* Filtering model created by psychologists Louis Janda and Karen Klende-Hamel&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Feldman, Robert S. "Gender and Sexuality." ''Life Span Development: A Topical Approach''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall/Pearson, 2011. 389. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Married Couples → Eligible Partner
#* Starting with the base of all people, remove married couples, who are not available to be in a ::relationship, and Eligible Partners remain; all those who are available to be in a relationship.
# Compatibility Filter →  Eligible Individuals Attracted to Each Other
#* The Compatibility Filter removes all people who are not attracted to each other, leaving only those ::who are compatible
# Physical Attractiveness Filter → Homogamous Potential Partners
#* Outside appearance and attraction
#* People are more likely to be physically attracted to those who look similar to themselves.  Humans have inherited the innate instinct to survive and reproduce and must do both within the confines of the particular environment where they live, from their animal ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, Alexander. ''Beyond Choice :Reproductive Freedom in the 21st Century''. New York, NY, USA: Public Affairs, 2005. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 29 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#* Nevertheless, the importance of physical homogamy in marital relationships is decreasing&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#* This can be due to interracial marriage
# Similar and Complementary Views Filter
#* People are more likely to choose to be with a partner who think very similarly to themselves while straying from people with conflicting ideas and views.
# Potential Field of Partners
#* After all filters have been applied, this group of people remains as potential partners.
# People Who Live in Proximity → Total Field of Potential Partners&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#* Of all the people who are potential partners, for practical reason people choose partners who are close by.
#* With growing communications and technological advances, proximity is not limited to being geographically nearby.
#* The spreading availability of online dating is increasing the ability to communicate without face-to-face interactions and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filipinadatingsites.net/|title=Way of Online Dating|last=Marshal|first=Peter|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociological perspective ==
* Different cultures have different desired aspects in a partner, but all of these different aspects fall into the same categories.  For example, love-marriage selection criteria seem to reflect individuals' personal concerns, such as personal and interpersonal qualities of the prospective mate and compatibility issues, while arranged-marriage selection criteria, not surprisingly, reflect concerns of the total family unit (Blood 1972). These family concerns include socioeconomic status, health, strength, fertility, temperament, and emotional stability of the prospective spouse. Yet, the similarities in characteristics between the two partners is consistent in both marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Marilyn, and Carstensen, Laura L., eds. Inside the American Couple : New Thinking, New Challenges. Berkeley, CA, USA: University of California Press, 2002. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 29 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* People are drawn to someone with the similar lifestyle and standard of living.  These people have a higher chance of common personal tastes, opinions and values with one another, making it easier to establish affinitive relations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Degenne, Alain, and Forse, Michel. Introducing Social Networks. London, GBR: SAGE Publications Inc. (US), 1999. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 2 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects can be assimilated through the different social networks.  Contrary to some belief, the idea that having a common profession is not the strongest bond of compatibility; educational homophily has a trend that confirms cultural differences and similarities are stronger than occupational stratification.  This is basically saying that even if working in proximity with someone in a similar work force is does not necessarily lead to a stronger bond than having educational similarities.  Some of this leads back to the similarities between cultures and education; in education there is a separation of the larger peer group into smaller peer groups that share common economic status, subject of study, and/or backgrounds. This allows homogamy between these subgroups of peers and thus creating smaller groups that share two or more similarities.  This example of status and educational culture reflects how people meet in the world through social networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Theory of complementary needs==
* A study carried out by sociologist Robert F. Winch on twenty five couples for the purpose of testing out the theory of the ways in which complementariness appears to function in mate-selection. The theory is both psychological and sociological because it derives from the Freudian tradition, but also concerns the formation of a social group; the marital dyad.&lt;ref name="Winch" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The theory states that we choose partners based on their needs being complementary to our own. It begins with the observation that in the United States, a couple is first formed by the meeting and acquainting of one another, and then by falling in love before deciding to marry. As a result, Winch proposes that, "since meeting appears to be a precondition for falling in love, what observations can we make about whom one meets or is likely to meet?"&lt;ref name="Winch" /&gt;{{rp|12}} Well, he states, it is more common than not that if we frequent certain places, we will most likely find someone who is, "accustomed to the same level of consumption, that they will cherish similar values, and that they will harbor similar aversions and prejudices".&lt;ref name="Winch" /&gt;{{rp|13}} In other words, an atheist is unlikely to encounter a habitué of Sunday mass, as a man who frequents the bar is unlikely to encounter a recovering alcoholic. As social psychologist Andrea B. Hollingshead states, "next to race, religion is the most decisive factor in the segregation of males and females into categories that are approved or disapproved with respect to nuptiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollingshead|first1=A. B.|title=Cultural Factors in the Selection of Marriage Mates|journal=American Sociological Review|pages=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Winch found that people tend to associate with and to marry among persons similar to themselves, but that it is also thought to be desirable and right for one to marry "among one's own" in regard to race, religion, etc.&lt;ref name="Winch" /&gt;{{rp|13}} He also argued that there is a set of variables which homogamy has been shown to function: race, religion, social class, broad occupational grouping, location of residence, income, age, level of education, intelligence, etc.&lt;ref name="Winch" /&gt;{{rp|14}} With these variables, he says, the sort of people with whom we shall most likely interact with are chosen and in turn, they define a "field of eligible spouse-candidates".&lt;ref name="Winch" /&gt;{{rp|14}} These 'spouse-candidates' are not just people within in close proximity to us, but rather, people who we pass on a day-to-day basis because of our routine and may have never even noticed. In other words, someone's spouse may end up being the man sitting behind them in church every Sunday, or the woman they are running next to at the gym.

==Considerations==
* While mate-selection has been found to be mostly homogamous in regard to social characteristics,&lt;ref name=Winch/&gt;{{rp|5}} such as religion, the psycho-dynamic of couples has not been. According to Sigmund Freud, there was a tendency for self-loving people to mate with those who were emotionally dependent and similarly, one may fall in love with a particular person because they represent a perfection which the other has unsuccessfully striven to attain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freud|first1=Sigmund|title=Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego|pages=30–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in relation to Winchs' Theory of Complementary Needs which says people look for qualities in a partner that will compliment their own. 
* According to the [[Principles of grouping|similarity principle]], the more two people perceive themselves to be similar, the more likely their relationship is to grow and succeed. In this, the word perceive holds a lot of significance because one may perceive that they are more similar to someone than they actually are and therefore believe they have more in common than they really do. Additionally, an individual may be inclined to over look differences because importance is held over certain similarities more than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammond|first1=Ron|last2=Cheney|first2=Paul|last3=Pearsey|first3=Raewyn|title=Sociology of the Family|url=http://freesociologybooks.com/Sociology_Of_The_Family/08_Dating_and_Mate_Selection.php|website=Free Sociology Books|publisher=RockyRidge Press|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology launched its online Master of Science in Computer Science degree in January 2014.&lt;ref name=omscspr/&gt; The program was conceived by John P. Imlay Jr., Dean of Computing [[Zvi Galil]], and Udacity founder [[Sebastian Thrun]].&lt;ref name=insidehighered/&gt; It was offered in partnership with Udacity and AT&amp;T and delivered through the [[massive open online course]] format,&lt;ref name=insidehighered/&gt; and was designed to provide a low-cost, high-quality alternative to traditional master's degree programs by delivering instructional content and academic support via the massive open online course format.&lt;ref name=omscspr/&gt; Charles Isbell, a senior associate dean at the College of Computing, helped lead the effort.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

As of Spring 2018, the program has 6,365 enrolled students located in 110 countries.&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt; It admits all applicants deemed to possess a reasonable chance of success&amp;mdash;almost two-thirds of applicants to date&amp;mdash;which is significantly higher than the university’s on-campus graduate admissions rate.&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt; From its creation in 2014 until the spring semester of 2018, the program has graduated nearly 900 students and received nearly 20,000 applications. The program has received significant media attention since its announcement in May 2013, including a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and a segment on the [[PBS NewsHour]] series "Rethinking Education."&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/education/masters-degree-is-new-frontier-of-study-online.html|title=Master’s Degree Is New Frontier of Study Online|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/online-graduate-programs-offer-degrees-significant-savings/|title=How online graduate programs offer degrees at significant savings|date=September 5, 2017|work=[[PBS Newshour]]|accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum and culture==
The online master's program currently offers 30 courses and four specializations&amp;mdash;Computational Perception and Robotics, Computing Systems, Interactive Intelligence, and Machine Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses|title=Current Courses|publisher=[[Georgia Tech College of Computing]]|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/program-info/specializations|title=Specializations|publisher=[[Georgia Tech College of Computing]]|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study entitled “Can Online Delivery Increase Access to Education,” by [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard University Associate Professor Joshua Goodman, [[Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts]] at the Georgia Institute of Technology Associate Professor Julia Melkers, and [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]] Associate Professor Amanda Pallais, explored the structure and industry impact of the online master's program and concluded that it supplies the need of “a vast untapped market for highly affordable degrees from prestigious colleges.”&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Joshua| last = Goodman| first2 = Julia| last2 = Melkers|first3=Amanda|last3=Pallais | title=Can Online Delivery Increase Access to Education|date= September 2016|publisher=[[Harvard Kennedy School]]|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=11348&amp;type=WPN|series=HKS Faculty Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the online format of the program, social media has played a significant role in the development of robust student communities on social media, including a student-led community on [[Google+]] with about 7,500 members.&lt;ref name=PCMag&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/343924/dont-dismiss-georgia-techs-6-600-online-masters-degree|title=Don't Dismiss Georgia Tech's $6,000 Online Master's Degree|work=[[PC Magazine]]|last=Fenton|first=William|date=April 22, 2016|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/communities/108902554607547634726|title=Georgia Tech OMSCS|website=[[Google+]]|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also utilizes an [[artificial intelligence]] teaching assistant called “Jill” Watson, built using IBM’s [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] platform. Jill is able to answer questions posed in natural language and assists students enrolled in the program's Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence course, led by Professor Ashok Goel.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-your-teacher-sounds-like-a-robot-you-might-be-on-to-something-1462546621|title=Imagine Discovering That Your Teaching Assistant Really Is a Robot|last=Korn|first=Melissa|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 6, 2016|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Highlands J (HJ) virus''' is a [[zoonotic]] [[alphavirus]] native to North and South America. It maintains a [[natural reservoir]] in the [[songbird]] population of freshwater [[swamps]] (generally [[scrub jay]]s and [[blue jay]]s) and is transmitted by the bite of the female ''[[Culiseta|Culiseta melanura]]'' [[mosquito]].

Though nearly identical in structure and natural cycle to the [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]], it is considerably less [[virulent]] than its cousin, causing relatively mild symptoms in its primary [[bird|avian]] reservoir and only nominally capable of transmission to [[mammals]]. A 1995 study conducted in [[Florida]] swampland found that 15% of swamp-dwelling jays tested positive for HJ [[antibodies]], all of which were [[asymptomatic]] and in apparent good health. Recorded bird deaths from HJ infection are uncommon but not rare, and include several domestic [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s at a commercial facility and young broiler [[chicken]]s in an experimental setting.

Transmission to [[equine]]s or humans via mosquito is also possible, though even more rare. During the 1990-1991 [[St. Louis encephalitis]] outbreak in [[Missouri]], 4 patients were found to be [[comorbid]]ly infected with SLE and HJ, though no harmful effects were attributed to the HJ alone. A limited survey of swamp-dwelling [[rodent]]s in Florida found one [[cotton mouse]] and one [[cotton rat]] with antibodies to HJ, both asymptomatic. The sole mammalian fatality attributed to HJ was a Florida [[horse]] originally diagnosed with [[Western equine encephalitis]] in 1964, which was later redetermined in 1989 to have been caused by HJ.&lt;ref&gt;Rutledge, C. Roxanne. ''"Mosquito-transmitted Highlands J virus in Florida"''. [[University of Florida]]. &lt;http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/IN/IN51500.pdf&gt; Retrieved 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its negligible virulence in humans, it is often tested for in US domestic [[mosquito control]] programs as an indicator of fruitful conditions for other mosquito-borne zoonoses to multiply.

The '''history of gaseous fuel''', important for lighting, heating, and cooking purposes throughout most of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, began with the development of [[analytical chemistry|analytical]] and [[pneumatic chemistry]] in the 18th century. The manufacturing process for "synthetic [[fuel gas]]es" (also known as "manufactured fuel gas", "manufactured gas" or simply "gas") typically consisted of the [[gasification]] of combustible materials, usually coal, but also wood and oil. The coal was gasified by heating the coal in enclosed ovens with an oxygen-poor atmosphere. The fuel gases generated were [[mixtures]] of many [[chemical substances]], including [[hydrogen]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[ethylene]], and could be burnt for heating and lighting purposes. [[Coal gas]], for example, also contains significant quantities of unwanted [[sulfur]] and [[ammonia]] compounds, as well as heavy [[hydrocarbons]], and so the manufactured fuel gases needed to be purified before they could be used.

The first attempts to manufacture fuel gas in a commercial way were made in the period 1795–1805 in France by [[Philippe LeBon]], and in England by [[William Murdoch]]. Although precursors can be found, it was these two engineers who elaborated the technology with commercial applications in mind. Frederick Winsor was the key player behind the creation of the first gas utility, the London-based [[Gas Light and Coke Company]], incorporated by royal charter in April 1812.

Manufactured gas utilities were founded first in England, and then in the rest of Europe and North America in the 1820s. The technology increased in scale. After a period of competition, the business model of the gas industry matured in monopolies, where a single company provided gas in a given zone. The ownership of the companies varied from outright municipal ownership, such as in Manchester, to completely private corporations, such as in London and most North American cities. Gas companies thrived during most of the nineteenth century, usually returning good profits to their shareholders, but were also the subject of many complaints over price.

The most important use of manufactured gas in the early 19th century was for [[gas lighting]], as a convenient substitute for candles and oil lamps in the home.  Gas lighting became the first widespread form of [[Street light#gas lamp lighting|street lighting]].  For this use, gases that burned with a highly luminous flame, "illuminating gases", were needed, in contrast to other uses (e.g. as fuel) where the heat output was the main consideration.  Accordingly some gas mixtures of low intrinsic luminosity, such as [[Coal gas#Gas for industrial use|blue water gas]], were enriched with oil to make them more suitable for street lighting. 

In the second half of the 19th century, the manufactured fuel gas industry diversified out of lighting and into heat and cooking. The threat from electrical light in the later 1870s and 1880s drove this trend strongly. The gas industry did not cede the [[gas lighting]] market to electricity immediately, as the invention of the [[Welsbach mantle]], a refractory mesh bag heated to incandescence by a mostly non-luminous flame within, dramatically increased the efficiency of gas lighting. [[Acetylene]] was also used from about 1898 for [[gas stove|gas cooking]] and [[gas lighting]] (see [[Carbide lamp]]) on a smaller scale, although its use too declined with the advent of electric lighting, and [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] for cooking.&lt;ref name=CGA100&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cganet.com/docs/100th.pdf|publisher=www.cganet.com|date=11 September 2013|title=Celebrating 100 Years as The Standard for Safety: The Compressed Gas Association, Inc. 1913 – 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other technological developments in the late nineteenth century include the use of [[water gas]] and machine stoking, although these were not universally adopted.

In the 1890s, [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] from [[natural gas field]]s in Texas and Oklahoma were built to Chicago and other cities, and [[natural gas]] was used to supplement manufactured fuel gas supplies, eventually completely displacing it. Gas ceased to be manufactured in North America by 1966 (with the exception of Indianapolis and Honolulu), while it continued in Europe until the 1980s. "Manufactured gas" is again being evaluated as a fuel source, as energy utilities look towards [[coal gasification]] once again as a potentially cleaner way of generating power from coal, although nowadays such gases are likely to be called "[[synthetic natural gas]]".

== Early history of fuel gas ==

=== Precursors ===
[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|left|thumb|Alessandro Volta]]
Pneumatic chemistry developed in the eighteenth century with the work of scientists such as [[Stephen Hales]], [[Joseph Black]], [[Joseph Priestley]], and [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier]], and others. Until the eighteenth century, gas was not recognized as a separate state of matter. Rather, while some of the mechanical properties of gases were understood, as typified by [[Robert Boyle]]'s experiments and the development of the [[air pump]], their chemical properties were not. Gases were regarded in keeping the Aristotelean tradition of four elements as being air, one of the four fundamental elements. The different sorts of airs, such as putrid airs or inflammable air, were looked upon as [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]] with some impurities, much like muddied water.

After Joseph Black realized that [[carbon dioxide]] was in fact a different sort of gas altogether from atmospheric air, other gases were identified, including [[hydrogen]] by [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1766. [[Alessandro Volta]] expanded the list with his discovery of methane in 1776. It had also been known for a long time that inflammable gases could be produced from most combustible materials, such as coal and wood, through the process of [[distillation]]. Stephen Hales, for example, had written about the phenomenon in the ''Vegetable Staticks'' in 1722. In the last two decades of the eighteenth century, as more gases were being discovered and the techniques and instruments of pneumatic chemistry became more sophisticated, a number of natural philosophers and engineers thought about using gases in medical and industrial applications. One of the first such uses was [[Balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]] beginning in 1783, but other uses soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gyung Kim|first=Mi Gyung|title=‘Public’ Science: Hydrogen Balloons and Lavoisier's Decomposition of Water|journal=Annals of Science|date=March 2006|volume=63|issue=3|pages=291–318|doi=10.1080/00033790600610494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the results of the ballooning craze of 1783–1784 was the first implementation of lighting by manufactured gas. A professor of natural philosophy at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] [[Jan Pieter Minckeleers]] and two of his colleagues were asked by their patron, the Duke of [[Arenberg]], to investigate ballooning. They did so, building apparatus to generate lighter than air inflammable gases from coal and other inflammable substances. In 1785 Minckeleers used some of this apparatus to gasify coal to light his lecture hall at the university. He did not extend gas lighting much beyond this, and when he was forced to flee Leuven during the [[Brabant Revolution]], he abandoned the project altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaspers|first=P. A. Th. M.|author2=J. Roegiers|authorlink2=Jan Roegiers|title=Le "Mémoire sur l'air inflammable" de Jean-Pierre Minckelers (1748 - 1824): édition critique d'après les manuscrits et l'édition originale de 1784|journal=Lias|year=1983|volume=10|pages=217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippe LeBon and the Thermolamp ===
[[File:Philippe Lebon.png|thumb|right|Philippe LeBon]]
[[File:Ecyclopedie Roret Lebon oven.png|left|LeBon's thermolamp, from his patent (1799 and 1801)|thumb]]
[[Philippe LeBon]] was a French civil engineer working in the public engineering corps who became interested while at university in distillation as an industrial process for the manufacturing of materials such as tar and oil. He graduated from the engineering school in 1789, and was assigned to Angoulême. There, he investigated distillation, and became aware that the gas produced in the distillation of wood and coal could be useful for lighting, heating, and as an energy source in engines. He took out a patent for distillation processes in 1794, and continued his research, eventually designing a distillation oven known as the ''thermolamp''. He applied for and received a patent for this invention in 1799, with an addition in 1801. He launched a marketing campaign in Paris in 1801 by printing a pamphlet and renting a house where he put on public demonstrations with his apparatus.  His goal was to raise sufficient funds from investors to launch a company, but he failed to attract this sort of interest, either from the French state or from private sources. He was forced to abandon the project and return to the civil engineering corps. Although he was given a forest concession by the French government to experiment with the manufacture of tar from wood for naval use, he never succeed with the thermolamp, and died in uncertain circumstances in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Veillerette, François. ''Philippe Lebon ou l'homme aux mains de lumière'', Ed N Mourot, 1987. ''(in french)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the thermolamp received some interest in France, in Germany interest was the greatest. A number of books and articles were written on the subject in the period 1802–1812. There were also thermolamps designed and built in Germany, the most important of which were by Zachaus Winzler, an Austrian chemist who ran a saltpetre factory in Blansko. Under the patronage of the aristocratic zu Salm family, he built a large one in Brno. He moved to Vienna to further his work. The thermolamp, however, was used primarily for making charcoal and not for the production of gases.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, Arthur (1958), "Gas for light and heat" in ''A History of Technology'' Volume IV The Industrial Revolution c 1750 to c 1850, edited Charles Singer, et al, Clarendon, Oxford {{ISBN|978-019858108-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HalvaDenk|first=Helma|title=Bedeutende Südmährer|url=http://www.suedmaehren.eu/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=21|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Murdock and Boulton &amp; Watt ===
[[File:William Murdoch (1754-1839).jpg|left|thumb|William Murdock]]
[[William Murdoch]] (sometimes Murdock) (1754–1839) was an engineer working for the firm of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]], when, while investigating distillation processes sometime in 1792–1794, he began using coal gas for illumination. He was living in [[Redruth]] in Cornwall at the time, and made some small scale experiments with lighting his own house with coal gas. He soon dropped the subject until 1798, when he moved to [[Birmingham]] to work at Boulton &amp; Watt's home base of [[Soho, Birmingham|Soho]]. Boulton &amp; Watt then instigated another small-scale series of experiments. With ongoing patent litigation and their main business of steam engines to attend to, the subject was dropped once again. Gregory Watt, James Watt's second son, while traveling in Europe saw Lebon's demonstrations and wrote a letter to his brother, [[James Watt Jr.]], informing him of this potential competitor. This prompted James Watt Jr. to begin a gaslight development program at Boulton &amp; Watt that would scale up the technology and lead to the first commercial applications of gaslight.&lt;ref name = "fred"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Dean|title=The rise of the gas industry in Britain|year=1949|publisher=British Gas Council|location=London|author2=A Douglas Lacey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Griffiths"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |first1=John |title= The Third Man, The Life and Times of William Murdoch 1754-1839|year=1992 |publisher=Andre Deutsch |location=London |isbn= 0-233-98778-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an initial installation at the [[Soho Foundry]] in 1803–1804, Boulton &amp; Watt prepared an apparatus for the textile firm of Philips &amp; Lee in Salford near Manchester in 1805–1806. This was to be their only major sale until late 1808. [[George Augustus Lee]] was a major motivating force behind the development of the apparatus. He had an avid interest in technology, and had introduced a series of technological innovations at the Salford Mill, such as iron frame construction and steam heating. He continued to encourage the development of gaslight technology at Boulton &amp; Watt.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Griffiths"/&gt;

=== Winsor and the Gas Light and Coke Company ===
[[File:A Peep at the Gas Lights in Pall Mall Rowlandson 1809.jpg|thumb|''A Peep at the Gas-lights in Pall Mall'': A contemporary caricature of Winsor's lighting of Pall Mall, by George Rowlandson (1809)]]

The first company to provide manufactured gas to consumer as a utility was the London-based [[Gas Light and Coke Company]]. It was founded through the efforts of a German émigré, [[Frederick Albert Winsor|Frederick Winsor]], who had witnessed Lebon's demonstrations in Paris. He had tried unsuccessfully to purchase a thermolamp from Lebon, but remained taken with the technology, and decided to try his luck, first in his hometown of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], and then in London in 1804. Once in London, Winsor began an intense campaign to find investors for a new company that would manufacture gas apparatus and sell gas to consumers. He was successful in finding investors, but the legal form of the company was a more difficult problem. By the [[Bubble Act]] of 1720, all [[joint-stock companies]] above a certain number of shareholders in England needed to receive a [[royal charter]] to incorporate, which meant that an act of Parliament was required.

Winsor waged his campaign intermittently to 1807, when the investors constituted a committee charged with obtaining an act of Parliament. They pursued this task over the next three years, encountering adversities en route, the most important of which was the resistance by Boulton &amp; Watt in 1809. In that year, the committee made a serious attempt to get the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to pass a bill empowering the king to grant the charter, but Boulton &amp; Watt felt their gaslight apparatus manufacturing business was threatened and mounted an opposition through their allies in Parliament. Although a parliamentary committee recommended approval, it was defeated on the third reading.

The following year, the committee tried again, succeeding with the acquiescence of Boulton &amp; Watt because they renounced all powers to manufacture apparatus for sale. The act required that the company raise £100,000 before they could request a charter, a condition it took the next two years to fill. [[George III]] granted the charter in 1812.

== Manufactured gas 1812–1825 ==

=== Manufactured gas in England ===
[[File:Gas plant Accum (1815).JPEG|thumb|right|A coloured plate of a gas plant from [[Frederick Accum]]'s ''A Practical Treatise on Gas-light'' (1815)]]
From 1812 to approximately 1825, manufactured gas was predominantly an English technology. A number of new gas utilities were founded to serve London and other cities in the UK after 1812. Liverpool, Exeter, and Preston were the first in 1816. Others soon followed; by 1821, no town with population over 50,000 was without gaslight. Five years later, there were only two towns over 10,000 that were without gaslight.&lt;ref name=Falkus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Falkus|first=M. E.|title=The British Gas Industry before 1850|journal=The Economic History Review|date=December 1967|volume=20|issue=3|pages=494–508|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1967.tb00150.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In London, the growth of gaslight was rapid. New companies were founded within a few years of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and a period of intense competition followed as companies competed for consumers on the boundaries of their respective zones of operations. [[Frederick Accum]], in the various editions of his book on gaslight, gives a good sense of how rapidly the technology spread in the capital. In 1815, he wrote that there were 4000 lamps in the city, served by 26&amp;nbsp;miles (42&amp;nbsp;km) of mains. In 1819, he raised his estimate to 51,000 lamps and 288&amp;nbsp;miles (463&amp;nbsp;km) of mains. Likewise, there were only two gasworks in London in 1814, and by 1822, there were seven and by 1829, there were 200 companies.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;{{rp|72}} The government did not regulate the industry as a whole until 1816, when an act of Parliament created and a post of inspector for gasworks, the first holder of which was [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Congreve]]. Even then, no laws were passed regulating the entire industry until 1847, although a bill was proposed in 1822, which failed due to opposition from gas companies.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The charters approved by Parliament did, however, contain various regulations such as how the companies could break up the pavement, etc.

=== Manufactured gas in Europe and North America ===
France's first gas company was also promoted by Frederick Winsor after he had to flee England in 1814 due to unpaid debts and tried to found another gas company in Paris, but it failed in 1819. The government was also interested in promoting the industry, and in 1817 commissioned Chabrol de Volvic to study the technology and build a prototype plant, also in Paris. The plant provided gas for lighting the hôpital Saint Louis, and the experiment was judged successful.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Williot, Naissance d'un service public: le gaz a Paris, Rive droite-Institu d'histoire de l'industrie, 1999, p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Louis XVIII]] then decided to give further impulse to the development of the French industry by sending people to England to study the situation there, and to install gaslight at a number of prestigious buildings, such as the Opera building, the national library, etc. A public company was created for this purpose in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Williot, Naissance d'un service public: le gaz a Paris, Rive droite-Institu d'histoire de l'industrie, 1999, p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt; Private companies soon followed, and by 1822, when the government moved to regulate the industry, there were four in operation in the capital. The regulations passed then prevented the companies from competing, and Paris was effectively divided between the various companies operating as monopolies in their own zones.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Williot, Naissance d'un service public: le gaz a Paris, Rive droite-Institu d'histoire de l'industrie, 1999, p. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaslight spread to other European countries. In 1817, a company was founded in Brussels by P. J. Meeus-Van der Maelen, and began operating the following year. By 1822, there were companies in Amsterdam and Rotterdam using English technology.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Körting, Geschichte der Deutschen Gasindustrie mit Vorgeschichte und bestimmenden Einflǜssen des Auslandes, Vulkan, 1963, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, gaslight was used on a small scale from 1816 onwards, but the first gaslight utility was founded by English engineers and capital. In 1824, the [[Imperial Continental Gas Association]] was founded in London to establish gas utilities in other countries. Sir William Congreve, one if its leaders, signed an agreement with the government in Hanover, and the gas lamps were used on streets for the first time in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Körting, Geschichte der Deutschen Gasindustrie mit Vorgeschichte und bestimmenden Einflǜssen des Auslandes, Vulkan, 1963, p. 104-5, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaslight was first introduced to the US in 1816 in Baltimore by [[Rembrandt Peale|Rembrandt]] and Rubens Peale, who lit their museum with gaslight, which they had seen on a trip to Europe. The brothers convinced a group of wealthy people to back them in a larger enterprise. The local government passed a law allowing the Peales and their associates to lay mains and light the streets. A company was incorporated for this purpose in 1817. After some difficulties with the apparatus and financial problems, the company hired an English engineer with experience in gaslight. It began to flourish, and by the 1830s, the company was supplying gas to 3000 domestic customers and 100 street lamps.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Erlick, "The Peales and Gas Lights in Baltimore", Maryland Historical Magazine, 80, 9-18(1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Companies in other cities followed, the second being Boston Gas Light in 1822 and New York Gas Light Company in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makholm|first=Jeff D.|title="Decoupling" For Energy Distributors: Changing 19th Century Tariff Structures To Address 21st Century Energy Markets|journal=Energy Law Journal|year=2008|volume=29|pages=157–172|url=http://www.nera.com/extImage/PUB_Decoupling_May2008.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A gas works was built in Philadelphia in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Works In The United States Of America|year=1841|publisher=John Weale|location=London|pages=1–85|editor=William Strickland, Edward H Gill and Henry R.

==Legal, regulatory, environmental, health, and safety aspects of gas manufacture==
Gas lighting was one of the most debated technologies of the first industrial revolution. In Paris, as early as 1823, controversy forced the government to devise safety standards (Fressoz, 2007). The residues produced from distilled coal were either drained into rivers or stored in basins which polluted (and still pollute) the soil.

[[Case law]] in the UK and the US clearly held though, the construction and operation of a gas-works was not the creation of a public nuisance ''in se'', due to the reputation of gas-works as highly undesirable neighbors, and the noxious pollution known to issue from such, especially in the early days of manufactured gas, gas-works were on extremely short notice from the courts that (detectable) contamination outside of their grounds – especially in residential districts – would be severely frowned upon. Indeed, many actions for the abatement of [[nuisance]]s brought before the courts did result in unfavorable verdicts for gas manufacturers – in one study on early environmental law, actions for nuisance involving gas-works resulted in findings for the plaintiffs 80% of the time, compared with an overall plaintiff victory rate of 28.5% in industrial nuisance cases.&lt;ref name="Nuisance - Rosen."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Christine Meisner|date=October 2003|title='Knowing' Industrial Pollution: Nuisance Law and the Power of Tradition in a Time of Rapid Economic Change, 1840–1864.|journal=Environmental History|publisher=History Cooperative|volume=8|issue=4|issn=1084-5453|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.4/rosen.html|accessdate=January 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305015413/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/eh/8.4/rosen.html|archivedate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Injunction]]s both preliminary and permanent could and were often issued in cases involving gas works. For example, the ill reputation of gas-works became so well known that in ''City of Cleveland vs. Citizens' Gas Light Co.'', [[case citation|20 N. J. Eq. 201]], a court went so far as to enjoin a ''future'' gas-works not yet even built – preventing it from causing ''annoying and offensive vapours and odors'' in the first place. The injunction not only regulated the gas manufacturing process – forbidding the use of lime purification – but also provided that if nuisances of any sort were to issue from the works – a permanent injunction forbidding the production of gas would issue from the court.&lt;ref name="ClevelandWorks - Injunction"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinney|first=Wm. Mark|author2=Mitchie, Thos.

Taylor'', [[Case citation|10 Beavan 80]], that ''I have been rather astonished to hear the effects of gas works treated as nothing...every man, in these days, must have sufficient experience, to enable him to come to the conclusion, that, whether a nuisance or not, a gas manufactory is a very disagreeable thing. Nobody can doubt that the volatile products which arise from the distillation of coal are extremely offensive. It is quite contrary to common experience to say they are not so...every man knows it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1905|title=The English Reports (Rolls III: Bevan 8 – 12)|publisher=Wm. Green and Sons; Stevens &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=Edinburgh, Scotland; London, England|volume=L|page=513|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUYwAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, as time went by, gas-works began to be seen as more as a double-edged sword – and eventually as a positive good, as former nuisances were abated by technological improvements, and the full benefits of gas became clear. There were several major impetuses that drove this phenomenon:

*regulation of pollution from gas-works (in the case of the UK, with the passage of the Gas-works Clauses Act 1847), which increased the cost of pollution, previously being near zero, leading to the development of technologies that abated the ongoing pollution nuisances (in many cases, turning discarded former pollutants into profitable by-products);
*the rise of the "smoke nuisance" in the 1850s, brought about by the domestic and commercial use of coal, in many cities and metropolises; direct combustion of coal being a particularly notorious source of pollution; which the widespread use of gas could abate, especially with the commencement of using gas for purposes other than illuminating during the 1870s; for cooking, for the heating of dwelling-houses, for making domestic hot water, for raising steam, for industrial and chemical purposes, and for stationary internal combustion engine-driving purposes – which were previously met by employing coal;
*the development of high-pressure gas mains, and compressors (1900s); these were capable of efficiently transporting gas over long distances, allowing one manufactured gas plant to supply a relatively large area – leading to the concentration of gas-manufacturing operations, instead of their geographic distribution; this resulted in gas-works being able to be located away from residential and commercial districts, where their presence could result in discomfort and concern for the inhabitants thereof;

Both the era of consolidation of gas-works through high-pressure distribution systems (1900s–1930s) and the end of the era of manufactured gas (1955–1975) saw gas-works being shut down due to redundancies. What brought about the end of manufactured gas was that pipelines began to be built to bring natural gas directly from the well to gas distribution systems. Natural gas was superior to the manufactured gas of that time, being cheaper – extracted from wells rather than manufactured in a gas-works – more user friendly – coming from the well requiring little, if any, purification – and safer – due to the lack of carbon monoxide in the distributed product. Upon being shut down, few former manufactured gas plant sites were brought to an acceptable level of environmental cleanliness to allow for their re-use, at least by contemporary standards. In fact, many were literally abandoned in place, with process wastes left ''in situ'', and never adequately disposed of.

As the wastes produced by former manufactured gas plants were persistent in nature, they often (as of 2009) still contaminate the site of former manufactured gas plants: the waste causing the most concern today is primarily coal tar (mixed long-chain aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, a byproduct of coal carbonization), while "blue billy" (a noxious byproduct of lime purification contaminated with cyanides) as well as other lime and coal tar residues are regarded as lesser, though significant environmental hazards. Some former manufactured gas plants are owned by gas utilities today, often in an effort to prevent contaminated land from falling into public use, and inadvertently causing the release of the wastes therein contained. Others have fallen into public use, and without proper reclamation, have caused – often severe – health hazards for their users. When and where necessary, former manufactured gas plants are subject to [[environmental remediation]] laws, and can be subject to legally mandated cleanups.

[[File:Retorts horizontal view Peckston 1819.png|thumb|right|Horizontal view of a retort and furnace (1819)]]

The basic design of gaslight apparatus was established by Boulton &amp; Watt and [[Samuel Clegg]] in the period 1805–1812. Further improvements were made at the Gas Light and Coke Company, as well as by the growing number of gas engineers such as John Malam and Thomas Peckston after 1812. Boulton &amp; Watt contributed the basic design of the retort, condenser, and gasometer, while Clegg improved the gasometer and introduced lime purification and the hydraulic main, another purifier.

===Retort bench===
The '''retort bench''' was the construction in which the retorts were located for the carbonization (synonymous with pyrolysis) of the coal feedstock and the evolution of coal gas. Over the years of manufactured gas production, advances were made that turned the retort-bench from little more than coal-containing iron vessels over an open fire to a massive, highly efficient, partially automated, industrial-scale, capital-intensive plant for the carbonization of large amounts of coal. Several retort benches were usually located in a single "retort house", which there was at least one of in every gas works.

Initially, retort benches were of many different configurations due to the lack of long use and scientific and practical understanding of the carbonization of coal. Some early retorts were little more than iron vessels filled with coal and thrust upon a coal fire with pipes attached to their top ends. Though practical for the earliest gas works, this quickly changed once the early gas-works served more than a few customers. As the size of such vessels grew – the need became apparent for efficiency in refilling retorts – and it was apparent that filling one-ended vertical retorts was easy; removing the coke and residues from them after the carbonization of coal was far more difficult. Hence, gas retorts transitioned from vertical vessels to horizontal tubular vessels.

Retorts were usually made of cast iron during the early days. Early gas engineers experimented extensively with the best shape, size, and setting. No one form of retort dominated, and many different cross-sections remained in use. After the 1850s, retorts generally became made of fire clay due to greater heat retention, greater durability, and other positive qualities. Cast-iron retorts were used in small gas works, due to their compatibility with the demands there, with the cast-iron retort's lower cost, ability to heat quickly to meet transient demand, and "plug and play" replacement capabilities. This outweighed the disadvantages of shorter life, lower temperature margins, and lack of ability to be manufactured in non-cylindrical shapes. Also, general gas-works practice following the switch to fire-clay retorts favored retorts that were shaped like a "D" turned 90 degrees to the left, sometimes with a slightly pitched bottom section.

With the introduction of the fire-clay retort, higher heats could be held in the retort benches, leading to faster and more complete carbonization of the coal. As higher heats became possible, advanced methods of retort bench firing were introduced, catalyzed by the development of the [[open hearth furnace]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Siemens]], circa 1855–1870, leading to a revolution in gas-works efficiency.

[[File:MeadeMdnGswksPracIsometricRegenerativeBench.png|thumb|right|Isometric view of a regenerative retort bench (1921)]]

Specifically, the two major advances were:

*The introduction of the "indirectly fired" retort bench. The early "directly fired" retort bench consisted of retorts suspended over a coke fire, which heated the retorts and drove the carbonization of coal within to coke, and the evolution of gas. The introduction of indirect firing changed this. Instead of the retorts being heated directly by fire – the fire was placed a ways below and to one side of the retorts, brought to a very high heat, while the air supply was reduced and a small amount of steam introduced. Instead of evolving large quantities of heat to directly heat the retorts, the fire now evolved heated gasses – specifically carbon monoxide and due to the steam, a small amount of hydrogen as well, which are both highly combustible. These gasses rise from the fire into a channel which brings them to the "[[tuyere]]s" – small holes similar to "nostrils", located adjacent to the retorts, which shoot the "furnace-gasses" out of them. Adjacent "tuyeres" emit a large amount of "secondary air", which is preheated air, that, upon mixing with the furnace gasses, causes them to ignite and burst into flame and bathe the exterior of the retorts in heat.
*The introduction of heat recuperation for the preheating of the air of primary and secondary combustion. By causing the exhaust of the retort-bench to pass through a maze of refractory brickwork, substantial quantities of heat can be extracted from it. On the other side of the exhaust channels are channels for the passage of the air of combustion. The bricks thus transfer the heat of the exhaust to the air of combustion, preheating it. This provides for a much greater degree of thermal efficiency in the retort-bench, causing it to be able to use far less coke, since air that is preheated by waste heat is already hot when it enters the fire to be burnt, or the "tuyere" to fuel secondary combustion.
These two advances turned the old, "directly fired" retort bench into the advanced, "indirectly fired", "regenerative" or "generative" retort bench, and lead coke usage within the retort benches (in the larger works) to drop from upwards of 40% of the coke made by the retorts to factors as low as 15% of the coke made by the retorts, leading to an improvement in efficiency of an order of magnitude. These improvements imparted an additional capital cost to the retort bench, which caused them to be slowly incorporated in the smaller gas-works, if they were incorporated at all.

Further increases in efficiency and safety were seen with the introduction of the "through" retort, which had a door at front and rear. This provided for greater efficiency and safety in loading and unloading the retorts, which was a labor-intensive and often dangerous process. Coal could now be pushed out of the retort – rather than pulled out of the retort. One interesting modification of the "through" retort was the "inclined" retort – coming into its heyday in the 1880s – a retort set on a moderate incline, where coal was poured in at one end, and the retort sealed; following pyrolysis, the bottom was opened and the coke poured out by gravity. This was adopted in some gas-works, but the savings in labor were often offset by the uneven distribution and pyrolysis of the coal as well as clumping problems leading to failure of the coal to pour out of the bottom following pyrolysis that were exacerbated in certain coal types. As such, inclined retorts were rendered obsolescent by later advances, including the retort-handling machine and the vertical retort system.

Several advanced retort-house appliances were introduced for improved efficiency and convenience. The compressed-air or steam-driven clinkering pick was found to be especially useful in removing clinker from the primary combustion area of the indirectly fired benches – previously clinkering was an arduous and time-consuming process that used large amounts of retort house labor. Another class of appliances introduced were apparatuses – and ultimately, machines – for retort loading and unloading. Retorts were generally loaded by using an elongated scoop, into which the coal was loaded – a gang of men would then lift the scoop and ram it into the retort. The coal would then be raked by the men into a layer of even thickness and the retort sealed. Gas production would then ensue – and from 8 – 12 hours later, the retort would be opened, and the coal would be either pulled (in the case of "stop-ended" retorts) or pushed (in the case of "through" retorts) out of the retort. Thus, the retort house had heavy manpower requirements – as many men were often required to bear the coal-containing scoop and load the retort.

''(TBD: Brief description of advanced retort loading apparatus; more detailed description of retort-handling machine.)''

''Coming soon: The introduction of the coke-oven system, and, finally, the vertical retort system.''

===Other Gas-Works facilities===

From the retort, the gas would first pass through a tar/water "trap" (similar to a trap in plumbing) called a hydraulic main, where a considerable fraction of coal tar was given up and the gas was significantly cooled. Then, it would pass through the main out of the retort house into an atmospheric or water-cooled condenser, where it would be cooled to the temperature of the atmosphere or the water used. At this point, it enters the exhauster house and passes through an "exhauster", an air pump which maintains the hydraulic mains and, consequently, the retorts at a negative pressure (with a zero pressure being atmospheric). It would then be washed in a "washer" by bubbling it through water, to extract any remaining tars. After this, it would enter a purifier. The gas would then be ready for distribution, and pass into a gasholder for storage.

====Hydraulic main====
[[File:HydraulicMain.png|thumb|right|Cross section of a hydraulic main (1909)]]

Within each retort-house, the retort benches would be lined up next to one another in a long row. Each retort had a loading and unloading door. Affixed to each door was an ascension pipe, to carry off the gas as it was evolved from the coal within. These pipes would rise to the top of the bench where they would terminate in an inverted "U" with the leg of the "U" disappearing into a long, trough-shaped structure (with a covered top) made of cast iron called a hydraulic main that was placed atop the row of benches near their front edge. It ran continuously along the row of benches within the retort house, and each ascension pipe from each retort descended into it.

The hydraulic main had a level of a liquid mixture of (initially) water, but, following use, also coal tar, and ammoniacal liquor. Each retort ascension pipe dropped under the water level by at least a small amount, perhaps by an inch, but often considerably more in the earlier days of gas manufacture. The gas evolved from each retort would thus bubble through the liquid and emerge from it into the void above the liquid, where it would mix with the gas evolved from the other retorts and be drawn off through the foul main to the condenser.

There were two purposes to the liquid seal: first, to draw off some of the tar and liquor, as the gas from the retort was laden with tar, and the hydraulic main could rid the gas of it, to a certain degree; further tar removal would take place in the condenser, washer/scrubber, and the tar extractor. Still, there would be less tar to deal with later. Second, the liquid seal also provided defense against air being drawn into the hydraulic main: if the main had no liquid within, and a retort was left open with the pipe not shut off, and air were to combine with the gas, the main could explode, along with nearby benches.

However, after the early years of gas, research proved that a very deep, excessive seal on the hydraulic main threw a backpressure upon all the retorts as the coal within was gasifying, and this had deleterious consequences; carbon would likely deposit onto the insides of retorts and ascension pipes; and the bottom layer of tar with which the gas would have to travel through in a deeply sealed main robbed the gas of some of its illuminating value. As such, after the 1860s, hydraulic mains were run at around 1&amp;nbsp;inch of seal, and no more.

Later retort systems (many types of vertical retorts, especially ones in continuous operation) which had other anti-oxygen safeguards, such as check valves, etc., as well as larger retorts, often omitted the hydraulic main entirely and went straight to the condensers – as other apparatus and buildings could be used for tar extraction, the main was unnecessary for these systems.

====Condenser====

Air Cooled Condensers

Condensers were either air cooled or water cooled. Air cooled condensers were often made up from odd lengths of pipe and connections. The main varieties in common use were classified as follows:

[[File:Horizontal Condensers.JPG|thumb|Horizontal Air Cooled Condenser]]
(a) Horizontal types 
[[File:Vertical Condensers.JPG|thumb|Vertical Air Cooled Condenser]]
(b) Vertical types
[[File:Annular Condensers.JPG|thumb|Annular Air Cooled Condenser]]
(c) Annular types 
[[File:Battery Condenser.JPG|thumb|Battery Air Cooled Condenser]]
(d) The battery condenser.

The horizontal condenser was an extended foul main with the pipe in a zigzag pattern from end to end of one of the retort-house walls. Flange connections were essential as blockages from naphthalene or pitchy deposits were likely to occur. The condensed liquids flowed down the sloping pipes in the same direction as the gas. As long as gas flow was slow, this was an effective method for the removal of naphthalene. Vertical air condensers had gas and tar outlets.

The annular atmospheric condenser was easier to control with respect to cooling rates. The gas in the tall vertical cylinders was annular in form and allowed an inside and outside surface to be exposed to cooling air. The diagonal side pipes conveyed the warm gas to the upper ends of each annular cylinder. Butterfly valves or dampers were fitted to the top of each vertical air pipe, so that the amount of cooling could be regulated.

The battery condenser was a long and narrow box divided internally by baffle-plates which cause the gas to take a circuitous course. The width of the box was usually about 2 feet, and small tubes passed from side to side form the chief cooling surface. The ends of these tubes were left open to allow air to pass through. The obstruction caused by the tubes played a role in breaking up and throwing down the tars suspended in the gas.

Typically, plants using cast-iron mains and apparatus allowed 5 square feet of superficial area per 1,000 cubic feet of gas made per day. This could be slightly reduced when wrought iron or mild steel was used.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyne Meade, Modern Gasworks Practice, D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1916, pages 286-291&lt;/ref&gt;

Water Cooled Condensers

Water cooled condensers were almost constructed from riveted mild steel plates (which form the outer shell) and steel or wrought-iron tubes. There were two distinct types used: 
[[File:Tubular Condenser.JPG|thumb|Water Cooled Tubular Condensers]]
(a) Multitubular condensers. 
[[File:Typical Water Tube Condenser.JPG|thumb|Water Tube Condenser]]  
(b) Water-tube condensers.

Unless the cooling water was exceptionally clean, the water-tube condenser was preferred. The major difference between the multitubular and water-tube condenser was that in the former the water passed outside and around the tubes which carry the hot gas, and in the latter type, the opposite was the case. Thus when only muddy water pumped from rivers or canals was available; the water-tube condenser was used. When the incoming gas was particularly dirty and contained an undesirable quantity of heavy tar, the outer chamber was liable to obstruction from this cause.

The hot gas was saturated with water vapor and accounted for the largest portion of the total work of condensation. Water vapor has to lose large quantities of heat, as did any liquefiable hydrocarbon. Of the total work of condensation, 87% was accounted for in removing water vapor and the remainder was used to cool permanent gases and to condensing liquefiable hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyne Meade, Modern Gasworks Practice, D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1916, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

As extremely finely divided particles were also suspended in the gas, it was impossible to separate the particulate matter solely by a reduction of vapor pressure. The gas underwent processes to remove all traces of solid or liquid matter before it reached the wet purification plant. Centrifugal separators, such as the Colman Cyclone apparatus were utilized for this process in some plants.[[File:Colman Centrifugal Separator.JPG|thumb|Colman "Cyclone" Separator]]

The hydrocarbon condensates removed in the order heavy tars, medium tars and finally light tars and oil fog.  About 60-65% of the tars would be deposited in the hydraulic main. Most of this tar was heavy tars.  The medium tars condensed out during the passage of the products between the hydraulic and the condenser. The lighter tars oil fog would travel considerably further.

In general, the temperature of the gas in the hydraulic main varies between 140-160&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F. The constituents most liable to be lost were benzene, toluene, and, to some extent, xylene, which had an important effect on the ultimate illuminating power of the gas. Tars were detrimental for the illuminating power and were isolated from the gas as rapidly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Alwyne Meade, Modern Gasworks Practice, D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1916, pages 296-299&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exhauster====

Maintained hydraulic main and condenser at negative pressure.

There were several types of exhausters.

*The steam ''ejector''/aspirator type exhauster used a substantial steam jet/venturi to maintain the negative pressure in the hydraulic main and condenser. This type of exhauster was mechanically simple, had no moving parts, and thus, had virtually no potential to fail. However, it consumed a comparatively large amount of steam. Often used as a backup exhauster; in this role it continued as a reliable backup until the end of the age of manufactured gas.
*Reciprocating exhausters of various types. Steam engine-driven exhauster used cylinder pump to pump gas. Relatively reliable, but inefficient, using large quantities of steam, but less than the ejector type exhauster. Used in the early days of exhausters, but quickly obsoleted.
*Blower-type exhauster.
*Turboexhauster.

[[File:Interior Diagram Bubbling Washer.JPG|thumb|Bubbling Washer for Ammonia Removal]]
Scrubbers which utilized water were designed in the 25 years after the foundation of the industry.  It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon the way in which the gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the Tower Scrubber. This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or weak gas liquor, trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted.  The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction ; notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The Tower Scrubber and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.&lt;ref name = "fred" /&gt;

====Purifier====
Coal gas coming directly from the bench was a noxious soup of chemicals, and removal of the most deleterious fractions was important, for improving the quality of the gas, for preventing damage to equipment or premises, and for recovering revenues from the sale of the extracted chemicals. Several offensive fractions being present in a distributed gas might lead to problems – [[Coal tar|Tar]] in the distributed gas might gum up the pipes (and could be sold for a good price), [[ammonia|ammoniacal vapours]] in the gas might lead to corrosion problems (and the extracted ammonium sulfate was a decent fertilizer), [[naphthalene|naphthalene vapours]] in the gas might stop up the gas-mains, and even [[carbon dioxide]] in the gas was known to decrease illumination; thus various facilities within the gas-works were tasked with the removal of these deleterious effluents. But these do not compare to the most hazardous contaminant in the raw coal gas: the sulfuret of hydrogen ([[hydrogen sulfide]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). This was regarded as utterly unacceptable for several reasons:
# The gas would smell rankly of rotten eggs when burnt;
# The gas-works and adjacent district would smell of rotten eggs when the gas-works was producing gas;
# The gas, upon burning, would form [[sulfur dioxide]], which would be quickly oxidized to [[sulfur trioxide]], and subsequently would react with the water vapor produced by combustion to form [[sulfuric acid]] vapour. In a dwelling-house, this could lead to the formation of irritating, poisonous and corrosive atmospheres where and when burnt.
# Manufactured gas was originally distributed in the well-to-do districts, as such were low-hanging fruit for the gas utility. Such persons were of a class known to possess silver goods of varying sorts. If exposed to a sulfurous atmosphere, silver tarnishes – and a sulfurous atmosphere would undoubtedly be present in any house lit with sulfuretted gas.

As such, the removal of the sulfuret of hydrogen was given the highest level of priority in the gas-works. A special facility existed to extract the sulfuret of hydrogen – known as the purifier.  The purifier was arguably the most important facility in the gas-works, if the retort-bench itself is not included.

Originally, purifiers were simple tanks of lime-water, also known as cream or milk of lime,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Newbigging, "Handbook for Gas Engineers and Managers", 8th Edition, Walter King, London, 1913, page 150&lt;/ref&gt; where the raw gas from the retort bench was bubbled through to remove the sulfuret of hydrogen. This original process of purification was known as the "wet lime" process. The lime residue left over from the "wet lime" process was one of the first true "toxic wastes", a material called "[[blue billy]]". Originally, the waste of the purifier house was flushed into a nearby body of water, such as a river or a canal. However, after fish kills, the nauseating way it made the rivers stink, and the truly horrendous stench caused by exposure of residuals if the river was running low, the public clamoured for better means of disposal. Thus it was piled into heaps for disposal. Some enterprising gas entrepreneurs tried to sell it as a weed-killer, but most people wanted nothing to do with it, and generally, it was regarded as waste which was both smelly and poisonous, and gas-works could do little with, except bury. But this was not the end of the "blue billy", for after burying it, rain would often fall upon its burial site, and leach the poison and stench from the buried waste, which could drain into fields or streams. Following countless fiascoes with "blue billy" contaminating the environment, a furious public, aided by courts, juries, judges, and masters in chancery, were often very willing to demand that the gas-works seek other methods of purification – and even pay for the damages caused by their old methods of purification.

This led to the development of the "dry lime" purification process, which was less effective than the "wet lime" process, but had less toxic consequences. Still, it was quite noxious. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) was placed in thick layers on trays which were then inserted into a square or cylinder-shaped purifier tower which gas was then passed through, from the bottom to the top. After the charge of slaked lime had lost most of its absorption effectiveness, the purifier was then shut off from the flow of gas, and either was opened, or air was piped in. Immediately, the sulfur-impregnated slaked lime would react with the air to liberate large concentrations of sulfuretted hydrogen, which would then billow out of the purifier house, and make the gas-works, and the district, stink of sulfuretted hydrogen. Though toxic in sufficient concentrations or long exposures, the sulfuret was generally just nauseating for short exposures at moderate concentrations, and was merely a health hazard (as compared to the outright danger of "blue billy") for the gas-works employees and the neighbors of the gas-works. The sulfuretted lime was not toxic, but not greatly wanted, slightly stinking of the odor of the sulfuret, and was spread as a low grade fertilizer, being impregnated with ammonia to some degree. The outrageous stinks from many gas-works led many citizens to regard them as public nuisances, and attracted the eye of regulators, neighbors, and courts.

The "gas nuisance" was finally solved by the "iron ore" process. Enterprising gas-works engineers discovered that bog iron ore could be used to remove the sulfuretted hydrogen from the gas, and not only could it be used for such, but it could be used in the purifier, exposed to the air, whence it would be rejuvenated, without emitting noxious sulfuretted hydrogen gas, the sulfur being retained in the iron ore. Then it could be reinserted into the purifier, and reused and rejuvenated multiple times, until it was thoroughly embedded with sulfur. It could then be sold to the sulfuric acid works for a small profit. Lime was sometimes still used after the iron ore had thoroughly removed the sulfuret of hydrogen, to remove carbonic acid (carbon dioxide, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the bisulfuret of carbon ([[carbon disulfide]], CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and any ammonia still aeroform after its travels through the works. But it was not made noxious as before, and usually could fetch a decent rate as fertilizer when impregnated with ammonia. This finally solved the greatest pollution nuisances of the gas-works, but still lesser problems remained – not any that the purifier house could solve, though.

Purifier designs also went through different stages throughout the years.

====The Gasholder====
[[File:Page 313 Single Lift Gas Holder.JPG|thumb|Single Lift Gasholder]] [[File:Telescoping Gasholder.JPG|thumb|Telescoping Gasholder]] [[Gasholders]] were constructed of a variety of materials, brick, stone, concrete, steel, or wrought iron. The holder or floating vessel is the storage reservoir for the gas, and it serves the purpose of equalizing the distribution of the gas under pressure, and ensures a continuity of supply, while gas remains in the holder. They are cylindrical like an inverted beaker and work up and down in the tank. In order to maintain a true vertical position, the vessel has rollers which work on guide-rails attached to the tank sides and to the columns surrounding the holder. 
Gasholders may be either single or telescopic in two or more lifts. When it is made in the telescopic form, its capacity could be increased to as much as four times the capacity of the single-lift holder for equal dimensions of tank. The telescopic versions were found to be useful as they conserved ground space and capital.&lt;ref name = "Newbigging"&gt;Thomas Newbigging, Handbook for Gas Engineers and Managers, 8th Edition, Walter King, London(1913), page 208&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minor and incidental coal gas-works facilities====
The gasworks had numerous small appertunances and facilities to aid with divers gas management tasks or auxiliary services.

=====Boilers=====
As the years went by, boilers (for the raising of steam) became extremely common in most gas-works above those small in size; the smaller works often used gas-powered internal combustion engines to do some of the tasks that steam performed in larger workings.

Steam was in use in many areas of the gasworks, including:
For the operation of the exhauster;
For scurfing of pyrolysis char and slag from the retorts and for clinkering the producer of the bench;
For the operation of engines used for conveying, compressing air, charging hydraulics, or the driving of dynamos or generators producing electric current;
To be injected under the grate of the producer in the indirectly fired bench, so as to prevent the formation of clinker, and to aid in the water-gas shift reaction, ensuring high-quality secondary combustion;
As a reactant in the (carburetted) water gas plant, as well as driving the equipment thereof, such as the numerous blowers used in that process, as well as the oil spray for the carburettor;
For the operation of fire, water, liquid, liquor, and tar pumps;
For the operation of engines driving coal and coke conveyor-belts;
For clearing of chemical obstructions in pipes, including naphthalene &amp; tar as well as general cleaning of equipment;
For heating cold buildings in the works, for maintaining the temperature of process piping, and preventing freezing of the water of the gasholder, or congealment of various chemical tanks and wells.

Heat recovery appliances could also be classed with boilers. As the gas industry applied scientific and rational design principles to its equipment, the importance of thermal management and capture from processes became common. Even the small gasworks began to use heat-recovery generators, as a fair amount of steam could be generated for "free" simply by capturing process thermal waste using water-filled metal tubing inserted into a strategic flue.

=====Dynamos/generators=====
As the electric age came into being, the gas-works began to use electricity – generated on site – for many of the smaller plant functions previously performed by steam or gas-powered engines, which were impractical and inefficient for small, sub-horsepower uses without complex and failure-prone mechanical linkages. As the benefits of electric illumination became known, sometimes the progressive gasworks diversified into electric generation as well, as coke for steam-raising could be had on-site at low prices, and boilers were already in the works.

=====Coal storage=====
According to Meade, the gasworks of the early 20th century generally kept on hand several weeks of coal. This amount of coal could cause major problems, because coal was liable to spontaneous combustion when in large piles, especially if they were rained upon, due to the protective dust coating of the coal being washed off, exposing the full porous surface area of the coal of slightly to highly activated carbon below; in a heavy pile with poor heat transfer characteristics, the heat generated could lead to ignition. But storage in air-entrained confined spaces was not highly looked upon either, as residual heat removal would be difficult, and fighting a fire if it was started could result in the formation of highly toxic carbon monoxide through the water-gas reaction, caused by allowing water to pass over extremely hot carbon (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + C = H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO), which would be dangerous outside, but deadly in a confined space.

Coal storage was designed to alleviate this problem. Two methods of storage were generally used; underwater, or outdoor covered facilities. To the outdoor covered pile, sometimes cooling appurtenances were applied as well; for example, means to allow the circulation of air through the depths of the pile and the carrying off of heat. Amounts of storage varied, often due to local conditions. Works in areas with industrial strife often stored more coal, while nations whose proletariat was under "control" stored less. Other variables included national security; for instance, the gasworks of [[Tegel]] in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] had some 1 million tons of coal (6 months of supply) in gigantic underwater bunker facilities half a mile long (Meade 2e, p.&amp;nbsp;379); as Berlin is on the [[North German Plain]], perhaps this was due to what happened to Paris in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871.

=====Coal stoking and machine stoking=====
[[File:Horizontal Retorts with Stoking Machine.PNG|thumb|Horizontal retorts with a stoking machine]]
Machine stoking or power stoking was used to replace labor and minimize disruptions due to labor disputes.  Each retort typically required two sets of three stokers.  Two of the stokers were required to lift the point of the scoop into the retort, while the third would push it in and turn it over. Coal would be introduced from each side of the retort.  The coke produced would be removed from both sides also. Gangs of stokers worked 12-hour shifts, although the labor was not continuous.  The work was also seasonal, with extra help being required in the winter time.  Machine stoking required more uniform placement of the retorts.  Increasing cost of labor increased the profit margin in experimenting with and instituting machine stoking.&lt;ref name = "Webber"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webber |first1=W. H. Y. |title=Gas &amp; Gas Making: Growth, Methods and Prospects of the Gas Industry |series=Common Commodities and Industries |year=1918  |publisher=Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd. |location= London|pages =11–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tar/liquor storage=====
The chemical industries demanded [[coal tar]], and the gas-works could provide it for them; and so the coal tar was stored on site in large underground tanks. As a rule, these were single wall metal tanks – that is, if they were not porous masonry. In those days, underground tar leaks were seen as merely a waste of tar; out of sight was truly out of mind; and such leaks were generally addressed only when the loss of revenue from leaking tar "wells", as these were sometimes called, exceeded the cost of repairing the leak. This practice of bygone days has caused representatives of present-day gas utilities to dive under tables and utter [[minced oath]]s when terms like "purportedly responsible party", "[[BTEX]]", "[[aquifer plume]]", or "[[Superfund]]" are mentioned.

Ammoniacal liquor was stored on site as well, in similar tanks. Sometimes the more progressive gasworks would have an [[ammonium sulfate]] plant, to convert the liquor into fertilizer, which was sold to farmers.

=====Station meter=====
This large-scale gas meter precisely measured gas as it issued from the works into the mains. It was of the utmost importance, as the gasworks balanced the account of issued gas versus the amount of paid for gas, and strived to detect why and how they varied from one another. Often it was coupled with a dynamic regulator to keep pressure constant, or even to modulate the pressure at specified times (a series of rapid pressure spikes was sometimes used with appropriately equipped street-lamps to automatically ignite or extinguish such remotely).

=====Anti-naphthalene minor carburettor=====

This device injected a fine mist of naphtha into the outgoing gas so as to avoid the crystallization of naphthalene in the mains, and their consequent blockage. Naphtha was found to be a rather effective solvent for these purposes, even in small concentrations. Where troubles with naphthalene developed, as it occasionally did even after the introduction of this minor carburettor, a team of workers was sent out to blow steam into the main and dissolve the blockage; still, prior to its introduction, naphthalene was a very major annoyance for the gasworks.

=====High-pressure distribution booster pump=====

This steam or gas engine powered device compressed the gas for injection into the high-pressure mains, which in the early 1900s began to be used to convey gas over greater distances to the individual low pressure mains, which served the end-users. This allowed the works to serve a larger area and achieve economies of scale.

|-
| Coal gas || Primarily bituminous or cannel coal. Lignite occasionally used. || Carbonization ([[pyrolysis]]) of the coal feedstock (the heating of the coal feedstock in the absence of oxygen.) The gas produced by the hot coal is the gas distributed. || As distributed, contains a moderate proportion of marsh gas ([[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbonic oxide ([[carbon monoxide]], CO), and simple hydrocarbon "illuminants", including oliefant gas ([[ethylene]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetylene gas (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In addition, prior to treatment, contains coal tars (complex aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), ammoniacal liquor (gaseous ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and aqueous ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH), the sulfuret of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), and the sulfuret of carbon (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). || 500–650 || 10–18 || The oldest type, introduced in 1798 by Murdoch, et al.; when the term "manufactured gas" or "town gas" is used without qualifiers, it generally refers to coal gas. Substantially greater illuminant yield with use of special "[[cannel coal]]", which may be modern [[oil shale]], richer in hydrocarbons than most regular gas coal (bituminous coal).
|-
| Wood gas &lt;!--don't wikilink me because today's wood gas is not this type of wood gas. This type was ONLY manufactured through pyrolysis--&gt; || Timber resources. || Carbonization (pyrolysis) of the timber feedstock (the heating of the timber feedstock in the absence of oxygen.) The volatiles evolved from the heated wood is the gas distributed. || Resulting products unknown. Probably marsh gas, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide, along with some hydrocarbons and organics, like turpentine. || ? || &lt; 10 || Wood was used as a feedstock during the early days (1820s - 1850s) of manufactured gas in certain areas of the United States, due to lack of development of coal resources. Wood was carbonized in a manner similar to coal; however, the gas evolved was markedly inferior to that of coal in lighting and heating qualities. Still very useful for lighting. This wood gas produced solely through pyrolysis should not be confused with [[wood gas]] as used today; the modern [[wood gas generator]] produces its synthesis gas through the complete gasification process, as described below.
|-
| Oil pyrolytic gas. || Petroleum oil. || Carbonization (pyrolysis) of petroleum (the heating of the petroleum feedstock in the absence of oxygen.) The gas produced by the heated &amp; decomposed oil is the gas distributed. || As distributed, contains an extremely high proportion of simple hydrocarbon "illuminants", including oliefant gas (ethylene, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetylene gas (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as propane gas (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and a small amount of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO). || 1000–1500 || 40–60 || Initial experiments in 1817–1825, which were failures; began to be used widely in 1860s. Simpler, much less labor-intensive manufacturing process. Oil very expensive feedstock compared to coal; prices (and illuminous efficacy per ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) double to triple that of regular coal gas.
|-
| Oil catalytic semi-water gas. (Improved Jones Process) || Petroleum oil. || Staged partial reaction of petroleum oil using steam at high temperature in catalytic environment. The gas produced by the partially reacted and partially cracked oil is the gas distributed. || As distributed, contains 35 – 40% hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 45% – 50% marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and the balance of higher hydrocarbons and carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO). || 500–700 || 10–18 || E.C. Jones, chief gas engineer of the San Francisco Gas Light Company (later the [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company|PG&amp;E]]) developed this ingenious process to turn oil into a gas very similar to that produced by the pyrolysis of coal using a catalytic backflush of already produced gas and steam to provide a hydrogen atmosphere to stimulate disassociation of the oil with the minimal production of lampblack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Improved Jones Process and evolutions of that process continued to be used on the Pacific Coast until the end of the manufactured gas age.
|-
| Producer gas || Anthracite coal, coke, bituminous coal dust and waste, lignite, or biomass. || Manufactured by the incomplete combustion of varying carboniferous feedstocks in an extremely hot (&gt;= 1100&amp;nbsp;°C), limited-oxygen atmosphere aided by the injection of a small, stoichiometric flow of steam. || Contains a high proportion of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO), limited amounts of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and a very small quantity of swamp gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). || 100–170 || nil || Produced in early days of coal gasification; however, only became common after invention of Otto cycle internal combustion engine for which it was an ideal fuel, as well as small-sized, reliable gas producers, which allowed the easy generation of producer gas nearly anywhere a supply of anthracite or coke was available. Gas generally not distributed past the walls of the production site, but used on location, due to low energy content and that it was mostly composed of deadly carbonic oxide. Used for standard domestic gas needs within institutions large enough to justify a hired man&lt;!--there were no women in manufactured gas in those days, lol--&gt; for the upkeep of the producer; these institutions often included work-houses, alms-houses, reformatories, orphanages, houses of correction, lunatic asylums, lyceums, industrial schools, and penitentiaries. Bulk heating, electric generation, and engine-running uses; also for welding purposes, as it possesses a "reducing flame" and a high temperature. N.B. One variant of producer gas was [[Mond gas]], known for both its consistent yield and that ammonia could be obtained as a byproduct. Slight modifications of producer necessary.
|-
| Water gas || Coke or anthracite coal and steam. || Manufactured by the reaction of extremely hot feedstock and steam in a superheated non-oxygen atmosphere. || Contains high proportions of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and very low proportions of other gasses. || ~ 300 || nil || Manufacture known since late 1830s. However, not optimized for profitable generation until approximately 1865–70. Produced using an intermittent process; first, the exothermic "blow", where the feedstock was heated by blowing air through it, followed by an endothermic "run", where the air was cut off, and steam passed through the now superhot feedstock, leading to the decomposition of the steam and scavenging of carbon from the feedstock. Generally mixed with coal gas, valued for being able to be produced "just in time" with 1 hour's notice, unlike coal gas, which would require 4+ days to bring online from idle. Low labor and capital costs, however, high, inefficient use of anthracite/coke feedstock.
|-
| Carburetted water gas || Water gas and petroleum or coal tar. || Manufactured by passing just-produced, super-hot water gas through a superheated "carburettor" into which petroleum or coal tar oil is sprayed, accomplishing the "cracking" of the oil into the gas. || Contains high proportions of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and moderate proportions of marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and mixed hydrocarbon illuminant gasses. || 400–700 || 10–25 || Introduced in 1876. Became a common process during the heady days of gas-lighting from the 1870s to the first decade of the 20th century, especially useful for mixing with coal gas. Process had similar positives and negatives as straight water gas, but also had illuminant value, as well as higher cost, due to oil/tar use. Variable illuminant yield, depending on amount/quality of oil spray. As gas steadily lost ground as an illuminant, extensive carburetting reduced to low values or carburetting omitted entirely, representing a return to water gas.
|-
| Complete gasification gas || Gas-evolving coal or other organics. || Manufactured by a complex, staged process where as coal travelled down the vertical axis of an upright, semi-cylindrical reaction chamber, it would be subject to different chemical reactions based on what was being fed into that area of the reaction chamber. || Mix of carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide, CO), marsh gas (methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a small quantity of simple hydrocarbon illuminants, along with small quantities of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. || 330–400 || &gt; 8 || Earliest processes from 1895, came into industrial-scale use by 1918 (Meade, p.&amp;nbsp;766–769). Numerous processes developed, many in Germany, Austria, and other Continental nations. Potential of retaining over 75% energy of feedstock in gas with heat recovery from raw gas (Meade, p.&amp;nbsp;762), as compared to ~55% feedstock energy retention of other gasification processes.&lt;ref&gt;Further information on this development late in the public domain period (pre-1923) is likely in non-public domain, out of print publications ("orphaned works"), and that researchers with time might investigate this interesting development.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Horizon''''' is an online-only, open-access magazine covering research and innovation,&lt;ref&gt;http://horizon-magazine.eu/content/about-horizon_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; published in Brussels since 2013&lt;ref&gt;Technische Universität München: THE EU RESEARCH AND INNOVATION MAGAZINE (Retrieved 5 April 2016) https://www.med.tum.de/en/node/266&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[European Commission]]. It covers a wide range of topics, including agriculture, energy, environment, frontier research, health, ICT, industry, policy, science in society, security, social sciences, space and transport.

''Horizon'' publishes three to five articles per week and in English only and normally covers research projects which were funded by the [[European Union]] (EU) through its  [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]], such as [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] and [[Horizon 2020]], and through the [[European Research Council]]. Occasionally, Horizon also publishes policy announcements from the European Commission’s [[Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research and Innovation]].

The '''International Society of Genetic Genealogy''' ('''ISOGG''') is an independent [[non-commercial]] [[nonprofit organization]] of [[genetic genealogy|genetic genealogist]]s run by [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. It was founded by a group of [[surname DNA project]] administrators in 2005 to promote [[Genealogical DNA test|DNA testing for genealogy]]. It advocates the use of [[genetics]] in [[Genealogy|genealogical research]], provides educational resources for genealogists interested in DNA testing, and facilitates networking among genetic genealogists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isogg.org|title=The International Society of Genetic Genealogy|accessdate=July 1, 2013|publisher=ISOGG}} See Homepage, Our Mission and About ISOGG.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISOGG 2013 Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree|url=http://www.isogg.org/tree/index.html|publisher=ISOGG|accessdate=July 10, 2013|quote=ISOGG (International Society of Genetic Genealogy) is not affiliated with any registered, trademarked, and/or copyrighted names of companies, websites and organizations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KingJobling&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.06.003|quote=The International Society of Genetic Genealogy (www.isogg.org) advocates the use of genetics as a tool for genealogical research, and provides a support network for genetic genealogists.

==Industry regulation and standards==
In 2006 ISOGG co-founder and director Katherine Borges explained there was interest in testing as "people want to connect",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Your Great-Great-Great-Great-Granddaddy?|last=Harmon|first=Amy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/weekinreview/11harmon.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 11, 2006|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 she estimated one million people had taken [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|DTC]] genetic genealogy tests since they became available in 2000.&lt;ref name=Smolenyak&gt;{{cite news|last=Smolenyak|first=Megan|title=Don't 'Protect' Us From Our Own Genetic Information|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/dont-protect-us-from-our_b_653474.html|accessdate=July 7, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 ISOGG supported the passing of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] designed to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Smolenyak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borges|first=Katherine|journal=ISOGG Newsletter|title=From the Director|date=March 1, 2008|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.isogg.org/newsletter/mar2008.htm|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 Borges represented ISOGG at an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] public meeting on oversight of [[Laboratory Developed Test|laboratory developed tests]], where she spoke against FDA regulation preventing consumer access to DTC testing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA/CDRH Public Meeting: Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), Date July 19–20, 2010|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm212830.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorhaus|first=Dan|title=The Conversation Continues: Recap from Day Two of FDA’s Regulatory Meeting|url=http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/07/21/fda-ldt-day-2-recap/|publisher=Genomics Law Report|accessdate=July 8, 2013|quote=DTC genetic testing also had its advocates, including 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki and Katherine Borges, Director of the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG), who delivered one of the most impassioned arguments for prioritizing individual access over FDA regulation. Borges sounded a familiar refrain in arguing that the FDA should not restrict consumer access to genetic information 'without credible, compelling scientific data to support' such regulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The general view of ISOGG's members is that regulatory agencies should not stand between a consumer who wishes to collect data on their own genome, and labs that can provide that service. The genome of an individual consists fundamentally of information, and every individual in a free society has an absolute right to information about their own genome from a source of their choosing. Our membership base consists of many MDs, PhDs, and other specialists who are willing to volunteer their time to assist with the development of industry standards, good practices, and advisory panels. These concepts could be developed in collaboration with federal agencies like NIST and the FTC. And FDA's regulatory requirements for DTCs could be met with something as simple as full and adequate disclosures of the limitations of the tests by the testing companies. The result could be a happy medium to the benefit of consumers, the laboratories, the testing companies, the government and to taxpayers.&lt;ref name=Smolenyak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Meeting on Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests, Tuesday, July 20, 2010|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/UCM226204.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An article published in ''Genetics in Medicine'' in March 2012 provides an overview of the diverse array of tests and practices in the emerging DTC genetic genealogy industry. In the article, the authors highlight ISOGG's potential role in developing industry best practice guidelines and consumer guidance: {{quote|Based on these data and our previous research, we believe that specific, federal regulation of the DNA ancestry testing industry is not warranted or justifiable at this time ... While no ethical or industry standards have been published, some companies in the DNA ancestry industry are accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ... We call on the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) to take a leadership role in (i) articulating an ethical code to guide the practices of the industry it advocates and (ii) developing a consumer guide to provide prospective consumers of the DNA ancestry testing industry with a reliable means to compare products and companies for their varying consumer motivations and interests. Moreover, we reiterate the need for a roundtable discussion (as recommended by the American Society of Human Genetics white paper) to better engage the many parties with diverse needs for and interests in DNA ancestry inference and testing. Such a roundtable will be successful in developing best practice guidelines for DNA ancestry testing only if all parties approach the project in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|doi=10.1038/gim.2011.77|pmid=22382803|title=Tilting at windmills no longer: A data-driven discussion of DTC DNA ancestry tests|year=2012|first1=Jennifer K.|last2=Cooper|first2=Jill D.|last3=Sterling|first3=Rene|last4=Royal|first4=Charmaine D.|journal=Genetics in Medicine|volume=14|issue=6|pages=586–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The increasing affordability and popularity of DTC genetic genealogy testing has also raised ethical concerns about genealogists testing the DNA of others without [[consent]]. According to Borges, "People who realize the potential of DNA will go to great lengths to get it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stalking Strangers’ DNA to Fill in the Family Tree|last=Harmon|first=Amy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/02/us/02dna.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISOGG Wiki contains a selection of external resources on ethics for genetic genealogists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Society of Genetic Genealogy Wiki (Ethics)|url=http://isogg.org/wiki/Ethics|publisher=ISOGG|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Y-STR nomenclature===
{{See also|List of Y-STR markers}}
ISOGG promotes the adoption of voluntary industry [[Y-STR]] nomenclature standards developed by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] and published in the ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=Smolenyak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John M. Butler |author2=Margaret C. Kline |author3=Amy E. Decker |title=Addressing Y-Chromosome Short Tandem Repeat Allele Nomenclature|journal=Journal of Genetic Genealogy|year=2008|volume=4|issue=2|pages=125–148|url=http://www.jogg.info/42/files/butler.pdf|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borges explains ISOGG's rationale as follows: {{quote|As DNA testing for genetic genealogy purposes has become common and more people put their DNA profiles into online ancestry databases, the need for a universal format became apparent. This is a big benefit to consumers. They will definitely find more matches because of this new standard. Currently, consumers are often unaware they have to convert their results for use on different databases or are intimidated enough by the process that they don’t check a variety of databases. Also, some errors find their way into conversion tools. All these problems reduce chances of finding matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation is First to Adopt Genetic Genealogy’s New Industry Standard for Reporting Y-DNA Profiles|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090817005034/en/Sorenson-Molecular-Genealogy-Foundation-Adopt-Genetic-Genealogy%E2%80%99s|date=August 17, 2009|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Background ==

=== Original Nice model ===

In the original [[Nice model]] a resonance crossing results in a dynamical instability that rapidly alters the orbits of the giant planets. The original Nice model begins with the [[giant planet]]s in a compact configuration with nearly circular orbits. Initially, interactions with [[planetesimal]]s originating in an outer disk drive a slow divergent migration of the giant planets. This [[Planetary migration#Planetesimal-driven migration|planetesimal-driven migration]] continues until [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] cross their mutual 2:1 [[orbital resonance|resonance]]. The resonance crossing excites the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of Jupiter and Saturn. The increased eccentricities create perturbations on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], increasing their eccentricities until the system becomes chaotic and orbits begin to intersect. Gravitational encounters between the planets then scatter Uranus and Neptune outward into the planetesimal disk. The disk is disrupted, scattering many of the planetesimals onto planet-crossing orbits. A rapid phase of divergent migration of the giant planets is initiated and continues until the disk is depleted. [[Dynamical friction]] during this phase dampens the eccentricities of Uranus and Neptune stabilizing the system. In numerical simulations of the original Nice model the final orbits of the giant planets are similar to the current [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=Alesandro|title=A coherent and comprehensive model of the evolution of the outer Solar System|journal=Comptes Rendus Physique|date=2010|volume=11|issue=9–10|pages=651–659|doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2010.11.001|arxiv=1010.6221|bibcode = 2010CRPhy..11..651M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resonant planetary orbits ===

Later versions of the Nice model begin with the giant planets in a series of resonances. This change reflects some hydrodynamic models of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]]. In these models, interactions between the giant planets and the [[protoplanetary disk|gas disk]] result in the giant planets migrating toward the central star, in some cases becoming [[hot Jupiter]]s.&lt;ref name=Lin_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=D.

=== Late escape from resonance ===

The stirring of the outer disk by massive planetesimals can trigger a late instability in a multi-resonant planetary system. As the eccentricities of the planetesimals are excited by gravitational encounters with [[Pluto#Mass and size|Pluto-mass]] objects, an inward migration of the giant planets occurs. The migration, which occurs even if there are no encounters between planetesimals and planets, is driven by a coupling between the average [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the planetesimal disk and the [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] of the outer planets. Because the planets are locked in [[Orbital resonance|resonance]], the migration also results in an increase in the eccentricity of the inner [[ice giant]]. The increased eccentricity changes the [[Apsidal precession|precession]] frequency of the inner ice giant, leading to the crossing of [[secular resonance]]s. The quadruple resonance of the outer planets can be broken during one of these secular-resonance crossings. Gravitational encounters begin shortly afterward due to the close proximity of the planets in the previously resonant configuration. The timing of the instability caused by this mechanism, typically occurring several hundred million years after the dispersal of the gas disk, is fairly independent of the distance between the outer planet and the planetesimal disk. In combination with the updated initial conditions, this alternative mechanism for triggering a late instability has been called the [[Nice 2 model]].&lt;ref name=Levison_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levison|first=Harold F.|author2=Morbidelli, Alessandro |author3=Tsiganis, Kleomenis |author4=Nesvorný, David |author5= Gomes, Rodney |title=Late Orbital Instabilities in the Outer Planets Induced by Interaction with a Self-gravitating Planetesimal Disk|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2011|volume=142|issue=5|page=152|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/142/5/152|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/142/5/152/pdf/aj_142_5_152.pdf|bibcode=2011AJ....142..152L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planetary encounters with Jupiter ===

Encounters between Jupiter and an ice giant during the giant planet migration are required to reproduce the current Solar System. In a series of three articles Ramon Brasser, Alessandro Morbidelli, Rodney Gomes, Kleomenis Tsiganis, and Harold Levison analyzed the orbital evolution of the Solar System during giant planet migration. The first article demonstrated that encounters between an ice giant and at least one gas giant were required to reproduce the oscillations of the eccentricities of the gas giants.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2009 /&gt; The other two demonstrated that if Jupiter and Saturn underwent a smooth planetesimal-driven separation of their orbits the terrestrial planets would have orbits that are too eccentric and too many of the asteroids would have orbits with large inclinations. They proposed that the ice giant encountered both Jupiter and Saturn, causing the rapid separation of their orbits, thereby avoiding the secular resonance sweeping responsible for the excitation of orbits in the inner Solar System.&lt;ref name=Brasser_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_Brasser_2010 /&gt;

Exciting the oscillations of the eccentricities of the giant planets requires encounters between planets. Jupiter and Saturn have modest [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] that oscillate out of phase, with Jupiter reaching maximum eccentricity when Saturn reaches its minimum and vice versa. A smooth migration of the giant planets without [[orbital resonance|resonance]] crossings results in very small eccentricities. Resonance crossings excite their [[Orbital eccentricity#Mean eccentricity|mean eccentricities]], with the 2:1 resonance crossing reproducing Jupiter's current eccentricity, but these do not generate the oscillations in their eccentricities. Recreating both requires either a combination of resonance crossings and an encounter between Saturn and an ice giant, or multiple encounters of an [[ice giant]] with one or both [[gas giant]]s.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|author2=Brasser, R. |author3=Tsiganis, K. |author4=Gomes, R. |author5= Levison, H. F |title=Constructing the secular architecture of the Solar System I. The giant planets|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2009|volume=507|issue=2|pages=1041–1052|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200912876|arxiv=0909.1886|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2009/44/aa12876-09/aa12876-09.html|bibcode=2009A&amp;A...507.1041M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the smooth migration of the giant planets the ν5 [[secular resonance]] sweeps through the [[inner Solar System]], exciting the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of the terrestrial planets. When planets are in a secular resonance the precessions of their orbits are synchronized, keeping their relative orientations and the average [[torque]]s exerted between them fixed. The torques transfer [[angular momentum]] between the planets causing changes in their eccentricities and, if the orbits are inclined relative to one another, their inclinations. If the planets remain in or near secular resonances these changes can accumulate resulting in significant changes in eccentricity and inclination.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2018" /&gt; During a ν5 secular resonance crossing this can result in the excitation of the terrestrial planet's eccentricity, with the magnitude of the increase depending on the eccentricity of Jupiter and the time spent in the secular resonance.&lt;ref name="Agnor_2012" /&gt; For the original [[Nice model]] the slow approach to Jupiter's and Saturn's 2:1 [[orbital resonance|resonance]] results in an extended interaction of the ν5 secular resonance with Mars, driving its eccentricity to levels that can destabilize the inner Solar System, potentially leading to collisions between planets or the ejection of Mars.&lt;ref name=Brasser_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agnor_2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnor|first=Craig B.|author2=Lin, D. N. C.|title=On the Migration of Jupiter and Saturn: Constraints from Linear Models of Secular Resonant Coupling with the Terrestrial Planets|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2012|volume=745|issue=2|page=143|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/745/2/143|arxiv=1110.5042|bibcode=2012ApJ...745..143A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions of the Nice model Jupiter's and Saturn's divergent migration across (or from) the 2:1 resonance is more rapid and the nearby ν5 resonance crossings of Earth and Mars are brief, thus avoiding the excessive excitation of their eccentricities in some cases. Venus and Mercury, however, reach significantly higher eccentricities than are observed when the ν5 resonance later crosses their orbits.&lt;ref name="Brasser_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasser|first=R.|author2=Morbidelli, A. |author3=Gomes, R. |author4=Tsiganis, K. |author5= Levison, H.F. |title=Constructing the secular architecture of the Solar System II: The terrestrial planets|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2009|volume=507|issue=2|pages=1053–1065|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200912878|arxiv=0909.1891|bibcode=2009A&amp;A...507.1053B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encounters between an ice giant and both Jupiter and Saturn accelerate the separation of their orbits, limiting the effects of secular resonance sweeping on the orbits of the terrestrial planets and the asteroids. To prevent the excitation of orbits of the terrestrial planets and asteroids the secular resonances must sweep rapidly through the inner Solar System. The small eccentricity of Venus indicates that this occurred on a timescale of less than 150,000 years, much shorter than in a planetesimal driven migration.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2018" /&gt; The secular resonance sweeping can be largely avoided, however, if the separation of Jupiter and Saturn was driven by gravitational encounters with an ice giant. These encounters must drive the Jupiter–Saturn period ratio quickly from below 2.1 to beyond 2.3, the range where the secular resonance crossings occur. This evolution of the giant planets orbits has been named the jumping-Jupiter scenario after a similar process proposed to explain the eccentric orbits of some exoplanets.&lt;ref name=Brasser_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_Brasser_2010 /&gt;

== Fifth giant planet ==

The frequent loss of the giant planet encountering Jupiter in simulations has led some to propose that the early Solar System began with five giant planets. In numerical simulations of the jumping-Jupiter scenario the ice giant is often [[rogue planet|ejected]] following its gravitational encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, leaving [[planetary system]]s that begin with four giant planets with only three.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Batygin_2012 /&gt; Although beginning with a higher-mass planetesimal disk was found to stabilize four-planet systems, the massive disk either resulted in excess migration of Jupiter and Saturn after the encounters between an ice giant and Jupiter or prevented these encounters by damping eccentricities.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011 &gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesvorný|first=David|title=Young Solar System's Fifth Giant Planet?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2011|volume=742|issue=2|page=L22|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/742/2/L22|arxiv=1109.2949|bibcode=2011ApJ...742L..22N}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem led David Nesvorný to investigate planetary systems beginning with five giant planets.

==Migration of Neptune before instability==

Neptune's migration into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begin allows Jupiter to retain a significant eccentricity and limits its migration after the ejection of the fifth ice giant. Jupiter's eccentricity is excited by resonance crossings and gravitational encounters with the ice giant and is damped due to secular friction with the planetesimal disk. Secular friction occurs when the orbit of a planet suddenly changes and results in the excitation of the planetesimals' orbits and the reduction of the planet's eccentricity and inclination as the system relaxes. If gravitational encounters begin shortly after the planets leave their multi-resonant configuration, this leaves Jupiter with a small eccentricity. However, if Neptune first migrates outward disrupting the planetesimal disk, its mass is reduced and the eccentricities and inclinations of the planetesimals are excited. When planetary encounters are later triggered by a resonance crossing this lessens the impact of secular friction allowing Jupiter's eccentricity to be maintained. The smaller mass of the disk also reduces the divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn following the ejection of the fifth planet. This can allow Jupiter's and Saturn's period ratio to jump beyond 2.3 during the planetary encounters without exceeding the current value once the planetesimal disk is removed. Although this evolution of the outer planet's orbits can reproduce the current Solar System, it is not the typical result in simulations that begin with a significant distance between the outer planet and the planetesimal disk as in the Nice 2 model.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2012 &gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesvorný|first=David|author2=Morbidelli, Alessandro|title=Statistical Study of the Early Solar System's Instability with Four, Five, and Six Giant Planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal |page=117|date=2012|volume=144|issue=4|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/144/4/117|arxiv=1208.2957|bibcode=2012AJ....144..117N}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extended migration of Neptune into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begin can occur if the disk's inner edge was within 2 AU of Neptune's orbit. This migration begins soon after the protoplanetary disk dissipates, resulting in an early instability, and is most likely if the giant planets began in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

A late instability can occur if Neptune first underwent a slow dust-driven migration towards a more distant planetesimal disk. For a five planet system to remain stable for 400 million years the inner edge of the planetesimal disk must be several AU beyond Neptune's initial orbit. Collisions between planetesimals in this disk creates debris that is ground down to dust in a collisional cascade. The dust drifts inward due to Poynting–Robertson drag, eventually reaching the orbits of the giant planets. Gravitational interactions with the dust causes the giant planets to escape from their resonance chain roughly 10 million years after the dissipation of the gas disk. The gravitational interactions then result in a slow dust-driven migration of the planets until Neptune approaches the inner edge of the disk. A more rapid planetesimal-driven migration of Neptune into the disk then ensues until the orbits of the planets are destabilized following a resonance crossing. The dust driven migration requires 7–22 Earth-masses of dust, depending on the initial distance between Neptune's orbit and the inner edge of the dust disk. The rate of the dust-driven migration slows with time as the amount of dust the planets encounters declines. As a result, the timing of the instability is sensitive to the factors that control the rate of dust generation such as the size distribution and the strength of the planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Morbidelli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Gomes|first3=Rodney S.|last4=Nesvorny|first4=David|title=Constraining the giant planets' initial configuration from their evolution: implications for the timing of the planetary instability|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=153|issue=4|page=153|date=2017|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa5eaa|arxiv=1702.02094|bibcode = 2017AJ....153..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications for the early Solar System ==

The jumping-Jupiter scenario results in a number of differences with the original Nice model.

The rapid separation of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits causes the secular resonances to quickly cross the inner Solar System. The number of asteroids removed from the core of the asteroid belt is reduced, leaving an inner extension of the asteroid belt as the dominant source of rocky impactors. The likelihood of preserving the low eccentricities of the terrestrial planets increases to above 20% in a selected jumping-Jupiter model. Since the modification of orbits in the asteroid belt is limited, its depletion and the excitement of its orbits must have occurred earlier. However, asteroid orbits are modified enough to shift the orbital distribution produced by a grand tack toward that of the current asteroid belt, to disperse collisional families, and to remove fossil Kirkwood gaps. The ice giant crossing the asteroid belt allows some icy planetesimals to be implanted into the inner asteroid belt.

In the outer Solar System icy planetesimals are captured as Jupiter trojans when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during encounters with the ice giant. Jupiter also captures irregular satellites via three body interactions during these encounters. The orbits of Jupiter's regular satellites are perturbed, but in roughly half of simulations remain in orbits similar to those observed. Encounters between an ice giant and Saturn perturb the orbit of Iapetus and may be responsible for its inclination. The dynamical excitement of the outer disk by Pluto-massed objects and its lower mass reduces the bombardment of Saturn's moons. Saturn's tilt is acquired when it is captured in a spin-orbit resonance with Neptune. A slow and extended migration of Neptune into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begin leaves the Kuiper belt with a broad inclination distribution. When Neptune's semi-major axis jumps outward after it encounters the ice giant objects captured in its 2:1 resonance during its previous migration escape, leaving a clump of low inclination objects with similar semi-major axes. The outward jump also releases objects from the 3:2 resonance, reducing the number of low inclination plutinos remaining at the end of Neptune's migration. 

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===

Most of the rocky impactors of the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] originate from an inner extension of the [[asteroid belt]] yielding a smaller but longer lasting bombardment. The innermost region of the asteroid belt is currently sparsely populated due to the presence of the ν6 [[secular resonance]]. In the early Solar System, however, this resonance was located elsewhere and the asteroid belt extended farther inward, ending at Mars-crossing orbits.&lt;ref name="Bottke_2012" /&gt; During the giant planet migration the ν6 secular resonance first rapidly traversed the asteroid belt removing roughly half of its mass, much less than in the original Nice model.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_Brasser_2010 /&gt; When the planets reached their current positions the ν6 secular resonance destabilized the orbits of the innermost asteroids. Some of these quickly entered planet crossing orbit initiating the Late Heavy Bombardment. Others entered quasi-stable higher inclination orbits, later producing an extended tail of impacts, with a small remnant surviving as the [[Hungaria family|Hungarias]].&lt;ref name="Bottke_2012" /&gt; The increase in the orbital eccentricities and inclinations of the destabilized objects also raised impact velocities, resulting in a change the size distribution of lunar craters,&lt;ref name="Marchi_etal_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marchi|first1=Simone|last2=Bottke|first2=William F.|last3=Kring|first3=David A.|last4=Morbidelli|first4=Alessandro|title=The onset of the lunar cataclysm as recorded in its ancient crater populations|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=2012|volume=325|pages=27–38|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.01.021|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12000374|bibcode=2012E&amp;PSL.325...27M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the production of impact melt in the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name="Marchi_etal_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marchi|first1=S.|last2=Bottke|first2=W.

The mass of the outer disk in the five-planet model is roughly half that of the original Nice model. The magnitude of the bombardment may have been reduced further due to the icy planetesimals undergoing significant mass loss, or their having broken up as the entered the inner Solar System.

A number of issues have been raised regarding the connection between the Nice model and the Late Heavy Bombardment.

===Terrestrial planets===

A giant-planet migration in which the ratio of the periods of Jupiter and Saturn quickly cross from below 2.1 to greater than 2.3 can leave the terrestrial planets with orbits similar to their current orbits. The eccentricities and inclinations of a group of planets can be represented by the angular momentum deficit (AMD), a measure of the differences of their orbits from circular coplanar orbits. A study by Brasser, Walsh, and Nesvorny found that when a selected jumping-Jupiter model was used, the current angular momentum deficit has a reasonable chance (~20%) of being reproduced in numerical simulations if the AMD was initially between 10% and 70% of the current value. The orbit of Mars is largely unchanged in these simulations indicating that its initial orbit must have been more eccentric and inclined than those of the other planets.&lt;ref name=Brasser_2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Walsh|first2=K. J.|last3=Nesvorny|first3=D.|title=Constraining the primordial orbits of the terrestrial planets|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=2013|volume=433|issue=4|pages=3417–3427|doi=10.1093/mnras/stt986|arxiv=1306.0975|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/433/4/3417|bibcode = 2013MNRAS.433.3417B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jumping-Jupiter model used in this study was not typical, however, being selected from among only 5% with Jupiter and Saturn's period ratio jumped to beyond 2.3 while reproducing other aspects of the outer Solar System.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2012" /&gt;

The overall success rate of jumping-Jupiter models with a late instability reproducing both the inner and outer Solar System is small. When Kaib and Chambers conducted a large number of simulations starting with five giant planets in a resonance chain and Jupiter and Saturn in a 3:2 resonance, 85% resulted in the loss of a terrestrial planet, less than 5% reproduce the current AMD, and only 1% reproduce both the AMD and the giant planet orbits.&lt;ref name=Kaib_Chambers_2016 /&gt; In addition to the secular-resonance crossings, the jumps in Jupiter's eccentricity when it encounters an ice giant can also excite the orbits of the terrestrial planets.&lt;ref name=Agnor_2012 /&gt; This led them to propose that the Nice model migration occurred before the formation of the terrestrial planets and that the LHB had another cause.&lt;ref name=Kaib_Chambers_2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaib|first1=Nathan A.|last2=Chambers|first2=John E.|title=The fragility of the terrestrial planets during a giant-planet instability|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=2016|volume=455|issue=4|pages=3561–3569|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv2554|arxiv=1510.08448|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/455/4/3561|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.455.3561K }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the advantage of an early migration is significantly reduced by the requirement that the Jupiter–Saturn period ratio jump to beyond 2.3 to reproduce the current asteroid belt.&lt;ref name="Walsh_Morbidelli_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toliou_etal_2016" /&gt;

The jumping-Jupiter model can reproduce the eccentricity and inclination of Mercury's orbit. Mercury's eccentricity is excited when it crosses a secular resonance with Jupiter. When relativistic effects are included, Mercury's precession rate is faster, which reduces the impact of this resonance crossing, and results in a smaller eccentricity similar to its current value. Mercury's inclination may be the result of it or Venus crossing a secular resonance with Uranus.&lt;ref name="Roig_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roig|first1=Fernando|last2=Nesvorný|first2=David|last3=DeSouza|first3=Sandro Richardo|title=Jumping Jupiter can explain Mercury's orbit|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2016|arxiv=1603.02502|bibcode = 2016ApJ...820L..30R |doi = 10.3847/2041-8205/820/2/L30|volume=820|issue=2|page=L30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asteroid belt ===

The rapid traverse of resonances through the asteroid belt can leave its population and the overall distribution of its [[orbital elements]] largely preserved.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_Brasser_2010 /&gt; In this case the asteroid belt's depletion, the mixing of its [[asteroid spectral types|taxonomical classes]], and the excitation of its orbits, yielding a distribution of inclinations peaked near 10° and eccentricities peaked near 0.1, must have occurred earlier.&lt;ref name=Roig_Nesvorny_2015 /&gt; These may be the product of Jupiter's [[Grand Tack]], provided that an excess of higher eccentricity asteroids is removed due to interactions with the terrestrial planets.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Gomes|first2=Rodney S.|last3=Walsh|first3=Kevin J.|last4=Morbidelli|first4=Allesandro|last5=Nesvorný|first5=David|title=Is the Grand Tack model compatible with the orbital distribution of main belt asteroids?|journal=Icarus|date=2016|volume=272|issue=114|pages=114–124|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2016.02.043|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516001214|bibcode=2016Icar..272..114D|arxiv = 1701.02775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roig_Nesvorny_2015 /&gt; Gravitational stirring by [[planetary embryo]]s embedded in the asteroid belt could also produce its depletion, mixing, and excitation.&lt;ref name="O'Brien_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=David P.|last2=Morbidelli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Bottke|first3=William F.|title=The primordial excitation and clearing of the asteroid belt—Revisited|journal=Icarus|volume=191|issue=2|pages=434–452|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.05.005|bibcode=2007Icar..191..434O|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most if not all of the embryos must have been lost before the instability.&lt;ref name=Morbidelli_Brasser_2010 /&gt; A mixing of asteroids types could be the product of asteroids being scattered into the belt during the formation of the  planets.&lt;ref name="Raymond_Izidoro_2017a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Sean N.|last2=Izidoro|first2=Andre|title=Origin of water in the inner Solar System: Planetesimals scattered inward during Jupiter and Saturn's rapid gas accretion|journal=Icarus|date=2017|volume=297|issue=2017|pages=134–148|arxiv=1707.01234|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103517302592|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2017.06.030|bibcode=2017Icar..297..134R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond_Izidoro_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Sean N.|last2=Izidoro|first2=Andre|title=The empty primordial asteroid belt|journal=Science Advances|date=2017|volume=3|issue=9|pages=e1701138|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1701138|pmid=28924609|pmc=5597311|arxiv=1709.04242|bibcode=2017SciA....3E1138R}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initially small mass asteroid belt could have its inclinations and eccentricities excited by secular resonances that hopped across the asteroid belt if Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits became chaotic while in resonance.&lt;ref name="Izidoro_etal_2016" /&gt; 

The orbits of the asteroids could be excited during the instability if the ice giant spent hundreds of thousands of years on a Jupiter crossing orbit. Numerous gravitational encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter during this period would cause frequent variations in Jupiter's semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination. The forcing exerted by Jupiter on the orbits of the asteroids and the semi-major axes where it was strongest, would also vary, causing a chaotic excitation of the asteroids orbits that could reach or exceed their present level. The highest eccentricity asteroids would be later be removed by encounters with the terrestrial planets. The eccentricities of the terrestrial planets are excited beyond the current values during this process, however, requiring that the instability occur before their formation in this case.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deienno |first1=Rogerio |last2=Izidoro |first2=Andre |last3=Morbidelli |first3=Alessandro |last4=Gomes |first4=Rodney S. |last5=Nesvorny |first5=David |last6=Raymond |first6=Sean N. |title=The excitation of a primordial cold asteroid belt as an outcome of the planetary instability |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=864 |issue=1 |pages=50 |date=2018|arxiv=1808.00609|bibcode=2018ApJ...864...50D |doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aad55d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sweeping of resonances and the penetration of the ice giant into the asteroid belt results in the dispersal of [[asteroid family|asteroid collisional families]] formed during or before the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]]. A collisional family's inclinations and eccentricities are dispersed due to the sweeping secular resonances, including those inside mean motion resonances, with the eccentricities being most affected. Perturbations by close encounters with the ice giant result in the spreading of a family's semi-major axes.

Planetesimals from the outer disc are embedded in all parts of the asteroid belt, remaining as [[P-type asteroid|P-]] and [[D-type asteroid]]s. While Jupiter's resonances sweep across the asteroid belt, outer disk planetesimals are captured by its inner resonances, evolve to lower eccentricities via secular resonances with in these resonances, and are released onto stable orbits as Jupiter's resonances move on.&lt;ref name="Levison_etal_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levison|first1=Harold F|last2=Bottke|first2=William F.|last3=Gounelle|first3=Matthieu|last4=Morbidelli|first4=Alessandro|last5=Nesvorný|first5=David|last6=Tsiganis|first6=Kleomenis|title=Contamination of the asteroid belt by primordial trans-Neptunian objects|journal=Nature|date=2009|volume=460|issue=7253|pages=364–366|doi=10.1038/nature08094|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7253/full/nature08094.html|pmid=19606143|bibcode = 2009Natur.460..364L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other planetesimals are implanted in the asteroid belt during encounters with the ice giant, either directly leaving them with [[perihelion and aphelion|aphelia]] higher than that of the ice giant's [[perihelion and aphelion|perihelia]], or by removing them from a resonance.

=== Jupiter trojans ===

Most of the [[Jupiter trojans]] are jump-captured shortly after a gravitational encounters between Jupiter and an ice giant. During these encounters Jupiter's [[semi-major axis]] can jump by as much as 0.2 [[astronomical unit|AU]], displacing the [[Lagrangian point#L4 and L5|L4 and L5 points]] radially, and releasing many existing Jupiter trojans. New Jupiter trojans are captured from the population of planetesimals with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2013 /&gt; The captured trojans have a wide range of inclinations and eccentricities, the result of their being scattered by the giant planets as they migrated from their original location in the outer disk.

=== Irregular satellites ===

Jupiter captures a population of irregular satellites and the relative size of Saturn's population is increased.
During gravitational encounters between planets, the hyperbolic orbits of unbound planetesimals around one giant planet are perturbed by the presence of the other. If the geometry and velocities are right, these three-body interactions leave the planetesimal in a bound orbit when planets separate. Although this process is reversible, loosely bound satellites including possible primordial satellites can also escape during these encounters, tightly bound satellites remain and the number of irregular satellites increases over a series of encounters.

===Regular satellites===

The orbits of Jupiter's regular satellites can remain dynamically cold despite encounters between the giant planets. Gravitational encounters between planets perturb the orbits of their satellites, exciting inclinations and eccentricities, and altering semi-major axes. If these encounters would lead to results inconsistent with the observations, for example, collisions between or the ejections of satellites or the disruption of the [[Laplace resonance]] of Jupiter's moons [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], this could provide evidence against jumping-Jupiter models. In simulations, collisions between or the ejection of satellites was found to be unlikely, requiring an ice giant to approach within 0.02 AU of Jupiter. More distant encounters that disrupted the Laplace resonance were more common, though tidal interactions often lead to their recapture.&lt;ref name=Deienno_2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Nesvorný|first2=David|last3=Vokrouhlický|first3=David|last4=Yokoyama|first4=Tadashi|title=Orbital Perturbations of the Galilean Satellites during Planetary Encounters|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2014|volume=148|issue=2|page=25|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/148/2/25|arxiv=1405.1880|bibcode = 2014AJ....148...25D }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sensitive test of jumping-Jupiter models is the inclination of [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]'s orbit, which isn't damped by tidal interactions. Callisto's inclination remained small in six out of ten 5-planet models tested in one study (including some where Jupiter acquired irregular satellites consistent with observations),&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2014" /&gt; and another found the likelihood of Jupiter ejecting a fifth giant planet while leaving Callisto's orbit dynamically cold at 42%.&lt;ref name="Cloutier_etal_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cloutier|first1=Ryan|last2=Tamayo|first2=Daniel|last3=Valencia|first3=Diana|title=Could Jupiter or Saturn Have Ejected a Fifth Giant Planet?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2015|volume=813|issue=1|page=8|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/813/1/8|arxiv=1509.05397|bibcode=2015ApJ...813....8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto is also unlikely to have been part of the Laplace resonance, because encounters that raise it to its current orbit leave it with an excessive inclination.&lt;ref name=Deienno_2014 /&gt;

The encounters between planets also perturb the orbits of the moons of the other outer planets. Saturn's moon Iapetus could have been excited to its current inclination, if the ice giant's closest approach was out of the plane of Saturn's equator. If Saturn acquired its tilt before the encounters, Iapetus's inclination could also be excited due to multiple changes of its semi-major axis, because the inclination of Saturn's Laplace plane would vary with the distance from Saturn. In simulations, Iapetus was excited to its current inclination in five of ten of the jumping-Jupiter models tested, though three left it with excessive eccentricity. The preservation of Oberon's small inclination favors the 5-planet models, with only a few encounters between Uranus and an ice giant, over 4-planet models in which Uranus encounters Jupiter and Saturn. The low inclination of Uranus's moon Oberon, 0.1°, was preserved in nine out of ten of five planet models, while its preservation was found to be unlikely in four planet models.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorný|first1=David|last2=Vokrouhlický|first2=David|last3=Deienno|first3=Rogerio|last4=Walsh|first4=Kevin J.|title=Excitation of the Orbital Inclination of Iapetus during Planetary Encounters|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2014|volume=148|issue=3|page=52|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/52|bibcode=2014AJ....148...52N|arxiv = 1406.3600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2011" /&gt; The encounters between planets may have also be responsible for the absence of regular satellites of Uranus beyond the orbit of Oberon.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=R.|last2=Yokoyama|first2=T.|last3=Nogueira|first3=E.

The loss of ices from the inner satellites due to impacts is reduced. Numerous impacts of planetesimals onto the satellites of the outer planets occur during the Late Heavy Bombardment. In the bombardment predicted by the original Nice model, these impacts generate enough heat to vaporize the ices of Mimas, Enceladus and Miranda.&lt;ref name="Nimmo_Korycansky_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nimmo|first1=F.|last2=Korycansky|first2=D.

Furthermore, the gravitational stirring by Pluto-massed objects in the Nice 2 model excites the inclinations and eccentricities of planetesimals. This increases their velocities relative to the giant planets, decreasing the effectiveness of gravitational focusing, thereby reducing the fraction of planetesimals impacting the inner satellites. Combined these reduce the bombardment by an order of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Dones_Levison_2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dones|first1=L.|last2=Levison|first2=H.

Some of the impacts are catastrophic, resulting in the disruption of the inner satellites. In the bombardment of the original Nice model this may result in the disruption of several of the satellites of Saturn and Uranus. An order of magnitude reduction in the bombardment avoids the destruction of Dione and Ariel; but Miranda, Mimas, Enceladus, and perhaps Tethys would still be disrupted. These may be second generation satellites formed from the re-accretion of disrupted satellites. In this case Mimas would not be expected to be differentiated and the low density of Tethys may be due to it forming primarily from the mantle of a disrupted progenitor.&lt;ref name="Movshovitz_etal_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Movshovitz|first1=N.|last2=Nimmo|first2=F.|last3=Korycansky|first3=D.

===Giant planet tilts===

Jupiter's and Saturn's tilts can be produced by spin-orbit resonances. A spin-orbit resonance occurs when the [[axial precession|precession]] frequency of a planet's spin-axis matches the [[apsidal precession|precession]] frequency of another planet's ascending node. These frequencies vary during the planetary migration with the semi-major axes of the planets and the mass of the planetesimal disk. Jupiter's small tilt may be due to a quick crossing of a spin-orbit resonance with Neptune while Neptune's inclination was small, for example, during Neptune's initial migration before planetary encounters began. Alternatively, if that crossing occurred when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumped, it may be due to its current proximity to spin-orbit resonance with Uranus. Saturn's large tilt can be acquired if it is captured in a spin-orbit resonance with Neptune as Neptune slowly approached its current orbit at the end of the migration.&lt;ref name=Vokrouhlicky_Nesvorny_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vokrouhlický|first1=David|last2=Nesvorný|first2=David|title=Tilting Jupiter (a bit) and Saturn (a lot) during Planetary Migration|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2015|volume=806|issue=1|page=143|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/806/1/143|arxiv=1505.02938|bibcode = 2015ApJ...806..143V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final tilts of Jupiter and Saturn are very sensitive to the final positions of the planets: Jupiter's tilt would be much larger if Uranus migrated beyond its current orbit, Saturn's would be much smaller if Neptune's migration ended earlier or if the resonance crossing was more rapid. Even in simulations where the final position of the giant planets are similar to the current Solar System, Jupiter's and Saturn's tilt are reproduced less than 10% of the time.&lt;ref name=Brasser_Lee_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Lee|first2=Man Hoi|title=Tilting Saturn without Tilting Jupiter: Constraints on Giant Planet Migration|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2015|volume=150|issue=5|page=157|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/5/157|arxiv=1509.06834|bibcode = 2015AJ....150..157B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuiper belt ===

A slow migration of Neptune covering several AU results in a [[Kuiper belt]] with a broad inclination distribution. As Neptune migrates outward it scatters many objects from the planetesimal disk onto orbits with larger semi-major axes. Some of these planetesimals are then captured in mean-motion resonances with Neptune. While in a mean-motion resonance, their orbits can evolve via processes such as the [[Kozai mechanism]], reducing their eccentricities and increasing their inclinations; or via apsidal and nodal resonances, which alter eccentricities and inclinations respectively. Objects that reach low-eccentricity high-perihelion orbits can escape from the mean-motion resonance and are left behind in stable orbits as Neptune's migration continues.&lt;ref name=Gomes_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomes|first1=Rodney|title=The origin of the Kuiper Belt high-inclination population|journal=Icarus|volume=161|issue=2|pages=404–418|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103502000568|doi=10.1016/s0019-1035(02)00056-8|bibcode = 2003Icar..161..404G |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brasil_etal_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasil|first1=P.

The objects that remain in the mean-motion resonances at the end of Neptune's migration form the resonant populations such as the [[plutino]]s.

Encounters between Neptune and Pluto-massed objects reduce the fraction of Kuiper belt objects in resonances. Velocity changes during the gravitational encounters with planetesimals that drive Neptune's migration cause small jumps in its semi-major axis, yielding a migration that is grainy instead of smooth. The shifting locations of the resonances produced by this rough migration increases the libration amplitudes of resonant objects, causing many to become unstable and escape from resonances. The observed ratio of hot classical objects to plutinos is best reproduced in simulations that include 1000–4000 Pluto-massed objects (i.e. large [[dwarf planet]]s) or about 1000 bodies twice as massive as Pluto, making up 10–40% of the 20-Earth-mass planetesimal disk, with roughly 0.1% of this initial disk remaining in various parts of the Kuiper belt. The grainy migration also reduces the number of plutinos relative to objects in the 2:1 and 5:2 resonances with Neptune, and results in a population of plutinos with a narrower distribution of libration amplitudes.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Vokroulicky_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorný|first1=David|last2=Vokrouhlický|first2=David|title=Neptune's Orbital Migration Was Grainy, Not Smooth|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2016|volume=825|issue=2|page=94|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/825/2/94|arxiv=1602.06988|bibcode = 2016ApJ...825...94N }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of Pluto-massed objects would requires the Kuiper belt's size distribution to have multiple deviations from a constant slope.&lt;ref name="Shannon_Dawson_2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shannon |first1=Andrew |last2=Dawson |first2=Rebekah I. |title=Limits on the number of primordial Scattered Disk objects at Pluto mass and higher from the absence of their dynamical signatures on the present day trans-Neptunian Populations |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=480 |issue=2 |pages=1870 |date=2018 |arxiv=1807.03371|bibcode=2018MNRAS.480.1870S |doi=10.1093/mnras/sty1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kernel of the cold [[classical Kuiper belt object]]s is left behind when Neptune encounters the fifth giant planet.

The gravitational encounter causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump outward.

===Scattered Disk===

In the [[scattered disk]], a slow and grainy migration of Neptune leaves detached objects with perihelia greater than 40 AU clustered near its resonances. Planetesimals scattered outward by Neptune are captured in resonances, evolve onto lower-eccentricity higher-inclination orbits, and are released onto stable higher perihelion orbits. Beyond 50 AU this process requires a slower migration of Neptune for the perihelia to be raised above 40 AU. As a result, in the scattered disk fossilized high-perihelion objects are left behind only during the latter parts of Neptune's migration, yielding short trails (or fingers) on a plot of eccentricity vs. semi-major axis, near but just inside the current locations of Neptune's resonances. The extent of these trails is dependent on the timescale of Neptune's migration and extends farther inward if the timescale is longer. The release of these objects from resonance is aided by a grainy migration of Neptune which may be necessary for an object like {{mpl|2004 XR|190}} to have escaped from Neptune's 8:3 resonance.&lt;ref name="Kaib_Sheppard_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaib|first1=Nathan A.|last2=Sheppard|first2=Scott S.|title=Tracking Neptune's Migration History through High-Perihelion Resonant Trans-Neptunian Objects|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2016|volume=152|issue=5|page=133|doi=10.3847/0004-6256/152/5/133|arxiv=1607.01777|bibcode = 2016AJ....152..133K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorný|first1=David|last2=Vokrouhlický|first2=David|last3=Roig|first3=Fernando|title=The Orbital Distribution of Trans-Neptunian Objects Beyond 50 au|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2016|volume=827|issue=2|page=L35|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201527757|arxiv=1607.08279|bibcode=2016ApJ...827L..35N}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the encounter with the fifth planet leaves Neptune with a large eccentricity the semi-major axes of the high perihelion objects would be distributed more symmetrically about Neptune's resonances,&lt;ref name="Pike_Lawler_2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pike|first1=R.

The dynamics of the scattered disk left by Neptune's migration varies with distance. During Neptune's outward migration many objects are scattered onto orbits with semi-major axes greater than 50 AU. Similar to in the Kuiper belt, some of these objects are captured by and remain in a resonance with Neptune, while others escape from resonance onto stable orbits after their perihelia are raised. Other objects with perihelia near Neptune's also remain at the end of Neptune's migration. The orbits of these scattering objects vary with time as they continue to interact with Neptune, with some of them entering planet crossing orbits, briefly becoming centaurs or comets before they are ejected from the Solar System. Roughly 80% of the objects between 50 and 200 AU have stable, resonant or detached, orbits with semi-major axes that vary less than 1.5 AU per billion years. The remaining 20% are actively scattering objects with semi-major axes that vary significantly due to interactions with Neptune. Beyond 200 AU most objects in the scattered disc are actively scattering. The total mass deposited in the scattered disk is about twice that of the classical Kuiper belt, with roughly 80% of the objects surviving to the present having semi-major axes less than 200 AU.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorny|first1=D.|last2=Vokrouhlicky|first2=D.|last3=Dones|first3=L.|last4=Levison|first4=H.

===Planet Nine cloud===

If the hypothetical [[Planet Nine]] exists and was present during the giant planet migration a cloud of objects with similar semi-major axes would be formed. Objects scattered outward to semi-major axes greater than 200 AU would have their perihelia raised by the dynamical effects of Planet Nine decoupling them from the influence of Neptune. The semi-major axes the objects dynamically controlled by Planet Nine would be centered on its semi-major axis, ranging from 200 AU to ~2000 AU, with most objects having semi-major axes greater than that of Planet Nine. Their inclinations would be roughly isotropic, ranging up to 180 degrees. The perihelia of these object would cycle over periods of over 100 Myr, returning many to the influence of the Neptune. The estimated mass remaining at the current time is 0.3 – 0.4 Earth masses.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2017" /&gt;

===Oort cloud===

Some of the objects scattered onto very distant orbits during the giant planet migration are captured in the Oort cloud. The outer Oort cloud, semi-major axes greater than 20,000 AU, forms quickly as the galactic tide raises the perihelion of object beyond the orbits of the giant planets. The inner Oort cloud forms more slowly, from the outside in, due to the weaker effect of the galactic tide on objects with smaller semi-major axes. Most objects captured in the outer Oort cloud are scattered outward by Saturn, without encountering Jupiter, with some being scattered outward by Uranus and Neptune. Those captured in the inner Oort cloud are primarily scattered outward by Neptune. Roughly 6.5% of the planetesimals beyond Neptune's initial orbit, approximately 1.3 Earth masses, are captured in the Oort cloud with roughly 60% in the inner cloud.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2017" /&gt;

Objects may also have been captured earlier and from other sources. As the sun left its birth cluster objects could have been captured in the Oort cloud from other stars.&lt;ref name="Levison_etal_2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levison|first1=Harold F.|last2=Duncan|first2=Martin J.|last3=Brasser|first3=Ramon|last4=Kaufmann|first4=David E.|title=Capture of the Sun's Oort Cloud from Stars in Its Birth Cluster|journal=Science|date=2010|volume=329|issue=5988|pages=187–190|doi=10.1126/science.1187535|pmid=20538912|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5988/187.full|bibcode = 2010Sci...329..187L }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the gas disk extended beyond the orbits of the giant planets when they cleared their neighborhoods comet-sized object are slowed by gas drag preventing them from reaching the Oort cloud.&lt;ref name="Brasser_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Duncan|first2=M.

The '''Kensington Runestone''' is a {{convert|202|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} slab of [[greywacke]] covered in [[Runic alphabet|runes]] on its face and side. 
A [[Swedish American|Swedish immigrant]], Olof Ohman, reported that he discovered it in 1898 in the largely rural township of [[Solem Township, Douglas County, Minnesota|Solem]], [[Douglas County, Minnesota]], and named it after the nearest settlement, [[Kensington, Minnesota|Kensington]].

The inscription purports to be a record left behind by Scandinavian explorers in the 14th century (internally dated to the year 1362). 
There has been a drawn-out debate on the stone's authenticity, but the [[scholarly consensus]] has classified it as a 19th-century [[hoax]] since it was first examined in 1910, with some critics directly charging the purported discoverer Ohman with fabricating the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Helmer|last=Gustavson|title=The non-enigmatic runes of the Kensington stone|volume=2004|issue=3|journal=Viking Heritage Magazine|publisher=Gotland University}} "[...] every Scandinavian runologist and expert in Scandinavian historical linguistics has declared the Kensington stone a hoax [...]";

Ohman's ten-year-old son, Edward Ohman, noticed some markings,&lt;ref&gt;Hall Jr., Robert A.: ''The Kensington Rune-Stone Authentic and Important'', page 3. Jupiter Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and the farmer later said he thought they had found an "Indian [[almanac]]."

During this period the journey of [[Leif Ericson]] to [[Vinland]] (North America) was being widely discussed and there was renewed interest in the [[Viking]]s throughout Scandinavia, stirred by the [[Romantic nationalism|National Romanticism]] movement. Five years earlier [[Norway]] had participated in the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] by sending the ''[[Viking (ship)|Viking]]'', a replica of the ''[[Gokstad ship]]'', to [[Chicago]]. There was also friction between [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] (which ultimately led to [[Norway's independence]] from Sweden in 1905). Some Norwegians claimed the stone was a Swedish hoax and there were similar Swedish accusations because the stone references a joint expedition of Norwegians and Swedes. It is thought to be more than coincidental that the stone was found among Scandinavian newcomers in Minnesota, still struggling for acceptance and quite proud of their Nordic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Michlovic, "Folk Archaeology in Anthropological Perspective" ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' '''31'''.1 (February 1990:103–107) p. 105ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of the inscription made its way to the [[University of Minnesota]]. [[Olaus J. Breda]] (1853–1916), professor of Scandinavian Languages and Literature in the Scandinavian Department, declared the stone to be a forgery and published a discrediting article which appeared in ''[[Symra]]'' during 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Olaus J. Breda. ''Rundt Kensington-stenen'', ([[Symra]]. 1910, pp. 65–80)&lt;/ref&gt; Breda also forwarded copies of the inscription to fellow linguists and historians in Scandinavia, such as [[Oluf Rygh]], [[Sophus Bugge]], [[Gustav Storm]], [[Magnus Olsen]] and [[Adolf Noreen]]. They "unanimously pronounced the Kensington inscription a fraud and forgery of recent date".&lt;ref name="Blegen1960"/&gt;

The stone was then sent to [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Scholars either dismissed it as a prank or felt unable to identify a sustainable historical context and the stone was returned to Ohman. [[Hjalmar Holand]], a Norwegian-American historian and author, claimed Ohman gave him the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = My First Eighty Years|last = Holand|first = Hjalmar|publisher = Twayne Publishers, Inc|year = 1957|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] has a bill of sale showing Ohman sold them the stone for $10 in 1911. Holand renewed public interest with an article&lt;ref&gt;Holand, "First authoritative investigation of oldest document in America", ''[[Journal of American History]]'' '''3''' (1910:165–84); Michlovic noted Holand's contrast of the Scandinavians as undaunted, brave, daring, faithful and intrepid contrasted with the Indians as savages, wild heathens, pillagers, vengeful, like wild beasts: an interpretation that "placed it squarely within the framework of Indian-white relations in Minnesota at the time of its discovery." (Michlovic 1990:106).&lt;/ref&gt; enthusiastically summarizing studies that were made by geologist [[Newton Horace Winchell]] (Minnesota Historical Society) and linguist [[George T. Flom]] ([[Philological Society]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]), who both published opinions in 1910.&lt;ref name="mhs1910"&gt;

According to Winchell, the tree under which the stone was found had been destroyed before 1910. Several nearby poplars that witnesses estimated as being about the same size were cut down and, by counting their rings, it was determined they were around 30–40 years old. One member of the team who had excavated at the find site in 1899, county schools superintendent Cleve Van Dyke, later recalled the trees being only ten or twelve years old.&lt;ref&gt;Milo M. Quaife, "The myth of the Kensington runestone: The Norse discovery of Minnesota 1362" in ''The New England Quarterly'' December 1934&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding county had not been settled until 1858, and settlement was severely restricted for a time by the [[Dakota War of 1862]] (although it was reported that the best land in the township adjacent to [[Solem Township, Douglas County, Minnesota|Solem]], [[Holmes City]], was already taken by 1867, by a mixture of Swedish, Norwegian and "Yankee" settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lobeck |first=Engebret P. |title=Holmes City narrative on Trysil (Norway) emigrants website (via Archive.org) |year=1867 |url=http://www.digitalheadhouse.com/family/reunion/History.htm |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030629163819/http://www.digitalheadhouse.com/family/reunion/History.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Winchell estimated that the inscription was roughly 500 years old, by comparing its weathering with the weathering on the backside, which he assumed was glacial and 8000 years old. Winchell also mentions in the same report that Prof. W. O. Hotchkiss, state geologist of Wisconsin, estimated that the runes were "at least 50 to 100 years." Meanwhile, Flom found a strong apparent divergence between the runes used in the Kensington inscription and those in use during the 14th century. Similarly, the language of the inscription was modern compared to the Nordic languages of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="mhs1910"/&gt;

The sequences ''rr'', ''ll'' and ''gh'' represent actual digraphs. The ''AVM'' is written in Latin capitals.
The numbers given in Arabic numerals in the above transcription are given in the [[pentimal system]].
At least seven of the runes, including those transcribed ''a, d, v, j, ä, ö'' above, are not in any standard known from the medieval period (see [[#Paleographic evidence|below]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;Aslak Liestöl, "The Bergen Runes and the Kensington Inscription Minnesota History 40 (1966), p. 59 [http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/40/v40i02p059-059.pdf] "To Scandinavian scholars this will not be starrtling news, for they are agreed that the Kensington inscription is modern. [...] The myth of the Kensington stone lives on, I am sorry to say, partly because scholarship has failed in making its views known in a form suitable to convince the public."&lt;/ref&gt;
The language of the inscription is close to modern Swedish, the transliterated text being quite easily comprehensible to 
any speaker of a modern Scandinavian language. The language being closer to the Swedish of the 19th than of the 14th century is one of the main reasons for the scholarly consensus dismissing it as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Wahlgren1958"/&gt;

The text translates to:

"Eight [[Geats]] and twenty-two Norwegians on an exploration journey from Vinland to the west. We had camp by two skerries one day's journey north from this stone. We were [out] to fish one day. After we came home [we] found ten men red of blood and dead. AVM ([[Ave Maria|Ave Virgo Maria]]) save [us] from evil."

"[We] have ten men by the sea to look after our ships, fourteen days' travel from this island. [In the] year 1362."

== Linguistic analysis==
Holand took the stone to Europe and, while newspapers in Minnesota carried articles hotly debating its authenticity, the stone was quickly dismissed by Swedish linguists.

For the next 40 years, Holand struggled to sway public and scholarly opinion about the Runestone, writing articles and several books. He achieved brief success in 1949, when the stone was put on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and scholars such as [[William Thalbitzer]] and S. N. Hagen published papers supporting its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=8 October 1951|title= Olof Ohman's Runes |journal= [[TIME]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859375,00.html |accessdate=2009-02-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At nearly the same time, Scandinavian linguists Sven Jansson, [[Erik Moltke]], Harry Anderson and K. M. Nielsen, along with a popular book by Erik Wahlgren, again questioned the Runestone's authenticity.&lt;ref name="Wahlgren1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wahlgren|first=Erik|title=The Kensington Stone, A Mystery Solved|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1958|isbn=1-125-20295-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Wahlgren, historian [[Theodore C. Blegen]] flatly asserted&lt;ref name="Blegen1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blegen|first=T|title=The Kensington Rune Stone : New Light on an Old Riddle|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|year=1960|isbn=0-87351-044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohman had carved the artifact as a prank, possibly with help from others in the Kensington area. Further resolution seemed to come with the 1976 published transcript&lt;ref name="Fridley1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fridley|first=R|year=1976|title=The case of the Gran tapes|journal=Minnesota History|volume=45|issue=4|pages=152–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an interview of Frank Walter Gran conducted by Paul Carson, Jr. on August 13, 1967 that had been recorded on audio tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507081851/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1977/5/1977_5_110.shtml|title=AmericanHeritage.com / POSTSCRIPTS|author=|date=7 May 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Case of the Gran Tapes", ''Minnesota History'' pages 152–156 (Winter 1976) [http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/45/v45i04p152-156.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Gran said his father John confessed in 1927 that Ohman made the inscription. John Gran's story however was based on second-hand anecdotes he had heard about Ohman, and although it was presented as a [[dying declaration]], Gran lived for several more years, saying nothing more about the stone.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The possibility of the runestone being an authentic 14th-century artefact was again raised in 1982 by [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.|Robert Hall]], an emeritus professor of Italian language and literature at [[Cornell University]], who published a book (and a follow up in 1994) questioning the methodology  of its critics. Hall asserted that the odd philological problems in the Runestone could be the result of normal dialectal variances in Old Swedish of the period. He further contended that critics had failed to consider the physical evidence, which he found leaning heavily in favour of authenticity.

In ''The Vikings and America'' (1986), Wahlgren again stated that the text bore linguistic abnormalities and spellings that he thought suggested the Runestone was a forgery.&lt;ref name="Wahlgren1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wahlgren|first=Erik|title=The Vikings and America (Ancient Peoples and Places)|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1986|isbn= 0-500-02109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lexical evidence===
One of the main linguistic arguments for the rejection of the text as genuine Old Swedish is the term  
''opthagelse farth'' (''updagelsefard'') "journey of discovery". 
This lexeme is unattested in either Scandinavian, Low Franconian or Low German before the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Henrik|title=The Kensington Runestone: Fact and Fiction|journal=The Swedish-American Historical Quarterly|year=2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=3–22|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-179079}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term exists in modern Scandinavian (Norwegian ''oppdagingsferd'' or ''oppdagelsesferd'', Swedish ''upptäcktsfärd'')
It is a loan from Low German  ''*updagen'', Dutch ''opdagen'', which are in turn from High German ''aufdecken'', ultimately loan-translated from French ''découvrir'' "to discover" in the 16th century.
&lt;!--genuine Low German has ''ontdekken'', but not ''updekken''--&gt;
&lt;!--why is this etymological fact traced to a random conversation held in 1911?
In a conversation with Holand in 1911, the lexicographer of the Old Swedish Dictionary (Soderwall) noted that his work was limited mostly to surviving legal documents written in formal and stilted language and that the root word ''opdage'' must have been a borrowed Germanic term (i.e. from Low German, Dutch or High German). Also, the ''-else'' ending characterizes a class of words that the Scandinavians borrowed from their southern neighbors.
--&gt;
The Norwegian historian Gustav Storm often used the modern Norwegian lexeme in late 19th-century articles on Viking exploration, creating a plausible incentive for the manufacturer of the inscription to use this word.

===Grammatical evidence===
Another characteristic pointed out by skeptics is the text's lack of [[Grammatical case|cases]].
Early Old Swedish (14th century) still retained  the four cases of [[Old Norse]], but Late Old Swedish (15th century) reduced its case structure to two cases, so that the absence of inflection in a Swedish text of the 14th century would be an irregularity. 
Similarly, the inscription text does not use the plural verb forms that were common in the 14th century and have only recently disappeared: for example, (plural forms in parenthesis) "wi war" (wörum), "hathe" (höfuðum), "[wi] fiske" (fiskaðum), "kom" (komum), "fann" (funnum) and "wi hathe" (hafdum).

Proponents of the stone's authenticity pointed to sporadic examples of these simpler forms in some 14th-century texts and to the great changes of the morphological system of the Scandinavian languages that began during the latter part of that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jdbengt.net/articles/kensington.pdf| author=John D. Bengtson| title=The Kensington Rune Stone: A Study Guide| publisher=jdbengt.net| accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleographic evidence===
The inscription contains "[[pentimal system|pentadic]]" numerals. Such numerals are known in Scandinavia, but nearly always from relatively recent times, not from verified medieval runic monuments, on which numbers were usually spelled out as words.

S. N. Hagen stated  "The Kensington alphabet is a synthesis of older unsimplified runes, later dotted runes, and a number of Latin letters ... The runes for a, n, s and t are the old Danish unsimplified forms which should have been out of use for a long time [by the 14th century]...I suggest that [a posited 14th century] creator must at some time or other in his life have been familiar with an inscription (or inscriptions) composed at a time when these unsimplified forms were still in use" and that he "was not a professional runic scribe before he left his homeland".&lt;ref&gt;Article ''The Kensington Runic Inscription'' by S.N. Hagen, in: ''Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies'', Vol. XXV, No.3, July 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Runes.Larsson.gif|thumb|250px|Edward Larsson's runic alphabets from 1885]]
A possible origin for the irregular shape of the runes was discovered in 2004, in the  1883 notes of a then-16-year-old journeyman tailor with an interest in folk music, Edward Larsson.&lt;ref name="DAUM"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tryggve Sköld |year=2003 |title=Edward Larssons alfabet och Kensingtonstenens |journal=DAUM-katta |volume= |issue=Winter 2003 |pages=7–11 |publisher=Dialekt-, ortnamns- och folkminnesarkivet i Umeå |location=[[Umeå]] |issn=1401-548X |url=http://www2.sofi.se/daum/katta/katta13/katta13.pdf |language=sv |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817211023/http://www2.sofi.se/daum/katta/katta13/katta13.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larsson's aunt had migrated with her husband and son from Sweden to Crooked Lake, just outside Alexandria, in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Kensingtonsteinens gåte |accessdate=2013-08-08 |series=Schrödingers katt |network=NRK |date=2012-12-20 |transcript=Episode subtitles (click "Teksting") |transcripturl=http://tv.nrk.no/serie/schrodingers-katt1/dmpv73003712/20-12-2012 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Larsson's sheet lists two different [[Futhark]]s. The first Futhark consists of 22 runes, the last two of which are bind-runes, representing the letter-combinations EL and MW. His second Futhark consists of 27 runes, where the last 3 are specially adapted to represent the letters å, ä, and ö of the modern Swedish alphabet. The runes in this second set correspond closely to the non-standard runes in the Kensington inscription.&lt;ref name="DAUM" /&gt;

The abbreviation for ''[[Ave Maria]]'' consists of the Latin letters ''AVM''.
Wahlgren (1958) noted that the carver had incised a notch on the upper right hand corner of the letter V.&lt;ref name="Wahlgren1958"/&gt;  The Massey Twins in their 2004 paper argued that this notch is consistent with a [[scribal abbreviation]] for a final ''-e'' used in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Keith and Kevin Massey, "Authentic Medieval Elements in the Kensington Stone" in Epigraphic Society Occasional Publications Vol. 24 2004, pp 176–182&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purported historical context  ==
[[Image:Kung Magnus Erikssons domsigill.jpg|thumb|200px|''Sigillum ad causas'' for [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]], King of Norway and Sweden]]
There is some limited historical evidence for possible 14th-century Scandinavian expeditions to North America. In a letter by [[Gerardus Mercator]] to [[John Dee]], dated 1577, Mercator refers to a Jacob Cnoyen, who had learned that eight men returned to Norway from an expedition to the Arctic islands in 1364. One of the men, a priest, provided the King of Norway with a great deal of geographical information.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Carl Christian Rafn]] in the early  19th century mentions a priest named [[Ivar Bardarsson]], who had previously been based in [[Greenland]] and turns  up in Norwegian records from 1364 onward{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

Furthermore, in 1354, King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] of Sweden and Norway had issued a letter appointing a law officer named [[Paul Knutson|Paul Knutsson]] as leader of an expedition to the colony of [[Greenland]], to investigate reports that the population was turning away from Christian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/middelalder/diplom_vise_tekst.prl?b=16908&amp;s=n&amp;str=|title=Diplomatarium Norvegicum|author=|date=|website=www.dokpro.uio.no|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the documents reprinted by the 19th century scholars was a scholarly attempt by Icelandic Bishop Gisli Oddsson, in 1637, to compile a history of the Arctic colonies. He dated the Greenlanders' fall away from Christianity to 1342, and claimed that they had turned instead to America. Supporters of a 14th-century origin for the Kensington runestone argue that Knutson may therefore have travelled beyond Greenland to North America, in search of renegade Greenlanders, most of his expedition being killed in Minnesota and leaving just the eight voyagers to return to Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

However, there is no evidence that the Knutson expedition ever set sail (the government of Norway went through considerable turmoil in 1355) and the information from Cnoyen as relayed by Mercator states specifically that the eight men who came to Norway in 1364 were not survivors of a recent expedition, but descended from the colonists who had settled the distant lands several generations earlier.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt; Also, those early 19th century books, which aroused a great deal of interest among [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian Americans]], would have been available to a late 19th-century hoaxer.
 
Hjalmar Holand adduced the "blond" Indians among the [[Mandan]] on the Upper Missouri River as possible descendants of the Swedish and Norwegian explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Hjalmar Holand, "The Kensington Rune Stone: A Study in Pre-Columbian American History." Ephraim WI, self-published (1932).&lt;/ref&gt; This was dismissed as "tangential" to the Runestone issue by Alice Beck Kehoe (2004), in her book "The Kensington Runestone, Approaching a Research Question Holistically."&lt;ref name="Kehoe6"&gt;Alice Beck Kehoe, ''The Kensington Runestone: Approaching a Research Question Holistically'', Long Grove IL, Waveland Press (2004) {{ISBN|1-57766-371-3}}.

==Governmental controls to prevent outbreaks==
===Regulations and ordinances===
The guidance issued by the UK government's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) now recommends that microbiological monitoring for wet cooling systems, using a [[dipslide]], should be performed weekly. The guidance now also recommends that routine testing for legionella bacteria in wet cooling systems be carried out at least quarterly, and more frequently when a system is being commissioned, or if the bacteria have been identified on a previous occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/46-2.htm#para8 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020031125/http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/46-2.htm |date=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further non-statutory UK guidance from the Water Regulations Advisory Scheme now exists for pre-heating of water in applications such as solar water heating systems.&lt;ref name=Makin2014/&gt;

The City of [[Garland, Texas]] requires yearly testing for legionella bacteria at cooling towers at apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-legionella_01eas.ART0.East.Edition1.29739cd.html |title=The Dallas Morning News, Garland tough on bacteria |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date=2007-02-01 |access-date=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malta]] requires twice yearly testing for ''Legionella'' bacteria at cooling towers and water fountains. [[Malta]] prohibits the installation of new cooling towers and evaporative condensers at health care facilities and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov.mt/EN/legalnotices/2006/01/LN5.pdf |title=299601 Legionella |format=PDF |access-date=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texas Department of State Health Services has provided guidelines for hospitals to detect and prevent the spread of [[nosocomial infection]] due to legionella.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Texas Legionnaires' Disease Task Force, Texas Department of State Health Services{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group has published guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1274093149925 |title=European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires' Disease |website=Web.archive.org |access-date=2017-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706104006/http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1274093149925 |archive-date=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the actions to be taken to limit the number of colony forming units (i.e., the "aerobic count") of micro-organisms per mL at 30&amp;nbsp;°C (minimum 48 hours incubation):

Almost all natural water sources contain ''Legionella'' and their presence should not be taken as an indication of a problem. The tabled figures are for total aerobic plate count, cfu/ml at 30&amp;nbsp;°C (minimum 48 hours incubation) with colony count determined by the pour plate method according to ISO 6222(21) or spread plate method on yeast extract agar. Legionella isolation can be conducted using the method developed by the US Center for Disease Control using buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with antibiotics.

Many other governmental agencies, cooling tower manufacturers, and industrial trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling the growth of ''Legionella'' in cooling towers. However, in the US, there are no regulations requiring testing or maintaining any specified levels in these facilities.

===Eliminating breeding grounds===
The bacteria grow best in warm water, like the kind found in hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, or parts of the air-conditioning systems of large buildings. Indoor ornamental fountains have been confirmed as a cause of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks, in which [[submerged lighting]] as a heat source was attributed to the outbreak in all documented cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Controlling the growth of ''Legionella'' in ornamental fountains is touched on in many of the listed guidelines,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} especially for solar water heating systems.&lt;ref name=Makin2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Preheated Domestic Hot Water: Storage of Preheated Domestic Hot Water and Possible Growth of Legionella Bacteria |url=https://www.wras.co.uk/downloads/public_area/publications/general/preheated_water_Nov_2014.pdf | vauthors = Makin T  |date=November 2014 |publisher=The Water Regulations Advisory Scheme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding an [[antibacterial agent]] to the automobiles' windshield system's reservoir is also recommended Legionellae have been discovered in up to 40% of freshwater environments and have been in up to 80% of freshwater sites by PCR hybridization assay.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

''Legionella'' bacteria themselves can be inactivated by [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light. However, ''Legionella'' bacteria that grow and reproduce in [[amoeba]]e or that are sheltered in corrosion particles cannot be killed by UV light alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

''Legionella'' will grow in water at temperatures from {{convert|20|to|50|C|F}}. However, the bacteria reproduce at the greatest rate in [[stagnant water]] at temperatures of {{convert|35|to|46|C|F}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Copper-Silver ionization is an effective industrial control and prevention process to eradicate ''Legionella'' in potable water distribution systems and cooling towers found in health facilities, hotels, nursing homes and most large buildings. In 2003, ionization became the first such hospital disinfection process to have fulfilled a proposed four-step modality evaluation; by then it had been adopted by over 100 hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stout JE, Yu VL | title = Hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease: new developments | journal = Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–41 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12861086 | doi = 10.1097/00001432-200308000-00005 | url = http://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=12861086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies indicate ionization is superior to thermal eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Yu-Sen E. |last1=Lin |first2=Janet E. |last2=Stout |first3=Victor L. |last3=Yu |year=2001 |chapter=Control of ''Legionella'' |pages=505–12 |chapterurl={{Google books|3f-kPJ17_TYC|page=505|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Seymour Stanton |editor1-last=Block | name-list-format = vanc |title=Disinfection, Sterilization, and Preservation |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-683-30740-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study by Lin, Stout and Yu found Copper-Silver ionization to be the only Legionella control technology which has been validated through a 4-step scientific approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin YE, Stout JE, Yu VL | title = Controlling Legionella in hospital drinking water: an evidence-based review of disinfection methods | journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–73 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21460472 | doi = 10.1086/657934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent research study provided evidence that ''Legionella pneumophila'', the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, can travel airborne at least 6&amp;nbsp;km from its source. In 2000, ASHRAE issued guidelines to maintain water systems and to decrease the chances of Legionnaires' disease transmission. The guidelines were not valued because legionella multiply in such temperatures. On the other hand, a lot of states had regulations that limited temperatures in health care facilities in order to reduce scalding injuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

It was previously believed that transmission of the bacterium was restricted to much shorter distances. A team of French scientists reviewed the details of an epidemic of Legionnaires' disease that took place in [[Pas-de-Calais]] in northern France in 2003–2004. There were 86 confirmed cases during the outbreak, of whom 18 died. The source of infection was identified as a cooling tower in a [[petrochemical]] plant, and an analysis of those affected in the outbreak revealed that some infected people lived as far as 6–7&amp;nbsp;km from the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen TM, Ilef D, Jarraud S, Rouil L, Campese C, Che D, Haeghebaert S, Ganiayre F, Marcel F, Etienne J, Desenclos JC | title = A community-wide outbreak of legionnaires disease linked to industrial cooling towers--how far can contaminated aerosols spread? | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–11 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16323138 | doi = 10.1086/498575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of Legionnaires' disease cases in May 2005 in [[Sarpsborg]], [[Norway]] concluded that: "The high velocity, large drift, and high humidity in the air scrubber may have contributed to the wide spread of ''Legionella'' species, probably for &gt;10 km."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nygård K, Werner-Johansen Ø, Rønsen S, Caugant DA, Simonsen Ø, Kanestrøm A, Ask E, Ringstad J, Ødegård R, Jensen T, Krogh T, Høiby EA, Ragnhildstveit E, Aaberge IS, Aavitsland P | title = An outbreak of legionnaires disease caused by long-distance spread from an industrial air scrubber in Sarpsborg, Norway | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–9 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18171215 | doi = 10.1086/524016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a study by the UK [[Health Protection Agency]] reported that 20% of cases may be caused by infected windscreen washer systems filled with pure water. The finding came after researchers spotted that professional drivers are five times more likely to contract the disease. No cases of infected systems were found whenever a suitable [[Windshield washer fluid|washer fluid]] was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson |first=Emma | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/10293519.stm |title=Windscreen water infection risk |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-06-13 |access-date=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7302">This is a list of craters on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The surface of [[Jupiter]]'s moon Europa is very young, geologically speaking, and as a result there are very few [[Impact crater|crater]]s. Furthermore, as Europa's surface is potentially made of weak water ice over a liquid ocean, most surviving craters have slumped so that their structure is very low in relief. Most of the craters that are large enough to have names are named after prominent figures in [[Celtic mythology|Celtic myths]] and folklore.

'''Logology''' ("the science of science") is the study of all aspects of [[science]] and of its [[scientist|practitioner]]s—aspects [[philosophy of science|philosophical]], biological, [[psychology of science|psychological]], [[sociology of science|societal]], [[history of science|historical]], [[politics|political]], [[research institute|institutional]], [[finance|financial]].  The term "logology" is used here as a [[synonym]]&lt;ref name=Zameck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasparek/&gt; for the equivalent term "science of science"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ "Science of Science Cyberinfrastructure Portal... at Indiana University"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219224025/http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ |date=2013-02-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", 1935, reprinted in [[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', Boston, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|83-01-03607-9}}, pp. 82–95.&lt;/ref&gt; and the semi-equivalent term "[[sociology of science]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Joseph Ben-David  |author2=Teresa A.

The term "logology" is [[back-formation|back-formed]] from "''-logy''" (as in "geo''logy''", "anthropo''logy''", "socio''logy''", etc.) in the sense of the "study of study" or the "science of science"—or, more plainly, the "study of science".&lt;ref name=Zameck&gt;{{cite book |author=[[:pl:Stefan Zamecki|Stefan Zamecki]] |title=Komentarze do naukoznawczych poglądów Williama Whewella (1794–1866):  studium historyczno-metodologiczne ''[Commentaries to the Logological Views of William Whewell (1794–1866):  A Historical-Methodological Study]'' |publisher=Wydawnictwa IHN PAN |year=2012|title-link=William Whewell }}, {{ISBN|978-83-86062-09-6}}, English-language summary: pp. 741–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasparek&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25778765 |author=[[Christopher Kasparek]] |title=Prus' ''Pharaoh'': The Creation of a Historical Novel |journal=[[The Polish Review]] |volume=XXXIX |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=45–46}} note 3&lt;/ref&gt;  
The word "logology" provides grammatical variants not available with the earlier terms "science of science" and "sociology of science"—"logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".{{efn|This meaning of "logology" is distinct from "the study of words", as the term was introduced by [[Kenneth Burke]] in ''The Rhetoric of Religion: Studies in Logology'' (1961), which sought to find a universal theory and methodology of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burke, Kenneth |year=1970  |title=The Rhetoric of Religion: Studies in Logology |publisher=University of California Press  |isbn=9780520016101 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sHD-u9uK-AAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In introducing the book, Burke wrote: "If we defined 'theology' as 'words about God', then by 'logology' we should mean 'words about words'". [[Logology (theology)|Burke's "logology"]], in this [[theology|theological]] sense, has been cited as a useful tool of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bentz, V.M. |author2=Kenny, W. |year=1997 |title="Body-As-World": Kenneth Burke's Answer to the Postmodernist Charges against Sociology |journal=Sociological Theory |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–96 |doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00024}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==
The early 20th century brought calls, initially from [[sociology|sociologists]], for the creation of a new, empirically-based [[science]] that would study the [[science|scientific enterprise]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], "Editor's Note", ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', edited by Bohdan Walentynowicz, Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|83-01-03607-9}}, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;  The early proposals were put forward with some hesitancy and tentativeness.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Klemens Szaniawski|Klemens Szaniawski]], "Preface", ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]] concluded that, while the singling out of a certain group of questions into a separate, "autonomous" discipline might be insignificant from a theoretical standpoint, it is not so from a practical one:  "A new grouping of [questions] lends additional importance to the original [questions] and gives rise to new ones and [to] new ideas.  The new grouping marks out the direction of new investigations; moreover, it may exercise an influence on university studies [and on] the found[ing] of chairs, periodicals and societies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", reprinted in [[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The new [[Metascience (research)|meta-science]] would be given a variety of names,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; including "science of knowledge", "science of science", "[[sociology of science]]", and "logology".

[[Florian Znaniecki]], who is considered to be the founder of Polish academic sociology, and who in 1954 also served as the 44th president of the [[American Sociological Association]], opened a 1923 article:&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Znaniecki]], ''"Przedmiot i zadania nauki o wiedzy"'' ("The Subject Matter and Tasks of the Science of Knowledge"), ''Nauka Polska'' (Polish Science), vol. IV (1923), no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[T]hough theoretical reflection on [[knowledge]] — which arose as early as [[Heraclitus]] and the [[Eleatics]] — stretches... unbroken... through the history of human thought to the present day... we are now witnessing the creation of a new ''science of knowledge'' [author's emphasis] whose relation to the old inquiries may be compared with the relation of modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] to the '[[natural philosophy]]' that preceded them, or of contemporary [[sociology]] to the '[[political philosophy]]' of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]].  [T]here is beginning to take shape a concept of a single, general theory of knowledge... permitting of empirical study....  This theory... is coming to be distinguished clearly from [[epistemology]], from normative [[logic]], and from a strictly descriptive [[history of knowledge]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Znaniecki]], "The Subject Matter and Tasks of the Science of Knowledge" (English translation), ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dozen years later, Polish husband-and-wife sociologists [[Stanisław Ossowski]] and [[Maria Ossowska]] (the ''Ossowscy'') took up the same subject in an article on "The Science of Science"&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", originally published in Polish as ''"Nauka o nauce"'' ("The Science of Science") in ''Nauka Polska'' (Polish Science), vol. XX (1935), no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; whose 1935 English-language version first introduced the term ''"science of science"'' to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], Editor's Note, in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article postulated that the new discipline would subsume such earlier ones as [[epistemology]], the [[philosophy of science]], the "[[psychology of science]]", and the "[[sociology of science]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", reprinted in [[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Science of science'' would also concern itself with questions of a practical character such as social and state policy in relation to science; the organization of institutions of higher learning, of research institutes, and of scientific expeditions; the protection of scientific workers, etc.  It would concern itself as well with historical questions:  the history of the conception of science, of the scientist, of the various disciplines, and of learning in general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1935 paper, the ''Ossowscy'' mentioned the German philosopher [[:de:Werner Schingnitz|Werner Schingnitz]] (1899–1953) who, in fragmentary 1931 remarks, had enumerated some possible types of research in the science of science and had proposed his own name for the new discipline:  ''"scientiology"''.  The ''Ossowscy'' took issue with the name:  "Those who wish to replace the expression 'science of science' by a one-word term [that] sound[s] international, in the belief that only after receiving such a name [will] a given group of [questions be] officially dubbed an autonomous discipline, [might] be reminded of the name ''mathesiology'', proposed long ago for similar purposes [by the French mathematician and physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836)]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 87–88, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, before long, in Poland, the unwieldy three-word term ''"nauka o nauce"'' ("science of science") was replaced by the more versatile one-word term ''"naukoznawstwo"'' ("logology") and its natural variants:  ''"naukoznawca"'' ("logologist"), ''"naukoznawczy"'' ("logological"), and ''"naukoznawczo"'' ("logologically").  And just after [[World War II]], only 11 years after the ''Ossowscy'''s landmark 1935 paper, the year 1946 saw the founding of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]' quarterly ''Zagadnienia Naukoznawstwa'' (Logology) — long before similar journals in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], "Editor's Note", ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Other thinkers associated with the Polish school of logology who "have [also] gained international recognition" include [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Ludwik Fleck]], and [[:pl:Stefan Amsterdamski|Stefan Amsterdamski]].&lt;ref&gt;Elena Aronova, Simone Turchetti (eds.), ''Science Studies during the Cold War and Beyond: Paradigms Defected'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The new discipline also took root elsewhere — in English-speaking countries, without the benefit of a one-word name.

==Science==
{{Main article|Science}}

===The term===
The term "[[science]]" (from the [[Latin]] "''scientia''", "[[knowledge]]") means somewhat different things in different languages.  In the [[English language]], "science", when unqualified, generally refers to the "[[natural sciences|natural]]", "[[exact sciences|exact]]", or "[[hard sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis'':  Reason, empiricism and skepticism are not virtues of science alone", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding terms in other languages, for example [[:fr:science|French]], [[:Wissenschaft|German]], and  [[:pl:nauka|Polish]], refer to a broader domain that includes not only the exact sciences ([[logic]] and [[mathematics]]) and the natural sciences ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[Earth sciences]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], etc.) but also the [[engineering|engineering sciences]], [[social sciences]] ([[history]], [[geography]], [[psychology]], [[physical anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[international relations]], [[pedagogy]], etc.), and [[humanities]] ([[philosophy]], [[history]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[linguistics]], etc.).&lt;ref name="Scientia Humanitatis' 2015 p. 80"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis''", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Amsterdam]] humanities professor Rens Bod points out that science—defined as a set of [[Scientific method|methods]] that describes and interprets [[observation|observed]] or [[inference|inferred]] [[phenomena]], past or present, aimed at testing [[hypotheses]] and building [[theories]]—applies to such humanities fields as [[philology]], [[art history]], [[musicology]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], [[historiography]], and [[literary studies]].&lt;ref name="Scientia Humanitatis' 2015 p. 80"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis''", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bod gives a historic example of scientific [[Content analysis|textual analysis]].  in 1440 the Italian philologist [[Lorenzo Valla]] exposed the [[Latin]] document ''[[Donatio Constantini]]'' (The Donation of Constantine)—which was used by the [[Catholic Church]] to legitimize its claim to lands in the [[Western Roman Empire]]—as a [[forgery]].  Valla used historical, linguistic, and philological evidence, including [[counterfactual history|counterfactual reasoning]], to rebut the document.  Valla found words and constructions in the document that could not have been used by anyone in the time of [[Emperor Constantine I]], at the beginning of the fourth century A.D.  For example, the [[late Latin]] word ''[[feudum]]'' ("fief") referred to the [[feudal system]], a [[medieval]] invention that did not exist before the seventh century A.D.  Valla's methods were those of science, and inspired the later scientifically-minded work of Dutch humanist [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] (1466–1536), [[Leiden University]] professor [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (1540–1609), and philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–77).&lt;ref name="Scientia Humanitatis' 2015 p. 80"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis''", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowability===
{{Main article|Knowledge}}

Science's search for the [[truth]] about various aspects of [[reality]] entails the question of the very ''knowability'' of reality.  Philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] writes:  "[In t]he pursuit of [[scientific knowledge]] through the interaction between [[theory]] and [[observation]]... we test theories against their observational consequences, but we also question or reinterpret our observations in light of theory.  (The choice between [[geocentric theory|geocentric]] and [[heliocentric theory|heliocentric theories]] at the time of the [[Copernican revolution]] is a vivid example.) ... 
How things seem is the starting point for all knowledge, and its development through further correction, extension, and elaboration is inevitably the result of more seemings—considered [[judgment]]s about the plausibility and consequences of different theoretical [[hypothesis|hypotheses]].  The only way to pursue the truth is to consider what seems true, after careful reflection of a kind appropriate to the subject matter, in light of all the relevant data, principles, and circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nagel]], "Listening to Reason" (a review of [[T.M. Scanlon]], ''Being Realistic about Reasons'', Oxford University Press, 132 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 15 (October 9, 2014), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of knowability is approached from a different perspective by physicist-astronomer [[Marcelo Gleiser]]:  "What we observe is not [[nature]] itself but nature as discerned through [[data]] we collect from [[machine]]s.  In consequence, the scientific [[worldview]] depends on the [[information]] we can acquire through our [[Scientific instrument|instrument]]s.  And given that our tools are limited, our view of the [[universe|world]] is necessarily [[myopia|myopic]].  We can see only so far into the nature of things, and our ever shifting scientific worldview reflects this fundamental limitation on how we perceive [[reality]]."  Gleiser cites the condition of [[biology]] before and after the invention of the [[microscope]] or [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]]; of [[astronomy]] before and after the [[telescope]]; of [[particle physics]] before and after [[collider]]s or fast electronics.  "[T]he theories we build and the worldviews we construct change as our tools of exploration transform.  This trend is the trademark of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?  The reach of the [[scientific method]] is constrained by the limitations of our tools and the intrinsic impenetrability of some of nature's deepest questions", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writes Gleiser:  "There is nothing defeatist in understanding the limitations of the scientific approach to knowledge....  What should change is a sense of scientific triumphalism – the belief that no question is beyond the reach of scientific discourse.

"There are clear unknowables in science – reasonable questions that, unless currently accepted laws of nature are violated, we cannot find answers to.  One example is the [[multiverse]]:  the conjecture that our [[universe]] is but one among a multitude of others, each potentially with a different set of [[Laws of science|laws of nature]].  Other universes lie outside our causal horizon, meaning that we cannot receive or send signals to them.  Any evidence for their existence would be circumstantial:  for example, scars in the radiation permeating space because of a past collision with a neighboring universe."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleiser gives three further examples of unknowables, involving the origins of the [[universe]]; of [[life]]; and of [[mind]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Theoretical physicist]] [[Brian Greene]], asked by [[Walter Isaacson]] on [[PBS]]' ''[[Amanpour &amp; Company]]'' on 24 October 2018 what questions he would like to see answered, listed the same three questions, in the same order, that Gleiser describes as unknowable.}}

"Scientific accounts of the origin of the [[universe]] are incomplete because they must rely on a conceptual framework to even begin to work:  [[energy conservation]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[quantum physics]], for instance.  Why does the universe operate under these laws and not others?

"Similarly, unless we can prove that only one or very few [[ biochemical pathway]]s exist from nonlife to [[life]], we cannot know for sure how life originated on Earth.

"For [[consciousness]], the problem is the jump from the [[material]] to the [[Qualia|subjective]] – for example, from firing [[neuron]]s to the [[experience]] of [[pain]] or the [[color]] red.  Perhaps some kind of rudimentary consciousness could emerge in a sufficiently complex machine.  But how could we tell?  How do we establish – as opposed to conjecture – that something is conscious?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paradoxically, writes Gleiser, it is through our consciousness that we make sense of the world, even if imperfectly.  "Can we fully understand something of which we are a part?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Herbert Spencer]] argued that the ultimate "[[reality]] existing behind all [[phenomenon|appearances]] is, and must ever be, unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Spencer]], ''First Principles'' (1862), part I:  "The Unknowable", chapter IV:  "The Relativity of All Knowledge".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Facts and theories===
{{Main article|Theory}}

Theoretical physicist and mathematician [[Freeman Dyson]] explains that "[s]cience consists of [[fact]]s and [[theory|theories]]":

"Facts are supposed to be true or false.  They are discovered by observers or experimenters.  A scientist who claims to have discovered a fact that turns out to be wrong is judged harshly....  

"Theories have an entirely different status.  They are free creations of the human mind, intended to describe our understanding of nature.  Since our understanding is incomplete, theories are provisional.  Theories are tools of understanding, and a tool does not need to be precisely true in order to be useful.  Theories are supposed to be more-or-less true...  A scientist who invents a theory that turns out to be wrong is judged leniently."&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders" (review of [[Mario Livio]], ''Brilliant Blunders:  From Darwin to Einstein—Colossal Mistakes by Great Scientists that Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe'', Simon and Schuster), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson cites a psychologist's description of how theories are born:  "We can't live in a state of perpetual doubt, so we make up the best story possible and we live as if the story were true."  Dyson writes:  "The inventor of a brilliant idea cannot tell whether it is right or wrong."  The passionate pursuit of wrong theories is a normal part of the development of science.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyson cites, after [[Mario Livio]], five famous scientists who made major contributions to the understanding of nature but also believed firmly in a theory that proved wrong.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] explained the [[evolution of life]] with his [[theory of natural selection]] of inherited variations, but he believed in a theory of blending inheritance that made the propagation of new variations impossible.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;  He never read [[Gregor Mendel]]'s studies that showed that the [[laws of inheritance]] would become simple when inheritance was considered as a [[randomness|random]] process.  Though Darwin in 1866 did the same experiment that Mendel had, Darwin did not get comparable results because he failed to appreciate the [[statistics|statistical]] importance of using very large experimental [[sample (statistics)|sample]]s.  Eventually, [[Mendelian inheritance]] by random variation would, no thanks to Darwin, provide the raw material for Darwinian selection to work on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), pp. 6, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] discovered basic laws of [[energy]] and [[heat]], then used these laws to calculate an estimate of the [[age of the earth]] that was too short by a factor of fifty.  He based his calculation on the belief that the [[earth's mantle]] was solid and could transfer heat from the interior to the surface only by [[Thermal conduction|conduction]].  It is now known that the mantle is partly fluid and transfers most of the heat by the far more efficient process of [[convection]], which carries heat by a massive circulation of hot rock moving upward and cooler rock moving downward.  Kelvin could see the eruptions of [[volcano]]es bringing hot liquid from deep underground to the surface; but his skill in calculation blinded him to processes, such as [[volcanic eruptions]], that could not be calculated.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

[[Linus Pauling]] discovered the chemical structure of [[protein]] and proposed a completely wrong structure for [[DNA]], which carries hereditary information from parent to offspring.  Pauling guessed a wrong structure for DNA because he assumed that a pattern that worked for protein would also work for DNA.  He overlooked the gross chemical differences between protein and DNA.  [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Watson]] paid attention to the differences and found the correct structure for DNA that Pauling had missed a year earlier.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

Astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] discovered the process by which the heavier [[chemical element|element]]s essential to [[life]] are created by [[nuclear reaction]]s in the cores of massive [[star]]s.  He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as [[steady-state cosmology]], which has the [[universe]] existing forever without an initial [[Big Bang]] (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it).  He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] discovered the theory of space, time, and gravitation known as [[general relativity]], and then added a [[cosmological constant]],  later known as [[dark energy]].  Subsequently Einstein withdrew his proposal of dark energy, believing it unnecessary.  Long after his death, observations suggested that dark energy really exists, so that Einstein's addition to the theory may have been right; and his withdrawal, wrong.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

To Mario Livio's five examples of scientists who blundered, Dyson adds a sixth:  himself.  Dyson had concluded, on theoretical principles, that what was to become known as the [[W-particle]], a charged [[weak boson]], could not exist.  An experiment conducted at [[CERN]], in [[Geneva]], later proved him wrong.  "With hindsight I could see several reasons why my stability argument would not apply to W-particles.  [They] are too massive and too short-lived to be a constituent of anything that resembles ordinary matter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empiricism===
{{Main article|Empiricism}}
[[Steven Weinberg]], 1979 [[Nobel Prize in physics|Nobel laureate in physics]], and a [[history of science|historian of science]], writes that the core goal of science has always been the same:  "to explain the world"; and in reviewing earlier periods of scientific thought, he concludes that only since [[Isaac Newton]] has that goal been pursued more or less correctly.  He decries the "intellectual snobbery" that [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] showed in their disdain for science's practical applications, and he holds [[Francis Bacon]] and [[René Descartes]] to have been the "most overrated" among the forerunners of modern science (they tried to prescribe rules for conducting science, which "never works").&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, [2015], 416 pp., $28.99, {{ISBN|978-0062346650}}), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg draws parallels between past and present science, as when a scientific theory is "fine-tuned" (adjusted) to make certain quantities equal, without any understanding of why they ''should'' be equal.  Such adjusting vitiated the celestial models of Plato's followers, in which different spheres carrying the [[planet]]s and [[star]]s were assumed, with no good reason, to rotate in exact unison.  But, Weinberg writes, a similar fine-tuning also besets current efforts to understand the "[[dark energy]]" that is [[Accelerating universe|speeding up the expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 53"&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, 2015), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient science has been described as having gotten off to a good start, then faltered.  The doctrine of [[atomism]], propounded by the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], was naturalistic, accounting for the workings of the world by impersonal processes, not by divine volitions.  Nevertheless these pre-Socratics come up short for Weinberg as proto-scientists, in that they apparently never tried to justify their speculations or to test them against evidence.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 53"/&gt;

Weinberg believes that science faltered early on due to Plato's suggestion that scientific truth could be attained by reason alone, disregarding [[empirical observation]], and due to Aristotle's attempt to explain nature [[teleology|teleologically]]—in terms of ends and purposes.  Plato's ideal of attaining knowledge of the world by unaided intellect was "a false goal inspired by mathematics"—one that for centuries "stood in the way of progress that could be based only on careful analysis of careful observation."  And it "never was fruitful" to ask, as Aristotle did, "what is the purpose of this or that physical phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 53"/&gt;

A scientific field in which the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic]] world did make progress was astronomy.  This was partly for practical reasons:  the sky had long served as compass, clock, and calendar.  Also, the regularity of the movements of heavenly bodies made them simpler to describe than earthly phenomena.  But not ''too'' simple:  though the sun, moon and "fixed stars" seemed regular in their celestial circuits, the "wandering stars"—the planets—were puzzling; they seemed to move at variable speeds, and even to reverse direction.  Writes Weinberg:  "Much of the story of the emergence of modern science deals with the effort, extending over two millennia, to explain the peculiar motions of the planets."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, 2015), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge was to make sense of the apparently irregular wanderings of the planets on the assumption that all heavenly motion is actually circular and uniform in speed.  Circular, because Plato held the [[circle]] to be the most perfect and symmetrical form; and therefore circular motion, at uniform speed, was most fitting for celestial bodies.  Aristotle agreed with Plato.  In Aristotle's [[cosmos]], everything had a "natural" tendency to motion that fulfilled its inner potential.  For the cosmos' sublunary part (the region below the moon), the natural tendency was to move in a straight line:  downward, for earthen things (such as rocks) and water; upward, for air and fiery things (such as sparks).  But in the [[Astronomical object|celestial]] realm things were not composed of earth, water, air, or fire, but of a "fifth element", or "[[Aether (classical element)|quintessence]]," which was perfect and eternal.  And its natural motion was uniformly circular.  The stars, the sun, the moon, and the planets were carried in their orbits by a complicated arrangement of crystalline spheres, all centered around an immobile earth.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, 2015), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Platonic-Aristotelian conviction that celestial motions must be circular persisted stubbornly.  It was fundamental to the astronomer [[Ptolemy]]'s system, which improved on Aristotle's in conforming to the astronomical data by allowing the planets to move in combinations of circles called "[[epicycle]]s".&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

It even survived the [[Copernican revolution]].  Copernicus was conservative in his Platonic reverence for the circle as the heavenly pattern.  According to Weinberg, Copernicus was motivated to dethrone the earth in favor of the sun as the immobile center of the cosmos largely by aesthetic considerations:  he objected to the fact that Ptolemy, though faithful to Plato's requirement that heavenly motion be circular, had departed from Plato's other requirement that it be of uniform speed.  By putting the sun at the center—actually, somewhat off-center—Copernicus sought to honor circularity while restoring uniformity.  But to make his system fit the observations as well as Ptolemy's system, Copernicus had to introduce still more epicycles.  That was a mistake that, writes Weinberg, illustrates a recurrent theme in the history of science:  "A simple and beautiful theory that agrees pretty well with observation is often closer to the truth than a complicated ugly theory that agrees better with observation."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

The planets, however, do not move in perfect circles but in [[ellipse]]s.  It was [[Johannes Kepler]], about a century after Copernicus, who reluctantly (for he too had Platonic affinities) realized this.  Thanks to his examination of the meticulous observations compiled by astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], Kepler "was the first to understand the nature of the departures from uniform circular motion that had puzzled astronomers since the time of Plato."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

The replacement of circles by supposedly ugly ellipses overthrew Plato's notion of [[Perfection#Aesthetics|perfection]] as the celestial explanatory principle.  It also destroyed Aristotle's model of the planets carried in their orbits by crystalline spheres; writes Weinberg, "there is no solid body whose rotation can produce an ellipse."  Even if a planet were attached to an ellipsoid crystal, that crystal's rotation would still trace a circle.  And if the planets were pursuing their elliptical motion through empty space, then what was holding them in their orbits?&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

Science had reached the threshold of explaining the world not [[geometry|geometrically]], according to shape, but dynamically, according to [[force]].  It was [[Isaac Newton]] who finally crossed that threshold.  He was the first to formulate, in his "[[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]", the concept of force.  He demonstrated that Kepler's ellipses were the very orbits the planets would take if they were attracted toward the sun by a force that decreased as the square of the planet's distance from the sun.  And by comparing the moon's motion in its orbit around the earth to the motion of, perhaps, an apple as it falls to the ground, Newton deduced that the forces governing them were quantitatively the same.  "This," writes Weinberg, "was the climactic step in the unification of the celestial and terrestrial in science."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

By formulating a unified explanation of the behavior of planets, comets, moons, tides, and apples, writes Weinberg, Newton "provided an irresistible model for what a [[physical theory]] should be"—a model that fit no preexisting [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] criterion.  In contrast to Aristotle, who claimed to explain the falling of a rock by appeal to its inner striving, Newton was unconcerned with finding a deeper cause for [[gravity]].  He declared in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'':  "I do not 'feign' hypotheses."  What mattered were his mathematically stated principles describing this force, and their ability to account for a vast range of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

About two centuries later, in 1915, a deeper explanation for Newton's law of gravitation was found in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]]:  gravity could be explained as a manifestation of the curvature in [[spacetime]] resulting from the presence of [[matter]] and [[energy]].  Successful theories like Newton's, writes Weinberg, may work for reasons that their creators do not understand—reasons that deeper theories will later reveal.  Scientific progress is not a matter of building theories on a foundation of [[reason]], but of unifying a greater range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] under simpler and more general principles.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

===Artificial intelligence===
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence}}
Since 1950, when [[Alan Turing]] proposed what has come to be called the “[[Turing test]],” there has been speculation whether machines such as computers can possess intelligence; and, if so, [[Technological singularity|whether intelligent machines could become a threat to human intellectual and scientific ascendancy]]—or even an existential threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”,  ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Searle]] points out common confusion about the correct interpretation of computation and information technology.  "For example, one routinely reads that in exactly the same sense in which [[Garry Kasparov]]… beat [[Anatoly Karpov]] in [[chess]], the computer called [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] played and beat Kasparov.... [T]his claim is [obviously] suspect.  In order for Kasparov to play and win, he has to be conscious that he is playing chess, and conscious of a thousand other things...  Deep Blue is conscious of none of these things because it is not conscious of anything at all.  Why is [[consciousness]] so important?  You cannot literally play chess or do much of anything else cognitive if you are totally disassociated from consciousness."&lt;ref name="autogenerated52"&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle explains that, "in the literal, real, observer-independent sense in which humans compute, mechanical computers do not compute.  They go through a set of transitions in electronic states that we can interpret computationally.  The transitions in those electronic states are absolute or observer-independent, but ''the computation is observer-relative''.  The transitions in physical states are just electrical sequences unless some conscious agent can give them a computational interpretation.... There is no psychological reality at all to what is happening in the [computer]."&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[A] digital computer", writes Searle, "is a syntactical machine.  It manipulates symbols and does nothing else.  For this reason, the project of creating human intelligence by designing a computer program that will pass the [[Turing Test]]... is doomed from the start.  The appropriately programmed computer has a [[syntax]] [rules for constructing or transforming the symbols and words of a language] but no [[semantics]] [comprehension of meaning].... Minds, on the other hand, have mental or semantic content."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychology and neural science [[Gary Marcus]] points out a so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence:  an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending [[language]] that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer science|Computer scientist]] [[Pedro Domingos]] writes:  "AIs are like [[autistic savant]]s and will remain so for the foreseeable future.... AIs lack [[common sense]] and can easily make errors that a human never would...  They are also liable to take our instructions too literally, giving us precisely what we asked for instead of what we actually wanted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pedro Domingos]], "Our Digital Doubles:  AI will serve our species, not control it", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 3 (September 2018), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

===Discoveries and inventions===
{{Main article|Discovery (observation)|Invention}}

Fifty years before [[Florian Znaniecki]] published his 1923 paper proposing the creation of an empirical field of study to study the field of [[science]], Aleksander Głowacki (better known by his pen name, [[Bolesław Prus]]) had made the same proposal.  In an 1873 public lecture "On Discoveries and Inventions",&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions:  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus]'', Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30407/30407-h/30407-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Prus said:
{{blockquote|Until now there has been no science that describes the means for making discoveries and inventions, and the generality of people, as well as many men of learning, believe that there never will be.  This is an error.  Someday a science of making discoveries and inventions will exist and will render services.  It will arise not all at once; first only its general outline will appear, which subsequent researchers will emend and elaborate, and which still later researchers will apply to individual branches of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions:  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus]'', Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prus defines ''"[[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]"'' as "the finding out of a thing that has existed and exists in nature, but which was previously unknown to people";&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''"[[invention]]"'' as "the making of a thing that has not previously existed, and which nature itself cannot make."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

He illustrates the concept of "discovery":

{{blockquote|Until 400 years ago, people thought that the Earth comprised just three parts:  Europe, Asia, and Africa; it was only in 1492 that the Genoese, [[Christopher Columbus]], sailed out from Europe into the Atlantic Ocean and, proceeding ever westward, after [10 weeks] reached a part of the world that Europeans had never known.  In that new land he found copper-colored people who went about naked, and he found plants and animals different from those in Europe; in short, he had discovered a new part of the world that others would later name "America."  We say that Columbus had ''discovered'' America, because America had already long existed on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prus illustrates the concept of "invention":

{{blockquote|[As late as] 50 years ago, [[locomotive]]s were unknown, and no one knew how to build one; it was only in 1828 that the English engineer [George] Stephenson built the first locomotive and set it in motion.  So we say that Stephenson ''invented'' the locomotive, because this machine had not previously existed and could not by itself have come into being in nature; it could only have been made by man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;}}

According to Prus, "inventions and discoveries are natural phenomena and, as such, are subject to certain laws."  Those are the laws of "gradualness", "dependence", and "combination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|1.  ''The law of gradualness.''  No discovery or invention arises at once perfected, but it is perfected gradually; likewise, no invention or discovery is the work of a single individual but of many individuals, each adding his little contribution.  [...]  Potatoes were first discovered; later they were found to make good cattle feed; then it was learned that potatoes could nourish people; and, later, potatoes began to be used for making vodka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to inventions, gradualness may be illustrated by the evolution of the stool.  First people found that it was better to sit on a stump or a rock than on the ground.  Then, noticing that a rock or a stump was too heavy to lug around, they built a stool consisting of a board and several legs.  Next, to the stool they added a backrest, thus making a chair; to the chair, they added arm rests, making an armchair.  Then they began painting and padding the armchairs and chairs, and so on.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  ''The law of dependence.''  An invention or discovery is conditional on the prior existence of certain known discoveries and inventions.  [...]   If potatoes grew only in America, they could not have been discovered before America had been; if the [[black swan]] lives only in Australia, the black swan could not have been seen before Australia had been.  If the rings of [[Saturn]] can be seen through telescopes, then the telescope had to have been invented before the rings could have been seen. [...]&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt;

3.  ''The law of combination.''  Any new discovery or invention is a combination of earlier discoveries and inventions, or rests on them.  When I study a new mineral, I inspect it, I smell it, I taste it, that is, I combine the mineral with my senses.  Then I weigh it and heat it, which is to say, I combine the mineral with a balance and with fire.  Then I place it into water, into sulfuric acid, and so forth, in short, I combine the mineral with everything that I have at hand and in this way I learn ever more of its properties.  And as for inventions, who does not know that a clock is a combination of wheels, springs, dials, bells, etc.?  Who does not know that gunpowder is a combination of sulfur, saltpeter and charcoal?&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each of Prus' three "laws" entails important corollaries.  The law of gradualness implies the following:&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|a)  Since every discovery and invention requires perfecting, let us not pride ourselves only on discovering or inventing something ''completely new'', but let us also work to improve or get to know more exactly things that are already known and already exist. […]&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

b)  The same law of gradualness demonstrates the necessity of ''expert training''.  Who can perfect a watch, if not a watchmaker with a good comprehensive knowledge of his métier?  Who can discover new characteristics of an animal, if not a naturalist?&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;}}

From the law of dependence flow the following corollaries:&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

{{blockquote|a)  No invention or discovery, even one seemingly without value, should be dismissed, because that particular trifle may later prove very useful.  There would seem to be no simpler invention than the needle, yet the clothing of millions of people, and the livelihoods of millions of seamstresses, depend on the needle’s existence.  Even today’s beautiful sewing machine would not exist, had the needle not long ago been invented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

b)  The law of dependence teaches us that what cannot be done today, might be done later.  People give much thought to the construction of a flying machine that could carry many persons and parcels.  The inventing of such a machine will depend, among other things, on inventing a material that is, say, as light as paper and as sturdy and fire-resistant as steel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, Prus' corollaries to his law of combination:&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

{{blockquote|a)  Anyone who wants to be a successful inventor, needs to know a great many things—in the most diverse fields.  For if a new invention is a combination of earlier inventions, then the inventor’s mind is the ground on which, for the first time, various seemingly unrelated things combine.  Example:  The steam engine combines Rumford’s double boiler, the pump, and the spinning wheel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;
   
[…] What is the connection among zinc, copper, sulfuric acid, a magnet, a clock mechanism, and an urgent message?  All these had to come together in the mind of the inventor of the telegraph… […]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greater the number of inventions that come into being, the more things a new inventor must know; the first, earliest and simplest inventions were made by completely uneducated people—but today’s inventions, particularly scientific ones, are products of the most highly educated minds. […]&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

b)  A second corollary concerns societies that wish to have inventors.  I said that a new invention is created by combining the most diverse objects; let us see where this takes us.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;

Suppose I want to make an invention, and someone tells me:  Take 100 different objects and bring them into contact with one another, first two at a time, then three at a time, finally four at a time, and you will arrive at a new invention.  Imagine that I take a burning candle, charcoal, water, paper, zinc, sugar, sulfuric acid, and so on, 100 objects in all, and combine them with one another, that is, bring into contact first two at a time:  charcoal with flame, water with flame, sugar with flame, zinc with flame, sugar with water, etc.  Each time, I shall see a phenomenon:  thus, in fire, sugar will melt, charcoal will burn, zinc will heat up, and so on.  Now I will bring into contact three objects at a time, for example, sugar, zinc and flame; charcoal, sugar and flame; sulfuric acid, zinc and water; etc., and again I shall experience phenomena.  Finally I bring into contact four objects at a time, for example, sugar, zinc, charcoal, and sulfuric acid.  Ostensibly this is a very simple method, because in this fashion I could make not merely one but a dozen inventions.  But will such an effort not exceed my capability?  It certainly will.  A hundred objects, combined in twos, threes and fours, will make over ''4 million'' combinations; so if I made 100 combinations a day, it would take me over 110 years to exhaust them all!&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

But if by myself I am not up to the task, a sizable group of people will be.  If 1,000 of us came together to produce the combinations that I have described, then any one person would only have to carry out slightly more than 4,000 combinations.  If each of us performed just 10 combinations a day, together we would finish them all in less than a year and a half:  1,000 people would make an invention which a single man would have to spend more than 110 years to make…&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Ludicrous as this metaphor for the process of invention may sound, it brings to mind some experiments that would soon be done by Prus' contemporary, the inventor [[Thomas Edison]]—nowhere more so than in his exhaustive search for a practicable [[Incandescent light bulb|light-bulb]] filament.  (Edison's work with electric light bulbs also illustrates Prus' law of gradualness:  many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps; Edison's was merely the first commercially practical incandescent light.)}}

The conclusion is quite clear:  a society that wants to win renown with its discoveries and inventions has to have a great many persons working in every branch of knowledge.  One or a few men of learning and genius mean nothing today, or nearly nothing, because everything is now done by large numbers.  I would like to offer the following simile:  Inventions and discoveries are like a lottery; not every player wins, but from among the many players a few ''must'' win.  The point is not that John or Paul, because they want to make an invention and because they work for it, shall make an invention; but where thousands want an invention and work for it, the invention must appear, as surely as an unsupported rock must fall to the ground.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt;}}

But, asks Prus, "What force drives [the] toilsome, often frustrated efforts [of the investigators]?  What thread will clew these people through hitherto unexplored fields of study?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The reference to a thread appears to be an allusion to [[Ariadne's thread#Minos and Theseus|Ariadne's thread]] in the myth of [[Theseus#The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur|Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur#Theseus and the Minotaur|Minotaur]].}}

{{blockquote|[T]he answer is very simple:  man is driven to efforts, including those of making discoveries and inventions, by ''[[need]]s''; and the thread that guides him is ''[[observation]]'':  observation of the works of nature and of man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt;

I have said that the mainspring of all discoveries and inventions is needs.  In fact, is there any work of man that does not satisfy some need?  We build railroads because we need rapid transportation; we build clocks because we need to measure time; we build sewing machines because the speed of [unaided] human hands is insufficient.  We abandon home and family and depart for distant lands because we are drawn by curiosity to see what lies elsewhere.  We forsake the society of people and we spend long hours in exhausting contemplation because we are driven by a hunger for knowledge, by a desire to solve the challenges that are constantly thrown up by the world and by life!&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt;

Needs never cease; on the contrary, they are always growing.  While the pauper thinks about a piece of bread for lunch, the rich man thinks about wine after lunch.  The foot traveler dreams of a rudimentary wagon; the railroad passenger demands a heater.  The infant is cramped in its cradle; the mature man is cramped in the world.  In short, everyone has his needs, and everyone desires to satisfy them, and that desire is an inexhaustible source of new discoveries, new inventions, in short, of all progress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

But needs are ''general'', such as the needs for food, sleep and clothing; and ''special'', such as needs for a new steam engine, a new telescope, a new hammer, a new wrench.  To understand the former needs, it suffices to be a human being; to understand the latter needs, one must be a ''specialist''—an ''expert worker''.  Who knows better than a tailor what it is that tailors need, and who better than a tailor knows how to find the right way to satisfy the need?&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let us consider how observation can lead man to new ideas; and to that end, as an example, let us imagine how, more or less, clay products came to be invented.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

Suppose that somewhere there lived on clayey soil a primitive people who already knew fire.  When rain fell on the ground, the clay turned doughy; and if, shortly after the rain, a fire was set on top of the clay, the clay under the fire became fired and hardened.  If such an event occurred several times, the people might observe and thereafter remember that fired clay becomes hard like stone and does not soften in water.  One of the primitives might also, when walking on wet clay, have impressed deep tracks into it; after the sun had dried the ground and rain had fallen again, the primitives might have observed that water remains in those hollows longer than on the surface.  Inspecting the wet clay, the people might have observed that this material can be easily kneaded in one’s fingers and accepts various forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Some ingenious persons might have started shaping clay into various animal forms […] etc., including something shaped like a tortoise shell, which was in use at the time.  Others, remembering that clay hardens in fire, might have fired the hollowed-out mass, thereby creating the first [clay] bowl.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, it was a relatively easy matter to perfect the new invention; someone else could discover clay more suitable for such manufactures; someone else could invent a glaze, and so on, with nature and observation at every step pointing out to man the way to invention. […]&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"/&gt;

[This example] illustrates how people arrive at various ideas: ''by closely observing all things and wondering about all things''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"/&gt;

Take another example.  [S]ometimes, in a pane of glass, we find disks and bubbles, looking through which we see objects more distinctly than with the naked eye.  Suppose that an alert person, spotting such a bubble in a pane, took out a piece of glass and showed it to others as a toy.  Possibly among them there was a man with weak vision who found that, through the bubble in the pane, he saw better than with the naked eye.  Closer investigation showed that bilaterally convex glass strengthens weak vision, and in this way eyeglasses were invented.  People may first have cut glass for eyeglasses from glass panes, but in time others began grinding smooth pieces of glass into convex lenses and producing proper eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The art of grinding eyeglasses was known almost 600 years ago.  A couple of hundred years later, the children of a certain eyeglass grinder, while playing with lenses, placed one in front of another and found that they could see better through two lenses than through one.  They informed their father about this curious occurrence, and he began producing tubes with two magnifying lenses and selling them as a toy.  Galileo, the great Italian scientist, on learning of this toy, used it for a different purpose and built the first telescope.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

This example, too, shows us that observation leads man by the hand to inventions.  This example again demonstrates the truth of gradualness in the development of inventions, but above all also the fact that education amplifies man’s inventiveness.  A simple lens-grinder formed two magnifying glasses into a toy—while Galileo, one of the most learned men of his time, made a telescope.  As Galileo’s mind was superior to the craftsman’s mind, so the invention of the telescope was superior to the invention of a toy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;  [...]

The three laws [that have been discussed here] are immensely important and do not apply only to discoveries and inventions, but they pervade all of nature.  An oak does not immediately become an oak but begins as an acorn, then becomes a seedling, later a little tree, and finally a mighty oak:  we see here the law of gradualness.  A seed that has been sown will not germinate until it finds sufficient heat, water, soil and air:  here we see the law of dependence.  Finally, no animal or plant, or even stone, is something homogeneous and single but is composed of various organs:  here we see the law of combination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prus holds that, over time, the multiplication of discoveries and inventions has improved the quality of people's lives and has expanded their knowledge.  "This gradual advance of civilized societies, this constant growth in knowledge of the objects that exist in nature, this constant increase in the number of tools and useful materials, is termed ''progress'', or the ''growth of civilization.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, Prus warns, "societies and people that do not make inventions or know how to use them, lead miserable lives and ultimately perish."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproducibility===
{{Main article|Reproducibility}}
A fundamental feature of the scientific enterprise is [[reproducibility]] of results.  "For decades", writes Shannon Palus, "it has been... an [[open secret]] that a [considerable part] of the literature in some fields is plain wrong."  This effectively sabotages the scientific enterprise and costs the world many billions of dollars annually in wasted resources.  Militating against reproducibility is scientists' reluctance to share techniques, for fear of forfeiting one's advantage to other scientists.  Also, [[scientific journal]]s and [[tenure]] committees tend to prize impressive new results rather than gradual advances that systematically build on existing literature.  Scientists who quietly fact-check others' work or spend extra time ensuring that their own [[Protocol (science)|protocol]]s are easy for other researchers to understand, gain little for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Palus]], "Make Research Reproducible:  Better incentives could reduce the alarming number of studies that turn out to be wrong when repeated" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a view to improving reproducibility of scientific results, it has been suggested that research-funding agencies finance only projects that include a plan for making their work [[open research|transparent]].  In 2016 the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] introduced new application instructions and review questions to encourage scientists to improve reproducibility.  The NIH requests more information on how the study builds on previous work, and a list of variables that could affect the study, such as the sex of animal subjects—a previously overlooked factor that led many studies to describe phenomena found in male animals as universal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Palus]], "Make Research Reproducible", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the questions that a funder can ask in advance could be asked by journals and reviewers.  One solution is "registered reports", a preregistration of studies whereby a scientist submits, for publication, research analysis and design plans before actually doing the study.  [[Peer review|Peer reviewers]] then evaluate the [[methodology]], and the journal promises to print the results, no matter what they are.  In order to prevent over-reliance on preregistered studies—which could encourage safer, less venturesome research, thus over-correcting the problem—the preregistered-studies model could be operated in tandem with the traditional results-focused model, which may sometimes be more friendly to [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Palus]], "Make Research Reproducible", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery===
A 2016 ''[[Scientific American]]'' report highlights the role of ''rediscovery'' in science.  [[Indiana University Bloomington]] researchers combed through 22 million scientific papers published over the previous century and found dozens of "Sleeping Beauties"—studies that lay dormant for years before getting noticed.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"&gt;Amber Williams, "Sleeping Beauties of Science:  Some of the best research can slumber for years", ''[[Scientific American]], vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The top finds, which languished longest and later received the most intense attention from scientists, came from the fields of chemistry, physics, and statistics.  The dormant findings were wakened by scientists from other disciplines, such as [[medicine]], in search of fresh insights, and by the ability to test once-theoretical postulations.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;  Sleeping Beauties will likely become even more common in the future because of increasing accessibility of scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;  The ''[[Scientific American]]'' report lists the top 15 Sleeping Beauties:  7 in [[chemistry]], 5 in [[physics]], 2 in [[statistics]], and 1 in [[metallurgy]].&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;  Examples include:

[[Herbert Freundlich]]'s "Concerning Adsorption in Solutions" (1906), the first mathematical model of [[adsorption]], when [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s adhere to a surface.  Today both [[environmental remediation]] and [[decontamination]] in [[industry|industrial settings]] rely heavily on adsorption.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

This famous [[thought experiment]] in [[quantum physics]]—now known as the [[EPR paradox]], after the authors' surname initials—was discussed ''theoretically'' when it first came out.  It was not until the 1970s that [[physics]] had the experimental means to test [[quantum entanglement]].&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

Soc.'', 1951, 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–75, explains how to suspend [[gold nanoparticle]]s in liquid.  It owes its awakening to [[medicine]], which now employs gold nanoparticles to detect [[tumor]]s and deliver drugs.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

William S. Hummers and Richard E Offeman, "Preparation of Graphitic Oxide", ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'', vol. 80, no. 6 (March 20, 1958), p.&amp;nbsp;1339, introduced [[Hummers' Method]], a technique for making [[graphite oxide]].  Recent interest in [[graphene]]'s potential has brought the 1958 paper to attention.  Graphite oxide could serve as a reliable intermediate for the 2-D material.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

===Multiple discovery===
{{Main article|Multiple discovery|List of multiple discoveries}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Robert K Merton.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Robert K. Merton]]]] --&gt;
Historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence, in [[science]], of "[[multiple discovery|multiple independent discovery]]".  Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] defined such "multiples" as instances in which similar [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] are made by scientists working independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science |journal=[[European Journal of Sociology]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=237–282 |year=1963 |doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801 }} Reprinted in [[Robert K.

Rupert |last=Hall |title=Philosophers at War: The Quarrel between Newton and Leibniz |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-521-22732-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th-century independent discovery of [[oxygen]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], and others; and the 19th-century independent formulation of the [[theory of evolution]] of [[species]] by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Tori Reeve, ''[[Down House]]: the Home of [[Charles Darwin]]'', pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Merton contrasted a "multiple" with a "singleton" — a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], ''On Social Structure and Science'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the ''common'' pattern in science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], "Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science," ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'', 105: 470–86, 1961. Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton]], ''The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1973, pp. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple discoveries in the history of science provide evidence for [[evolution]]ary models of science and technology, such as [[memetics]] (the study of self-replicating units of culture), [[evolutionary epistemology]] (which applies the concepts of [[biological evolution]] to study of the growth of human knowledge), and [[cultural selection theory]] (which studies sociological and cultural evolution in a Darwinian manner).  A [[recombinant DNA|recombinant-DNA]]-inspired "[[paradigm]] of paradigms", describing a mechanism of "recombinant conceptualization", predicates that a new [[concept]] arises through the crossing of pre-existing concepts and [[fact]]s.  This is what is meant when one says that a scientist, scholar, or artist has been "influenced by" another — [[etymology|etymologically]], that a concept of the latter's has "flowed into" the mind of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'': the [[Invention|Creation]] of a [[Historical Novel]]," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXIX, no. 1 (1994), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of multiple independent discoveries and inventions can be viewed as a consequence of [[Bolesław Prus]]' three laws of gradualness, dependence, and combination (see "[[Logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|Discoveries and inventions]]", above).  The first two laws may, in turn, be seen as corollaries to the third law, since the laws of gradualness and dependence imply the impossibility of certain scientific or technological advances pending the availability of certain theories, facts, or technologies that must be combined to produce a given scientific or technological advance.

===Nonconformance===
{{Main article|Creativity}}
A practical question concerns the traits that enable some individuals to achieve extraordinary results in their fields of work – and how such [[creativity]] can be fostered.  [[Melissa Schilling]], a student of [[innovation]] strategy, has identified some traits shared by eight major innovators in [[natural science]] or [[technology]]:  [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–90), [[Thomas Edison]] (1847–1931), [[Nikola Tesla]] (1856–1943), [[Maria Skłodowska Curie]] (1867–1934), [[Dean Kamen]] (born 1951), [[Steve Jobs]] (1955–2011), [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955), and [[Elon Musk]] (born 1971).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling chose innovators in natural science and technology rather than in other fields because she found much more consensus about important contributions to natural science and technology than, for example, to art or music.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  She further limited the set to individuals associated with ''multiple'' innovations.  "When an individual is associated with only a single major invention, it is much harder to know whether the invention was caused by the inventor's personal characteristics or by simply being at the right place at the right time."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight individuals were all extremely intelligent, but "that is not enough to make someone a serial breakthrough innovator."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly all these innovators showed very high levels of [[Emotional detachment|social detachment]], or separateness (a notable exception being Benjamin Franklin).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Their isolation meant that they were less exposed to dominant ideas and norms, and their sense of not belonging meant that even when exposed to dominant ideas and norms, they were often less inclined to adopt them."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  From an early age, they had all shown extreme faith in their ability to overcome obstacles – what [[psychology]] calls "[[self-efficacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Most [of them, writes Schilling] were driven by [[Ideal (ethics)|idealism]], a superordinate goal that was more important than their own comfort, reputation, or families.  Nikola Tesla wanted to free mankind from labor through unlimited free [[energy]] and to achieve international [[peace]] through global [[communication]].  Elon Musk wants to solve the world's energy problems and colonize [[Mars]].  Benjamin Franklin was seeking greater social harmony and productivity through the ideals of [[egalitarianism]], [[toleration|tolerance]], industriousness, temperance, and charity.  Marie Curie had been inspired by [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]'s argument that [[Poland]], which was under Tsarist Russian rule, could be preserved only through the pursuit of education and technological advance by all Poles – ''including women''."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the innovators also worked hard and tirelessly because they found work extremely rewarding.  Some had an extremely high need for achievement.  Many also appeared to find work [[autotelic]] – rewarding for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  A surprisingly large portion of the breakthrough innovators have been [[autodidact]]s – self-taught persons – and excelled much more outside the classroom than inside.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Almost all breakthrough innovation," writes Schilling, "starts with an unusual idea or with beliefs that break with [[conventional wisdom]]....  However, creative ideas alone are almost never enough.  Many people have creative ideas, even brilliant ones.  But usually we lack the time, knowledge, money, or motivation to act on those ideas."  It is generally hard to get others' help in implementing original ideas because the ideas are often initially hard for others to understand and value.  Thus each of Schilling's breakthrough innovators showed ''extraordinary'' effort and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, writes Schilling, "being at the right place at the right time still matter[ed]."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lichenology====
{{Main article|Lichenology}}
When Swiss botanist [[Simon Schwendener]] discovered in the 1860s that [[lichen]]s were a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] partnership between a [[fungus]] and an [[alga]], his finding at first met with resistance from the scientific community.  After his discovery that the fungus--which cannot make its own food--provides the lichen's structure, while the alga's contribution is its [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of food, it was found that in some lichens a [[cyanobacterium]] provides the food—and a handful of lichen species contain ''both'' an alga and a cyanobacterium, along with the fungus.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gies, "The Meaning of Lichen:  How a self-taught naturalist unearthed hidden symbioses in the wilds of British Columbia—and helped to overturn 150 years of accepted scientific wisdom", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-taught naturalist, [[Trevor Goward]], has helped create a [[paradigm shift]] in the study of lichens and perhaps of all life-forms by doing something that people did in pre-scientific times:  going out into nature and closely observing.  His essays about lichens were largely ignored by most researchers because Goward has no scientific degrees and because some of his radical ideas are not supported by rigorous data.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gies, "The Meaning of Lichen", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Goward told [[Toby Spribille]], who at the time lacked a high-school education, about some of his lichenological ideas, Goward recalls, "He said I was delusional."  Ultimately Spribille passed a high-school equivalency examination, obtained a Ph.D. in lichenology at the [[University of Graz]] in Austria, and became an assistant professor of the ecology and evolution of symbiosis at the [[University of Alberta]].  In July 2016 Spribille and his co-authors published a ground-breaking paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' revealing that many lichens contain a second fungus.  

Spribille credits Goward with having "a huge influence on my thinking.  [His essays] gave me license to think about lichens in [an unorthodox way] and freed me to see the patterns I worked out in ''[[Bryoria]]'' with my co-authors."  Even so, "one of the most difficult things was allowing myself to have an open mind to the idea that 150 years of literature may have entirely missed the theoretical possibility that there would be more than one fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis."  Spribille says that academia's emphasis on the canon of what others have established as important is inherently limiting.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gies, "The Meaning of Lichen", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{Main article|Genius|Leadership}}
Contrary to previous studies indicating that higher [[intelligence]] makes for better [[leadership|leaders]] in various fields of endeavor, later research suggests that, at a certain point, a higher [[IQ]] can be viewed as harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decades ago, psychologist [[Dean Simonton]] suggested that brilliant leaders' words may go over people's heads, their solutions could be more complicated to implement, and followers might find it harder to relate to them.  At last, in the July 2017 ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'', he and two colleagues published the results of actual tests of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonakis|first=John|last2=House|first2=Robert J.|last3=Simonton|first3=Dean Keith|date=2017|title=Can super smart leaders suffer from too much of a good thing?

Studied were 379 men and women business leaders in 30 countries, including the fields of banking, retail, and technology.  The managers took IQ tests--an imperfect but robust predictor of performance in many areas--and each was rated on leadership style and effectiveness by an average of 8 co-workers.  IQ correlated positively with ratings of leadership effectiveness, [[strategy]] formation, [[Foresight (psychology)|vision]], and several other characteristics—up to a point.  The ratings peaked at an IQ of about 120, which is higher than some 80% of office workers.  Beyond that, the ratings declined.  The researchers suggested that the ideal IQ could be higher or lower in various fields, depending on whether technical or [[social skills]] are more valued in a given work culture.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Psychologist Paul Sackett, not involved in the research, comments:  "To me, the right interpretation of the work would be that it highlights a need to understand what high-IQ leaders do that leads to lower perceptions by followers.  The wrong interpretation would be,'Don't hire high-IQ leaders.'"&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study's [[lead author]], psychologist [[John Antonakis]], suggests that leaders should use their intelligence to generate creative [[metaphor]]s that will persuade and inspire others.  "I think the only way a smart person can signal their intelligence appropriately and still connect with the people," says Antonakis, "is to speak in [[charismatic]] ways."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of science==
===Specialization===
{{Main article|Academic specialization}}
[[Academic specialization]] produces great benefits for science and technology by focusing effort on discrete disciplines.  But over-narrow specialization can act as a roadblock to progress in areas that overlap established disciplines.   

In 2017, in [[Manhattan]], [[James Harris Simons]], a noted mathematician and retired founder of one of the world's largest [[hedge fund]]s, inaugurated  the [[Flatiron Institute]], a nonprofit enterprise whose goal is to apply his hedge fund's analytical strategies to projects dedicated to expanding knowledge and helping humanity.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has established computational divisions for research in astrophysics, biology, and quantum physics,&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and an interdisciplinary division for [[climate modelling]] that interfaces geology, oceanography, atmospheric science, biology, and climatology.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter, fourth Flatiron Institute division was inspired by a 2017 presentation to the Institute's leadership by [[John Grotzinger]], a "bio-geoscientist" from the [[California Institute of Technology]], who explained the challenges of climate modelling.  Grotzinger was a specialist in historical climate change—specifically, what had caused the great [[Permian extinction]], during which virtually all species died.  To properly assess this cataclysm, one had to understand both the rock record and the ocean's composition, but [[geology|geologists]] did not interact much with [[physical oceanography|physical oceanographers]].  Grotzinger's own best collaboration had resulted from a fortuitous lunch with an oceanographer.  Climate modelling was an intrinsically difficult problem made worse by [[academia]]'s structural divisions.  "If you had it all under one umbrella... it could result [much sooner] in a major breakthrough."  Simons and his team found Grotzinger's presentation compelling, and the Flatiron Institute decided to establish its fourth and final computational division.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mentoring===
{{Main article|Mentorship}}
Sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]], in her 1977 study of natural-science [[Nobel laureates]] in the United States, was struck by the fact that more than half (48) of the 92 laureates who did their prize-winning research in the U.S. by 1972 had worked either as students, postdoctorates, or junior collaborators under older Nobel laureates.  Furthermore, those 48 future laureates had worked under a total of 71 laureate masters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Zuckerman noted that many Nobel-quality scientists have never received a Nobel prize and never will, due to the limited number of such prizes available.  "These scientists, like the 'immortals' who happened not to have been included among the cohorts of forty in the [[French Academy]], may be said to occupy the 'forty-first chair' in science...  Scientists of the first rank who never won the Nobel prize include such giants as [[Dmitri Mendeleev|[Dmitri] Mendele[y]ev]] [1834–1907], whose [[Periodic Law]] and [[table of elements]] are known to every schoolchild, and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] [1839–1903], America's greatest scientist of the nineteenth century, who provided the foundations of modern [[chemical thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]].  They also include the [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] [[Oswald T. Avery]] [1877–1955], who laid the groundwork for explosive advances in modern [[molecular biology]], as well as all the [[mathematics|mathematicians]], [[astronomy|astronomers]], and [[earth sciences|earth]] and [[marine science|marine scientists]] of the first class who work in fields statutorily excluded from consideration for Nobel prizes."&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite 1977, p. 42"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social viscosity ensures that not every qualified novice scientist attains access to the most productive centers of scientific thought.  Nevertheless, writes Zuckerman, "To some extent, students of promise can choose masters with whom to work and masters can choose among the cohorts of students who present themselves for study.  This process of bilateral assortative selection is conspicuously at work among the ultra-elite of science.  Actual and prospective members of that elite select their scientist parents and therewith their scientist ancestors just as later they select their scientist progeny and therewith their scientist descendants."&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite 1977, p. 104"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman writes:  "[T]he lines of elite apprentices to elite masters who had themselves been elite apprentices, and so on indefinitely, often reach far back into the [[history of science]], long before 1900, when [Alfred] Nobel's will inaugurated what now amounts to the International Academy of Sciences.  As an example of the many long historical chains of elite masters and apprentices, consider the German-born English laureate [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] (1953), who traces his scientific lineage [...] back through his master, the 1931 laureate [[Otto Heinrich Warburg|Otto Warburg]].  Warburg had studied with [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fis[c]her]] [1852–1919], recipient of a prize in 1902 at the age of 50, three years before it was awarded [in 1905] to ''his'' teacher, [[Adolf von Baeyer]] [1835–1917], at age 70.  This lineage of four Nobel masters and apprentices has its own pre-Nobelian antecedents.  Von Baeyer had been the apprentice of [[August Kekule|F[riedrich] A[ugust] Kekulé]] [1829–96], whose ideas of [[structural formulae]] revolutionized [[organic chemistry]] and who is perhaps best known for the often retold story about his having hit upon the ring structure of [[benzene]] in a dream (1865).  Kekulé himself had been trained by the great [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] [[Justus von Liebig]] (1803–73), who had studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] with the master [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|J[oseph] L[ouis] Gay-Lussac]] (1778–1850), himself once apprenticed to [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] (1748–1822).  Among his many institutional and cognitive accomplishments, Berthollet helped found the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', served as science advisor to [[Napoleon]] in [[Egypt]], and, more significant for our purposes here, worked with [[Antoine Lavoisier|[Antoine] Lavoisier]] [1743–94] to revise the standard system of [[chemical nomenclature]]."&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite 1977, p. 105"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

====Big Science====
{{Main article|Big Science}}
What has been dubbed "[[Big Science]]" emerged from the United States' [[World War II]] [[Manhattan Project]] that produced the world's first [[nuclear weapons]]; and Big Science has since been associated with [[physics]], which requires massive [[particle accelerators]].  In [[biology]], Big Science debuted in 1990 with the [[Human Genome Project]] to sequence human [[DNA]].  In 2013 [[neuroscience]] became a Big Science domain when the U.S. announced a [[BRAIN Initiative]] and the [[European Union]] announced a [[Human Brain Project]].  Major new brain-research initiatives were also announced by Israel, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind: Two years in, a $1-billion-plus effort to simulate the human brain is in disarray. Was it poor management, or is something fundamentally wrong with [[Big Science]]?", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier successful Big Science projects had habituated politicians, [[mass media]], and the public to view Big Science programs with sometimes uncritical favor.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S.'s BRAIN Initiative was inspired by concern about the spread and cost of [[mental disorders]] and by excitement about new brain-manipulation technologies such as [[optogenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  After some early false starts, the U.S. [[National Institute of Mental Health]] let the country's brain scientists define the BRAIN Initiative, and this led to an ambitious interdisciplinary program to develop new technological tools to better monitor, measure, and simulate the brain.  Competition in research was ensured by the National Institute of Mental Health's [[peer review|peer-review process]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the [[European Commission]]'s Human Brain Project got off to a rockier start because political and economic considerations obscured questions concerning the feasibility of the Project's initial scientific program, based principally on [[computer modeling]] of [[neural circuit]]s.  Four years earlier, in 2009, fearing that the European Union would fall further behind the U.S. in computer and other technologies, the European Union had begun creating a competition for Big Science projects, and the initial program for the Human Brain Project seemed a good fit for a European program that might take a lead in advanced and emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only in 2015, after over 800 European neuroscientists threatened to boycott the European-wide collaboration, were changes introduced into the Human Brain Project, supplanting many of the original political and economic considerations with scientific ones.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
{{Main article|Funding of science}}
====Government funding====
{{Main article|Funding of science#Public funding}}
[[Nathan Myhrvold]], former [[Microsoft]] chief technology officer and founder of [[Microsoft Research]], argues that the funding of [[basic science]] cannot be left to the [[private sector]]—that "without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt."&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes that [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], published in 1915, did not spring full-blown from his brain in a eureka moment; he worked at it for years—finally driven to complete it by a rivalry with mathematician [[David Hilbert]].&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of almost any iconic scientific discovery or technological invention—the [[lightbulb]], the [[transistor]], [[DNA]], even the [[Internet]]—shows that the famous names credited with the breakthrough "were only a few steps ahead of a pack of competitors."  Some writers and elected officials have used this phenomenon of "[[list of multiple discoveries|parallel innovation]]" to argue against public financing of basic research:  government, they assert, should leave it to companies to finance the research they need.&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Myhrvold writes that such arguments are dangerously wrong:  without government support, most basic scientific research will never happen.  "This is most clearly true for the kind of pure research that has delivered... great intellectual benefits but no profits, such as the work that brought us the [[Higgs boson]], or the understanding that a supermassive [[black hole]] sits at the center of the [[Milky Way]], or the discovery of [[methane]] seas on the surface of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].  Company research laboratories used to do this kind of work:  experimental evidence for the [[big bang]] was discovered at [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[Bell Labs]], resulting in a [[Nobel Prize]].  Now those days are gone."&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in applied fields such as [[materials science]] and [[computer science]], writes Myhrvold, "companies now understand that basic research is a form of [[Charity (practice)|charity]]—so they avoid it."  Bell Labs scientists created the [[transistor]], but that invention earned billions for [[Intel]] and [[Microsoft]].  [[Xerox PARC]] engineers invented the modern [[graphical user interface]], but [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Microsoft profited most.  [[IBM]] researchers pioneered the use of giant [[magnetoresistance]] to boost [[hard-disk]] capacity but soon lost the disk-drive business to [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] and [[Western Digital]].&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Company researchers now have to focus narrowly on innovations that can quickly bring revenue; otherwise the research budget could not be justified to the company's investors.  "Those who believe profit-driven companies will altruistically pay for basic science that has wide-ranging benefits—but mostly to others and not for a generation—are naive....  If [[government]] were to leave it to the [[private sector]] to pay for [[basic research]], most [[science]] would come to a screeching halt.  What research survived would be done largely in secret, for fear of handing the next big thing to a rival."&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private funding====
{{Main article|Funding of science#Private funding}}
A complementary perspective on the funding of scientific research is given by D.T. Max, writing about the [[Flatiron Institute]], a computational center set up in 2017 in [[Manhattan]] to provide scientists with mathematical assistance.  The Flatiron Institute was established by [[James Harris Simons]], a mathematician who had used mathematical [[algorithm]]s to make himself a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  The Institute has three computational divisions dedicated respectively to [[astrophysics]], [[biology]], and [[quantum physics]], and is working on a fourth division for [[climate model|climate modeling]] that will involve interfaces of [[geology]], [[oceanography]], [[atmospheric science]], [[biology]], and [[climatology]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flatiron Institute is part of a trend in the sciences toward privately-funded research.  In the United States, [[basic science]] has traditionally been financed by universities or the government, but private institutes are often faster and more focused.  Since the 1990s, when [[Silicon Valley]] began producing billionaires, private institutes have sprung up across the U.S.  In 1997 [[Larry Ellison]] launched the [[Ellison Medical Foundation]]  to study the biology of [[aging]].  In 2003 [[Paul Allen]] founded the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]].  In 2010 [[Eric Schmidt]] founded the [[Schmidt Ocean Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

These institutes have done much good, partly by providing alternatives to more rigid systems.  But [[private foundation]]s also have liabilities.  Wealthy benefactors tend to direct their funding toward their personal enthusiasms.  And foundations are not taxed; much of the money that supports them would otherwise have gone to the government.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding biases====
[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], of [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford University Medical School]], writes that "There is increasing evidence that some of the ways we conduct, evaluate, report and disseminate research are miserably ineffective.  A series of papers in 2014 in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]''... estimated that 85 percent of investment in [[biomedical research]] is wasted.  Many other disciplines have similar problems."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ioannidis identifies some science-funding biases that undermine the efficiency of the scientific enterprise, and proposes solutions:

Funding too few scientists:  "[M]ajor success [in scientific research] is largely the result of luck, as well as hard work.  The investigators currently enjoying huge funding are not necessarily genuine superstars; they may simply be the best connected."  Solutions:  "Use a [[lottery]] to decide which [[grant application]]s to fund (perhaps after they pass a basic review).... Shift... funds from senior people to younger researchers..."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

No reward for [[Open research|transparency]]:  "Many scientific protocols, analysis methods, computational processes and data are opaque.  [M]any top findings cannot be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]].  That is the case for two out of three top psychology papers, one out of three top papers in experimental economics and more than 75 percent of top papers identifying new cancer drug targets.  [S]cientists are not rewarded for sharing their techniques."  Solutions:  "Create better infrastructure for enabling transparency, openness and sharing.  Make transparency a prerequisite for funding.  [P]referentially hire, promote or tenure... champions of transparency."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

No encouragement for [[Reproducibility|replication]]:  Replication is indispensable to the [[scientific method]].  Yet, under pressure to produce new [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]], researchers tend to have little incentive, and much counterincentive, to try replicating results of previous studies.  Solutions:  "Funding agencies must pay for replication studies.  Scientists' advancement should be based not only on their discoveries but also on their replication track record."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

No funding for young scientists:  "[[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] made their top contributions in their mid-20s."  But the average age of biomedical scientists receiving their first substantial grant is 46.  The average age for a full professor in the U.S. is 55.  Solutions:  "A larger proportion of funding should be earmarked for young investigators.  Universities should try to shift the aging distribution of their faculty by hiring more young investigators."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biased funding sources:  "Most funding for [[research and development]] in the U.S. comes not from the government but from private, for-profit sources, raising unavoidable [[conflicts of interest]] and pressure to deliver results favorable to the sponsor."  Solutions:  "Restrict or even ban funding that has overt conflicts of interest.  [[Scientific journal|Journals]] should not accept research with such conflicts.  For less conspicuous conflicts, at a minimum ensure transparent and thorough disclosure."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding the wrong fields:  "Well-funded fields attract more scientists to work for them, which increases their lobbying reach, fueling a [[vicious circle]].  Some entrenched fields absorb enormous funding even though they have clearly demonstrated limited yield or uncorrectable flaws."  Solutions:  "Independent, impartial assessment of output is necessary for lavishly funded fields.  More funds should be earmarked for new fields and fields that are high risk.  Researchers should be encouraged to switch fields, whereas currently they are incentivized to focus in one area."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not spending enough:  The U.S. military budget ($886 billion) is 24 times the budget of the [[National Institutes of Health]] ($37 billion).  "Investment in science benefits society at large, yet attempts to convince the public often make matters worse when otherwise well-intentioned science leaders promise the impossible, such as promptly eliminating all cancer or [[Alzheimer's disease]]."  Solutions:  "We need to communicate how science funding is used by making the process of science clearer, including the number of scientists it takes to make major accomplishments.... We would also make a more convincing case for science if we could show that we do work hard on improving how we run it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rewarding big spenders:  "Hiring, promotion and [[tenure]] decisions primarily rest on a researcher's ability to secure high levels of funding.  But the expense of a project does not necessarily correlate with its importance.  Such reward structures select mostly for politically savvy managers who know how to absorb money."  Solutions:  "We should reward scientists for high-quality work, reproducibility and social value rather than for securing funding.  Excellent research can be done with little to no funding other than protected time.  Institutions should provide this time and respect scientists who can do great work without wasting tons of money."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

No funding for high-risk ideas:  "The pressure that taxpayer money be 'well spent' leads government funders to back projects most likely to pay off with a positive result, even if riskier projects might lead to more important, but less assured, advances.  Industry also avoids investing in high-risk projects...  [[Innovation]] is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict..."  Solutions:  "Fund excellent scientists rather than projects and give them freedom to pursue research avenues as they see fit.  Some institutions such as [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] already use this model with success."  It must be communicated to the public and to policy-makers that science is a cumulative investment, that no one can know in advance which projects will succeed, and that success must be judged on the total agenda, not on a single experiment or result.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of good data:  "There is relatively limited evidence about which scientific practices work best.  We need more research on research ('[[meta-research]]') to understand how to best perform, evaluate, review, disseminate and reward science."  Solutions:  "We should invest in studying how to get the best science and how to choose and reward the best scientists."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual bias===
{{Main article|Women in science|Matilda effect}}
Claire Pomeroy, president of the [[Lasker Foundation]], which is dedicated to advancing [[medical research]], points out that [[woman scientist|women scientists]] continue to be subjected to [[discrimination]] in professional advancement.&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the percentage of doctorates awarded to women in [[life sciences]] in the United States increased from 15 to 52 percent between 1969 and 2009, only a third of assistant professors  and less than a fifth of full professors in biology-related fields in 2009 were women.  Women make up only 15 percent of permanent department chairs in [[medical school]]s and barely 16 percent of medical-school deans.&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The problem is a culture of unconscious [[bias]] that leaves many women feeling demoralized and marginalized.  In one study, science faculty were given identical [[résumé]]s in which the names and genders of two applicants were interchanged; both male ''and'' female faculty judged the male applicant to be more competent and offered him a higher salary.&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unconscious bias also appears as "microassaults" against [[woman scientist|women scientist]]s:  purportedly insignificant [[sexism|sexist]] jokes and insults that accumulate over the years and undermine confidence and ambition.  Writes Claire Pomeroy:  "Each time it is assumed that the only woman in the lab group will play the role of recording secretary, each time a research plan becomes finalized in the men's lavatory between conference sessions, each time a woman is not invited to go out for a beer after the plenary lecture to talk shop, the damage is reinforced."&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

"When I speak to groups of women scientists," writes Pomeroy, "I often ask them if they have ever been in a meeting where they made a recommendation, had it ignored, and then heard a man receive praise and support for making the same point a few minutes later.  Each time the majority of women in the audience raise their hands.  Microassaults are especially damaging when they come from a [[high school|high-school]] science teacher, college [[mentor]], university dean or a member of the scientific elite who has been awarded a prestigious prize—the very people who should be inspiring and supporting the next generation of scientists."&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main article|Sexual harassment}}
[[Sexual harassment]] is more prevalent in [[academia]] than in any other social sector except the [[military]].  A June 2018 report by the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] states that sexual harassment hurts individuals, diminishes the pool of scientific talent, and ultimately damages the integrity of science.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Moskowitz, "End Harassment:  A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Johnson]], co-chair of the committee that drew up the report, describes some measures for preventing sexual harassment in science.  One would be to replace trainees' individual [[mentoring]] with group mentoring, and to uncouple the mentoring relationship from the trainee's financial dependence on the mentor.  Another way would be to prohibit the use of [[confidentiality agreement]]s in connection with harassment cases.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Moskowitz, "End Harassment:  A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel approach to the reporting of sexual harassment, dubbed ''Callisto'', that has been adopted by some institutions of higher education, lets aggrieved persons record experiences of sexual harassment, date-stamped, without actually formally reporting them.  This program lets people see if others have recorded experiences of harassment from the same individual, and share information anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Moskowitz, "End Harassment:  A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterrent stereotypes===
[[Psychologist]] Andrei Cimpian and [[philosophy]] professor [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]] have proposed a theory to explain why American women and [[African-American]]s are often subtly deterred from seeking to enter certain academic fields by a misplaced emphasis on [[genius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cimpian and Leslie had noticed that their respective fields are similar in their substance but hold different views on what is important for success.  Much more than psychologists, philosophers value a certain ''kind of person'':  the "brilliant superstar" with an exceptional mind.  Psychologists are more likely to believe that the leading lights in psychology grew to achieve their positions through hard work and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, women accounted for less than 30% of doctorates granted in philosophy; African-Americans made up only 1% of philosophy Ph.D.s.  Psychology, on the other hand, has been successful in attracting women (72% of 2015 psychology Ph.D.s) and African-Americans (6% of psychology Ph.D.s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early insight into these disparities was provided to Cimpian and Leslie by the work of psychologist [[Carol Dweck]].  She and her colleagues had shown that a person's beliefs about [[Aptitude|ability]] matter a great deal for that person's ultimate success.  A person who sees talent as a stable trait is motivated to "show off this aptitude" and to avoid making [[Error|mistake]]s.  By contrast, a person who adopts a "growth [[mindset]]" sees his or her current capacity as a work in progress:  for such a person, mistakes are not an indictment but a valuable signal highlighting which of their skills are in need of work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cimpian and Leslie and their collaborators tested the hypothesis that attitudes, about "genius" and about the unacceptability of making mistakes, within various academic fields may account for the relative attractiveness of those fields for American women and African-Americans.  They did so by contacting academic professionals from a wide range of disciplines and asking them whether they thought that some form of exceptional intellectual talent was required for success in their field.  The answers received from almost 2,000 academics in 30 fields matched the distribution of Ph.D.s in the way that Cimpian and Leslie had expected:  fields that placed more value on brilliance also conferred fewer Ph.D.s on women and African-Americans.  The proportion of women and African-American Ph.D.s in psychology, for example, was higher than the parallel proportions for philosophy, mathematics, or physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigation showed that non-academics share similar ideas of which fields require brilliance.  Exposure to these ideas at home or school could discourage young members of [[stereotype]]d groups from pursuing certain careers, such as those in the natural sciences or engineering.  To explore this, Cimpian and Leslie asked hundreds of five-, six-, and seven-year-old boys and girls questions that measured whether they associated being "really, really smart" (i.e., "brilliant") with their sex.  The results, published in January 2017 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', were consistent with scientific literature on the early acquisition of sex stereotypes.  Five-year-old boys and girls showed no difference in their self-assessment; but by age six, girls were less likely to think that girls are "really, really smart."  The authors next introduced another group of five-, six-, and seven-year-olds to unfamiliar gamelike activities that the authors described as being "for children who are really, really smart."  Comparison of boys' and girls' interest in these activities at each age showed no sex difference at age five but significantly greater interest from boys at ages six and seven—exactly the ages when stereotypes emerge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cimpian and Leslie conclude that,  "Given current societal stereotypes, messages that portray [genius or brilliance] as singularly necessary [for academic success] may needlessly discourage talented members of stereotyped groups."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic snobbery&lt;!--'Sagan effect' redirects here--&gt;===
{{Main article|Snobbery}}
Largely as a result of his growing popularity, astronomer and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]], creator of the 1980 [[PBS]] TV ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' series, came to be ridiculed by scientist peers and failed to receive tenure at [[Harvard University]] in the 1960s and membership in the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in the 1990s.  The [[eponym]]ous "Sagan effect" persists:  as a group, scientists still discourage individual investigators from engaging with the public unless they are already well-established senior researchers.&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 65"&gt;[[Susana Martinez-Conde]], Devin Powell and [[Stephen L. Macknik]], "The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Editors, "Go Public or Perish:  When universities discourage scientists from speaking out, society suffers", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 2 (February 2018), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of the Sagan effect deprives society of the full range of expertise needed to make informed decisions about complex questions, including [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], and [[energy]] alternatives.  Fewer scientific voices mean fewer arguments to counter [[antiscience]] or [[pseudoscientific]] discussion.  The Sagan effect also creates the false impression that science is the domain of older white men (who dominate the senior ranks), thereby tending to discourage women and minorities from considering science careers.&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 65"/&gt;

A number of factors contribute to the Sagan effect's durability.  At the height of the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century, many researchers emulated the example of [[Isaac Newton]], who dedicated himself to physics and mathematics and never married.  These scientists were viewed as pure seekers of truth who were not distracted by more mundane concerns.  Similarly, today anything that takes scientists away from their research, such as having a hobby or taking part in public debates, can undermine their credibility as researchers.&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 66"&gt;[[Susana Martinez-Conde]], Devin Powell and [[Stephen L. Macknik]], "The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more prosaic factor in the Sagan effect's persistence may be professional [[jealousy]].&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 66"/&gt;

However, there appear to be some signs that engaging with the rest of society is becoming less hazardous to a career in science.  So many people have social-media accounts now that becoming a public figure is not as unusual for scientists as previously.  Moreover, as traditional funding sources stagnate, going public sometimes leads to new, unconventional funding streams.  A few institutions such as [[Emory University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] may have begun to appreciate outreach as an area of academic activity, in addition to the traditional roles of research, teaching, and administration.  Exceptional among federal funding agencies, the [[National Science Foundation]] now officially favors popularization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susana Martinez-Conde]], Devin Powell and [[Stephen L. Macknik]], "The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Editors, "Go Public or Perish:  When universities discourage scientists from speaking out, society suffers", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 2 (February 2018), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minnesota / Texas Adoption Research Project''' (MTARP) is a longitudinal research study that focuses on the consequences of variations in openness in [[adoption]] arrangements for all members of the adoptive kinship network: birthmothers, adoptive parents, and adopted children, and for the relationships within these family systems.

MTARP is a joint project between the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[University of Texas at Austin]] and involves interviews with adoptive parents and birth mothers. The Principal Investigators of the study are Harold D. Grotevant, [[University of Minnesota]], and Ruth G. McRoy, [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Co-investigators include Gretchen Wrobel, Bethel University, St. Paul, MN, Martha Rueter, University of Minnesota, Susan Ayers-Lopez, University of Texas at Austin, and Sarah Friese, University of Minnesota.  It is funded primarily by the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]], [[National Science Foundation]], [[William T. Grant Foundation]], [[Office of Population Affairs]], and Rudd Family Foundation Chair in Psychology at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grotevant |first=Harold D. |last2=McRoy |first2=Ruth G. |last3=Wrobel |first3=Gretchen M. |last4=Ayers-Lopez |first4=Susan |date=2013-09-01 |title=Contact Between Adoptive and Birth Families: Perspectives From the Minnesota/Texas Adoption Research Project |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdep.12039/abstract |journal=Child Development Perspectives |language=en |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=193–198 |doi=10.1111/cdep.12039 |issn=1750-8606|pmc=3743089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also funded in part by the [[Pioneer Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http:/www.pioneerfund.org/Grantees.html |title=Grantees |website=Pioneer Fund website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106210310/http:/www.pioneerfund.org/Grantees.html |archive-date=2011-11-06 |access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the families in the project adopted a child in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Families and birthmothers were first interviewed between 1987 and 1992 and again between 1996 and 2000. Grotevant and colleagues at the Minnesota site have followed the adopted children and their adoptive parents (e.g., Grotevant, Ross, Marchel, &amp; McRoy, 1999; Dunbar &amp; Grotevant, 2004); McRoy and colleagues at the University of Texas at Austin have followed the children’s birthmothers (e.g., Christian, et al., 1997; Fravel, et al., 2000).  Adoptive families and birthmothers were recruited for the study through 35 adoption agencies located across the United States.

Families where there was at least one adopted child (the "target child") between the ages of 4 and 12 at the time of the interview, who was adopted through an agency before his or her first birthday, and in which both adoptive parents were married to the partner they had at the time of the adoption were selected for the study. Transracial, international, or "special needs" adoptees were not included.  Participants in the study were located in 23 different states from all regions of the U.S., making this study the only nationwide one of its kind.

[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the modern synthesis, including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance.&lt;ref name="Gould216"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]].]]
{{Evolutionary biology}}

The '''modern synthesis'''{{efn|Also known variously as the '''new synthesis''', the '''modern evolutionary synthesis''', the '''evolutionary synthesis''', and the '''neo-Darwinian synthesis'''. These alternative terms are ambiguous as they could possibly include later syntheses, so this article uses [[Julian Huxley]]'s 1942 "modern synthesis"{{sfn|Huxley|2010}} throughout.}} was the early 20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s ideas on heredity in a joint mathematical framework. [[Julian Huxley]] coined the term in his 1942 book, ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''.

The 19th century ideas of [[natural selection]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were put together with [[population genetics]], early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed the relationship between the broad-scale changes of [[macroevolution]] seen by [[paleontology|palaeontologists]] and the small-scale [[microevolution]] of local [[population]]s of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1959, [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] in 1966 and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included [[E. B. Ford]], [[Bernhard Rensch]], [[Ivan Schmalhausen]], and [[George Gaylord Simpson]]. An early event in the modern synthesis was [[R. A. Fisher]]'s 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but [[William Bateson]], and separately [[Udny Yule]], were already starting to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.

Different syntheses followed, accompanying the gradual breakup of the early 20th century synthesis, including with [[social behaviour]] in [[E. O. Wilson]]'s [[sociobiology]] in 1975, [[evolutionary developmental biology]]'s integration of [[embryology]] with genetics and evolution, starting in 1977, and [[Massimo Pigliucci]]'s proposed [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] of 2007. In the view of the evolutionary biologist [[Eugene Koonin]] in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a 'post-modern' synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in [[molecular biology]], the study of [[prokaryote]]s and the resulting [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]], and [[genomics]].&lt;ref name=Koonin2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |title=The Origin at 150: is a new evolutionary synthesis in sight? |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=November 2009 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=473–475 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.09.007 |pmid=19836100 |pmc=2784144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's evolution by natural selection, 1859===
{{main|Evolution|Natural selection}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was successful in convincing most biologists that [[evolution]] had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that [[natural selection]] was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of [[Lamarckism]] (inheritance of acquired characteristics), [[orthogenesis]] (progressive evolution), [[saltationism]] (evolution by jumps) and [[mutationism]] (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=236–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] advocated a selectionist version of evolution, and unlike Darwin completely rejected Lamarckism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kutschera |first=Ulrich |authorlink=Ulrich Kutschera |date=December 2003 |title=A comparative analysis of the Darwin-Wallace papers and the development of the concept of natural selection |journal=Theory in Biosciences |location=Jena; Berlin &amp; Heidelberg |publisher=Urban &amp; Fischer; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=343–359 |doi=10.1007/s12064-003-0063-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Wallace's view was labelled [[neo-Darwinism]] by Samuel Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Samuel |authorlink1=Samuel Butler (novelist)|title=Unconscious Memory |date=1880 |publisher=David Bogue |page=280 |url=https://archive.org/details/unconsciousmemo00hartgoog |quote=I may predict with some certainty that before long we shall find the original Darwinism of Dr. [[Erasmus Darwin]] … generally accepted instead of the neo-Darwinism of to-day, and that the variations whose accumulation results in species will be recognised as due to the wants and endeavours of the living forms in which they appear, instead of being ascribed to chance, or, in other words, to unknown causes, as by Mr. Charles Darwin's system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wallacefund.info/terms-darwinism-and-neo-darwinism |title=On the Terms "Darwinism" and "Neo-Darwinism" |last=Beccaloni |first=George |date=2013 |website=A.

===The eclipse of Darwinism, 1880s onwards===
{{main|The eclipse of Darwinism}}

From the 1880s onwards, there was a widespread belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This [[eclipse of Darwinism]] (in [[Julian Huxley]]'s phrase) grew out of the weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in [[blending inheritance]], which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] correctly noted in 1868.&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson105-129"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of [[pangenesis]], with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing from all parts of the body, actually implied Lamarckism as well as blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gayon, Jean |date=1998 |title=Darwinism's Struggle for Survival: Heredity and the Hypothesis of Natural Selection |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=2–3 |isbn=978-0-521-56250-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darwin68"&gt;{{cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Darwin | year=1868 | title=The variation of animals and plants under domestication | publisher=John Murray | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F880.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 | isbn=1-4191-8660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weismann's germ plasm, 1892===
{{main|Germ plasm}}

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |date=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong, and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was 'hard'.{{efn|Peter Gauthier has however argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm. It did not test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=Peter |date=March–May 1990 |title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis? |journal=BIOS |volume=61 |number=1/2 |pages=6–8 |jstor=4608123}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He argued strongly and dogmatically{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=248}} for Darwinism and against Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=247–253, 257}}

==Disputed beginnings==

===Genetics, mutationism and biometrics, 1900–1918===
{{main|Mutationism|Biostatistics}}
[[File:William Bateson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William Bateson]] championed [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelism]].]]

While carrying out breeding experiments to clarify the mechanism of inheritance in 1900, [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Carl Correns]] independently rediscovered [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. News of this reached [[William Bateson]] in [[England]], who reported on the paper during a presentation to the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in May 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/germplas/PISUM/ZGS4F.HTM |title=Mendel's Peas |last=Ambrose |first=Mike |publisher=Germplasm Resources Unit, [[John Innes Centre]]|location=Norwich, UK |accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mendelian inheritance]], the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with the contribution of the other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's round and wrinkled peas, the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term [[allele]] for a variant form of an [[gene|inherited characteristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reviewing Mendel's Laws |url=http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/inheritance/laws.html |publisher=Pearson |accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bateson|1894}}: Mutations (as 'sports') and polymorphisms were well known long before the Mendelian recovery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two schools were the Mendelians, such as Bateson and de Vries, who favoured mutationism&lt;!--cd overlink this--&gt;, evolution driven by mutation, based on genes whose alleles [[Particulate inheritance|segregated discretely]] like Mendel's peas;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=157–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1989|pp=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Biostatistics|biometric school]], led by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter Weldon]]. The biometricians argued vigorously against mutationism, saying that empirical evidence indicated that variation was continuous in most organisms, not discrete as Mendelism seemed to predict; they wrongly believed that Mendelism inevitably implied evolution in discontinuous jumps.&lt;ref name="grafen 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Pearson, 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Pearson]] led the [[Biostatistics|biometric school]].]]

A traditional view is that the biometricians and the Mendelians rejected natural selection and argued for their separate theories for 20 years, the debate only resolved by the development of population genetics.&lt;ref name="grafen 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Grafen|Ridley|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olby |first1=Robert |title=The Dimensions of Scientific Controversy: The Biometric-Mendelian Debate |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=September 1989 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=299–320 |jstor=4026898 |doi=10.1017/s0007087400026170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more recent view is that Bateson, de Vries, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and [[Reginald Punnett]] had by 1918 formed a synthesis of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]], the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and the probability that a new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gayon, J. | title=Darwinism's Struggle for Survival: Heredity and the Hypothesis of Natural Selection |year=1988 | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoltzfus"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |last2=Cable |first2=Kele |title=Mendelian-Mutationism: The Forgotten Evolutionary Synthesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2014 |volume=47 |pages=501–546 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9383-2 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10739-014-9383-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected".&lt;ref name="BatesonSaunders1902"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bateson |first1=William |author1link=William Bateson |last2=Saunders |first2=E. R. |author2link=Edith Rebecca Saunders |title=Experimental Studies in the Physiology of Heredity|journal=Royal Society. Reports to the Evolution Committee |date=1902 |url=http://post.queensu.ca/~forsdyke/bateson1.htm#Bateson%20&amp;%20Saunders%20(1902)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1902, the statistician [[Udny Yule]] showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's approach as confrontational,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yule | first1=G. Udny |authorlink=Udny Yule | title=Mendel's Laws and their probable relations to inter-racial heredity |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb06590.x/pdf |journal=New Phytologist |volume=1 |pages=226–227 |date=1902 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb07336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=81–82}}

===Castle's hooded rats, 1911===

Starting in 1906, [[William Ernest Castle|William Castle]] carried out a long study of the effect of selection on coat colour in [[rat]]s. The [[piebald]] or hooded pattern was [[recessive]] to the grey wild type. He crossed hooded rats with the black-backed Irish type, and then back-crossed the offspring with pure hooded rats. The dark stripe on the back was bigger. He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations, and found that it was possible to change the characteristics way beyond the initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries's claim that continuous variation was caused by the environment and could not be inherited. By 1911 Castle noted that the results could be explained by Darwinian selection on heritable variation of a sufficient number of Mendelian genes.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=109–114}}

===Morgan's fruit flies, 1912===
{{main|Thomas Hunt Morgan}}

Thomas Hunt Morgan began his career in genetics as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''{{efn|Morgan's work with fruit flies helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] theory of inheritance, that the hereditary material was embodied in these bodies within the cell nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the supply of genetic variation in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=120–121}}

==An obstruction: Woodger's positivism, 1929==

{{further|Joseph Henry Woodger}}

The [[theoretical biology|theoretical biologist]] and [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] led the introduction of [[logical positivism|positivism]] into biology with his 1929 book ''Biological Principles''. He saw a mature [[science]] as being characterised by a framework of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that could be verified by facts established by [[experiment]]s. He criticised the traditional [[natural history]] style of [[biology]], including the study of [[evolution]], as immature science, since it relied on [[narrative]].&lt;ref name=Smocovitis100&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodger set out to play for biology the role of [[Robert Boyle]]'s 1661 ''[[Sceptical Chymist]]'', intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the [[Vienna Circle]] of logical positivists like [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[reductionism|to reduce]] biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and by influencing thinkers such as Huxley, helped to bring about the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis100/&gt; The positivist climate made natural history unfashionable, and in America, research and university-level teaching on evolution declined almost to nothing by the late 1930s. The Harvard physiologist [[William John Crozier]] told his students that evolution was not even a science: "You can't experiment with two million years!"&lt;ref name=Smocovitis114&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tide of opinion turned with the adoption of [[mathematical model]]ling and [[controlled experiment]]ation in population genetics, combining genetics, ecology and evolution in a framework acceptable to positivism.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis119&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events in the synthesis==
===Fisher and Haldane's mathematical population genetics, 1918–1930===
{{main|A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection}}

In 1918, R. A. Fisher wrote the paper "[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Ronald A. |authorlink=Ronald Fisher |date=January 1919 |title=XV.—The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |location=London |publisher=Robert Grant &amp; Son; [[Williams and Norgate|Williams &amp; Norgate]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=399–433 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800012163 |oclc=4981124}} "Paper read by J. Arthur Thomson on July 8, 1918 to the Royal Society of Edinburgh."&lt;/ref&gt; which showed mathematically how continuous variation could result from a number of discrete [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]. In this and subsequent papers culminating in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher showed how Mendelian genetics was consistent with the idea of evolution driven by natural selection.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=221–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Fisher also analysed [[sexual selection]] in his book, but his work was largely ignored, and Darwin's case for such selection misunderstood&lt;!--e.g. by Huxley--&gt;, so it formed no substantial part of the modern synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosken |first1=David J. |last2=House |first2=Clarissa M. |title=Sexual Selection |journal=Current Biology |date=25 January 2011 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=R62–R65 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1920s, [[A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection|a series of papers]] by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] applied mathematical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the [[Peppered moth evolution|evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths]].&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt; Haldane established that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=325–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both workers, and others such as Dobzhansky and Wright, explicitly intended to bring biology up to the philosophical standard of the physical sciences, making it firmly based in mathematical modelling, its predictions confirmed by experiment. Natural selection, once considered hopelessly unverifiable speculation about history, was becoming predictable, measurable, and testable.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis122&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=122–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Beer's embryology, 1930===

The traditional view is that [[developmental biology]] played little part in the modern synthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'', the evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] anticipated [[evolutionary developmental biology]]&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis I.

===Wright's adaptive landscape, 1932===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|[[Sewall Wright]] introduced the idea of a [[fitness landscape]] with local optima.]]
{{further information|Population genetics#History}}

The population geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] focused on combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, and the effects of [[inbreeding]] on small relatively isolated populations, which could be subject to [[genetic drift]]. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an [[Fitness landscape|adaptive landscape]] in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1932|pp=[http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf 356–366]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming aware of the importance of geographical isolation in real world populations.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt; The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Michael R. |authorlink1=Michael R.

===Dobzhansky's evolutionary genetics, 1937===
{{further|Genetics and the Origin of Species}}
[[File:Drosophila pseudoobscura-Male.png|thumb|left|''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'', the fruit fly which served as [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]'s [[model organism]]]]

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], an emigrant from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], who had been a postdoctoral worker in Morgan's fruit fly lab, was one of the first to apply genetics to natural populations. He worked mostly with ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]''. He says pointedly: "Russia has a variety of climates from the Arctic to sub-tropical... Exclusively laboratory workers who neither possess nor wish to have any knowledge of living beings in nature were and are in a minority."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|Provine|1998|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, there were other [[Russia]]n geneticists with similar ideas, though for some time their work was known to only a few in the [[Western world|West]]. His 1937 work ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a key step in bridging the gap between population geneticists and field naturalists. It presented the conclusions reached by Fisher, Haldane, and especially Wright in their highly mathematical papers in a form that was easily accessible to others.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt; Further, Dobzhansky asserted that evolution was based on material genes, arranged in a string on physical hereditary structures, the [[chromosome]]s, and [[genetic linkage|linked]] more or less strongly to each other according to their physical distances from each other on the chromosomes. As with Haldane and Fisher, Dobzhansky's "evolutionary genetics"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a genuine science, now unifying cell biology, genetics, and both micro- and macroevolution.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis122/&gt; His work emphasized that real world populations had far more genetic variability than the early population geneticists had assumed in their models, and that genetically distinct sub-populations were important. Dobzhansky argued that natural selection worked to maintain genetic diversity as well as driving change. He was influenced by his exposure in the 1920s to the work of [[Sergei Chetverikov]], who had looked at the role of recessive genes in maintaining a reservoir of genetic variability in a population before his work was shut down by the rise of [[Lysenkoism]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt; By 1937, Dobzhansky was able to argue  that mutations were the main source of evolutionary changes and variability, along with chromosome rearrangements, effects of genes on their neighbours during development, and polyploidy. Next, genetic drift (he used the term in 1941), selection, migration, and geographical isolation could change gene frequencies. Thirdly, mechanisms like ecological or sexual isolation and hybrid sterility could fix the results of the earlier processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eldredge |first=Niles |title=Unfinished Synthesis: Biological Hierarchies and Modern Evolutionary Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEYdRMjhPC4C&amp;pg=PR9 |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536513-9 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Fisher were correct.

===Schmalhausen's stabilizing selection, 1941===
{{further|Stabilizing selection}}

[[Ivan Schmalhausen]] developed the theory of [[stabilizing selection]], the idea that selection can preserve a trait at some value, publishing a paper in Russian titled "Stabilizing selection and its place among factors of evolution" in 1941 and a monograph ''Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmalhausen|first1=Ivan I.|last2=Dordick|first2=Isadore (trans.)|authorlink1=Ivan Schmalhausen|editor1-last=Dobzhansky|editor1-first=Theodosius|editor1-link=Theodosius Dobzhansky|title=Factors of Evolution.

Baldwin's 1902 concept that changes induced by the environment will ultimately be replaced by hereditary changes (including the [[Baldwin effect]] on behaviour), following that theory's implications to their Darwinian conclusion, and bringing him into conflict with Lysenkoism. Schmalhausen observed that stabilizing selection would remove most variations from the norm, most mutations being harmful.&lt;ref name=Levit2006&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levit | first=Georgy S. |author2=Hossfeld, Uwe |author3=Olsson, Lennart | title=From the 'Modern Synthesis' to Cybernetics: Ivan Ivanovich Schmalhausen (1884–1963) and his Research Program for a Synthesis of Evolutionary and Developmental Biology | journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology | volume=306B | issue=2006 | pages=89–106 | publisher=Wiley-Liss | year=2006 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.b.21087/abstract | pmid=16419076 | doi=10.1002/jez.b.21087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams, M.

===Huxley's popularising synthesis, 1942===
{{main|Evolution: The Modern Synthesis}}
[[File:Julian Huxley 1964.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julian Huxley]] presented a serious but popularising version of the theory in his 1942 book ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''.]]

In 1942, [[Julian Huxley]]'s serious but popularising&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamm&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lamm |first1=Ehud |title=Review of: Julian Huxley, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis – The Definitive Edition, with a new forward by Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller. MIT Press |url=http://www.ehudlamm.com/huxley.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''{{sfn|Huxley|2010}} introduced a name for the synthesis and intentionally set out to promote a "synthetic point of view" on the evolutionary process. He imagined a wide synthesis of many sciences: genetics, developmental physiology, ecology, systematics, palaeontology, cytology, and mathematical analysis of biology, and assumed that evolution would proceed differently in different groups of organisms according to how their genetic material was organised and their strategies for reproduction, leading to progressive but varying evolutionary trends.&lt;ref name=Lamm/&gt; His vision was of an "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt; with a system of ethics and a meaningful place for "Man" in the world grounded in a unified theory of evolution which would demonstrate progress leading to man at its summit. Natural selection was in his view a "fact of nature capable of verification by observation and experiment", while the "period of synthesis" of the 1920s and 1930s had formed a "more unified science",&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt; rivalling physics and enabling the "rebirth of Darwinism".&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=138–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the book was not the research text that it appeared to be. In the view of the philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]], and in Huxley's own opinion, Huxley was "a generalist, a synthesizer of ideas, rather than a specialist".&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{harvnb|Ruse|1996|pp=328–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse observes that Huxley wrote as if he were adding empirical evidence to the mathematical framework established by Fisher and the population geneticists, but that this was not so. Huxley avoided mathematics, for instance not even mentioning [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]]. Instead, Huxley used a mass of examples to demonstrate that natural selection is powerful, and that it works on Mendelian genes. The book was successful in its goal of persuading readers of the reality of evolution, effectively illustrating topics such as [[island biogeography]], [[speciation]], and competition. Huxley further showed that the appearance of long-term [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic trends]] – predictable directions for evolution – in the fossil record were readily explained as [[allometry|allometric growth]] (since parts are interconnected). All the same, Huxley did not reject orthogenesis out of hand, but maintained a belief in progress all his life, with ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as the end point, and he had since 1912 been influenced by the [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], though in public he maintained an atheistic position on evolution.&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt; Huxley's belief in progress within evolution and evolutionary humanism was shared in various forms by Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson and Stebbins, all of them writing about "the future of Mankind". Both Huxley and Dobzhansky admired the palaeontologist priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], Huxley writing the introduction to Teilhard's 1955 book on orthogenesis, ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]''. This vision required evolution to be seen as the central and guiding principle of biology.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt;

===Mayr's allopatric speciation, 1942===
{{main|Systematics and the Origin of Species|Allopatric speciation}}
[[File:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ernst Mayr]] argued that [[allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] was needed to provide sufficient [[reproductive isolation]] for [[speciation|new species to form]].]]

[[Ernst Mayr]]'s key contribution to the synthesis was ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species]]'', published in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asserted the importance of and set out to explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of [[Taxon|polytypic]] species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hey, Jody|author2=Fitch, Walter M.|author3=Ayala, Francisco J. |title=Systematics and the origin of species: An introduction |journal=PNAS |date=2005 |volume=102 |issue=supplement 1 |pages=6515–6519 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0501939102 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6515.full|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.6515H |pmc=1131868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr emphasized the importance of [[allopatric speciation]], where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that [[reproductive isolation]] occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of [[sympatric speciation]] believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the [[Species problem#Biological species concept|biological species concept]] that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mayr|1982}} Before he left [[Germany]] for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist [[Bernhard Rensch]], who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rensch|1947}}; {{harvnb|Rensch|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/RENS1900.htm |title=Rensch, Bernhard (Carl Emmanuel) (Germany 1900-1990) |last=Smith |first=Charles H. |authorlink=Charles H.

He noted that any chosen line is one path in a complex branching tree, [[natural selection]] having no [[orthogenesis|imposed direction]].]]

===Simpson's palaeontology, 1944===

[[George Gaylord Simpson]] was responsible for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with palaeontology in his 1944 book ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. Simpson's work was crucial because so many palaeontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, with the idea that natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the [[evolution of the horse]]) that earlier palaeontologists had used as support for [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the [[fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt;

===The Society for the Study of Evolution, 1946===

During the [[World War II|war]], Mayr edited a series of bulletins of the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology, and Systematics, formed in 1943, reporting on discussions of a "synthetic attack" on the interdisciplinary problems of evolution. In 1946, the committee became the Society for the Study of Evolution, with Mayr, Dobzhansky and Sewall Wright the first of the signatories. Mayr became the editor of its journal, ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. From Mayr and Dobzhansky's point of view, suggests the historian of science Betty Smocovitis, Darwinism was reborn, evolutionary biology was legitimised, and genetics and evolution were synthesised into a newly unified science. Everything fitted in to the new framework, except "heretics" like [[Richard Goldschmidt]] who annoyed Mayr and Dobzhansky by insisting on the possibility of [[mutationism|speciation by macromutation]], creating "hopeful monsters". The result was "bitter controversy".&lt;ref name=Smocovitis153&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=153–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stebbins's botany, 1950===

The botanist [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] extended the synthesis to encompass [[botany]]. He described the important effects on [[speciation]] of [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] and [[polyploidy]] in plants in his 1950 book ''[[Variation and Evolution in Plants]]''. These permitted evolution to proceed rapidly at times, polyploidy in particular evidently being able to create new species effectively instantaneously.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smocovitis2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smocovitis | first1=V.

{{further|Inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}

In 1964, [[W. D. Hamilton]] published two papers on "The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour". These defined [[inclusive fitness]] as the number of offspring equivalents an individual rears, rescues or otherwise supports through its behaviour. This was contrasted with personal reproductive fitness, the number of offspring that the individual directly begets. Hamilton, and others such as [[John Maynard Smith]], argued that a gene's success consisted in maximising the number of copies of itself, either by begetting them or by indirectly encouraging begetting by related individuals who shared the gene, the theory of [[kin selection]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maynard Smith |first=John |authorlink=John Maynard Smith |year=1964 |title=Group Selection and Kin Selection |journal=Nature |volume=201 |issue=4924 |pages=1145–1147 |doi=10.1038/2011145a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[E. O.

This appeared radically new, although Wilson was following Darwin, Fisher, Dawkins and others.&lt;ref name=YudellDesalle2000/&gt; Critics such as [[Gerhard Lenski]] noted that he was following Huxley, Simpson and Dobzhansky's approach, which Lenski considered needlessly reductive as far as human society was concerned.&lt;ref name=Lenski1976&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lenski| first=Gerhard| year=1976| title=Sociobiology.

{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

In 1977, [[recombinant DNA]] technology enabled biologists to start to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] from 1978, when [[Edward B. Lewis]] discovered [[homeotic]] genes, showed that many so-called [[toolkit gene]]s act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some of the regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the ''[[Pax6]]'' gene is involved in forming the [[eye]]s of mice and of fruit flies. Such [[deep homology]] provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S. F. |title=A New Evolutionary Synthesis |work=Developmental Biology |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10128/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later syntheses==

In 1982, a historical note on a series of evolutionary biology books{{efn|In a reissue of Dobzhansky's ''Genetics and the Origin of Species''.}} could state without qualification that evolution is the central organizing principle of biology. Smocovitis commented on this that "What the architects of the synthesis had worked to construct had by 1982 become a matter of fact", adding in a footnote that "the centrality of evolution had thus been rendered [[tacit knowledge]], part of the [[received wisdom]] of the profession".{{sfn|Smocovitis|1996|pp=186–187}}

By the late 20th century, however, the modern synthesis was showing its age, and fresh syntheses to remedy its defects and fill in its gaps were proposed from different directions. These have included such diverse fields as the [[sociology|study of society]],&lt;ref name=YudellDesalle2000/&gt; developmental biology,&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991/&gt; epigenetics,&lt;ref name=pigliucci/&gt; [[molecular biology]], [[microbiology]], [[genomics]],&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; [[symbiogenesis]], and [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name=Noble2011/&gt; The physiologist [[Denis Noble]] argues that these additions render neo-Darwinism in the sense of the early 20th century's modern synthesis "at the least, incomplete as a theory of evolution",&lt;ref name=Noble2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=Denis |title=Neo-Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis and selfish genes: are they of use in physiology? |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=589 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=1007–1015 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201384|pmc=3060581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one that has been falsified by later biological research.&lt;ref name=Noble2011/&gt;

Michael Rose and Todd Oakley note that evolutionary biology, formerly divided and "[[Balkanization|Balkanized]]", has been brought together by genomics. It has in their view discarded at least five common assumptions from the modern synthesis, namely that the genome is always a well-organised set of genes; that each gene has a single function; that species are well adapted biochemically to their ecological niches; that species are the durable units of evolution, and  all levels from organism to organ, cell and molecule within the species are characteristic of it; and that the design of every organism and cell is efficient. They argue that the "new biology" integrates genomics, [[bioinformatics]], and evolutionary genetics into a general-purpose toolkit for a "Postmodern Synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Michael R. |authorlink1=Michael R.

===Pigliucci's extended evolutionary synthesis, 2007===
{{main|Extended evolutionary synthesis}}

In 2007, more than half a century after the modern synthesis, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] called for an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] to incorporate aspects of biology that had not been included or had not existed in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J. | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | issue=5| pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;John Odling-Smee ''et al''.

===Koonin's 'post-modern' evolutionary synthesis, 2009===
[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|A 21st century [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] showing [[horizontal gene transfer]]s among [[prokaryote]]s and the saltational [[endosymbiosis]] events that created the [[eukaryote]]s, neither fitting into the 20th century's modern synthesis]]

In 2009, Darwin's 200th anniversary, the ''Origin of Species''{{'}} 150th, and the 200th of Lamarck's "early evolutionary synthesis",&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'', the evolutionary biologist [[Eugene Koonin]] stated that while "the edifice of the [early 20th century] Modern Synthesis has crumbled, apparently, beyond repair",&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; a new 21st century synthesis could be glimpsed. Three interlocking revolutions had, he argued, taken place in evolutionary biology: molecular, microbiological, and genomic. The [[molecular biology|molecular revolution]] included the neutral theory, that most mutations are neutral and that purifying selection happens more often than the positive form, and that all current life evolved from [[Last Universal Common Ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. In microbiology, the synthesis has expanded to cover the [[prokaryote]]s, using [[ribosomal RNA]] to form a [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. Finally, [[genomics]] brought together the molecular and microbiological syntheses, noting that a molecular view shows that the tree of life is problematic.  In particular, [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[bacteria]] means that prokaryotes freely share genes, challenging Mayr's foundational definition of [[species]]. Further, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and "momentous events" like [[endosymbiosis]] enable evolution to proceed in sudden jumps, ending the old gradualist-saltationist debate by showing that on this point Darwin's gradualism was wrong. The idea of [[progressionism|progress in biology]], too, is seen to be wrong, along with the modern synthesis belief in [[pan-adaptationism]], that everything is optimally adapted: genomes plainly are not.&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; Many of these points had already been made by other researchers such as Ulrich Kutschera and [[Karl J. Niklas]].&lt;ref name="Kutschera"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J.

===Towards a replacement synthesis===
[[File:Modern Synthesis Limits.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|Inputs to the modern synthesis, with other topics (inverted colours) such as developmental biology that were not joined with evolutionary biology until the turn of the 21st century]]

Biologists, alongside scholars of the history and philosophy of biology, have continued to debate the need for, and possible nature of, a replacement synthesis. For example, in 2017 Philippe Huneman and Denis M. Walsh stated in their book ''Challenging the Modern Synthesis'' that numerous theorists had pointed out that the disciplines of embryological developmental theory, morphology, and ecology had been omitted. They noted that all such arguments amounted to a continuing desire to replace the modern synthesis with one that united "all biological fields of research related to evolution, adaptation, and diversity in a single theoretical frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huneman |first1=Philippe |last2=Walsh |first2=Denis M. |title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis: Adaptation, Development, and Inheritance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72EwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76 |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-068145-6 |pages=76 (Chapter 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observed further that there are two groups of challenges to the way the modern synthesis viewed inheritance. The first is that other modes such as [[epigenetic inheritance]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], the [[Baldwin effect]], and the [[maternal effect]] allow new characteristics to arise and be passed on, and for the genes to catch up with the new adaptations later. The second is that all such mechanisms are part, not of an inheritance system, but a [[Developmental systems theory|developmental system]]: the fundamental unit is not a discrete selfishly competing gene, but a collaborating system that works at all levels from genes and cells to organisms and cultures to guide evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huneman |first1=Philippe |last2=Walsh |first2=Denis M. |title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis: Adaptation, Development, and Inheritance  |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-068145-6 |pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==

Looking back at the conflicting accounts of the modern synthesis, the historian Betty Smocovitis notes in her 1996 book ''Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology'' that both historians and philosophers of biology have attempted to grasp its scientific meaning, but have found it "a moving target";&lt;ref name=Smocovitis187&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only thing they agreed on was that it was a historical event.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis187/&gt; In her words "by the late 1980s the notoriety of the evolutionary synthesis was recognized . . . So notorious did 'the synthesis' become, that few serious historically minded analysts would touch the subject, let alone know where to begin to sort through the interpretive mess left behind by the numerous critics and commentators".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[agriculture]], '''multiple cropping''' is the practice of growing two or more [[agriculture|crops]] in the same piece of land in same [[growing seasons]] instead of one crop.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnett, R.B. (2002). ''Interactive Geography 4'', p. 98. SNP Pan Pacific Publishing. {{ISBN|981-208-657-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[polyculture]]. It can take the form of double-cropping, in which a second crop is planted after the first has been harvested, or relay cropping, in which the second crop is started amidst the first crop before it has been harvested. A related practice, [[companion planting]], is sometimes used in gardening and intensive cultivation of vegetables and fruits. One example of multi-cropping is tomatoes + onions + marigold; the marigolds repel some tomato pests.
Mixed cropping is found in many agricultural traditions. In the Garhwal Himalaya of India, a practice called baranaja involves sowing 12 or more crops on the same plot, including various types of beans, grains, and millets, and harvesting them at different times.

In the cultivation of rice, multiple cropping requires effective irrigation, especially in areas with a dry season. Rain that falls during the wet season permits the cultivation of rice during that period, but during the other half of the year, water cannot be channeled into the rice fields without an irrigation system. The [[Green Revolution]] in Asia led to the development of high-yield varieties of rice, which required a substantially shorter growing season of 100 days, as opposed to traditional varieties, which needed 150 to 185 days. Due to this, multiple cropping became more prevalent in Asian countries.

'''Oregon pioneer history''' (1806—1890) is the period in the [[History of Oregon|history]] of [[Oregon Country]] and [[Oregon Territory]], in the present day state of [[Oregon]] and [[Northwestern United States]].

It was the era when [[Settler|pioneers]] and [[mountain men]], primarily of [[Europe]]an descent, traveled west across [[North America]] to explore and settle the lands west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and north of [[California]]. Some also arrived via the [[Pacific Ocean]], traveling by ship either around [[Cape Horn]] or by changing ships at [[Panama]]. The period begins after the explorations of the lower [[Columbia River]] by [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792, along with the 1804-1806 [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] to [[Oregon Country]], and runs until circa 1890 when railroads and urban centers created a more settled state.

==Territory==
At the beginning of the pioneer period the Oregon Country was the homeland of numerous tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest|Native Americans]]. Regardless, portions of the area were claimed by the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], [[Spain]], and [[Russia]]. From 1818 to the mid-19th century, several treaties were signed that would set the current political boundaries. In 1818, the United States and Great Britain signed the [[Treaty of 1818]] that led to what has been termed a "joint occupation" of the Oregon Country.&lt;ref name=wsu&gt;[http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/holland/masc/PNWTimeline.htm Historical Timeline of Events Leading to the formation of Washington State.] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6939xOSkW?url=http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/holland/masc/PNWTimeline.htm |date=2012-07-10 }} Washington State University, accessed October 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1818 the U.S. resolved its claims with Spain regarding the western [[Louisiana Purchase]] lands, limiting Spanish claims to colonial [[Alta California]] south of the 42nd degree of latitude. This was followed by the [[Russo-American Treaty]] in 1825 that removed all remaining [[Russian-American Company]] claims south of 54' 40" (previously resolved with the British, regarding claims with Great Britain only). The remaining [[Oregon boundary dispute|territorial conflict]] between British and U.S. claims continued until 1846 when the [[Oregon Treaty]] settled the boundary issue with the 49th degree of latitude set as the international boundary between the United States and Britain's North American possessions.&lt;ref name=wsu/&gt; However, due to some ambiguity in the treaty, future conflict did arise and ended with the bloodless [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] over the [[San Juan Islands]].
         
The portion that became part of the United States in 1846 remained unorganized until Congress created the [[Oregon Territory]] in August 1848.&lt;ref name=wsu/&gt; In 1853, the northern boundary of the current state of Oregon was defined, with roughly half of the original Oregon Territory becoming the [[Washington Territory]].&lt;ref name=wsu/&gt; The boundaries were finalized for Oregon upon entering the Union as the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. The remaining northeastern portion of the territory became part of the Washington Territory.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, [[Idaho Territory]] was created from the eastern section of the Washington Territory, with other former eastern portions of the Oregon Territory becoming parts of [[Montana Territory]] and [[Wyoming Territory]].&lt;ref name=wsu/&gt; Washington became a state in 1889, followed by Idaho in 1890.&lt;ref name=wsu/&gt;

===Government===
{{further|Champoeg Meetings|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Territory}}
Various Native American tribes inhabited the region at the beginning of the pioneer settlement period. Each tribe had their own forms of government, but no modern nation existed. The first formal government in the region came in the form of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], who were granted the authority by their charter to in effect rule over the region's British subjects. Thus the HBC was the de facto government for much of the region until U.S. settlers eventually outnumbered the British in the region.&lt;ref name=Horner&gt;Horner, John B. (1919). ''Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature''. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1841 with the death of [[Ewing Young]], settlers in the [[Willamette Valley]] held a series of meetings at [[Champoeg, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Eventually, in 1843 the majority of participants voted to create a government to rule over the pioneers until the boundary question would be settled. This temporary government had a supreme judge, a [[Provisional Legislature of Oregon|legislature]], and at first an [[Executive Committee (Oregon Country)|executive committee]] followed later by a governor.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; This government remained in control of portions of the region until 1849 when the United States' territorial government arrived.

Beginning in 1849, the [[Oregon Territorial Legislature]] began meeting and passing laws, with the Provisional Government's laws remaining in effect unless a new law was passed (except a law allowing for minting of money that was set aside by the first territorial governor).&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt; In 1857, the people of the territory passed a resolution to hold a convention to draft a constitution in order to achieve statehood. The [[Oregon Constitutional Convention]] was held in Salem during the summer of 1857, and created Oregon's first [[Oregon Constitution|constitution]].&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt; Oregon submitted the constitution to Congress, and on February 14, 1859, Oregon became a state.&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt;

==Economy==

===Fur trade===
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] helped expand interest in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name=bb1&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/pre-land.aspx Oregon Blue Book: Oregon History: Land-based Fur Trade and Exploration]&lt;/ref&gt; Although seaborne traders had been engaged in the [[fur trade]] along the coastline for many years, Lewis and Clark's news and descriptions of the region spurred others in the United States to seek fortunes in the fur trade business in [[Oregon Country]].&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; The first Americans to return were members of [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[Pacific Fur Company]] as part of an [[Astor Expedition|expedition]] that established [[Fort Astoria]] at the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] in 1811.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; However, some of the first British traders overland include members of the [[North West Company]] that crossed the Rocky Mountains in 1808 and traveled down what they named the [[Fraser River]] in modern [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; The fur trade envisioned by the American Pacific Fur Company and put into practice by the North West Company, and later Hudson's Bay Company, was a triangular trade that sent furs to China, Chinese goods such as tea to England, and manufactured goods to the Pacific Northwest for trade with the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W. Meinig |title= The Great Columbia Plain |origyear= 1968 |edition= Weyerhaeuser Environmental Classic |year= 1995 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-97485-0 |page= 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813, during the [[War of 1812]], the Pacific Fur Company representatives at Fort Astoria sold the fort and all other company assets in Oregon to the British-owned North West Company. This happened under threat from a British warship and without the confirmation of John Jacob Astor. Fort Astoria was renamed Fort George. When Astor tried to regain the post, the British insisted their takeover was a business deal, not an act of war. Astor lost his investment.&lt;ref&gt;Emmerich, Alexander. ''John Jacob Astor. Der erfolgreichste deutsche Auswanderer''. Konrad Theiss Verlag: Stuttgart 2009, S. 143ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some years after the war, U.S. diplomats interpreted the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the war, as including the return of the fur trade post.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; Although returned to American ownership, the site of Fort Astoria was not reoccupied for many years. The North West Company built a new Fort George adjacent to the old one. In 1821 the North West Company and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] were merged by an act of Parliament with the name of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) retained for the combined entity.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; The HBC then named Dr. [[John McLoughlin]] as [[Chief Factor]] for the region the HBC called the [[Columbia District]] which encompassed much of the drainage of the Columbia River.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; In 1822 McLoughlin had a new post built near where the confluence of the [[Willamette River]] and the Columbia.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; On the north shore of the Columbia a new headquarters, [[Fort Vancouver]], became the centerpiece of a multi-post system where furs and supplies were funneled in and out of Fort Vancouver.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; Brigades of fur trappers would spend months in the wilderness trapping animals, then return with the pelts to fur posts such as [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]], [[Fort Umpqua]], [[Fort Walla Walla]], [[Fort Nisqually]], [[Fort Okanogan]], and [[Fort Boise]].&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; Later the HBC would start the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]] to supply food staples to the venture.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; By the 1830s the Hudson's Bay Company was worried about American expansion into the region and, in an attempt to forestall it, made a policy that fur trapping brigades operating south of the Columbia River, especially in the drainages of the Snake River and Willamette River, would work to create so-called "fur deserts", where beaver stocks were rapidly and deliberately depleted. This policy, although successful in making beaver rare in the Willamette Valley, did not prevent American settlement.

The next player in the fur trade was American [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]] who had made a fortune in the ice business in New England.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; In 1832 he led a new expedition to establish a fur trading empire through his new [[Pacific Trading Company]].&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; After returning from Oregon Country, Wyeth set out again in 1834 to set up the trading posts.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; His expedition established [[Fort Hall]] (on the [[Snake River]]) and [[Fort William (Oregon)|Fort William]] (on [[Sauvie Island|Wapatoo Island]]), but the venture was a failure due to the dominance of the HBC in the region and the [[American Fur Company]]'s control of the trade in the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; In 1836 Wyeth sold his two posts to the HBC.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt;

Beginning in the early 1840s the fur trade began to decline as fashion tastes shifted away from beaver pelt hats and the numbers of beavers declined due to [[over harvesting]].&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; Then beginning in the mid-1830s missionaries and settlers began to arrive in the region&lt;ref name=bb2&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/pre-souls.aspx Oregon Blue Book: Oregon History: Souls to Save]&lt;/ref&gt; Also the majority of the Native Americans in many areas were killed off by diseases introduced by Euro-Americans, including up to 70 percent in the [[Willamette Valley]] and Lower Columbia valley by 1830.&lt;ref name=bb2/&gt; Mass migration began in 1842 when a wagon train of around 100 wagons came overland along the [[Oregon Trail]].&lt;ref name=bb3&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/pre-overland.aspx Oregon Blue Book: Oregon History: Overland to Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846 McLoughlin retired from leading the HBC in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Lamb|first=W. Kaye.|author-link=William Kaye Lamb|title=McLoughlin, John |volume=VIII|url=http://www.biographi.ca/fr/bio/mcloughlin_john_8F.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1849 the [[United States Army]] arrived after the creation of the [[Oregon Territory]] and set up adjacent to Fort Vancouver.&lt;ref name=nps&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fova/historyculture/introduction-to-the-village.htm NPS: Fort Vancouver: Introduction to the Village]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1860 the Hudson's Bay Company closed the fort and withdrew to [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]], essentially ending the systematic fur trade in the region.&lt;ref name=nps/&gt;

===Transportation===
Early travel to the region was mainly by ship, with overland transportation developing later. By the 1830s a steady stream of travelers entered Oregon from the south through California and from the east over the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Many of these people were involved with the fur trade and would use the well worn trails of the Native Americans. Travel overland was mainly by horse, mule, and foot until the later 1830s when wagons slowly worked their way into the region. The [[Oregon Trail]] began seeing [[Oregon Trail#Great Migration of 1843|mass migration involving wagon trains in 1843]]. Boats were used extensively to haul cargo in the region, including steamboats, with the [[SS Beaver]] as the first steamboat in Oregon.&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt;

As more settlers arrived in the area, further transportation infrastructure was developed. Roads such as the [[Barlow Road]], [[Canyon Road]], and the [[Applegate Trail]] were created and small bridges built.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; [[Historic ferries of Oregon|Ferries]] also began to appear in the 1840s at many river crossings in the region.&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt; As the population grew, steamboats began regular service on the rivers, and later railroads were developed. The [[Oregon Steam Navigation Company]] and other smaller carriers developed transportation networks. The first railroad came in 1858 with the Cascade Railroad Company operating a line in the [[Columbia River Gorge]], followed by the [[Oregon and California Railroad]] and eventually connections to the transcontinental rail lines in 1883.&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt;

In 1873, at [[Willamette Falls]] a lock and canal were completed to allow vessels to pass the waterfall and continue upriver on the [[Willamette River]].&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Construction on a lock to bypass a set of cascades on the [[Columbia River]] began in 1878, but were not completed until 1896.&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt; Other canals were also built, including the [[Tualatin Canal]] at Oswego Lake. In 1887, the [[Morrison Bridge]] was completed as the first bridge over the Willamette River in Portland.

===Other activities===
In January 1837, thirteen pioneer settlers formed the [[Willamette Cattle Company]] to travel to Mexican-owned [[California]] and purchase cattle. The settlers were urged on by [[United States Navy]] officer [[William A. Slacum]], who was on a mission from the United States President. Slacum provided some financing and the transportation to California aboard the vessel ''[[Loriot (ship)|Loriot]]''. The settlers were led by American [[Ewing Young]], with others such as [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] of the [[Methodist Mission]] and [[John McLoughlin]] of the Hudson's Bay Company providing additional investment.

Young led a small group to California, sailing from the [[Willamette River]] to [[San Francisco Bay]]. There the group procured about 630 head of cattle, which they drove north to the [[Willamette Valley]]. In Oregon, the cattle were divided between the investors, making Young one of the richest settlers in Oregon and helping to break the dependence of the settlers on the cattle of the HBC.

Although the Willamette Cattle Company brought some cattle to Oregon Country, the demand exceeded the supply. Beginning in 1840, another group of pioneers began building a ship to sail south to California where they would trade the ship for more livestock. This [[Star of Oregon (event)|operation]] ended in 1843 when the group returned to the Willamette Valley settlements with a variety of livestock. They left California with 1,250 head of cattle, 600 horses and mules, and 3,000 sheep.

'''Pioneer P-31''' (also known as Atlas-Able 5B or Pioneer Z) was intended to be a lunar orbiter probe, but the mission failed shortly after launch. The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit, to investigate the environment between the [[Earth]] and [[Moon]], and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and [[topography]] of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of [[micrometeorite]]s, and study [[radiation]], [[magnetic field]]s, and low frequency [[electromagnetic wave]]s in space. A midcourse propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first [[United States]] self-contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from Earth and the first U.S. tests of maneuvering a satellite in space.

==Mission==

The spacecraft was launched on Atlas vehicle 91D coupled to Thor-Able upper stages including an Able solid propellant third stage on December 15, 1960. The launch was uneventful until T+66 seconds when a severe axial disturbance was recorded, followed by rapid loss of LOX tank pressure and changes in the Atlas's engine exhaust indicative of oxidizer starvation. At T+73 seconds, the Atlas experienced total structural breakup and loss of telemetry. The upper stages continued transmitting data until impact with the ocean. The payload fell into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 12 to 20&amp;nbsp;km (7 to 12 miles) from [[Cape Canaveral]] in about 20 meter (65 feet) deep water. A Navy salvage operation recovered parts of the launch vehicle and the payload. The immediate cause of the failure was unclear, but thought to be related to either the adapter mating the Able stages to the Atlas coming loose and being rammed into the LOX tank or else aerodynamic buffeting on the launch vehicle. The recovered Able second stage showed no sign that engine ignition or operation had taken place, and the most probable cause of the failure was believed to be aerodynamic flexing of the Able adapter which then ruptured the Atlas's LOX tank. The crippled booster continued to fly for a few seconds afterwards, but the structural collapse of the Atlas's forward section combined with the loss of LOX pressure to the propellant feed system resulted in engine shutdown and vehicle self-destruction.

As a result of this failure and [[Mercury-Atlas 1]] five months earlier due to a similar episode of aerodynamic bending in the forward portion of the LOX tank, GD/A began requiring that all Atlas upper stage/payload combinations undergo proper structural dynamics testing.&lt;ref&gt;"Missile 91D Flight Evaluation Report", January 14, 1961 Convair&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure was described as "especially disappointing" since it was the final launch in the Able probe series as its successor, the Ranger program, was in the works. In the end, the US space program would not see a completely successful lunar probe until [[Ranger 7]] four years later. It also marked the final launch in the first generation of lunar probes, which used direct ascent trajectories and would give way to the second generation probes which had parking orbits.

==Spacecraft design==

Pioneer P-31 was virtually identical to the earlier [[Pioneer P-30]] satellite which failed, a 1-meter diameter sphere with a propulsion system mounted on the bottom giving a total length of 1.4 meters. The mass of the structure and aluminum alloy shell was about 30&amp;nbsp;kg and the propulsion units roughly 90&amp;nbsp;kg. Four solar panels, each 60 x 60&amp;nbsp;cm and containing 2200 solar cells in 22 100-cell nodules, extended from the sides of the spherical shell in a "paddle-wheel" configuration with a total span of about 2.7 meters. The solar panels charged [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]]. Inside the shell, a large spherical hydrazine tank made up most of the volume, topped by two smaller spherical nitrogen tanks and a 90 N injection rocket to slow the spacecraft down to go into lunar orbit, which was designed to be capable of firing twice during the mission. Attached to the bottom of the sphere was a 90 N vernier rocket for mid-course propulsion and lunar orbit maneuvers which could be fired four times.

Around the upper hemisphere of the hydrazine tank was a ring-shaped instrument platform which held the batteries in two packs, two 1.5 W [[UHF]] transmitters and diplexers, logic modules for scientific instruments, two command receivers, decoders, a buffer/amplifier, three converters, a telebit, a command box, and most of the scientific instruments. Two dipole UHF antennas protruded from the top of the sphere on either side of the injection rocket nozzle. Two dipole UHF antennas and a long VLF antenna protruded from the bottom of the sphere. The transmitters operated on a frequency of 378&amp;nbsp;MHz.

Thermal control was planned to be achieved by 50 small "propeller blade" devices on the surface of the sphere. The blades themselves were made of reflective material and consisted of four vanes which were flush against the surface, covering a black heat-absorbing pattern painted on the sphere. A thermally sensitive coil was attached to the blades in such a way that low temperatures within the satellite would cause the coil to contract and rotate the blades and expose the heat absorbing surface, and high temperatures would cause the blades to cover the black patterns. Square heat-sink units were also mounted on the surface of the sphere to help dissipate heat from the interior.

== On-board equipment ==

The scientific instruments consisted of an [[ion chamber]] and [[Geiger-Müller tube]] to measure total [[radiation flux]], a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a scintillation counter to monitor low-energy radiation, a [[scintillation spectrometer]] to study the Earth's (and possible lunar) [[radiation belt]]s, a VLF receiver for natural [[radio wave]]s, a transponder to study electron density, and part of the flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. A plasma probe was mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares. The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere as well. The only difference between Pioneer P-31 and the earlier Pioneer P-30 was the addition of a solid state detector sensitive to low energy protons on the satellite and an STL-designed rubidium frequency standard experiment placed on a pod attached to the booster. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly 60&amp;nbsp;kg. Total cost of the mission was estimated at 9–10 million dollars.

This value was challenged by a 2010 experiment utilizing a third method, which produced a radius about 5% smaller than this.&lt;ref name="Pohl"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pohl R, Antognini A, Nez F, Amaro FD, Biraben F, Cardoso JM, Covita DS, Dax A, Dhawan S, Fernandes LM, Giesen A, Graf T, Hänsch TW, Indelicato P, Julien L, Kao C, Knowles P, Le Bigot E, Liu Y, Lopes JA, Ludhova L, Monteiro CM, Mulhauser F, Nebel T, Rabinowitz P, dos Santos JM, Schaller LA, Schuhmann K, Schwob C, Taqqu D, Veloso JF, Kottman F |display-authors=1 |date=July 2010 |title=The size of the proton |url=http://www.quantum.physik.uni-potsdam.de/teaching/ss2015/pqt/Pohl2010.pdf |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=466 |issue=7303 |pages=213–216 |doi=10.1038/nature09250 |bibcode=2010Natur.466..213P |pmid=20613837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy remains unresolved, and is a topic of ongoing research.

==Problem==
Prior to 2010, the proton radius was measured using one of two methods: one relying on spectroscopy, and one relying on nuclear scattering.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nature.com/news/proton-size-puzzle-deepens-1.22760|title=Proton-size puzzle deepens|publisher=Nature|date=5 October 2017|author=Davide Castelvecchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectroscopy method===
The spectroscopy method uses the energy levels of electrons orbiting the nucleus. The exact values of the energy levels is sensitive to the nuclear radius (see [[Lamb Shift]]). For hydrogen, whose nuclei consists only of one proton, this indirectly measures the proton radius. Measurements of hydrogen's energy levels are now so precise that the proton radius is the limiting factor when comparing experimental results to theoretical calculations. This method produces a proton radius of about {{val|8.768|0.069|e=-16|u=m}} (or {{val|0.8768|0.0069|ul=fm}}), with approximately 1% relative uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Pohl" /&gt;

===Nuclear scattering===
The nuclear method is similar to [[Rutherford scattering|Rutherford's scattering experiments]] that established the existence of the nucleus. Small particles such as electrons can be fired at a proton, and by measuring how the electrons are scattered, the size of the proton can be inferred. Consistent with the spectroscopy method, this produces a proton radius of about {{val|8.775|0.005|e=-16|u=m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sick I, Trautmann D |year=2014 |title=Proton root-mean-square radii and electron scattering |journal=[[Physical Review C]] |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages= 012201 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.89.012201|arxiv=1407.1676 |bibcode=2014PhRvC..89a2201S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 experiment===
In 2010, Pohl et al. published the results of an experiment relying on [[muonic hydrogen]] as opposed to normal hydrogen. Conceptually, this is similar to the spectroscopy method. However, the much higher mass of a muon causes it to orbit 207 times closer than an electron to the hydrogen nucleus, where it is consequently much more sensitive to the size of the proton. The resulting radius was recorded as {{val|0.842|0.001|u=fm}}, 5 [[standard deviations]] (5σ) smaller than the prior measurements.&lt;ref name="Pohl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phys"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=November 26, 2013 |title=Proton radius puzzle may be solved by quantum gravity |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-11-proton-radius-puzzle-quantum-gravity.html |newspaper=[[Phys.org]] |access-date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly measured radius is 4% smaller than the prior measurements, which were believed to be accurate within 1%. (The new measurement's uncertainty limit of only 0.1% makes a negligible contribution to the discrepancy.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlson CE |date=May 2015 |title=The proton radius puzzle |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |volume=82 |pages=59–77 |arxiv=1502.05314 |bibcode=2015PrPNP..82...59C |doi=10.1016/j.ppnp.2015.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, additional measurements using electrons have slightly reduced the estimated radius to {{val|8.751|0.061|e=-16|u=m}} ({{val|0.8751|0.0061|u=[[femtometre|fm]]}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CODATA Internationally recommended 2014 values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: Proton RMS charge radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rp}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by reducing the uncertainty even more the disagreement has worsened to over 7σ.

A follow-up experiment by Pohl et al. in August 2016 used a [[deuterium]] atom to create muonic deuterium and measured the deuteron radius. This experiment allowed the measurements to be 2.7 times more accurate, but also found a discrepancy of 7.5 standard deviations smaller than the expected value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pohl R, Nez F, Fernandes LM, Amaro FD, Biraben F, Cardoso JM, Covita DS, Dax A, Dhawan S, Diepold M, Giesen A, Gouvea AL, Graf T, Hänsch TW, Indelicato P, Julien L, Knowles P, Kottmann F, Le Bigot E, Liu Y, Lopes JA, Ludhova L, Monteiro CM, Mulhauser F, Nebel T, Rabinowitz P, dos Santos JM, Schaller LA, Schuhmann K, Schwob C, Taqqu D, Veloso JF, Antognini A |display-authors=1 |year=2016 |title=Laser spectroscopy of muonic deuterium |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=353 |issue=6300 |pages=669–673 |doi=10.1126/science.aaf2468 |bibcode=2016Sci...353..669P |pmid=27516595 |url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~kirkmcd/examples/EP/pohl_science_353_669_16.pdf|hdl=10316/80061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Proton-radius puzzle deepens |journal=CERN Courier |date=16 September 2016 |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/66149|quote=After our first study came out in 2010, I was afraid some veteran physicist would get in touch with us and point out our great blunder. But the years have passed, and so far nothing of the kind has happened.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Pohl's group performed yet another experiment, this time using hydrogen atoms that had been excited by two different lasers. By measuring the energy released when the excited electrons fell back to lower-energy states, the [[Rydberg constant]] could be calculated, and from this the proton radius inferred. The result is again ~5% smaller than the generally-accepted proton radius.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen, doi.org/10.1126/science.aah6677&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed resolutions==
The anomaly remains unresolved and is an active area of research. There is as yet no conclusive reason to doubt the validity of the old data.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; The immediate concern is for other groups to reproduce the anomaly.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; 

The uncertain nature of the experimental evidence has not stopped theorists from attempting to explain the conflicting results. Among the postulated explanations are the [[three-body force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karr J, Hilico L |year=2012 |title=Why Three-Body Physics Does Not Solve the Proton-Radius Puzzle |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=109 |issue=10 |pages= 103401 |arxiv=1205.0633 |bibcode=2012PhRvL.109j3401K |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.103401 |pmid=23005286}}&lt;/ref&gt; interactions between gravity and the [[weak force]] or a [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]-dependent interaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Onofrio R |year=2013 |title=Proton radius puzzle and quantum gravity at the Fermi scale |journal=[[EPL (journal)|EPL]] |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages= 20002 |arxiv=1312.3469 |bibcode=2013EL....10420002O |doi=10.1209/0295-5075/104/20002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phys"/&gt; [[dimension (physics)|higher dimension]] gravity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dahia F, Lemos AS |year=2016 |title=Is the proton radius puzzle evidence of extra dimensions? |journal=[[European Physical Journal]] |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=435 |arxiv=1509.08735 |bibcode=2016EPJC...76..435D |doi=10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-4266-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new [[boson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Y, McKeen D, Miller GA |year=2016 |title=Electrophobic Scalar Boson and Muonic Puzzles |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=117 |issue=10 |pages= 101801 |arxiv=1605.04612 |bibcode=2016PhRvL.117j1801L |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.101801 |pmid=27636468}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the quasi-free {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lestone, JP|url=|title="Muonic atom Lamb shift via simple means", Los Alamos Report LA-UR-17-29148|date=4 October 2017|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory}} According to the report, “Muonic hydrogen (μp) and muonic deuterium (μd) Lamb shifts can be obtained to better than 1% via simple methods. The smallness of the muon fuzziness suggests that the associated Lamb shifts need to be calculated including some aspects of the internal degrees of freedom of the proton. If the charge of the proton is assumed to be contained within a quasi-free [[Pion|{{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}}]] for half of the time, then the calculated μp and μd Lamb shifts are consistent with experiment without any need for a change in the proton radius. ... As a simple approximation, we here assume that the proton can be thought of as spending approximately half its time as a neutron with a nearby quasi-free {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}} with an inertia of approximately 140 MeV.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Randolf Pohl, the original investigator of the puzzle, stated that while it would be "fantastic" if the puzzle led to a discovery, the most likely explanation is not new physics but some measurement artefact. His personal assumption is that past measurements have misgauged the [[Rydberg constant]] and that the current official proton size is inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |date=August 11, 2016 |title=New Measurement Deepens Proton Puzzle |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160811-new-measurement-deepens-proton-radius-puzzle/ |newspaper=[[Quanta Magazine]] |access-date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one of the most recent attempts of resolve the puzzle without new physics, Alarcón, et al. (2018), at Jefferson Labs, have proposed that a different technique to fit the experimental scattering data to a conclusion regarding the proton charge radius that gives more weight to a larger number of higher energy data points in an analytically well justified manner produces a proton charge radius determination from the existing electron scattering data that is consistent with the muonic hydrogen measurement.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Alarcón, D. Higinbotham, C. Weiss, Z. Ye, "Proton charge radius extraction from electron scattering data using dispersively improved chiral effective field theory" (September 17, 2018). https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06373&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, this approach attributes the cause of the proton radius puzzle to a failure to account for significant theoretical uncertainty introduced in previous determinations by the process used to fit the experimental observations made to a determination of the proton charge radius. Other investigators have suggested that the analysis used for the electron based proton charge radius may not be properly considering the rest frames of the different components of the experiments in light of special relativity.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Giannini, E. Santopinto, "On the proton radius problem" (1 Nov 2013) https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Robson, "Solution to the Proton Radius Problem" (27 Jan 2015) https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4552&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration of polarization factors in the muonic hydrogen case that aren't material in ordinary hydrogen has also been proposed as a possible solution.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Pineda, "Brief review of the theory of the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift and the proton radius" (5 Aug 2011)https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1263&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to [[Argentina]] in 1992, she began a project to understand how plants are affected by environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="elsevier.com"/&gt; Chan's team of scientific researchers created more drought resistant seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blankstein | first=A.M. | last2=Noguera | first2=P. | title=Excellence Through Equity: Five Principles of Courageous Leadership to Guide Achievement for Every Student | publisher=SAGE Publications | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-4833-9285-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtW5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT206 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About her work Chan stated, {{quote|(The creation of more drought-resistant seed) was a very long process of basic research with research groups were changing over time. It was a day and Eureka! It was like the discovery of Newton when the apple fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2013/10/130930_ciencia_mujeres_cientificas_mr|title=10 mujeres que lideran la ciencia en América Latina|work=BBC Mundo|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Supporters of the technology say the boost in productivity could mean as much as $10 billion in added profits each year, particularly after a severe drought recently slashed Argentina's soy output by more than a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-04-drought-resistant-argentine-soy.html|title=Drought-resistant Argentine soy raises hopes, concerns|work=phys.org|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="789">'''Special Engineer Detachment''' (SED) was a [[US Army]] program that identified enlisted personnel with technical skills, such as machining, or who had some science education beyond high school. Those identified were organized into the Special Engineer Detachment, or SED. SED personnel began arriving at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in October 1943. By August 1945, 1800 SED personnel worked at Los Alamos. These troops worked in all areas and activities of the Laboratory, including the [[Trinity Test]], and were involved in overseas operations on [[Tinian]].

A '''statistician''' is a person who works with theoretical or applied [[statistics]]. The profession exists in both the [[private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as [[statistical consultant]]s.&lt;ref name=ONET&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-2041.00 |title=O*NET OnLine: 15-2041.00 - Statisticians  |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statslife.org.uk/careers/types-of-job |title=Royal Statistical Society StatsLife Types of Job |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the work==
According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], as of 2014, 26,970 jobs were classified as ''statistician'' in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30 percent worked for governments (federal, state, or local).&lt;ref name=bls&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/statisticians.htm |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor  |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2016-17 |title=Statisticians |accessdate=30 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2016, the median pay for statisticians in the United States was $80,500.&lt;ref name=bls/&gt;  Additionally, there is a substantial number of people who use statistics and data analysis in their work but have job titles other than ''statistician'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |title=Statisticians |deadurl=y |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232329/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011 |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2010-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Actuary|actuaries]], [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]], [[economist]]s, data scientists, data analysts (predictive analytics) [[financial analyst]]s, [[psychometrician]]s, [[sociologist]]s, [[epidemiologist]]s, and [[Quantitative psychology|quantitative psychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |title=Statisticians |author=Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor |work=Occupational Outlook Handbook |edition=2006-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001105634/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos045.htm |archivedate=1 October 2007 |accessdate=3 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statisticians are included with the [[profession|professions]] in various national and international occupational classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/docs/resol08.pdf |title=International Labour Organisation (ILO) International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) ISCO-08 classification structure |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=122372&amp;CVD=122374&amp;CPV=21&amp;CST=01012011&amp;CLV=2&amp;MLV=4 |title=Canadian National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 21 - Professional occupations in natural and applied sciences |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BLS, "Overall employment is projected to grow 33% from 2016 to 2026, much faster than average for all occupations. Businesses will need these workers to analyze the increasing volume of digital and electronic data."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/mathematicians-and-statisticians.htm|title=Mathematicians and Statisticians :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States most employment in the field requires either a [[masters degree]] in statistics or a related field or a [[PhD]].&lt;ref name=ONET/&gt; "Typical work includes collaborating with scientists, providing mathematical modeling, simulations, designing randomized experiments and randomized sampling plans, analyzing experimental or survey results, and forecasting future events (such as sales of a product)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bulletin.imstat.org/2014/10/ims-presidential-address-let-us-own-data-science/ |title=IMS Presidential Address: Let us own Data Science, 1 October 2014, News of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1996">[[File:Reef Aquarium New Sump.jpg|thumb|A sump with three compartments including a [[protein skimmer]]]]

In [[fishkeeping]], a '''sump''' is an accessory [[aquarium]] tank in which mechanical equipment is kept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saltaquarium.about.com/cs/bcorsettingup/a/aa020298sumps.htm What is a Sump and Do You Need One for a Saltwater Aquarium?], by Stan &amp; Debbie Hauter, in [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2003-01/gt/index.php Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sumps] by Gregory S. Taylor, a complete three-part article in Reefkeeping Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; A remote sump allows for a clutter-free display tank.

It is found mainly in a [[reef aquarium]] or [[marine aquarium]]. The sump sits below, behind, or (less typically) on a support above the main tank, and is used as a [[Filter (aquarium)|filter]], as well as a holding place for unsightly, miscellaneous equipment such as [[protein skimmer]]s, [[calcium reactor]]s, and [[Heater (aquarium)|heaters]]. The main advantage of having a sump plumbed into an aquarium is the increase of water volume in the system, making it more stable and less prone to fluctuations of [[pH]] and [[salinity]], and also mitigating the effects of nutrient buildup or the unintentional introduction of foreign substances. In addition, some sumps have a compartment that can be converted into a [[Refugium (fishkeeping)|refugium]], helping to filter out excess nutrients such as [[nitrate]]s.

A sump can also improve aeration of the water in the aquarium. Water movement between the sump and the display tank helps with gas exchange between the water and air. Increased [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] is beneficial to fish and can also aid in avoiding ''[[Cyanobacteria]]'' outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madhattersreef.com/the-benefits-of-an-aquarium-sump/ The Benefits of an Aquarium Sump] by Jeff Hesketh&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:V-3.cannon-installations.Miedzyzdroje.2.JPG|thumb|Remains of V-3 in Zalesie near [[Misdroy]], [[Wolin]] Island, [[Poland]] (2008)]]

The '''V-3''' ({{lang-de|[[V-weapons|Vergeltungswaffe]] 3}}, "Retribution Weapon 3") was a German [[World War II]] [[supergun]] working on the multi-charge principle whereby secondary propellant charges are fired to add velocity to a projectile.

The weapon was planned to be used to bombard London from two large [[bunkers]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region of northern France, but they were rendered unusable by Allied bombing raids before completion. Two similar guns were used to bombard [[Luxembourg]] from December 1944 to February 1945.

The V-3 was also known as the ''Hochdruckpumpe'' ("High Pressure Pump," HDP for short), which was a [[code name]] intended to hide the real purpose of the project. It was also known as ''Fleißiges Lieschen'' ("[[Impatiens_walleriana|Busy Lizzie]]").&lt;ref name=nat-military-museum&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/museumspecial.php|title=The V3 weapon system (HDP), "High pressure pump" or "Centipede"|work=Current museum specials &amp; news|accessdate=24 December 2007|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822160622/http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/museumspecial.php|archive-date=22 August 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} (bottom of page)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The gun used multiple propellant charges placed along the barrel's length and timed to fire as soon as the projectile passed them in order to provide an additional boost. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] boosters were used instead of [[explosive]] charges because of their greater suitability and ease of use. These were arranged in symmetrical pairs along the length of the barrel, angled to project their thrust against the base of the projectile as it passed. This layout spawned the  German codename ''Tausendfüßler'' ("[[millipede]]"). The barrel and side chambers were designed as identical sections to simplify production and allow damaged sections to be replaced. The entire gun would use multiple such sections bolted together. The [[smoothbore]] gun fired a fin-stabilized shell that depended upon aerodynamic forces rather than [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] forces to prevent tumbling (distinct from conventional [[rifling|rifled]] weapons which cause the projectile to spin); this resulted in a lower [[drag coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = V-3 | work = | publisher =Astronautix |website=www.astronautix.com | url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/v3.htm | doi = | accessdate =11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The origin of the multi-chamber gun dates back to the 19th century. In 1857, U.S. arms expert [[Azel Storrs Lyman]] (1815–1885) was granted a patent on ''"Improvement in accelerating fire-arms"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US| number = 16568| status =patent | title = Improvement in accelerating fire-arms | pubdate =3 February 1857 | gdate = | fdate = | pridate = | inventor = Azel Storrs Lyman| class =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he built a prototype in 1860 which proved to be unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Pal03"&gt;{{harvnb|Pallud|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyman"&gt;{{harvnb|Lyman Holley|1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyman then modified the design in collaboration with [[James Richard Haskell]], who had been working for years on the same principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US| number = 200740| status =patent | title = Improvement in accelerating guns | pubdate =26 February 1878 | gdate = | fdate = | pridate = | inventor = Azel Storrs Lyman| class =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harkel"&gt;{{cite patent | country = US| number =241978 | status =patent | title =Accelerating gun | pubdate =24 May 1881 | gdate = | pridate = | inventor =James Richard Haskell | class =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haskell and Lyman reasoned that subsidiary propellant charges could increase the muzzle velocity of a projectile if the charges were spaced at intervals along the barrel of a gun in side chambers and ignited an instant after a shell had passed them. The "Lyman-Haskell multi-charge gun" was constructed on the instructions of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[Chief of Ordnance]], but it did not resemble a conventional artillery piece. The barrel was so long that it had to be placed on an inclined ramp, and it had pairs of chambers angled back at 45 degrees discharging into it. It was test fired at the Frankford Arsenal at [[Philadelphia]] in 1880 and was unsuccessful. The flash from the original propellant charge bypassed the projectile due to faulty [[obturation]] and prematurely ignited the subsidiary charges before the shell passed them, slowing the shell down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|United States Army&amp;nbsp;— Ordnance Dept|1884|pp =232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|United States Army&amp;nbsp;— Ordnance Dept|1884|pp =16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best velocity that could be obtained from it was {{convert|335|m/s|ft/s}}, inferior to the performance of a conventional [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun]] of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hogg|2002|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; New prototypes of multi-charge guns were built and tested,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New York Times|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birnie|1907|pp=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lyman and Haskell abandoned the idea.&lt;ref name="lyman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bull|2004|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, French engineer [[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux]], one of the pioneers of the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede|motorcycle]], had been working on a similar project since before 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ginisty|1884|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perreaux was granted a patent in 1864 for a multi-chamber gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = FR| number = 65571| status =patent |title = Système de charge à longue portée pour arme de chasse, de guerre et grosse artillerie de terre et de mer dit Canon Perreaux | pubdate =20 December 1864 | gdate = | fdate = | pridate = | inventor =Louis-Guillaume Perreaux| class =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, Perreaux presented his invention at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|World Exhibition of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|L'artillerie à l'exposition de 1878|1879|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the French Army made plans for a very long range multi-chamber gun in response to the German [[Paris Gun]]. The Paris Gun was built by [[Krupp|Friedrich Krupp AG]] and could bombard [[Paris]] from German lines over a distance of no less than {{convert|125|km}}. However, the French initiative did not reach the prototype stage, as it was discontinued when the retreat of the German armies and the armistice put an end to the bombardment. The plans for the multi-chamber gun were archived, as they had been envisioned to counter the German fire.&lt;ref&gt;In 1938, a Czech named Tugendhat rediscovered the concept and tried to sell his ''"Multiplex Gun"'' proposal to the British, but they turned him down. ({{cite book|last=Fitzsimons|first=Bernard|title=The Illustrated encyclopedia of 20th century weapons and warfare|year=1979|publisher=Purnell Reference Books|location=Milwaukee |isbn=978-0-8393-6175-6|page=1566|volume=14}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

France collapsed in June 1940 at the beginning of World War II, and German troops acquired the plans of this long-range gun.&lt;ref name="Pal03"/&gt; In 1942, this patent attracted the attention of [[August Coenders|August Cönders]],&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;August Cönders is often incorrectly considered the inventor of the multi-chamber gun.&lt;/ref&gt; developer of the [[Röchling shell]] and chief engineer of the plants "Röchling Stahlwerk AG" in [[Wetzlar]], Germany. Cönders thought that the gradual acceleration of the shell by a series of small charges spread over the length of the barrel might be the solution to the problem of designing very long range guns. The very strong explosive charge needed to project shells at a high speed were causing very rapid degradation of the gun tubes of conventional guns.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;For example, in 1918, the tube of the [[Paris Gun]] needed to be changed after only 65 shots. Moreover, the shells had to be made in progressively larger diameter to compensate for wear of the tube, and were numbered from 1 to 65 to be used in the correct order. ({{harvnb|Pallud|2003}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Cönders proposed the use of electrically activated charges to eliminate the problem of the premature ignition of the subsidiary charges, the problem experienced by the Lyman-Haskell gun. Cönders built a prototype of a 20&amp;nbsp;mm multi-chamber gun using machinery readily available at the Wetzlar plant, machinery that was producing tubes of this caliber for the [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns of 20 mm]].&lt;ref name="Pal03"/&gt; The first tests were encouraging, but to get the support of the Ministry of arms, [[Hermann Röchling]] had to present to [[Albert Speer]] Cönders' project of a cannon capable of firing on London from the coast of the Pas-de-Calais. The project intended to use two batteries to crush London under a barrage of hundreds of shells per hour, shells of {{convert|140|kg}} with an explosive charge of {{convert|25|kg}}.

Speer told [[Adolf Hitler]] about the proposal in May 1943. After the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombed the [[Peenemünde]] rocket center on 17 August, Hitler agreed to Speer's suggestion that the gun be built without more tests.&lt;ref name="ley196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cönders constructed a full-calibre gun at the [[Hillersleben]] proving ground near [[Magdeburg]] but, by the end of 1943, he had encountered severe problems both in putting the gun's basic principle into operation and in producing a feasible design for the shells that it was to fire. Even when everything worked, the muzzle velocity was just over {{convert|1000|m/s|ft/s}}, which was nowhere near what had been promised. Nonetheless, a proposal was made to build a single full-sized gun with a {{convert|150|m|ft|adj=on}} barrel at [[Misdroy]] on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] island of [[Wolin]], near Peenemünde, while construction went ahead at the Mimoyecques site in France (which had already been attacked by the [[USAAF]] and the RAF). The ''[[Waffenamt|Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Weapon Procurement Office) took control of the project by March 1944, with no good news from Misdroy, and Cönders became one of the engineers working on the three chief problems: projectile design, obturation, and ignition of the secondary charges.

Six different companies produced satisfactory designs for projectiles, including [[Krupp]] and [[Škoda Works]].  [[Obturate|Obturation]] problems were solved by placing a sealing [[piston]] between the projectile and the initial propellant charge, which in turn prevented the flash from the charge from getting ahead of the projectile and solved the problem of controlling the initiation of the secondary charges.&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|Ford|2000|pp=117–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of May 1944, there were four designs for the 150-mm finned projectile, one manufactured by [[Fasterstoff]] (designed by Füstenberg) and three others by [[Röchling]] (Cönders), [[Bochumer]] (Verein-Haack), and [[Witkowitz Ironworks]] (Athem).&lt;ref name=Irving&gt;{{harvnb|Irving|1964|pp=220, 245, 246, 247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trials were held at Misdroy from 20–24 May 1944 with ranges of up to {{convert|88|km|abbr=on}} being attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irving|1964|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 1944, the Misdroy gun was test-fired with 8 rounds (one of the {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} long shells travelled {{convert|93|km|abbr=on}}). The gun burst during the testing,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Irving|1964|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting an end to the tests.

==Mimoyecques site==
{{main article|Fortress of Mimoyecques}}
Major Bock of Festung Pioneer-Stab 27 (the fortification regiment of LVII Corps, [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fifteenth Army]], at the time based in the [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe area]]) was given the task of finding a suitable site for the HDP batteries following Hitler's decision that HDP guns should be sited in northern France to bombard London. A study in early 1943 concluded that a hill with a rock core would be most suitable, as the gun tubes could be placed in [[Drift mining|drifts]] (inclined tunnels) and support equipment and supplies located in adjacent tunnels. The guns would not be movable and would be permanently aimed at London.

A suitable site was selected at a [[limestone]] hill about {{convert|5|km|mi}} north of the [[Hidrequent]] quarries, near Mimoyecques in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region of northern France behind [[Cap Gris Nez]], very close to the French end of the present day [[Channel tunnel]], where [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] launch sites were already under construction. The site was {{convert|8|km|mi}} from the sea and {{convert|165|km|mi}} from London.&lt;ref name=lcdl&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Base v-3  une base pour bombarder londres | work = Les Canons De L'apocalypse | publisher = | url = http://html2.free.fr/canons/basev3.htm | doi = | accessdate =11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was code-named ''Wiese'' (meadow) and ''Bauvorhaben 711'' (Construction Project 711), and [[Organisation Todt]] began construction in September 1943 with the building of railway lines to support the work, and began to excavate the gun shafts in October.&lt;ref name=zaloga&gt;{{harvnb|Zaloga|Johnson|Taylor|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial layout comprised two parallel facilities approximately {{convert|1000|m|ft}} apart, each with five drifts which were to hold a stacked cluster of five HDP gun tubes, for a total of 50 guns. Both facilities were served by an underground railway tunnel and underground ammunition storage galleries.

The eastern complex consisted of five drifts angled at 50 degrees reaching {{convert|105|m|ft}} below the hilltop. The five drifts exited the hilltop through a concrete slab {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} thick. Large steel plates protected the five openings and each drift had a special armoured door. Extensive tunnels and elevator shafts supported the guns and, if the site had become operational, about 1,000 troops from Artillerie Abteilung 705 and supporting units would have been deployed at Mimoyecques. Artillerie Abteilung 705 had been organised in January 1944 under Oberstleutnant Georg Borttscheller to operate the Wiese gun complex.

The plans were to have the first battery of five gun tubes ready for March 1944, and the full complex of 25 gun tubes by 1 October 1944. A failure occurred, however, at the Misdroy proving ground in April 1944 after only 25 rounds had been fired and, as a result, the project was further cut back from five drifts to three, even though work had begun on some of the other drifts. The site was finally put out of commission on 6 July 1944, when bombers of [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]] (the famous "Dambusters") attacked using {{convert|5400|kg|lb|adj=on}} "[[Tallboy bomb|Tallboy]]" deep-penetration bombs.

==Luxembourg bombardment==
The project eventually came under the control of the SS, and SS General [[Hans Kammler]] ordered it to be ready for action in late 1944, assisted by [[Walter Dornberger]]. A battery was constructed of two shorter V-3 guns approximately {{convert|50|m|ft}} long with 12 side-chambers, and it was placed in the hands of the army artillery unit ''Artillerie Abteilung 705'' under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Patzig. These were sited in a wooded ravine of the [[Ruwer River]] at [[Lampaden]] about {{convert|13|km|mi}} southeast of [[Trier]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=luxem&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = The V3 weapon system (HDP), " High pressure pump " or " Centipede " | work = | publisher = National Museum of Military History | url = http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/museumspecial.php | doi = | accessdate =1 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822160622/http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/museumspecial.php|archivedate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two guns were aimed west, resting on 13 steel support structures on solid wooden bases on a 34 degree slope. The city of [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] (which had been liberated in September 1944) was at a range of about {{convert|43|km|mi}} and was designated Target No. 305. Concrete [[blockhouse]]s were constructed between the two gun tubes, as well as ten smaller bunkers to hold projectiles and propellant charges.

The assembly and mounting of the Lampaden guns coincided with the final preparations for the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. However, the supply of ammunition became problematic due to the state of the German railway network. Time had become critical, and it was decided to use a {{convert|150|mm|in|adj=on}} finned projectile with a discarding [[sabot]], weighing {{convert|95|kg|lb}} and carrying a {{convert|7|-|9|kg|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} explosive charge. The propellant comprised a {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} main charge and 24 subsidiary charges for a total of {{convert|73|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

By the time that the Ardennes offensive began on 16 December 1944, Kammler received orders from [[OB West]] (German Army Command in the West) to begin firing at the end of the month, and the first gun tube was ready for action on 30 December 1944. Two warm-up rounds were initially fired, followed by five high-explosive shells which were fired in sequence, attended by Kammler. The muzzle velocity was approximately {{convert|935|m/s|ft/s}}.

The second gun tube was brought into operation on 11 January 1945 and some 183 rounds in total were fired until 22 February 1945, with 44 confirmed hits in the urban area. The guns were not particularly effective; from the 142 rounds that struck Luxembourg, total casualties were 10 dead and 35 wounded.

==Fate==
One of the two Lampaden guns was dismantled on 15 February,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=V3 position in Hermeskeil-lamps |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lostplaces.de%2Fcms%2Fcontent%2Fview%2F94%2F33%2F&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8 |accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and firing ceased on 22 February, when [[United States Army|US Army]] units had advanced to within {{convert|3|km|mi}} of the Lampaden site.

A second battery of guns began to be deployed in January 1945 at [[Buhl, Haut-Rhin|Buhl]], aimed at [[Belfort]] in support of the [[Operation Nordwind]] offensive. One gun was erected before the failure of the Nordwind offensive put the site at risk, and the equipment was removed before firing could begin.

There were other proposals to deploy batteries to bombard [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Antwerp]] and other cities but these were not implemented due to the poor state of the German railway network and a lack of ammunition. All four HDP guns were eventually abandoned at the Röchling works in [[Wetzlar]] and Artillerie Abteilung 705 was re-equipped with conventional artillery.&lt;ref name="zaloga"/&gt; The disassembled gun tubes, spare parts, and remaining ammunition were later captured by the US Army and shipped to the United States where they were tested and evaluated at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], and finally scrapped there in 1948.&lt;ref name=luxem/&gt;

==V-3 museum==
The Mimoyecques museum allows visitors to view the galleries (in various stages of construction and bombing damage), remains of the guns, a small scale V-3 replica, and examples of machinery, rail systems and tools employed.

The gun tried was of small calibre about {{convert|4|in}} in diameter and this succeeded beyond the expectations of the company who were present to witness the trial. The success of the small one led the gentlemen interested in its production for field or battery purposes to endeavor to have one of a large size cast. Of course many difficulties had to be overcome before they could venture to make the world acquainted with the fact that a large one was in hand but after several failures mainly due to unforeseen circumstances they have had one cast weighing {{convert|10,175|lb}} and measuring {{convert|11|ft|6|in}} in length. This gun was tried in the United States a few miles below Reading Pennsylvania on the old proving ground.|ref=harv|pages=658–659|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=4ctMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA658#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}
