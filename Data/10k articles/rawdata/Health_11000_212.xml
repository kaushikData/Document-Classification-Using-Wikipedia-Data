[[File:Laura Bush talks with African boy.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Laura Bush]] with an [[AIDS orphan]] at a center in [[HIV/AIDS in Zambia|Zambia]] that promotes abstinence and faith for youth.]]
'''Abstinence-only sex education''' is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage. It often excludes other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.

Evidence does not support the effectiveness of abstinence-only sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b |pmid=17885460 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=446–52 |year=2007 |last1=Ott |first1=Mary A |last2=Santelli |first2=John S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chin2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.006 |pmid=22341164 |title=The Effectiveness of Group-Based Comprehensive Risk-Reduction and Abstinence Education Interventions to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Adolescent Pregnancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Sexually Transmitted Infections |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=272–94 |year=2012 |last1=Chin |first1=Helen B |last2=Sipe |first2=Theresa Ann |last3=Elder |first3=Randy |last4=Mercer |first4=Shawna L |last5=Chattopadhyay |first5=Sajal K |last6=Jacob |first6=Verughese |last7=Wethington |first7=Holly R |last8=Kirby |first8=Doug |last9=Elliston |first9=Donna B |last10=Griffith |first10=Matt |last11=Chuke |first11=Stella O |last12=Briss |first12=Susan C |last13=Ericksen |first13=Irene |last14=Galbraith |first14=Jennifer S |last15=Herbst |first15=Jeffrey H |last16=Johnson |first16=Robert L |last17=Kraft |first17=Joan M |last18=Noar |first18=Seth M |last19=Romero |first19=Lisa M |last20=Santelli |first20=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be ineffective in decreasing [[HIV]] risk in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Un2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005421.pub2 |title=Abstinence-only programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Underhill |first1=Kristen |last2=Operario |first2=Don |last3=Montgomery |first3=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not decrease rates of sexual activity or [[unplanned pregnancy]] when compared to comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;

The topic of abstinence-only education is controversial in the United States, with proponents claiming that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity, and critics arguing that abstinence-only education is religiously motivated and that the approach has been proven ineffective and even detrimental to its own aims.

==Description==
Abstinence education teaches children and [[adolescents]] to abstain from sexual activity, and that this is the only certain method of avoiding pregnancy and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). With a heavy focus on the importance of "family values," programs also teach that abstinence until marriage is a standard by which to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/edth.12034 |title=Just the Facts? The Separation of Sex Education from Moral Education |journal=Educational Theory |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=443–60 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17162310&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1931-2393.2006.tb00277.x |pmid=17162310 |title=Changes in Formal Sex Education: 1995?2002 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=182–9 |year=2006 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Santelli |first2=John S |last3=Singh |first3=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
[[Systematic review]]s of research evaluating abstinence-only sex education have concluded that it is ineffective at preventing [[unwanted pregnancy]] or the spread of STIs, among other shortfalls.&lt;ref name=Obs2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirby, D.|title=Emerging Answers 2007: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases|publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy|year=2007|url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}} {{cite web |url=http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125612/http://thenationalcampaign.org/resource/emerging-answers-2007%E2%80%94full-report |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27677440&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17437199.2016.1240625 |pmid=27677440 |title=A comprehensive review of reviews of school-based interventions to improve sexual-health |journal=[[Health Psychology Review]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–52 |year=2016 |last1=Denford |first1=Sarah |last2=Abraham |first2=Charles |last3=Campbell |first3=Rona |last4=Busse |first4=Heide }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has recommended against the use of abstinence-only sex education because it has been found to be ineffective, and because the media frequently conveys information about non-abstinence.&lt;ref name=pmid20805150&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-1544 |pmid=20805150 |title=Sexuality, Contraception, and the Media |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=576–82 |year=2010 |last1=Strasburger |first1=V. C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== STI transmission ===
A 2015 meta-analysis found that abstinence-focused programs had no effect on the likelihood of contracting STDs.&lt;ref name=pmid26149164&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1570162x13666150511143943 |pmid=26149164 |title=Effective Evidence-Based Programs for Preventing Sexually-Transmitted Infections: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Current HIV Research |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=432–8 |year=2015 |last1=Petrova |first1=Dafina |last2=Garcia-Retamero |first2=Rocio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cochrane systematic review suggests that abstinence-only education neither increases nor decreases HIV risk in high-income countries.&lt;ref name=Un2007/&gt; In the developing world there is a lack of evidence of effect.&lt;ref name=pmid24594648&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0089692 |pmid=24594648 |pmc=3942389 |title=School Based Sex Education and HIV Prevention in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e89692 |year=2014 |last1=Fonner |first1=Virginia A |last2=Armstrong |first2=Kevin S |last3=Kennedy |first3=Caitlin E |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Kevin R |last5=Sweat |first5=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Douglas Kirby]] reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence-only education programs and found little evidence to justify the use of such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.3.18 |title=The impact of abstinence and comprehensive sex and STD/HIV education programs on adolescent sexual behavior |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=18 |year=2008 |last1=Kirby |first1=Douglas B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 meta-analysis found that it was ineffective at reducing the risk of HIV infection among adolescents.&lt;ref name=pmid21199984&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.251 |title=Interventions to Reduce Sexual Risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Adolescents |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume=165 |year=2011 |last1=Johnson |first1=Blair T |last2=Scott-Sheldon |first2=Lori A. J |last3=Huedo-Medina |first3=Tania B |last4=Carey |first4=Michael P |pmc=4361805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence education has also been found to include misleading medical information and exclude potentially life-saving information about sexual risk reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17441692.2012.759609 |pmid=23327516 |pmc=3984004 |title=Abstinence promotion under PEPFAR: The shifting focus of HIV prevention for youth |journal=Global Public Health |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2013 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Speizer |first2=Ilene S |last3=Edelstein |first3=Zoe R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found "that state-level abstinence education mandates have no effect on teen birth rates or abortion rates, although we find that state-level policies may affect teen sexually transmitted disease rates in some states."&lt;ref name=pmid26918400&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hec.3315 |pmid=26918400 |title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes |journal=Health Economics |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=403–420 |year=2017 |last1=Carr |first1=Jillian B |last2=Packham |first2=Analisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===
Research conducted on 48 states of United States showed that "The level of abstinence education (no provision, covered, promoted, stressed) was positively correlated with both teen pregnancy and teen birth rates.&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; Also, in John S. Santelli's research, the decline of teenage pregnancy rates during 1995&amp;ndash;2002 were largely due to improved contraception, and the reduction in pregnancy risk among teenagers at age of 18 or 19 is entirely ascribed to more contraception.&lt;ref name=pmid17138906&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.089169 |pmid=17138906 |pmc=1716232 |title=Explaining Recent Declines in Adolescent Pregnancy in the United States: The Contribution of Abstinence and Improved Contraceptive Use |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=150–6 |year=2007 |last1=Santelli |first1=John S |last2=Lindberg |first2=Laura Duberstein |last3=Finer |first3=Lawrence B |last4=Singh |first4=Susheela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[SIECUS]], the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, "[s]cientific evidence simply does not support an abstinence-only-until-marriage approach."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf SIECUS Fact Sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616150557/http://www.siecus.org/_data/global/images/research_says.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} (includes research citations).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] pointed out that pregnancy rates for teens 15–19 reversed their decline in 2006, near the peak of the Abstinence Only campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Table 1.0,"U.S. Teenage Pregnancies, Births and Abortions: National and State Trends and Trends by Race and Ethnicity." {{cite web |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129204657/http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/01/26/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}, downloaded 20100127.&lt;/ref&gt;

While sex education has been linked to a delay in the first time having sex,&lt;ref name=pmid22999833&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.028 |pmid=22999833 |laysource=Guttmacher Institute |laysummary=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2012/sex-education-linked-delay-first-sex |laydate=March 8, 2012 |title=Consequences of Sex Education on Teen and Young Adult Sexual Behaviors and Outcomes |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=332–8 |year=2012 |last1=Lindberg |first1=Laura Duberstein |last2=Maddow-Zimet |first2=Isaac }}&lt;/ref&gt; abstinence-only programs specifically haven't shown this link, and do not seem to influence if or when young people begin having sex.&lt;ref name=pmid18346659&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.026 |pmid=18346659 |title=Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=344–51 |year=2008 |last1=Kohler |first1=Pamela K |last2=Manhart |first2=Lisa E |last3=Lafferty |first3=William E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Support===
Proponents of abstinence-only sex education argue that this approach is superior to comprehensive sex education because it emphasizes the teaching of morality that limits sex to that within the bounds of marriage, and that [[premarital sex|sex before marriage]] and at a [[Child sexuality|young age]] has heavy physical and emotional costs.&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310182953/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html |date=2012-03-10 }} Retrieved on 2007-14-03&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence programs often teach young people that pleasure in sex is most likely to be found within marriage, and therefore, that they should wait to engage in sexual activity until they are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14681811.2012.738604 |title=The use and misuse of pleasure in sex education curricula |journal=Sex Education |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=305–18 |year=2013 |last1=Lamb |first1=Sharon |last2=Lustig |first2=Kara |last3=Graling |first3=Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence generally places a great emphasis on the importance of the institution of marriage, which some proponents believe allows young people to grow and develop as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views On Sex - And Sex Education - Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.

Proponents suggest that comprehensive sex education encourages premarital sexual activity among teenagers, which should be discouraged in an era when [[HIV]] and other incurable STIs are widespread and when [[teen pregnancy]] is an ongoing concern. Many supporters of abstinence-only education do so out of the belief that comprehensive guides to sex or information about contraceptives will ultimately result in teens actively pursuing and engaging in sexual activities,&lt;ref name=pmid22022362&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658 |pmid=22022362 |pmc=3194801 |title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=e24658 |year=2011 |last1=Stanger-Hall |first1=Kathrin F |last2=Hall |first2=David W }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others oppose the endorsement of contraception for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Contra-Contraception"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shorto |first=Russel |title=Contra-Contraception |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=May 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=March 18, 2017 |df= }}{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318073038/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers are framed as less intelligent and less responsible than adults. They are seen as unable to control themselves due to 'raging hormones'. As a result, a teenager's sexual desire is something that needs to be controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, J (2012). "Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide". ''Sociology Compass'': 1–14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, dividing the teens into two separate categories in the minds of adults: "the innocent and the guilty, the vulnerable and the predatory, the pure and the corrupting."&lt;ref&gt;Fields, p. 6{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition ===
Opponents and critics, which include prominent professional associations in the fields of medicine, public health, adolescent health, and psychology, argue that such programs fail to provide adequate information to protect the health of adolescents. Not only is information inadequate, but opponents believe that young people have the right to receive comprehensive information about how to protect themselves and their sexual health.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.10.006 |pmid=16387256 |title=Abstinence and abstinence-only education: A review of U.S. Policies and programs |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2006 |last1=Santelli |first1=John |last2=Ott |first2=Mary A |last3=Lyon |first3=Maureen |last4=Rogers |first4=Jennifer |last5=Summers |first5=Daniel |last6=Schleifer |first6=Rebecca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate information is especially important since, although some supporters may claim that abstinence is an effective method, it has been found that a small percentage of people actually practice it.&lt;ref name=pmid16387256/&gt;

Some critics also argue that such programs verge on religious interference in secular education. Opponents of abstinence-only education dispute the claim that comprehensive sex education encourages teens to have premarital sex.&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;Douglas Kirby, Ph.

According to [[Advocates for Youth]], abstinence-only sex education distorts information about contraceptives, including only revealing failure rates associated with their use, and ignoring discussion of their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Effective Sex Education, Brigid McKeon, 2006; {{cite web |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=450&amp;Itemid=336 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419141940/http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=450&amp;Itemid=336 |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language surrounding medicine and health is construed  as being both objective and value free.&lt;ref name=pmid23468394/&gt; This objectivity is then adopted by conservative politicians and campaigners to assert authority which historically holds its basis in religion.&lt;ref name="Hawaii of Manoa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beh|first1=Hazel Glenn|last2=Diamond|first2=Milton|title=The Failure of Abstinence-only Education: minors have a right to honest talk about sex|journal=Columbia Journal of Gender and Law|date=2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–62|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2006-failure-of-abstinence-only-education.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516171135/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2005to2009/2006-failure-of-abstinence-only-education.html|archivedate=16 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstinence-only education is not supported by the majority of public school teachers, parents, and students. The majority in each of these groups is opposed to abstinence-only curriculum and wants a more comprehensive curriculum. "Although more than nine in 10 teachers believe that students should be taught about contraception... one in four are instructed not to teach the subject." Even when there are no rules limiting sex education to abstinence-only, teachers may continue to teach abstinence-only curriculum because they fear retaliation from the local community. Parents also want their children to be taught about contraception. "Most parents (65%) believe that sex education should encourage young people to delay sexual activity but also prepare them to use birth control and practice safe sex once they do become sexually active." 86% of parents want schools to teach their children how to get STD testing, 77% want their children to learn how to talk to a partner about STDs and birth control, 71% want them to learn how to use condoms, and 68% want them to learn about using other forms of birth control. Students are also opposed to abstinence-only education. "Approximately half of students in grades 7-12 report needing more information about what to do in the event of rape or sexual assault, how to get tested for HIV and other STDs, and how to talk with a partner about birth control and STDs." Clearly, there is a disparity between the type of sex education curriculum teachers, parents, and students want and what government policy determines they receive.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia. "Sex Education: Politicians, Parents, Teachers, and Teens." ''The Reproductive Rights Reader''. Nancy Ehrenreich, Ed. New York City, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
Another problem for abstinence education is the definition of abstinence. Santelli (2006) states that there is no strict definition of abstinence within the US federal government guidelines for teaching abstinence-only sex education, using a mixture of non-specific phrases, like "postponing sex" or "never had [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]]," while also using moralistic terms or phrases like ''[[virgin]]'', ''chaste'', and "making a commitment".&lt;ref name="pmid16387256"/&gt; This has resulted in sexual activities that are not penile-vaginal, including [[mutual masturbation]], [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], being considered outside of the scope of abstention from sex, which is termed ''[[technical virginity]].''&lt;ref name="Intimate"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan Strong |author2=Christine DeVault |author3=Theodore F. Cohen |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationship in a Changing Society| publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2010|accessdate=October 8, 2011 |page=186| isbn=0-534-62425-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA186|quote=Most people agree that we maintain virginity as long as we refrain from sexual (vaginal) intercourse.

It does so with certain guidelines and restrictions on the recipients. PEPFAR promotes an "ABC" approach – Abstain, Be faithful, and use Condoms. Funding recipients may give information about condoms to youth over 15 years old, but cannot use the funding to provide condoms or promote usage.

PEPFAR was founded in 2003 with the mandate that 33% of its funds provided for prevention be used for abstinence-only education.

=== Funding ===
In the U.S., states may apply for federal funding of abstinence-only sex education programs from either Title V, the [[Adolescent Family Life Act]] (AFLA), and/or Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE).&lt;ref name=pmid22022362/&gt; To be eligible for funding, programs must satisfy requirements given under the Social Security Act, which is reproduced here verbatim:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm Social Security Act, Section 510] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026183857/http://ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title05/0510.htm |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(2) For purposes of this section, the term "abstinence education" means an educational or motivational program which—
:(A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
:(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;
:(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
:(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
:(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
:(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society;
:(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
:(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Funding, which began in the 1980s, has continued to increase since its inception, though support for the programs and legislation surrounding them has become dependent upon the current administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10282580.2010.517970 |title=Barack Obama vs Bristol Palin: Why the President's sex education policy wins |journal=Contemporary Justice Review |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=411–24 |year=2010 |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana A |last2=Miller |first2=Monica K }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[George W. Bush administration]] increased federal funding for abstinence-only programs (the only type funded even under the previous [[Clinton Administration]]), while the [[Obama administration]] reversed the emphasis and provided more federal dollars for comprehensive sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secondnexus.com/news/politics/donald-trump-abstinence-only-education-aoum-budget/ Trump Ignores Scientific Evidence Proving Abstinence Only Education Doesn’t Work]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] cut grants to comprehensive sex education&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-cuts-short-teen-pregnancy-prevention-program-funding/ Trump administration cuts short teen pregnancy prevention program funding]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed increased funding for abstinence-only education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/trump-budget-abstinence-only-sex-ed.html Trump’s Proposed Budget Would Invest $277 Million in Abstinence-Only Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
The [[Christian Right]], who initially stood against having school-based sex education programs, began supporting abstinence-only programs due to the focus on marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/publius/pjr052 |jstor=41682905 |title=Saying No to Abstinence-Only Education: An Analysis of State Decision-Making |journal=Publius: the Journal of Federalism |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=613–35 |year=2012 |last1=Doan |first1=A. E |last2=McFarlane |first2=D. R }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a driving force behind the abstinence movement, they have focused on getting more funding for these programs and have also been successful in creating more awareness surrounding abstinence through their use of activism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363460711406460 |title=Battling a 'sex-saturated society': The abstinence movement and the politics of sex education |journal=Sexualities |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=416–43 |year=2011 |last1=Calterone Williams |first1=Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the New Right, the abstinence-only sex education movement was an opportunity and an avenue to change the current view and status of sexuality in America, aligning it more with their own values, and as a result, creating individuals who remained abstinent until marriage, and thus, citizens who embodied values of self-discipline and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00335630.2016.1209548 |title=Chastity for democracy: Surplus repression and the rhetoric of sex education |journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=353–75 |year=2016 |last1=Kelly |first1=Casey Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, abstinence-only programs utilize ideas of individualism and personal responsibility when educating young people about sex, seeking to create individuals who take responsibility for sexuality and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1743923X09000154 |title=Whose Responsibility?

===Religion===
Religious doctrines take varying stances on contraception and pre-marital sex, some of which are covered by:

*[[Religion and birth control]]
*[[Christian views on contraception]]
*[[Protestant views on birth control]]
*[[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]]
*[[Sexuality and Mormonism]]
*[[Fornication]]
*[[Fornication#Islam|Premarital sex in Islam]]

The philosophical [[sex-positive movement]] cuts across many religions, and rejects the idea that consensual pre-marital sex or contraception are immoral.

[[Image:Ashtray.jpg|thumb|right|A glass ashtray]]
An '''ashtray''' is a [[wikt:receptacle|receptacle]] for ash from [[cigarette]]s and [[cigar]]s.  Ashtrays are typically made of [[fire retardant]] material such as [[glass]], heat-resistant [[plastic]], [[pottery]], [[metal]], or [[rock (geology)|stone]].

==Types==
[[File:2011-158-18, Ash Tray ,Commemorative, Ship Launching (5915313535).jpg|thumb|Commemorative, decorative ashtray manufactured 1935 (photo 2011)]]
[[Image:Ashtray I.JPG|right|thumb|Wall-mounted ashtray]]
[[File:NID ash tray.jpeg|thumb|A NID ashtray]]The most common ashtray design is a shallow [[cylinder]] with a flat base, to rest on a table. Other ashtrays, particularly in [[public places]], are wall-mounted, and larger than standard tabletop ashtrays due to the increased use they receive. Many ashtrays have notches at the rim, to hold cigarettes and/or a cigar. Frequently ashtrays were equipped in older large or luxury cars before later being available as dealer-installed accessory items.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, cars such as the [[BMW]] E38 featured ashtrays and lighters installed in both rear doors.

==History==
While primitive forms of ashtrays existed way before the 19th century, it was during this [[century]] that the design, [[aesthetics]] and their popularity really took off. As more [[women]] began to smoke in the early 1900s, the ashtray inched closer to an [[art]] form of sorts. Many women avoided the use of the traditional ashtray as it failed to reflect their [[feminine]] values through an activity that was long declared as being exclusive to [[men]]. What emerged were detailed, often very fancy ashtrays. These ashtrays depicted [[pastoral]] scenes of [[maiden]]s wandering through vibrantly colored landscapes. Some even featured very luxurious cast-iron models of women in fancy dresses, animals in states of [[Play (activity)|play]] and the occasional [[porcelain]] or [[ceramic]] tray highlighting extravagant floral arrangements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neptunecigar.com/tips/cigars-and-the-history-of-the-ashtray|title=Cigars and the History of the Ashtray|last=Normand|first=Luzzie|date=|website=Neptune Cigars, Inc. (US)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "ashtray" in unhyphenated form, rather than "ash tray" or "ash-tray", did not come into common use until 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YP2dHzxkx5cC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=ashtrays&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rOoUUrj3L8mwyQHaioG4DA&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=ashtrays&amp;f=false|title=Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition|last=Proctor|first=Robert N.|date=2012|website=Google Books|publisher=University of California Press|page=136|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time went on, and the advent of women smoking both cigars and cigarettes became less of a departure from the norm, ashtrays saw a decline in design aesthetics and more of a shift towards practicality. However, it was not uncommon to see ashtrays featuring pin-up girls in [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s during this decade. It was also during this time that another [[Fad|trend]] in ashtrays began to emerge: the auto-ashtray.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the addition of [[vehicle]] ashtrays is now becoming something of the past, there was a time when these not only came standard, they were expected. In the early years, design oversights put these ash receptacles right below the [[air conditioning|A/C]] and [[Central heating|heating]] so every time the owner would use either of these, the ash would inadvertently fly in their face or all throughout the car.  But as new models of vehicles were constantly introduced to the public, these little foibles gave way and many began to use chrome trays with covers that could be opened and closed at the driver’s discretion.  Many luxury cars would make it a more luxurious design and it was not uncommon to see intricately made ashtrays in some of the high-end cars of the day. These ashtrays would feature [[leather]], high-end [[metals]] and even specialized [[engravings]] by the [[manufacturer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

But, just like the stand-alone ashtray, the vehicle ashtray began to lose popularity and in 1994, vehicles began to be produced without them and instead, offer the buyer the option to include one from the [[Dealer (franchising)|dealer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today, ashtrays are still used for the odd cigarette smoker, but they have also been making a small revival in popularity from the cigar [[aficionados]] of the world. Cigars, unlike cigarettes require a significantly longer time to get through. On average, cigars take about 40 to 60 minutes to complete. Holding a cigar in your hand the entire time can quickly become taxing on your grip, not to mention, you will probably be engaged in some other activities at some point during that hour. To help solve this problem, cigar smokers implement a cigar ashtray to ease the burden of holding the cigar the entire time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contrary to what some might think, cigar ashtrays are actually quite different than their cigarette ashtray peers. Ashtrays for cigars has to provide sufficient room for the cigar to sit and not be situated at an angle or smudged down into a tight space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Biographical Information Blank (BIB)''' is a type of assessment that uses [[biodata]] in [[employee recruitment]] to help determine which of several candidates should be hired for a job. Originally companies would take the information from their job applications forms to see what would be useful in predicting the [[job performance]] of employees.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, N., &amp; Chan, D. (1998). Personnel selection: A theoretical approach. Thousand Oaks: CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the amount and type of biographical information collected expanded and was put into the BIB assessments we find today.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, N., &amp; Chan, D. (1998). Personnel selection: A theoretical approach. Thousand Oaks: CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern BIB is a [[self-report]] instrument that includes questions about past personal and work experiences, as well as interests, opinions, values and attitudes.  Its items are all presented in the [[multiple choice]] format. The emphasis is on past behaviors because they are best predictors of future behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, W. F., &amp; Aguinis, H. (2010). Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management,  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, BIBs are designed to predict success in a particular job because they contribute to a predictor sample, which is used to make personnel selection decisions.

There are two types of BIBs: the empirical and the rational.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, G. S., &amp; Searcy, C. A. (1999). Specification of scales in biodata form development: Rational vs. empirical and global vs. specific. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 7(2), 72-85.&lt;/ref&gt; With the empirical BIB, each item is correlated with a measure of [[job performance]] or other criterion of job success. Those items that can predict job success are retained for the BIB. The rationale approach is to start with a [[job analysis]] to determine the knowledge, skill, ability, and other job characteristics (KSAOs) needed for the job. Items are chosen that reflect the required KSAOs.

A great deal of research has shown that BIBs are able to predict job success.&lt;ref&gt;Breaugh, J. A. (2009). The use of biodata for employee selection: Past research and future directions. Human Resource Management Review, 19(3), 219-231.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of BIBs, the empirical and the rational seem to work equally well.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, G. S., &amp; Searcy, C. A. (1999). Specification of scales in biodata form development: Rational vs. empirical and global vs. specific. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 7(2), 72-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brzeg water tower''' - a historic [[water tower]] in the town of [[Brzeg]], [[Opole Voivodeship]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staśkiewicz|first1=Jarosław|title=Wieża ciśnień w Brzegu w rękach harcerzy|url=http://www.nto.pl/wiadomosci/brzeg/art/4538131,wieza-cisnien-w-brzegu-w-rekach-harcerzy,id,t.html|website=nto.pl|accessdate=24 August 2017|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the oldest waterworks for the town of [[Brzeg]] (''Brieg''), built in the second half of the nineteenth-century was not sufficient for the town's populous, in 1864, the town authorities set out to built a new water tower which was completed in the latter part of the aforesaid year. Initially, water was taken from the [[Oder]] River, however, due to noted frequent epidemics, a waterworks was built in [[Gierszowice]] to supply the [[water tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wieża ciśnień, Brzeg - Zabytek.pl|url=https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/wieza-cisnien-3106|website=zabytek.pl|accessdate=24 August 2017|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brzeg - Wieża ciśnień - stare zdjęcia, mapa|url=http://fotopolska.eu/Brzeg/b16723,Wieza_cisnien.html|website=fotopolska.eu|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">'''Closed kinetic chain exercises''' or '''closed chain exercises''' (CKC) are [[physical exercise]]s performed where the [[hand]] (for arm movement) or [[foot]] (for leg movement) is fixed in space and cannot move. The extremity remains in constant contact with the immobile surface, usually the ground or the base of a machine.

The opposite of CKC exercises are [[open kinetic chain exercises]] (OKC).

Closed chain exercises are often compound movements, that generally incur compressive forces, while open-chain exercises are often isolation movements that promote more shearing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Electromyographic evaluation of closed and open kinetic chain knee rehabilitation exercises. Graham VL, Gehlsen GM, Edwards JA. J Athl Train. 1993 Spring;28(1):23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

CKC exercises involve more than one muscle group and joint simultaneously rather than concentrating solely on one, as many OKC exercises do (single-joint movements), lending the former to more utilitarian and athletic activities.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship between open and closed kinetic chain strength of the lower limb and jumping performance. Blackburn JR, Morrissey MC. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther. 1998 Jun;27(6):430-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Closed-kinetic chain upper-body training improves throwing performance of NCAA Division I softball players. Prokopy MP, Ingersoll CD, Nordenschild E, Katch FI, Gaesser GA, Weltman A. J Strength Cond Res. 2008 Nov;22(6):1790-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
These exercises are typically [[weight bearing]] exercises, where an exerciser uses one's own body weight and/ or external weight.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Closed kinetic chain upper body exercises==
[[Push-ups]] and their derivatives, [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-ups]] (or [[chin-ups]]) and dips, concentrate on a co-contraction of the [[Triceps brachii muscle|triceps]], [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps]], [[deltoid muscle|deltoids]], [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]], [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|lats]], [[abdominals]] and [[lower back]] for stabilization in various ratios depending upon angle and leverage.&lt;ref name="ClosedKinetic"&gt;Closed Kinetic Chain Exercise.

==Ethics==
The CAB is intended to be a way to respect the rights of research participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Sandra Crouse|title=Ethics in Public Health Research Protecting Human Subjects: the Role of Community Advisory Boards|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=June 2004|volume=94|issue=6|pages=918–922|pmc=1448363|pmid=15249289|doi=10.2105/ajph.94.6.918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in a community has the potential for group harm, which is distinct from the individual harm which can happen to individuals who participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[National Bioethics Advisory Commission]]|title=Research Involving Human Biological Materials: Ethical Issues and Policy Guidance|date=August 1999|url=http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/nbac/hbm.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2012}} See recommendation 17&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the risk to communities, researchers have an obligation to community stakeholders to seek community feedback about the research.&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties of CABs==
CABs and researchers must continually decide which powers to invest in a CAB. Here are some common questions which must be decided:

#What interaction should CABs have with [[institutional review boards]]?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#What education and training should the research institution give to the CAB members to enable them to perform their duties?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#To what extent should CABs participate in the development of [[informed consent]] processes?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#To what extent should CABs participate in developing guidelines to determine whether research participants give sufficient consent?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#In emergency situations, to what extent can CABs provide consultation on what response researchers should have to the emergency?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#When study participants have ethical problems with the research, to what extent should the CAB directly receive those participants' concerns?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#When CABs perceive the inevitable lapses in sufficient protection for research participants which occasionally and naturally occur in any study, what power should the CAB have to direct rectification of this lapse?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;
#To what extent should CABs direct the empowerment of their communities to more fully and beneficially participate in research?&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt;

==Guidelines==
A community advisory board has whatever duties the members invest in it, but various organizations have suggested that they have certain responsibilities. Besides not knowing what CABs should do, it is difficult to determine what CABs should not do. Some of the perennial problems with CABs are determining the following: who in a community can serve on a CAB, the extent to which the CAB directs research, and the extent to which the community directs the execution of the research.&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt; Researchers find that research is more productive and ethical when researchers train, recruit, and integrate members from the population targeted by the research into the research team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Overseeing genetic research===
In 2000 the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] held a conference which defined some CAB duties.&lt;ref name="quinnprotecting"/&gt; Those duties are as follows:&lt;ref name="responsible"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]]|title=Report of the First Community Consultation on the Responsible Collection and Use of Samples for Genetic Research|date=September 2000|url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Reports/community_consultation.htm|accessdate=10 April 2012}} Reproduced here verbatim.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Obtain broad community input for all phases of research.&lt;ref name="responsible"/&gt;
#[[Respect for persons|Respect]] communities as full partners in research.&lt;ref name="responsible"/&gt;
#Resolve all issues pertaining to [[Biological specimen|tissue samples]].&lt;ref name="responsible"/&gt;

#Ensure dissemination of accurate information to the media and the public.&lt;ref name="responsible"/&gt;
#Provide sufficient funds for research and encourage community–researcher partnerships.&lt;ref name="responsible"/&gt;

==Challenges in developing countries==
As part of [[international development]] many research institutions medical research in [[developing countries]]. When this happens, they often opt to get advice from the local community through a CAB. The process of setting up CABs in developing countries has its own problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ntshanga | first1 = S. P. | last2 = Ngcobo | first2 = P.

'''DiscoverX''' develops, commercializes and manufactures reagents and assay kits for the [[drug discovery]] market.  Their focus is on lucrative protein target classes, such as [[G-protein-coupled receptor]]s and [[kinase]]s.

The company is built around a proprietary technology called '''enzyme fragment complementation''' or '''EFC''' which forms the basis of the assays that they design and market.  In EFC, two [[Lactase|β-galactosidase]] fragments are employed which are themselves inactive.  One fragment (EA) has an inactivating deletion while the second fragment (ED) has a complementing fragment; in solution where both EA and ED are present, certain pairs of fragments combine spontaneously to form  active complexes.  Some pairs of fragments interact only weakly and combine to produce enzyme activity only when forced into close proximity by virtue of their attachment to proteins which bind to each other.  This property permits evaluation of intracellular protein interactions for use in high throughput screening of drug candidates for their effect on specific cellular pathways. The company offers a wide variety of cell lines that produce such fusion products.

== Early life and education ==
Ellis was born in [[Hawkinsville, Georgia|Hawkinsville]], Georgia to Joshua P. O'Neal and Althea (Hamilton) O'Neal. In 1933, she obtained her bachelors degree in Biology and Chemistry upon graduating from [[Spelman College]]. Ellis then attended graduate school at [[Atlanta University]] where she acquired a master's degree in biology in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Women in America|last=Hine|first=Darlene|publisher=Carson Pub|year=1993|isbn=|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|pages=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 Ellis graduated from [[University of Illinois College of Medicine]] where she graduated with honors and fifth in her class. 

== Career and Accomplishments ==
Following graduate school, she was presented with a grant to study diseases and parasites in [[Puerto Rico]], which prompted her passion for healthcare for all socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epic Lives: One Hundred Black Women Who Made a Difference|last=Carney Smith|first=Jessie|publisher=Visible Ink|year=1993|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis served as a pediatric residency at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] from 1951-1952. Her primary concerns were with the black community, children, and child mortality rates. She aided in the development of parenting and education programs for the [[March of Dimes]]. She dedicated much of her treating and advising to new and expecting mothers. 

Ellis obtained a postdoctoral fellowship studying pediatric cardiology at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] from July 1, 1952 to June 30, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notable Black American Women|last=Smith|first=Jessie Carney|publisher=Gale Research|year=1992–2003|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her team helped to develop the technique to help save [[Blue-babies|blue babies]] (those infants with inadequate oxygen supply). In 1970 Ellis became the first African American woman to hold an executive position in the [[American Medical Association]], which she held for five years. She became a Director of Maternal Care and Health Care for Ohio's Department of Health in 1960. In 1970, Ellis was appointed to the President's Committee on the Handicapped. Ellis was inducted the [[Chicago's Women Hall of Fame]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life and death ==
Ellis married to Arthur. W. Ellis in 1935 and later married James D.

{{globalize|date=May 2007}}
A '''gas leak''' refers to a [[leak]] of [[natural gas]] or other gaseous product from a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] or other containment into any area where the gas should not be present. Because  a small leak may gradually build up an explosive concentration of gas, leaks are very dangerous. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning from Accidents|author=Trevor A. Kletz|year=2001|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=075064883X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to causing fire and explosion hazards, leaks can kill vegetation, including large trees, and may release powerful [[greenhouse gases]] to the atmosphere.

==Fire and explosion safety==
Pure natural gas is colorless and odorless, and is composed primarily of [[methane]]. Unpleasant scents in the form of traces of [[mercaptan]]s are usually added, to assist in identifying leaks. This [[odor]] may be perceived as rotting eggs, or a faintly unpleasant [[skunk]] smell. Persons detecting the odor must evacuate the area and abstain from using open flames or operating electrical equipment, to reduce the risk of fire and explosion.

As a result of the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration|Pipeline Safety Improvement Act]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h107-3609 Text of H.R. 3609 (107th): Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) - GovTrack.us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of 2002 passed in the United States, federal safety standards require companies providing natural gas to conduct [[safety inspection]]s for gas leaks in homes and other buildings receiving natural gas.  The gas company is required to inspect [[gas meter]]s and inside gas piping from the point of entry into the building to the outlet side of the gas meter for gas leaks.  This may require entry into private homes by the natural gas companies to check for hazardous conditions.

==Harm to vegetation==
Gas leaks can damage or kill plants.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindsay|first=Jay|title=Trust Targets Gas Leaks That Kill Trees|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/26/AR2007032600228.html|accessdate=2013-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=Boston's Leaky Gas Lines May Be Tough On The Trees|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/21/142504812/bostons-leaky-gas-lines-may-be-tough-on-the-trees|work=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to leaks from natural gas pipes, methane and other gases migrating from [[landfill]] garbage disposal sites can also cause [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]] in grass, weeds, or trees.&lt;ref name=Fraedrich&gt;{{cite web|last=Fraedrich|first=Bruce R.|title=Gas Injury to Trees: Identification and Treatment|url=http://www.bartlett.com/resources/Gas-Injury-to-Trees.pdf|publisher=Bartlett Tree Research Laboratories|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, leaking gas may migrate as far as {{convert|100|ft|m}} from the source of the leak to an affected tree.&lt;ref name=Baniecki&gt;{{cite web|last=Baniecki |first=John F. |title=Gas Leak |url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/hortcult/treeshru/treeprob.htm |work=Tree Problems |publisher=West Virginia University Extension Service |accessdate=2013-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010955/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/hortcult/treeshru/treeprob.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm to animals==
Small animals and birds are more sensitive to toxic gases, including the methane and [[carbon monoxide]] present in natural gas.  The expression "canary in a coal mine" derives from the historical practice of using a [[Domestic Canary|canary]] as an [[animal sentinel]] to detect toxic naturally occurring [[Coalbed methane|coal gas]].

==Greenhouse gas emissions==
Methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is up to 120 times as potent a [[greenhouse gas]] as [[carbon dioxide]].  Thus, the release of unburned natural gas produces much stronger effects than the carbon dioxide that would have been released if the gas had been burned as intended.&lt;ref name=Struck&gt;{{cite news|last1=Struck|first1=Doug|title=Google Earth captures city’s leaky gas pipelines|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/science/2014/07/16/map-gas-leaks-part-effort-make-environmental-information-public/mliLHjbMtLifFwTMdFsiZO/story.html|accessdate=2014-07-18|work=Boston Globe|date=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leak grades==
In the United States, most state and federal agencies have adopted the Gas Piping and Technology Committee (GPTC) standards for grading natural gas leaks.

A ''Grade 1 leak'' is a leak that represents an existing or probable hazard to persons or property, and requires immediate repair or continuous action until the conditions are no longer hazardous.
Examples of a Grade 1 leak are:
* Any leak which, in the judgment of operating personnel at the scene, is regarded as an immediate hazard.
* Escaping gas that has ignited.
* Any indication of gas which has migrated into or under a building, or into a [[tunnel]].
* Any reading at the outside wall of a building, or where gas would likely migrate to an outside wall of a building.
* Any reading of 80% [[Flammability limit#Lower explosive limit|LEL]], or greater, in a [[confined space]].
* Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater in small substructures (other than gas associated sub structures) from which gas would likely migrate to the outside wall of a building.
* Any leak that can be seen, heard, or felt, and which is in a location that may endanger the general public or property.

A ''Grade 2 leak'' is a leak that is recognized as being non-hazardous at the time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future hazard.
Examples of a Grade 2 Leak are:
* Leaks Requiring Action Ahead of Ground Freezing or Other Adverse Changes in Venting Conditions. Any leak which, under frozen or other adverse soil conditions, would likely migrate to the outside wall of a building.
* Leaks requiring action within six months
* Any reading of 40% LEL, or greater, under a sidewalk in a wall-to-wall paved area that does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak.
* Any reading of 100% LEL, or greater, under a street in a wall-to-wall paved area that has significant gas migration and does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak.
* Any reading less than 80% LEL in small substructures (other than gas associated substructures) from which gas would likely migrate creating a probable future hazard.
* Any reading between 20% LEL and 80% LEL in a confined space.
* Any reading on a pipeline operating at 30 percent [[Specified Minimum Yield Strength|specified minimum yield strength (SMYS)]] or greater, in a class 3 or 4 location,{{clarify|date=February 2012}} which does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak.
* Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater, in gas associated sub-structures.
* Any leak which, in the judgment of operating personnel at the scene, is of sufficient magnitude to justify scheduled repair.

A ''Grade 3 leak'' is non-hazardous at the time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous.
Examples of a Grade 3 Leak are:
* Any reading of less than 80% LEL in small gas associated substructures.
* Any reading under a street in areas without wall-to-wall paving where it is unlikely the gas could migrate to the out-side wall of a building.
* Any reading of less than 20% LEL in a confined space.

==Studies==
In 2012, [[Boston University]] professor Nathan Phillips and his students drove along all {{convert|785|mi|km}} of Boston roads with a [[gas sensor]], identifying 3300 leaks.&lt;ref name="Struck" /&gt;  The [[Conservation Law Foundation]] produced a map showing around 4000 leaks reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.&lt;ref name="Struck" /&gt; In July 2014, the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] released an interactive [[online map]] based on gas sensors attached to three  mapping cars which already were being driven along Boston streets to update [[Google Earth]] [[Street View]].  This survey differed from the previous studies in that an estimate of leak severity was produced, rather than just leak detection.  This map should help the gas utility to prioritize leak repairs, as well as raising public awareness of the problem.&lt;ref name="Struck" /&gt;

==Regulation==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
===Massachusetts===
Legislation passed in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2014/Chapter149, Acts of 2014, Chapter 149: AN ACT RELATIVE TO NATURAL GAS LEAKS]&lt;/ref&gt; requires gas suppliers to make greater efforts to control some of the 20,000 documented leaks in the US state of [[Massachusetts]].  The new law requires grade 1 and 2 leaks to be repaired if the street above a gas pipe is dug up, and requires priority be given to leaks near schools.  It provides a mechanism for increased revenue from ratepayers (up to 1.5% without further approval) to cover the cost of repairs and replacement of leak-prone materials (like [[cast iron]] and [[Cathodic protection|non-cathodically protected]] steel) on an accelerated basis.  The law sets a target of 20 years for replacement of pipes made from leak-prone materials if feasible given the revenue cap; {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, [[Columbia Gas of Massachusetts]] (formerly named "''Bay State Gas''"), [[Berkshire Gas]], [[Liberty Utilities]], [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], and [[Unitil]] say they will meet this target, but [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]] says it will take 25 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dpu/orders/14-135-nstar-gsep-order.pdf|title=Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs|website=Mass.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/eea/energy-utilities-clean-tech/natural-gas-utility/gas-system-enhancement-plan-orders.html Gas System Enhancement Plan Orders ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaks, statistics on leak-prone materials, and financial statements are reported annually to the Department of Public Utilities, which also has responsibility for rate-setting.

Additional proposals not included in the law would have required grade 3 leaks to be repaired during road construction, and priority for leaks which are killing trees or which were near hospitals or churches.&lt;ref name=Ailworth&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ailworth|first1=Erin|title=New Mass. law aims to speed repairs to gas leaks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/07/06/new-law-aims-speed-repairs-gas-leaks/KzxFpeELSPqG5kXDFAHL3I/story.html|accessdate=2014-07-18|work=Boston Globe|date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Metzger&gt;{{cite news|last=Metzger |first=Andy |title=With natural gas leaks widespread, lawmakers revisit fixes |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/marblehead/news/x793337975/With-natural-gas-leaks-widespread-lawmakers-revisit-fixes |accessdate=2013-11-28 |newspaper=Wicked Local Marblehead |date=Jun 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001429/http://www.wickedlocal.com/marblehead/news/x793337975/With-natural-gas-leaks-widespread-lawmakers-revisit-fixes |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation stated that the leaks were worth $38.8 million in lost natural gas, which also contributes 4% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Metzger" /&gt; A federal study prompted by US Senator [[Edward J. Markey]] concluded that Massachusetts consumers paid approximately $1.5 billion from 2000–2011 for gas which leaked and benefited no one.&lt;ref name="Ailworth" /&gt; Markey has also backed legislation that would implement similar requirements at the national level, along with financing provisions for repairs.&lt;ref name=Ailworth /&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
Catastrophic gas leaks, such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] are well-recognized as problems, but the more-subtle effects of chronic low-level leaks have been slower to gain recognition.

==Other contexts==
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
In work with dangerous gases (such as in a lab or industrial setting), a gas leak may require [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] emergency response, especially if the leaked material is flammable, explosive, corrosive, or toxic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15993">The '''Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network''' ('''GOARN''') is a network composed of numerous technical and public health institutions, laboratories, NGOs, and other organizations that work to observe and respond to threatening epidemics.&lt;ref name="IHRGOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/about/IHR_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_respond.pdf |title=International Health Regulations Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |date=1 May 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOARN works closely with and under the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which is one of its most notable partners. Its goals are to: examine and study diseases, evaluate the risks that certain diseases pose, and improve international capability to deal with diseases.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network-GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/goarnenglish.pdf |title=The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

The [[World Health Organization]] realized at the start of the 21st century that it did not have the resources required to adequately respond to and prevent epidemics around the world. Thus, a "Framework for Global Outbreak and Response" was created by the Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Response, and Regional Offices. This framework was put then forth in a meeting in Geneva from April 26–28, 2000. In this meeting, which was attended by 121 representatives from 67 institutions, the decision was made to form GOARN to contribute resources, coordination, surveillance, and technical assistance towards combating diseases.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |date=4 September 2014 |journal=Global Public Health |author=John S. Mackenzie |pmc=4205922 |pmid=25186571 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.951870 |volume=9 |pages=1023–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided that GOARN would be directed by a steering committee made of 20 representatives of GOARN partners and an operational support team (OST) based in WHO. The steering committee oversees and plans the activities of GOARN, and the OST is composed of a minimum of 5–6 WHO staff. Task forces and groups were established to deal with specific issues.&lt;ref name="Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response._Report_of_a_WHO_Meeting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/surveillance/whocdscsr2003.pdf |title=Global Outbreak Alert and Response. Report of a WHO meeting |date=26 April 2000 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOARN resources are primarily coordinated by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="The_Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network" /&gt;

==Goals==

The WHO's guiding principles are to standardize "epidemiological, laboratory, clinical management, research, communication, logistics, support, security, evacuation, and communication systems" and coordinative international resources to support local efforts by GOARN partners to combat outbreaks. It also focuses on improving long term ability to provide technical assistance to affected areas.&lt;ref name="Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response._Report_of_a_WHO_Meeting" /&gt;

==Partners==

GOARN has grown to now have over 600 partners in the form of public health institutions, networks, laboratories, and [[United Nations]] and non-governmental organizations. Technical institutions, networks, and organizations that have the ability to improve GOARN's capabilities are eligible for partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/alert_and_response/outbreak-network/en/ |title=Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its partners, GOARN is staffed by a variety of individuals who specialize in public health, such as "doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilization experts, emergency management and public health professionals among others."&lt;ref name="Partners:Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_(GOARN)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title=Partners: Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its biggest partner, WHO plays a large role in GOARN. Alongside coordinating its resources to combat outbreaks, WHO provides much of the staffing and assistance for GOARN, though as will be covered later, does not fund GOARN directly. Since the network is primarily led by the WHO, there is some uncertainty as to whether WHO should be considered a partner in GOARN or if the network should be considered a WHO initiative.

Another notable partner is the [[Center for Disease Control]], which sends technical resources and staff to GOARN. The CDC also has a history of resource sharing and cooperation with WHO in order to combat disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_t-iBC3LiEC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=GOARN+CDC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=isv4GUkBWC&amp;sig=w-0SZ3lZH7ZEMrEU9mLTXWDLUjQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr6eGd6uTOAhUOzGMKHf-xAicQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=30 August 2016 |author1=Kenneth H. Mayer  |author2=H.F. Pizer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==

The WHO does not directly fund GOARN. Instead, GOARN members and outside fundraising that is carried out each time there is a new incidence is used to support the GOARN response. The [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] provides GOARN with US$500,000 as a revolving fund, meant to be used for quickly mobilizing response teams. This is known as the WHO-NTI Global Emergency Response Fund, and must be repaid after withdrawal. The GOARN is effective at operating from a fairly small budget.&lt;ref name="Exploring the international arena of global public health surveillance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/1/2.full |title=Exploring the international arena of global public health surveillance |date=28 September 2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=30 August 2016 |author=Philippe Calain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field missions==

GOARN has responded to over 120 occurrences in 85 countries and has deployed over 2,300 experts into the field.&lt;ref name="Partners:Global_Outbreak_Alert_and_Response_Network_(GOARN)" /&gt; Some examples of deployments are the SARS outbreak in Asia in 2003, Rift Valley fever, and the nipah virus around the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name="CDC Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/pdfs/atlanta/john_mackenzie.pdf |title=GOARN and One Health: Nipahvirus as a source of lessons learnt |date=26 April 2000 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=4 September 2016 |author=John S. Mackenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field missions overview===

Since its creation, GOARN cooperated with various other organizations to control outbreaks and improve national capacity to respond to diseases. A brief history of GOARN's work against international diseases is as follows. In 2000–2003, GOARN primarily responded to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever in Africa. It supported field investigation and outbreak containment. In 2003, GOARN helped to deploy international teams and helped to coordinate the response against SARS. In 2004, the network was one of the first to deploy against H5N1 influenza. In April–July 2005, GOARN helped to control Marburg Hemorrhagic fever in Angola. It carried out some "risk assessment and preparedness missions" in 2006, along with some response to human bird flu. In 2008/2009, GOARN responded to cholera in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="Independent_Evaluation_of_GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ihr/publications/WHO_HSE_GCR_GOARN_2011_2.pdf |title=Independent Evaluation of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network |date=1 April 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016 |author1=Egbert Sondorp |author2=Christoper Ansell |author3=Robert Hartley Stevens |author4=Emma Denton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and SARS===

GOARN played a role in containing the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia. The network sent teams of experts in epidemiology, microbiology/virology, and infection control to Hanoi, Vietnam in March 14, 2003 and then Beijing China in March 25, 2003. GOARN assisted during this outbreak to not only study the outbreak and provide assistance, but also facilitate communication between the [[Department of Health (Hong Kong)]] and the WHO.&lt;ref name="SARS_Operational_Update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/sars/goarn/en/ |title=Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Operational Update |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest signs of the outbreak in China were reported February 11–24, when multiple people were reported to contract the disease. WHO was notified February 28 and then directly notified GOARN March 13. The first members of a WHO/GOARN outbreak control team arrived in Hong Kong March 14, followed by another 5-person GOARN team 12 days later. This second team transitioned to Guangdong, where they investigated the earliest cases of SARS and conducted interviews with health staff. The outbreak was declared by WHO to be contained by July 5.&lt;ref name="SARS_Chronology"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ |title= Update 95-SARS: Chronology of a serial killer |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, GOARN carried out many of the operations for the initial response to SARS through the mobilization of field teams. Also through GOARN, the WHO developed many international networks to create tools and standards for containing the epidemic. These networks communicated data by teleconference and use of secure websites for sharing of information.

Besides these networks and field teams, GOARN also assisted nations by directly providing assistance to affected areas and improving their capacity to respond to such threats in the future. GOARN's role in the outbreak was recognized by the World Health Assembly during the 56th Assembly in resolution WHA56.29.&lt;ref name="WHO_Response_to_SARS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92476/ |title=The WHO Response to SARS and Preparations for the Future |publisher= National Academies Press |accessdate= 30 October 2016 |author1=J.S.

Slattery |author11=G. Thomson |author12=D. Werker |author13=M. Ryan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and Ebola===

On March 23, 2014, the first reports of Ebola in Guinea were reported by WHO's Regional Office in Africa. Five days later, the first GOARN team was sent to Guinea. This team found the situation to be quite severe and its findings were discussed in a press conference in Geneva April 8.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/one-year-report/who-response/en/ |title=Key Events in the WHO Response to the Ebola outbreak |date=1 January 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third week of April, WHO collaborated with GOARN to send a new medical team trained in infection prevention/control and intensive care to Guinea's principal hospital, Donka Hospital. Two weeks later, on May 5, WHO deployed experts, thirty three of whom were from GOARN, to West Africa to assist in the response to the outbreak. The outbreak was detected to have spread to Sierre Leone later in the month.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola" /&gt;

On June 23, a GOARN steering committee session sent a message to WHO requesting for WHO to lead the response more strongly because it was the only agency with the resources and staff to do so.&lt;ref name="WHO Report Ebola" /&gt;

Over the course of the outbreak, the network deployed 895 experts, including "doctors, nurses, infection control specialists, logisticians, laboratory specialists; communication, anthropology and social mobilisation experts, emergency management and public health professionals." The network is still involved in the response to Ebola.&lt;ref name="GOARN_EBOLA_2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title= Partners: Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate= 30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and cholera===
In Sierre Leone, GOARN has sent case management and laboratory experts from the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh]] to help train the response capacity of health care and laboratory workers case management and diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Cholera_Sierra_Leone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/partners/en/ |title=Cholera in Sierra Leone-update (8 October 2012) |date=8 October 2012 | publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Iraq, the [[Syrian Civil War]] displaced many refugees into the Kurdistan. The refugee camps suffer from poor sanitation, which has led to cholera outbreaks in the region in 2007 and 2012. GOARN, as per the request of the [[Ministry of Health (Iraq)|Ministry of Health of Iraq]] for support and training in outbreak response, deployed a multidisciplinary team of six experts to the Northern Iraqian Dohuk and Erbil camps to assist with assessing the risk of cholera and other diseases as well as assisting MoH to prepare for response to the diseases.&lt;ref name="Northern_Iraq_Cholera"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ghdonline.org/yp-chronic/discussion/whogoarn-request-for-technical-assistance-for-chol/ |title=WHO/GOARN Request for technical assistance for Cholera Control in Northern Iraq |date=21 May 2014 |publisher=GHDonline |accessdate=30 October 2016 |author=Shushmita Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GOARN and H1N1===

GOARN supported countries and various other outbreak control organizations to fight against the H1N1 outbreak in the US and Mexico. The GOARN alert and request for assistance started in Mexico April 24, 2009. Over the course of the outbreak, GOARN helped the [[Pan American Health Organization]] coordinate and exchange information with the CDC and [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. It was provided with support and training from the Regional Office for the Western Pacific Response so that it could support regional offices in Manila and carry out field missions in Malaysia and Mongolia. The network carried out a joint training course with the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Cairo.&lt;ref name="H1N1_and_GOARN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/h1n1_donor_032011.pdf |title=Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All in all, GOARN carried out 188 missions to 27 countries to strengthen international coordination between these organizations and to improve international capacity to respond to threats. Its activities consisted of assessment of the situation, communication between partners, infection control, laboratory diagnostic, and transportation of specimens.&lt;ref name="H1N1_and_GOARN" /&gt;

'''Glory''' is a fictional character in the [[television series]] ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' portrayed by [[Clare Kramer]]. Glory is a god from a hell dimension and was the [[Big Bad|main antagonist]] of the fifth season.

==Character biography==

===History===
Glorificus (also known as "Glory") is a god from a hell dimension in which she ruled alongside two other deities. Her power and dominion were vast and continued to grow stronger and stronger, as did her lust for misery and destruction, and she quickly became the most powerful of the three hell gods. Fearful that Glorificus would seize total control of the dimension for herself, the other two allied together and went to war against her. The hell gods barely defeated her, but despite their victory, she was too powerful to destroy, so they banished her into the earthly dimension, where her essence would be imprisoned in a human child named [[Ben (Buffyverse)|Ben]], created solely to "contain" her until he eventually died as a mortal, sealing her.

Glory was too powerful to be completely contained within the human vessel and when Ben reached his 20s, Glory began to gain control over Ben for short periods of time, taking the form of a vain, self-centered human female possessing superhuman strength, speed and invulnerability. Glory's strength was greater than that of any Slayer, vampire or demon on Earth, although her powers were greatly diminished compared with those she had in her true form. [[Dark magick]]s prevent humans from learning that Glory and Ben are one and the same; even when she transforms right in front of someone, they instantly forget what they saw. The spell does not affect supernatural creatures like vampires and demons. This becomes a recurring joke in the penultimate episode of Season Five, where Spike finds himself repeatedly having to explain that Ben and Glory are the same person, only for people to either to misunderstand him or to instantly forget. As Ben and Glory's personalities begin to merge more and more (see below), the magic weakens until, in the finale, the whole gang is able to see through it. This human form is Glory's only weakness; if the human vessel containing her is killed, then Glory perishes with him.

Glory's goal is to find the Key, a "mystical energy nexus" which is the only way for her to return to her original dimension. Unfortunately, using the Key will break down the barriers between all dimensions, causing all worlds to bleed into each other and allowing "Hell to reign on Earth". The Key was safe, guarded by an ancient group of monks known as The Order of Dagon. When they discovered "The Beast" (Glory) was searching for the Key they chose to hide it. Using ancient magic they transformed the Key into a human girl and placed her under the protection of the Slayer [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]], altering the memories of the Slayer and anyone connected to her into believing the girl was Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]]. The Order of Dagon were eventually destroyed by Glory. The last monk of the order was taken prisoner and interrogated by Glory, and later rescued by Buffy. Before the monk died from his wounds he revealed to Glory (under torture) that the Key had been transformed, but not what the Key had become. The monk, after being rescued by Buffy, revealed to Buffy that Dawn was the Key, something she already suspected.

Glory was also opposed by a [[Military order (society)|military order]] known as the "Knights of Byzantium", composed of knights and clerics. They swore to prevent Glory from using the Key, and they attempted to kill Dawn before Glory could find her. In the episode "[[Spiral (Buffy episode)|Spiral]]", a large group of knights besiege Buffy and Dawn, but Glory arrives and slaughters nearly all of them, taking the Key with her.

===The Key===
The Key is an ancient power, an ancient green mystical energy that according to Glory "is almost as old as she is". The Key needs to draw on powers from the dimension it's in before being used, which is why it can only be used at a certain time and certain place. Who or what created the Key or how is unknown, even its true purpose is never fully revealed. The Key seems to work by destroying the barriers that separate one dimension from another. The longer the Key is in use, the more the walls of reality begin to break down. When the Key is activated, a small portal opens and begins to grow, in which demons, creatures and entire dimensions begin immediately bleeding through. 

Buffy's first confrontation with Glory came shortly after discovering there was something not right about Dawn. Buffy tried to go up against Glory and failed miserably. Glory beat Buffy severely, destroying an entire building in the process. The only thing Buffy did manage to do was escape during a temper tantrum by Glory which caused the building to collapse, escaping with the last surviving monk who quickly revealed to her the truth about Dawn being the Key and Buffy as her protector.

===Sunnydale===

Although Glory enters early on in Season 5, the [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] knows very little about her, only discovering her name from one of Glory's minions. Glory's god-like status, her extreme power level, her origins, the Key's true nature and history are not known until later episodes. Glory comes to [[Sunnydale]] looking for "The Key", which will allow her to return to her own dimension. The Key would cause damage to all dimensions, including the dimension [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and her friends inhabit, though Glory seems to be unaware or unconcerned of this fact. Glory is not aware of what form the Key has taken, though she knows that Buffy, the Slayer, protects it. For her part, Buffy is not initially aware of the Key's nature either. It is eventually revealed that Buffy's "new sister", [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], is the Key, in human form.

She begins the quest to locate the Key, aided by a race of pale, black-eyed demons who are loyal to her almost to a fault, though she does not care for them and viciously abuses them, both verbally and physically, for even the slightest failures. Glory quickly establishes herself as one of Buffy's most dangerous and determined enemies. At one point, she confronts Buffy in her own home, openly threatening to kill Buffy's friends and family and force Buffy herself to watch her do so.

Due to Glory being a god in a human body, the human mind can not control such power and this gradually turns Glory insane. In order to maintain her sanity and power, Glory feeds off the mental energies of humans by a process that Buffy and her friends refer to as "brain-sucking". She inserts her fingers into the victim's head, absorbing the energies that bind the victim's mind. The humans that she "devours" in this way become incoherent and mentally unstable; those affected are also able to see Dawn in her true form. Glory's arrival in Sunnydale is followed by an inexplicable increase in the number of mental patients. One of her unfortunate victims is [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]]'s girlfriend, [[Tara Maclay|Tara]], who later inadvertently betrays Dawn to Glory. The Scoobies try to run, but Glory still manages to kidnap Dawn shortly afterward. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ben-glory.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ben, the human shell of Glory.]] --&gt;

The Key can only be used at a certain time, and as that time draws near, the power that separates Glory from Ben dissolves. They still inhabit Ben's body separately, but their memories and personalities begin to blur together.

After recovering from a mental breakdown caused by Glory's kidnapping of Dawn, Buffy decides to attack Glory with everything she has: Willow's magic spell to restore Tara's sanity stolen by Glory, at the same time weakening Glory's mind; the Dagon Sphere (a weapon created by the monks that causes physical pain to Glory); Buffy's robot double (the "[[Buffybot]]") originally Spike's sex toy; Olaf, The Troll God's Hammer (with which Buffy is able beat Glory in battle and severely weaken her albeit temporarily, due to the hammer being a weapon of the gods); and eventually a [[wrecking ball]], commandeered by [[Xander Harris|Xander]]. Meanwhile, Spike, [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], and [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] attack her minions. The final spell that opens the rift between dimensions had already been started by one of Glory's disciples - [[Doc (Buffyverse)|Doc]] - by cutting Dawn with a knife and making her bleed (the act of which opens a portal to the other dimensions). After killing Doc, Buffy realizes that because the monks created Dawn from her essence, they share the same blood which means not only Dawn's blood but her own can close the portal, but it would also require her to die (her blood must stop flowing for the gateway to close). After saying goodbye to her sister, Buffy jumps into the portal that is opening, instantly dying and closing the gateway.

Glory is left defeated and significantly weakened, losing her hold on this reality and returning to the form and mind of Ben. Giles knows that Glory will eventually regain her power and return to get her revenge on Buffy unless Ben is killed, so he smothers Ben to death with his bare hands, ensuring that Glory can never return.

Glory is also referred to as "Glorificus" by her minions and in most textual references, and occasionally as "The Beast" by the monks who created Dawn (although she has nothing to do with [[Beast (Buffyverse)|The Beast]] who appeared in ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', the spin-off series of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'').

After Glory's defeat, her final appearance in the series is at the end of the episode "[[Lessons (Buffy episode)|Lessons]]", as an avatar of [[First Evil|the First Evil]] along with most of the other major villains from the series.

==Name==
"That Which Cannot Be Named" came into existence [[Prehistory|before written word]], and therefore (as its title implies) has no name. When the hell-god came to this dimension, she was dubbed "Glorificus" or sometimes "Glorifius," names which she shortened to "Glory." She was also known as "the Glorious One" (among many other amusing, groveling titles such as "Her Splendiferousness," "Her Sparkling Luminescence" and "Oh Sweaty-Naughty-Feelings-Causing One") by her demon minions, and as "the Beast" or "the Abomination" by the human priesthood and the [[Knights of Byzantium]]. The [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] and Ben often refer to her by the insulting name of "Hell-Bitch."

According to Jane Espenson, Glory was originally named Cherry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Powers and abilities==
In Season 5, Episode 13, "Blood Ties," the gang begins discussing the Watcher Council's research on Glory. Buffy asks whether or not Glory, as a god, can summon elements like lightning. Giles responds, "Normally, yes, but since she is in human form, her powers are severely limited." During season five the following were demonstrated:
* '''Near-[[invulnerability]]''': Only a Troll God's hammer was able to do any lasting damage to Glory when used repeatedly. In "Tough Love," Willow's lightning bolts caused her pain, but caused no visible damage, though she comments that Willow's assault "slowed her down". By the time of the season finale, Buffy mentions that Willow was the only one ever successful in actually hurting Glory up to that point. When a building collapses on top of her (see below), she was slowed down, but was unharmed. Similarly, she was unharmed after being hit by a truck. 
* '''Superhuman strength''': Glory possesses enormous [[physical strength]] far beyond that of most, if not all, vampires, demons, or Slayers; in fact, she is considered to be the most physically powerful [[Big Bad]] in the series, shown to be able to inflict massive damage on her opponents through pure brute force and physical strength alone. At one point, a building collapses on her after she repeatedly stomps her foot in a temper tantrum over a broken shoe. In "[[Intervention (Buffy episode)|Intervention]]", she kicked Spike clear across her living room, through a solid wooden door, and to the other end of the room behind said door after losing her patience with him. In "[[Tough Love (Buffy episode)|Tough Love]]", she squeezed Tara's hand to the point where it oozed blood, right before she fed off of her brain. In "[[Spiral (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spiral]]", she punches a hole through the [[Force field (science fiction)|barrier]] that Willow had previously generated. Even Buffy, with her slayer strength, could barely stand toe-to-toe in a fight of brawl.
* '''[[Speedster (fiction)|Superspeed]]''': Glory's super-speed is depicted as a fast-moving blur that is apparently invisible to the naked eye. This is seen when she pursues Buffy and Dawn immediately after Tara, in her insane state, accidentally reveals that Dawn is the Key.
* '''Brain sucking''': The ability to drain the mental energy of humans. This was primarily to maintain her own mental strength, but would also prevent Ben's form from resuming control. Not only does the drain draw out all energy leaving the victims in an insane state, they are also able to visually see the Key's true energy and ultimately become psychically linked to Glory and the Key.
* '''Shroud of [[illusion]]''': A mystical shroud cast to prevent people from learning that she and Ben were the same person, the origins of which are unclear. It only works on humans; vampires, demons, and other non-humans are immune. She loses this capability in the penultimate episode of Season Five.
* '''Creature identification''': The ability to differentiate between vampires and humans and also from any other creature from the Key, as seen in "[[Intervention (Buffy episode)|Intervention]]", when her minions capture Spike under the mistaken impression that he is the Key. And also when they assume Tara is the Key and Glory quickly identifies she is not.
* '''Omnilingualism''': Able to speak and understand any human or demon language. This is known when humans and demons would talk to her in other languages and she would easily be able to interpret and understand.
* '''Magic''': In "[[Shadow (Buffy episode)|Shadow]]", Glory cast an ancient spell that caused an ordinary snake to grow to a massive size and granted it the ability to see the true form of the Key, in addition to making it completely loyal to her. According to Giles, a spell such as that would need enormous levels of magic to perform, and Glory cast it easily.

The extent of Glory's true powers as a hell-god were never revealed or used, though according to Gregor in "[[Spiral (Buffy episode)|Spiral]]", they were beyond what even her compatriot hell-gods could conceive. She later secures Ben's aid in recapturing Dawn by promising him immortality.

==Personality==
Clare Kramer says Glory's strength was her lack of self-doubt: "She was completely secure in herself, focused on what she wanted and dedicated to her cause." Her strength was also [[hubris|her downfall]]; Kramer notes that Glory was unable "to look at more than just herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Doug Petrie, "Joss very much wanted someone who was like the Joker to Batman. Someone who was just dynamic, charismatic and psychotic and we have all that. And Glory looks a lot better in a hot little red dress than the Joker ever did! We've got it all in Glory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Merchandise==
The character's popularity prompted [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond Select Toys]] to release two unique Glory action figures in 2006 and 2007: one figure is modeled on the character wearing her trademark red dress, and the other features the character dressed in black, as seen in "[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]". The latter action figure was released as part of a set, with the other figure being Dawn from the same episode.

A [[maquette]] of Glory was released as part of Electric Tiki's "Tooned-Up Television" line.&lt;ref&gt;Electric Tiki 'Buffy Tooned-Up', [http://www.electrictiki.com/tooned-up/buffy.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in Malaysia}}

'''Healthcare in Malaysia''' is mainly under the Ministry of Health. [[Malaysia]] generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care, operating a [[two-tier health care]] system consisting of both a government base [[universal healthcare]] system and a co-existing private healthcare system. Infant mortality rate – a standard in determining the overall efficiency of healthcare – in 2005 was 10, comparing favourably with the United States and western Europe. Life expectancy at birth in 2005 was 74 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/malaysia.html |title=UNICEF website for data from 2005 |publisher=Unicef.org |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Healthcare in Malaysia has undergone radical transformations. Earliest pre-colonial medical care was confined to traditional remedies current among local populations of [[Malaysian Malays|Malays]], [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]], Indian and other ethnic groups. The advent of colonialism brought western medical practice into the country. Since the country's independence in August 1957, the system of medical care transferred from the British colonial rule has been transformed to meet the needs of emerging diseases, as well as national political requirements.

==Healthcare today in Malaysia==

Malaysia has a widespread system of health care. It implements a universal healthcare system, which exists along the private healthcare system.&lt;ref name="HealthCareExpat"/&gt; Infant mortality rate, a standard in determining the overall efficiency of healthcare, in 2005 was 10, comparing favourably with the United States and Western Europe. Life expectancy at birth in 2005 was 74 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/malaysia_statistics.html |title=Malaysia – Statistics |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infant mortality fell from 75 per 1000 live births in 1957 to 7 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare in Malaysia is divided into private and public sectors. Public provision is rather basic, especially in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government produced a plan, ''1Care for 1Malaysia'', in 2009, with the intention of reform based on the principle ‘use according to need, pay according to ability’, but little progress towards its implementation has been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Better healthcare for all|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2F2011%2F12%2F3%2Ffocus%2F10023345|accessdate=15 November 2015|publisher=The Star|date=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malaysian society places importance on the expansion and development of healthcare, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into [[publicly-funded health care|public healthcare]], an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of [[telehealth]]. Over the last couple of years, they have increased their efforts to overhaul the systems and attract more foreign investment.

===Hospitals===
{{main|List of hospitals in Malaysia}}
The government hospitals have the country's best healthcare equipment and facilities apart from having specialists in the field. However, the main drawback is the shortage of staff in public hospitals compare to number of patients seeking treatment has led to long queues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public or private hospitals? The choice is yours|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/02/18/public-or-private-hospitals-the-choice-is-yours/|publisher=The Borneo Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private hospitals are mostly located at urban areas and are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities. Private hospitals were not seen as an ideal investment: it has often taken up to ten years before companies have seen any profits. However, the situation has now changed and companies are now exploring this area again, corresponding with the increased number of foreigners entering Malaysia for medical care and the recent government focus on developing the [[medical tourism|health tourism]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitpenang.gov.my/portal3/medical-tourism.html|title=Penang Medical Tourism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912041445/http://www.visitpenang.gov.my/portal3/medical-tourism.html|archivedate=12 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/mediacentre.asp?page=news_desk&amp;subpage=archive&amp;news_id=127|title=Media Release:Health Tourism in Malaysia|first=Ministry of Tourism|publisher=[[Tourism Malaysia]]|accessdate=21 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government has also been trying to promote Malaysia as a health care destination, regionally and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myhealthcare.gov.my/en/index.asp?page=MHTC&amp;subpage=MHTC_mission |title=The Official Site of Malaysia Healthcare Travel &amp; Medical Tourism |publisher=Myhealthcare.gov.my |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=17 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017064513/http://www.myhealthcare.gov.my/en/index.asp?page=MHTC&amp;subpage=MHTC_mission |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government agencies have invested heavily in healthcare companies. About a third of private hospital beds are in concerns with government investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policy and action==
The Malaysian government places importance on the expansion and development of health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into public health care—an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and ageing population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of [[telehealth]]. A major problem with the health care sector is the lack of medical centres for rural areas, which the government is trying to counter through the development of and expansion of a system called "[[telehealth|tele-primary care]]".&lt;ref name="HealthCareExpat"&gt;{{cite web|author=moveforward |url=http://www.expatforum.com/articles/health/health-care-in-malaysia.html |title=Health Care in Malaysia |publisher=Expatforum.com |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the overperscription of drugs, though this has decreased in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianzworldwidecare.com/healthcare-in-malaysia |title=Healthcare in Malaysia |publisher=Allianzworldwidecare.com |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last couple of years, the Malaysian Health Ministry has increased its efforts to overhaul the system and attract more foreign investment.

===Influenza===
The [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] has developed a National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP) which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non-governmental organisations to ensure that resources are mobilised and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moh.gov.my/MohPortal/DownloadServlet?id=2873&amp;type=2 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509001006/http://www.moh.gov.my/MohPortal/DownloadServlet?id=2873&amp;type=2 |date=9 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Henipavirus|Nipah]] virus outbreak in 1999, the Malaysian Health Ministry have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. [[Malaysia]] was fully prepared during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)]] situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 (bird flu)]] outbreak in 2004.

===Medicine via Post===
In January 2011 the Malaysia government launched a program to renew prescriptions via mail. Medicine via Post targets patients with chronic diseases. To be eligible to participate patients have to receive a certification from a pharmacist that their condition is stable and that they understand how to properly use their medication. Patients pay delivery costs which are RM3.5 in Putrajaya, RM5.0 for other locations in Peninsular Malaysia, and RM8.0 for Sabah and Sarawak. The program is based on a pilot-project conducted at Putrajaya Hospital started in October 2009.&lt;ref name="medpost"&gt;Medicine via Post in govt hospitals, by Husa Yusop, 24 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical education==
{{See also|List of medical schools in Malaysia}}
The Malaysian health care system requires doctors to perform a compulsory three years service with public hospitals to ensure that the manpower in these hospitals is maintained.&lt;ref name="HealthCareExpat"/&gt; Doctors are required to perform 4 years including 2 years of housemanship and 2 years government service with public hospitals throughout the nation, ensuring adequate coverage of medical needs for the general population. Foreign doctors are encouraged to apply for employment in Malaysia, especially if they are qualified to a higher level. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment. As a result, certain medical care and treatment is available only in large cities.

'''Henry Stanislaus Spalding, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]''' (1865-1934) was the author of several books about medical ethics but was best known for his series of adventure books for boys.  His stories incorporated elements of the Catholic faith as well as history and outdoor adventure.

==Early life==
Henry Stanislaus Spalding was born January 10, 1865 in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="newsletter"&gt;Obituary in ''The Jesuit Province Newsletter,'' vol. XIII, No. 33, March 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lineage"&gt;''Lineage: A Biographical History of the Chicago Province'' by Edmund J. Fortman, Loyola University Press, Chicago, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spalding family was staunchly Catholic, having been among the early English settlers of the colony of [[Maryland]], and with other families had settled in the Bardstown/Rolling Fork area, which later grew into the first Catholic diocese west of the Appalachians.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lifeofmostrevmjs00inspal ''The Life of the Most Rev. M.J. Spalding, D.D.''], by J. L. Spalding, The Catholic Publication Society, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the descendants of these original Spalding settlers were the Most Reverend [[Martin John Spalding]], Archbishop of Baltimore from 1864 to 1872, and [[John Lancaster Spalding]], who was Bishop of Peoria from 1877-1908.  Though not as illustrious as these two, among Henry's siblings were a Dominican priest and four Dominican nuns.&lt;ref name="newsletter" /&gt;

==Jesuit priest and educator==
Spalding entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] novitiate at [[Florissant, Missouri]] on August 7, 1884 and spent five years teaching at Marquette College (now [[Marquette University]]) from 1888-1893 before completing his studies for the priesthood at [[St. Louis University]] and [[Woodstock College]].&lt;ref name="newsletter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lineage" /&gt;  Here he was ordained in 1899 by Cardinal [[James Gibbons]].  He later returned to Marquette, where he held the post of Prefect of Studies and Discipline from 1903-1908.  During this time, with then-president of Marquette, Alexander Burrowes, he helped establish the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy (now the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]]), of which he subsequently was appointed regent.&lt;ref name="newsletter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anchor"&gt;''[http://cdm16123.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15443coll1/id/639 An Anchor For The Future: A History of the Medical College of Wisconsin.]'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 Spalding worked with Burrowes once more to establish the Loyola University School of Medicine (now the [[Stritch School of Medicine]]), where he remained Regent until 1917.&lt;ref name="stritch loyola"&gt;''[http://ssom.luc.edu/about/history/ History of Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University.]''. Retrieved 2015-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both here and at Marquette, the establishment of these medical schools involved mergers with secular schools, and coming under the authority of these Catholic institutions meant that certain subjects that contradicted Catholic teaching had to be avoided.&lt;ref name="anchor" /&gt;  Perhaps as a result of this, Spalding began teaching medical ethics at this time, produced several textbooks on the subject, and would later develop a specialty in Sociology, crowning his career with a textbook on the subject, in collaboration with fellow Jesuit Herbert Muntsch.&lt;ref name="mariale"&gt;''Mariale: Journal of St. Francis Seminary'', Loretto, PA, 1930, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic author==
Spalding began publishing stories for boys in 1901, beginning with ''The Cave of the Beech Fork'' and following it in 1903 with ''The Sheriff of the Beech Fork''.  Both stories are set in 1815 in Spalding's hometown of Bardstown, Kentucky, and mention actual figures such as [[William Byrne (Catholic)|William Byrne]] and Bishop [[Benedict Joseph Flaget]], both of whom figured heavily in the life of his relative, Archbishop Martin John Spalding.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt;  The historical setting and the outdoors adventures in these books prompted [[Maurice Francis Egan]] to say of them, "In ''The Cave by the Beech Fork'' a new genre is credited in American Catholic Literature...all the fresh air books provided for boys had hitherto been written by non-Catholics..."&lt;ref name="who"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J6wNAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:DuHGUcVzYd4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMI3ubOp-PCxwIVy1s-Ch0VBggk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The American Catholic Who’s Who''] by Georgina Pell Curtis, B. Herder, 1911, p.616.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spalding's special study of [[Jacques Marquette]] formed the basis for his next historical novels, ''The Race for Copper Island'' and ''The Marks of the Bear Claws'', and his appointment as [[Knights of Columbus]] chaplain to Camp Johnson in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] during [[World War I]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.slu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/woodstock/id/26560/rec/54 ''Woodstock Letters''], Volume 49, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; gave him the impetus to write two books set in the Everglades, ''Held in the Everglades'' and ''Signals from the Bay Tree''.  And having descended from early Maryland settlers, he prepared for the Maryland Tercentenary in 1934 by writing ''Catholic Colonial Maryland'' as well as the historical novel ''Arrows of Iron''.&lt;ref name="newsletter" /&gt;

==Illness and death==
In 1932 Spalding was diagnosed with [[pernicious anemia]] and was not expected to live, but he recovered and was able to celebrate his Golden Jubilee on August 12, 1934.  Early that fall, however, the anemia returned, and as he worsened, he was given [[last rites]] and was visited by several of his siblings one last time before slipping into a coma and passing away on December 27, 1934.&lt;ref name="newsletter" /&gt;

'''Hormonal contraception''' refers to [[birth control]] methods that act on the [[endocrine system]]. Almost all methods are composed of [[steroid hormones]], although in [[India]] one [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] is marketed as a contraceptive. The original hormonal method—the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]—was first marketed as a contraceptive in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Scott Ricci |author2=Terri Kyle |year=2009 |chapter=Common Reproductive Issues|title=Contraception |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing decades many other delivery methods have been developed, although the oral and injectable methods are by far the most popular. Altogether, 18% of the world's contraceptive users rely on hormonal methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, Rachel K. |year=2011 |title= Beyond Birth Control: The Overlooked Benefits Of Oral Contraceptive Pills|journal=Guttmacher Institute |volume=November|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Beyond-Birth-Control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hormonal contraception is highly effective: when taken on the prescribed schedule, users of steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year. Perfect-use pregnancy rates for most hormonal contraceptives are usually around the 0.3% rate or less.&lt;ref name="npsnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_news/current/hormonal_contraception_tailoring_for_the_individual |title=NPS News 54: Hormonal contraceptives - tailoring for the individual |author=National Prescribing Service |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently available methods can only be used by women; the development of a [[male hormonal contraceptive]] is an active research area.

There are two main types of hormonal contraceptive formulations: ''combined methods'' which contain both an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and a [[progestin]], and ''progestogen-only methods'' which contain only [[progesterone]] or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). Combined methods work by suppressing [[ovulation]] and thickening [[cervical mucus]]; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is much more common with progestogen-only methods. Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives are not believed to be caused by progestogen-only formulations: [[deep vein thrombosis]] is one example of this.

==Medical uses==
Hormonal contraception is primarily used for the prevention of [[pregnancy]], but is also prescribed for the treatment of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], menstrual disorders such as [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[menorrhagia]], and [[hirsutism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hormonal Contraceptives Offer Benefits Beyond Pregnancy Prevention|url=http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2009/Hormonal_Contraceptives_Offer_Benefits_Beyond_Pregnancy_Prevention|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polycystic ovary syndrome===
Hormonal treatments, such as hormonal contraceptives, are frequently successful at alleviating symptoms associated with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. [[Birth control pills]] are often prescribed to reverse the effects of excessive [[androgen]] levels, and decrease ovarian hormone production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dysmenorrhea===
Hormonal birth control methods such as [[birth control pills]], the [[contraceptive patch]], [[vaginal ring]], [[contraceptive implant]], and [[hormonal IUD]] are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary [[dysmenorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noncontraceptive Benefits of Birth Control Pills|url=http://www.reproductivefacts.org/Noncontraceptive_Benefits_of_Birth_Control_Pills_factsheet/|work=Reproductivefacts.org|publisher=The American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysmenorrhea|url=http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq046.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20130509T0012463128|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menorrhagia===
[[Oral contraceptives]] are prescribed in the treatment of [[menorrhagia]] to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The [[hormonal IUD]] ([[Mirena]]) releases [[levonorgestrel]] which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/menorrhagia/DS00394/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs|work=The Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hirsutism===
Birth control pills are the most commonly prescribed hormonal treatment for [[hirsutism]], as they prevent [[ovulation]] and decrease [[androgen]] production by the [[ovaries]]. Additionally, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] in the pills stimulates the liver to produce more of a protein that binds to androgens and reduces their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
Modern contraceptives using steroid hormones have ''perfect-use'' or ''method'' failure rates of less than 1% per year.

==Side effects==

===Cancers===
*There is a mixed effect of combined hormonal contraceptives on the rates of various cancers, with the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) stating: "It was concluded that, if the reported association was causal, the excess risk for breast cancer associated with typical patterns of current use of combined oral contraceptives was very small."&lt;ref name=IARC99 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IARC2007&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] | work = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | volume = 91 | year = 2007 | title = Combined Estrogen-Progestogen Contraceptives | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol91/mono91-6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also saying that "there is also conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium":&lt;ref name=IARC99&gt;{{cite book | author=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) | title=Oral Contraceptives, Combined | edition=Vol. 72 | year=1999 | chapter=5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation | chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-1.html | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The (IARC) notes that "the weight of the evidence suggests a small increase in the relative risk for breast cancer among current and recent users" which following discontinuation then lessens over a period of 10 years to similar rates as women who never used them, as well as "The increase in risk for breast cancer associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives in younger women could be due to more frequent contacts with doctors" &lt;ref name=IARC2007/&gt;
* Small increases are also seen in the rates of [[cervical cancer]] and [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular (liver) tumours]].
* [[Endometrial cancer|Endometrial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endometrial cancer and oral contraceptives: an individual participant meta-analysis of 27 276 women with endometrial cancer from 36 epidemiological studies|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 4, 2015|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00212-0|volume=16|pages=1061–1070|pmid=26254030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ovarian cancer]] risks are approximately halved and persists for at least 10 years after cessation of use; although "sequential oral contraceptives which were removed from the consumer market in the 1970s was associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer".
* Studies have overall not shown effects on the relative risks for colorectal, malignant melanoma or thyroid cancers.
* Information on progesterone-only pills is less extensive, due to smaller sampling sizes, but they do not appear to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=iarc72&gt;{{cite book |author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |title=Hormonal contraception and post-menopausal hormonal therapy; IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, Volume 72 |year=1999 |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |isbn=92-832-1272-X |pages=339&amp;ndash;397 |chapter=Hormonal contraceptives, progestogens only |chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most other forms of hormonal contraception are too new for meaningful data to be available, although risks and benefits are believed to be similar for methods which use the same hormones; e.g., risks for combined-hormone patches are thought to be roughly equivalent to those for combined-hormone pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2007-07-13| url=http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/Handouts/orthoevra_patch.html| title=McKinley Health Center, University of Illinois: OrthoEvra Contraceptive Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular disease===
Combined oral contraceptives can increase the risk of certain types of cardiovascular disease in women with a pre-existing condition or already-heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Smoking (for women over 35), metabolic conditions like diabetes, obesity and family history of heart disease are all risk factors which may be exacerbated by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives.&lt;ref name="npsnews" /&gt;

===Blood Clots===
Hormonal contraception methods are consistently linked with the risk of developing blood clots. However, the risk does vary depending on the hormone type or birth control method being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Clots with Hormonal Contraception|url=http://www.hormonesmatter.com/blood-clots-hormonal-contraception/|website=Hormones Matter|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two main classes of hormonal contraceptives: ''combined contraceptives'' contain both an estrogen (usually [[ethinylestradiol]]) and a [[progestin]]. ''Progestogen-only contraceptives'' contain only [[progesterone]] or a synthetic analogue (progestin). Also marketed is [[ormeloxifene]]; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.

===Combined===
The most popular form of hormonal contraception, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is known colloquially as ''the pill''. It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]: this is known as the [[Yuzpe regimen]]. COCPs are available in [[oral contraceptive formulations|a variety of formulations]].

The [[contraceptive patch]] is applied to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. [[NuvaRing]] is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraception]].

Some [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s can be administered as one injection per month.

===Progestogen-only===
The [[progestogen only pill]] (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window. [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen only pills|Several different formulations]] of POP are marketed. A low-dose formulation is known as ''the minipill''. Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]. There are a number of [[Emergency contraceptive availability by country|dedicated products]] sold for this purpose.

Hormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as [[intrauterine system]]s (IUS) or Intrauterine Devices (IUD). An IUS/IUD must be inserted by a health professional. The copper IUD does not contain hormones. While a copper-containing IUD may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose.

[[Depo Provera]] is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection. Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |title=Noristerat Injection |work=About.com |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/g/Noristerat.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contraceptive implants]] are inserted under the skin of the upper arm, and contain progesterone only. [[Jadelle]] (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones. It is effective for five years. Nexplanon has replaced the former [[Implanon]] and is also a single rod that releases etonogestrel (similar to the body's natural progesterone). The only difference between Implanon and Nexplanon is Nexplanon is radio opaque and can be detected by x-ray. This is needed for cases of implant migration. It is effective for three years and is usually done in office. It is over 99% effective. It works in 3 ways: 
1. Prevents ovulation- usually an egg does not mature
2. thickens cervical mucus so to prevent sperm from reaching the egg
3. If those 2 fail, the last is the progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to be too thin for implantation.

===Ormeloxifene===
[[Ormeloxifene]] is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in [[India]].&lt;ref name="centron"/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood.

===Combined===
Combined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. They inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.&lt;br/&gt;Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|pages=19–152|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first=Ellis R.|last2=Hammes|first2=Stephen R.|year=2011|chapter=Estrogens and progestins|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first=Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Björn C.|title=Goodman &amp; Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics|edition=12th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|pages=1163–1194|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glasier|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J.

Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

The estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;
* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].
* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].
* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.

Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

===Progestogen-only===
The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"/&gt;

Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant [[Jadelle]] and the [[intrauterine system]] Mirena. These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the [[cervical mucus]] and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.

Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Implanon]]), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens.

High dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.

In [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).

===Ormeloxifene===
Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation. It has been shown to increase the rate of [[blastocyst]] development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the [[fallopian tube]]s into the uterus. Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (the transformation of the endometrium in preparation for possible implantation of an embryo).&lt;ref name="centron"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centchroman |work=Reproductive Health Online |year=2003 |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1advances/old/1centch/ceorvw.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are believed to prevent [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] rather than [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], exactly how these effects operate to prevent pregnancy is not understood.

==Frequency of use==
Pills—combined and progestogen-only—are the most common form of hormonal contraception. Worldwide, they account for 12% of contraceptive use. 21% of users of reversible contraceptives choose COCPs or POPs. Pills are especially popular in more developed countries, where they account for 25% of contraceptive use.&lt;!--

==History==
In 1921, [[Ludwig Haberlandt]] demonstrated a temporary hormonal contraception in a female rabbit by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Müller-Jahncke WD | title = Ludwig Haberlandt (1885-1932) and the development of hormonal contraception | language = German| journal = Z Gesamte Inn Med | volume = 43 | issue = 15 | pages = 420–2 | date = Aug 1988 | pmid = 3051743 | url = | laysummary = | oclc = | id = | bibcode = | accessdate = | location = GERMANY, EAST | laydate = | format = | quote = | publisher = | issn = 0044-2542 | laysource = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined the structure of the [[steroid hormones]] and found that high doses of [[androgens]], [[estrogen]]s, or [[progesterone]] inhibited [[ovulation]].&lt;!--

In 1957 [[Enovid]], the first COCP, was approved in the [[United States]] for the treatment of menstrual disorders. In 1960, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved an application that allowed Enovid to be marketed as a contraceptive.&lt;!--

Combined contraceptives have also been made available in a variety of forms. In the 1960s a few [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s were introduced, notably Injectable Number 1 in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and Deladroxate in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research and regulatory approval (of injectable contraceptives) |journal=Population Reports |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=1995-08-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-17773564/research-and-regulatory-approval.html |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third combined injection, Cyclo-Provera, was reformulated in the 1980s by lowering the dose and renamed Cyclofem (also called Lunelle).

In 1991, [[ormeloxifene]] was introduced as a contraceptive in [[India]].&lt;ref name="pmid11410933"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singh MM | title = Centchroman, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, as a contraceptive and for the management of hormone-related clinical disorders | journal = Medical Research Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 302–47 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11410933 | doi = 10.1002/med.1011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it acts on the estrogen hormonal system, it is atypical in that it is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] rather than an estrogen, and has the capacity for both estrogenic and [[antiestrogen]]ic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid11410933" /&gt;

'''Hyperprosexia''', and '''paraprosexia''' are closely related [[medical]] and [[neurology|neuro]]-[[psychiatry|psychiatric]] phenomena associated with attention and concentration. They typically occur in patients suffering traumatic brain injuries.

* ''Aprosexia'' is an abnormal inability to pay attention, characterized by a near-complete indifference to everything.&lt;ref name="titleDefinition: aprosexia from Online Medical Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?aprosexia |title=Definition: aprosexia from Online Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Patients suffering traumatic brain injury experience profound disturbance of the basic functions of the cognitive, behavioral, emotional and intellectual systems. Such patients' ability to regulate interaction between the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] and the external world is greatly diminished and they typically exhibit inflexible, concrete and sometimes inappropriate behaviors.

'''La Clinica del Pueblo''' is a non-profit, Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) clinic that serves the Latino population of the [[Washington, D.C.]], metropolitan area that provides services through medical services, mental health and substance abuse counseling, language access services, and community health action programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://latino.si.edu/virtualgallery/OJOS/bios/bios_Romagoza.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
La Clinica's mission is to build a healthy Latino community through culturally appropriate health services, focusing on those most in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcdp.org/template/page.cfm?id=87 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605071736/http://www.lcdp.org/template/page.cfm?id=87 |archivedate=2010-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
La Clínica del Pueblo (LCDP) was founded in 1983 to address the growing medical needs of Washington's Latino community by Salvadorian activists at the Central American Refugee Center (CARECEN) and "self-proclaimed North American hippies" at [[Plenty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcdp.org/doc/LCDP_Case_Study_Summary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002212801/http://www.lcdp.org/doc/LCDP_Case_Study_Summary.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Salvadorians fled to Washington during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], seeking refuge, but were unable to access traditional forms of health care due to linguistic and cultural barriers and immigration status. LCDP opened to serve these immigrants, as well as other Latin Americans fleeing war-torn countries, but soon started serving the entire Latino community.

Initially, LCDP provided only basic medical care one day a week, at no cost, staffed by volunteer doctors and health promoters. It quickly became a safe place for undocumented refugees to go for care from understanding individuals. As the Latino population grew, so did LCDP. It began to provide many different social services, such as health education and outreach.

===1988-1995===
In 1988, [[Juan Romagoza Arce|Dr. Juan Romagoza]], himself a refugee from [[El Salvador]], became director of LCDP. Under Romagoza, LCDP expanded the scope of its operations to [[alternative medicine]], community health outreach and prevention. In 1989, LCDP received a grant from the DC Mayor's Office of Latino Affairs to start a HIV/AIDS program. In 1990, LCDP received its first multi-year contract from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington]] to provide physicals to Vietnamese refugees.

At this time, LCDP was still operating under [[Central America Resource Center|CARECEN]]. Due its growth, LCDP's staff and patients lobbied for autonomy and in 1995, LCDP became an independent non-profit organization.

===1995–present===
From 1995-2003, LCDP grew rapidly, increasing its budget from $800,000 to $4.6 million. During this period, LCDP also began accepting reimbursements from [[Medicaid]], which meant it was no longer a [[free clinic]]. This period also saw the creation of the interpreter services program, a Social Services Department which provided patients with case managers, and the launch of an [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] prevention program.

In 2000, LCDP received a large grant from the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], which allowed its mental health department to hire full-time therapists for the first time.

In 2007, Romagoza stepped down after 20 years and returned to El Salvador to continue his medical outreach there. Enrique Cobham served as Interim Executive Director until 2009, when Alicia Wilson was appointed as Executive Director. Wilson, who was development director before her appointment as executive director, started at LCDP in 1999 as a case manager. After her appointment as Executive Director, she started "''¡La Clínica Adelante!''", an ambitious agenda to grow LCDP's patient programs as well as its resources.

In 2007, LCDP became a [[Federally Qualified Health Center]] and implemented a sliding-scale payment system, which ended its tenure as a "free-clinic". LCDP currently accepts some forms of private insurance, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], Medicaid and DC alliance.

In 2007, LCDP served 7,500 clients with over 55,000 health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcdp.org/template/page.cfm?id=86 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605071731/http://www.lcdp.org/template/page.cfm?id=86 |archivedate=2010-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=June 2018}} LCDP has a staff of around 115 employees and is located across 5 different sites in Washington DC and Prince George's County, Maryland. 

== Service areas==
LCDP patient services are divided into four different areas. They are:

*'''Medical services''': provides basic health care.
*'''Mental health/substance abuse''': provides substance abuse help and mental health services
*'''Community health action''': works with communities on HIV prevention and other issues, like transgender rights and youth issues.
*'''Interpreter services''': provides patients, staff and the community at large with interpretation services.

'''María Luisa Ávila Agüero''' (born January 30, 1961) is a [[Costa Rica]]n pediatric infectious disease specialist who was {{ill|Ministry of Public Health (Costa Rica)|es|Ministerio de Salud Pública (Costa Rica)|lt=Minister of Public Health}} during the administrations of [[Óscar Arias|Óscar Arias Sánchez]] (2006–2010) and [[Laura Chinchilla|Laura Chinchilla Miranda]] (2010–2014).

==Biography==
The daughter of Claudio Ávila Quirós and Evelia Agüero Garro, María Luisa Ávila Agüero studied at the Escuela República de Paraguay and the Colegio Anastasio Alfaro. She graduated as a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]] from the [[University of Costa Rica]] and specialized in [[Infectious disease (medical specialty)|infectious disease]]. She became the Chief of Infectious Disease at the National Children's Hospital. In 2006, President Óscar Arias Sánchez appointed her Minister of Public Health, and in the following administration, Laura Chinchilla Miranda retained her in the post.

==Arias Sánchez administration==
Through the publication of Executive Decree No. 34510-S "Organic Regulation of the Ministry of Health", a new institutional structure and development of the organizational model was implemented.&lt;ref name=Memoria2009&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/memorias/memoria2010/presentacion.pdf |title=Memoria Institucional 2009 – 4 años de gestión |trans-title=2009 Institutional Report – 4 Years of Management |publisher=Costa Rica Ministry of Public Health |language=Spanish |date=April 30, 2010 |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, through the Executive Decree, the Costa Rica Solid Waste Plan was made official. In 2009, the country achieved the lowest [[infant mortality]] rate in its history, ranking third in Latin America, behind only [[Chile]] and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Memoria2009/&gt;

The basic [[Vaccine|vaccination]] scheme for the entire population was extended, through the incorporation of four new vaccines for children: [[chickenpox]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|pneumococcus]], [[pertussis]], and [[rotavirus]]. In April 2010, Law 8809 was passed, creating the {{ill|National Directorate of CEN-CINAI|es|Dirección Nacional de CEN-CINAI}} and providing it with an organizational and managerial structure, as well as resources to be able to advance the coverage of comprehensive care for the country's children.&lt;ref name=Memoria2009/&gt;

Ávila resumed the program of [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne disease]] control, giving special emphasis to the fight against [[malaria]], which had been abandoned by previous administrations and left in the hands of local levels of the Ministry of Health. Thanks to Dr. Ávila's management, [[Matina (canton)|Matina]]'s Area of Health team was able to obtain support to control the increasing incidence of malaria which had been taking place in that canton of [[Limón Province|Limón]] since the early 2000s, and with that, avoid its spread to the rest of the country's low areas.

At the end of the administration in 2010, Costa Rica reported its lowest incidence of [[dengue fever]] in nine years, and mortality from hemorrhagic dengue remained at 0.&lt;ref name=Memoria2009/&gt;

At the end of July 2009, at the Ministry's request, the [[Catholic Church]] canceled the pilgrimage of the faithful to the city of [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] for the August 2 festival at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels, Cartago|Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels]], due to the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2009/julio/22/pais2034614.html |title=Iglesia y Salud cancelan romería por pandemia de gripe AH1N1 |trans-title=Church and Health Cancel Pilgrimage For H1N1 Flu Pandemic |last=Villegas S. |first=Jairo |work=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=July 22, 2009 |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the Ministry's audit questioned a series of agreements and contracts that it had made with the [[University of Costa Rica]] (UCR) to implement an organizational development process at the institution, for a sum of close to 900 million [[Costa Rican colón|colones]] (approximately US$1.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-02-28/ElPais/FotoVideoDestacado/ElPais2282956.aspx |title=Auditoría cuestiona contrataciones millonarias hechas por Salud |trans-title=Audit Questions Millionaire Hirings Made By Health |last=Mata B. |first=Alonso |work=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=February 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303135933/http://www.nacion.com/2010-02-28/ElPais/FotoVideoDestacado/ElPais2282956.aspx |archive-date=March 3, 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2010, Ávila was part of a group of five ministers – together with Leonardo Garnier (Education), {{ill|Roberto Gallardo Núñez|es|lt=Roberto Gallardo}} (Planning), Marco Vinicio Ruiz (Foreign Trade), and [[María Elena Carballo]] – to ask President Arias Sánchez to promote Bill 16.390 on "[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Costa Rica|civil unions between people of the same sex]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-03-20/ElPais/NotasSecundarias/ElPais2307950.aspx |title=Apoyo de ministros a uniones de homosexuales enoja a la Iglesia |trans-title=Support of Ministers For Homosexual Unions Angers the Church |last=Murillo |first=Álvaro |work=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=March 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323054511/http://www.nacion.com/2010-03-20/ElPais/NotasSecundarias/ElPais2307950.aspx |archive-date=March 23, 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinchilla Miranda administration==
At the beginning of the Chinchilla Miranda administration, due to a lack of foresight and administrative problems at the Ministry of Public Health, a total of 135,000 children and mothers in poverty did not receive milk normally provided by the government. This caused Ávila to be called to appear before the Legislative Assembly, where some confrontations took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/archivo/Diputados-increpan-Ministra-Salud_0_1127487306.html |title=Diputados increpan a Ministra de Salud |trans-title=Deputies Rebuke Minister of Health |last=Mata |first=Esteban |work=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |language=Spanish |date=June 9, 2010 |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, members of the [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|PAC]] and [[Social Christian Unity Party|PUSC]] filed a motion of censure against the Minister of Public Health for friction created after she ordered the closure of 40 offices in the Legislative Assembly's facilities that did not meet appropriate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/archivo/Oposicion-impulsa-censura-ministra-Salud_0_1130086981.html |title=Oposición impulsa moción de censura contra ministra de Salud |trans-title=Opposition Files Motion of Censure Against Minister of Health |last=Mata |first=Esteban |work=[[La Nación (San José)|La Nación]] |location=San José |language=Spanish |date=June 22, 2010 |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

María Luisa Ávila presented her resignation from the Ministry of Public Health in July 2011 for differences with President Laura Chinchilla on the intervention process to seek solutions to various problems in the [[Costa Rican Social Security Fund|Department of Social Security]]. The resignation became effective on September 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.monumental.co.cr/noticia/maria-luisa-avila-dejara-el-ministerio-de-salud |title=María Luisa Ávila dejará el Ministerio de Salud |trans-title=María Luisa Ávila Leaves the Ministry of Health |publisher=Radio Monumental |language=Spanish |date=July 28, 2011 |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="916">The '''Misuse of Drugs Act''' is a national drug control law of [[Belize]] that divides drugs into three classes. There does not seem to be any mechanism for adding, removing, or transferring drugs between classes without amending the statute. Like the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (disambiguation)|Misuse of Drugs Act]]s of other nations, this statute is designed to implement the provisions of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and its supplementary drug control [[treaty|treaties]].

'''Neophobia''' is the fear of anything new, especially a persistent and abnormal [[Fear processing in the brain|fear]]. In its milder form, it can manifest as the unwillingness to try new things or break from routine. In the context of children the term is generally used to indicate a tendency to reject unknown or novel foods.&lt;ref name="pmid21872699"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shim|first1=Jae Eun|last2=Kim|first2=Juhee|last3=Mathai|first3=Rose Ann|last4=STRONG Kids Research|first4=Team.|title=Associations of Infant Feeding Practices and Picky Eating Behaviors of Preschool Children|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=September 2011|volume=111|issue=9|pages=1363–1368|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2011.06.410|pmid=21872699}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Food neophobia|Food neophobia]], as it may be referred to, is an important concern in pediatric [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="pmid17997196"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dovey|first1=Terence M.|last2=Staples|first2=Paul A.|last3=Gibson|first3=E.

In biomedical research, neophobia is often associated with the study of taste.

==Terminology==
The word ''neophobia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] νέος, ''neos'', meaning "new, young",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dne%2Fos1 νέος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος, ''phobos'', for "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cainophobia'' comes from the Greek καινός, ''kainos'', meaning "new, fresh".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkaino%2Fs καινός],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cainophobia Cainophobia], Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative terms for neophobia include '''''metathesiophobia''''', '''''prosophobia''''', '''''cainotophobia''''' (or '''''cainophobia'''''), and '''''kainophobia''''' (or '''''kainolophobia''''').&lt;ref&gt;http://phobialist.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Norway rats]] and [[house mice]] are thought to have evolved increased levels of neophobia as they became [[Commensalism|commensal]] with humans because humans were routinely devising new methods (e.g., [[mousetrap]]s) to eradicate them.&lt;ref name="MeddockOsborn1968"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meddock TD,Osborn DR| title = Neophobia in wild and laboratory mice| journal = Psychonomic Science | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 223–223| date = May 1968 |issn=0033-3131 | doi=10.3758/BF03331280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neophobia is also a common finding in aging animals, although [[apathy]] could also explain, or contribute to explain, the lack of exploratory drive systematically observed in aging. Researchers argued that the lack of exploratory drive was likely due neurophysiologically to the dysfunction of neural pathways connected to the [[prefrontal cortex]] observed during aging.&lt;ref name="pmid7601365"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalonde R, Badescu R |title=Exploratory drive, frontal lobe function and adipsia in aging |journal=Gerontology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=134–44 |year=1995 |pmid=7601365 |doi= 10.1159/000213674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Anton Wilson]] theorized in his book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' that neophobia is instinctual in people after they begin to raise children. Wilson's views on neophobia are mostly negative, believing that it is the reason human culture and ideas do not advance as quickly as our technology. His model includes an idea from [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', which is that new ideas, however well proven and evident, are implemented only when the generations who consider them "new" die and are replaced by generations who consider the ideas accepted and old.

==Food neophobia==

'''Food neophobia''' in humans has been described as the fear of eating new or unfamiliar foods. It differs from [[selective eating disorder]]. Food neophobia is particularly common in toddlers and young children. It is often related to an individual’s level of [[sensation-seeking]], meaning a person's willingness to try new things and take risks. Not only do people with high food neophobia resist trying new food, they also rate new foods that they do try as lower than neophilics.&lt;ref name=Logue&gt;{{cite book|last=Logue|first=A.W.|title=The Psychology of Eating and Drinking|year=2004|publisher=Brunner-Routledge|location=New York|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very typical for people to generally have a fear of new things and to prefer things that are familiar and common. Most people experience food neophobia to a certain extent, though some people are more neophobic than others. A measure of individual differences in food neophobia is the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), which consists of a 10-item survey that requires self-reported responses on a seven-point [[Likert scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pliner|first=P.|author2=K. Hobden|title=Development of a scale to measure the trait of food neophobia in humans|journal=Appetite|year=1992|volume=19|pages=105–120|doi=10.1016/0195-6663(92)90014-w}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a separate scale geared towards children called the Food Neophobia Scale for Children (FNSC), in which the parents actually do the reporting for the survey.&lt;ref name=Alley&gt;{{cite book|vauthors =Alley TR, Potter KA|title=Handbook of Behavior, Food and Nutrition|year=2011|publisher=Springer|pages=707–724|chapter=Food Neophobia and Sensation Seeking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animals it has been shown that food neophobia is a fear of novelty lasting only a short duration (minutes at most), which is distinct form dietary conservatism, the prolonged refusal to add a novel food to the diet, which can last many days or even years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marples|first=Nicola M.|last2=Kelly|first2=David J.|last3=Thomas|first3=Robert J.|year=2005|title=PERSPECTIVE: THE EVOLUTION OF WARNING COLORATION IS NOT PARADOXICAL|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01032.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=59|issue=5|pages=933–940|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01032.x|issn=0014-3820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarplesKelly1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marples|first1=N.M.|last2=Kelly|first2=D.J.|title=Neophobia and Dietary Conservatism:Two Distinct Processes?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|volume=13|issue=7-8|year=1999|pages=641–653|issn=0269-7653|doi=10.1023/A:1011077731153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary conservatism has never yet been demonstrated in humans, although the genetically influenced behaviour of "fussy eating" in children&lt;ref name="pmid27412445"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris HA, Fildes A, Mallan KM, Llewellyn CH | title = Maternal feeding practices and fussy eating in toddlerhood: a discordant twin analysis | journal = Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 81 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27412445 | pmc = 4944306 | doi = 10.1186/s12966-016-0408-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27739065"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith AD, Herle M, Fildes A, Cooke L, Steinsbekk S, Llewellyn CH | title = Food fussiness and food neophobia share a common etiology in early childhood | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–196 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27739065 | pmc = 5298015 | doi = 10.1111/jcpp.12647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resembles the behaviour seen in animals. 

Food neophobia relates to the [[The Omnivore's Dilemma|omnivore's dilemma]], a phenomenon that explains the choice that [[omnivore]]s, and humans in particular, have between eating a new food and risking danger or avoiding it and potentially missing out on a valuable food source. Having at least some degree of food neophobia has been noted to be evolutionarily advantageous as it can help people to avoid eating potentially poisonous foods.&lt;ref name=Dovey&gt;{{cite book|last=Dovey|first=Terence M.|title=Eating Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press|location=England|pages=47, 48, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes ===
Genetics seem to play a role in both food neophobia and general neophobia. Research shows that about two-thirds of the variation in food neophobia is due to genetics. A study done on twin pairs showed an even higher correlation, indicating that genetics does play a factor in food neophobia.&lt;ref name=Alley /&gt;

Psychosocial factors can also increase a child's chances of developing food neophobia. Young children carefully watch parental food preferences, and this may produce neophobic tendencies with regard to eating if parents tend to avoid some foods.&lt;ref name="Moyer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/the_kids/2012/12/picky_eater_kids_their_eating_habits_might_be_your_fault_but_they_ll_survive.html |title=Picky eater kids: Their eating habits might be your fault, but they’ll survive. |last=Moyer|first=Melinda Wenner |date=19 December 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause includes being more sensitive than average to bitter tastes, which may be associated with a significant history of [[Otitis media|middle ear infection]] or an increased perception of bitter foods, known as a [[supertaster]].&lt;ref name="Moyer" /&gt;

Sometimes food neophobia is more directly caused by an environmental occurrence. For example, with poison-induced neophobia, a food-poisoning experience can lead to people not only avoiding the flavor(s) they associate with creating their illness but also avoiding all novel flavors during the period directly following the poisoning experience. This can be seen as the body’s attempt to prevent any new and risky food items from entering the body.

Besides food poisoning, food neophobia also arises from the person associating a negative experience with new foods, for example suffering from [[gastroenteritis]] or other gastrointestinal illnesses after eating undercooked food.

Another environmental factor influencing levels of food neophobia is the current arousal level of the individual. Trying a new food is an arousing experience, and if the person prefers to maintain a lower arousal level in general, then he or she might avoid new foods as a method of managing his or her current arousal level. Also, if people are currently experiencing situations with a lot of novelty and are therefore more aroused, they might be reluctant to try new foods as doing so would increase their arousal level to an uncomfortable level. This example can help explain why Americans visiting a foreign country might be less likely to try a new food item and instead gravitate towards the familiar McDonald’s food.

===Treatment===
Some efforts to address this situation, such as pressuring the child to eat a disliked food or threatening punishment for not eating it, tend to exacerbate the problem.&lt;ref name="Moyer" /&gt;

Effective solutions include offering non-food rewards, such as a small sticker, for tasting a new or disliked food, and for parents to model the behavior they want to see by cheerfully eating the new or disliked foods in front of the children.&lt;ref name="Moyer" /&gt;

Exposing someone to a new food increases the chances of liking that food item. However, it is not enough to merely look at a new food. Novel food must be repeatedly tasted in order to increase preference for eating it.&lt;ref name=Logue /&gt; It can take as many as 15 tries of a novel food item before a child accepts it. There also appears to be a critical period for lowering later food neophobia in children during the weaning process.  The variety of solid foods first exposed to children can lower later food refusal. Some researchers believe that even the food variety of a nursing mother and the consequent variety of flavors in her breastmilk can lead to greater acceptance of novel food items later on in life. Food neophobia does tend to naturally decrease as people age.&lt;ref name=Dovey /&gt;

[[Image:Picherchat.jpg|thumb|right|The mining waste was located very near neighborhoods in the town, 2008]]

'''Picher''' is a [[ghost town]] and former city in [[Ottawa County, Oklahoma|Ottawa County]], [[Oklahoma]], United States. This was a major national center of [[lead]] and [[zinc]] mining at the heart of the [[Tri-State district|Tri-State Mining District]].

More than a century of unrestricted subsurface excavation dangerously undermined most of Picher's town buildings and left giant piles of [[toxic metal]]-contaminated [[mine tailings]] (known as [[Chat (mining)|chat]]) heaped throughout the area. The discovery of the cave-in risks, groundwater contamination, and health effects associated with the chat piles and subsurface shafts resulted in the site being included in 1980 in the [[Tar Creek Superfund Site]] by the US [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The state collaborated on mitigation and remediation measures, but a 1996 study found that 34% of the children in Picher suffered from lead poisoning due to these environmental effects, which could result in lifelong neurological problems.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/us/14kansas.html?hp Treece Journal: Welcome to Our Town. Wish We Weren’t Here]. Susan Saulny, ''The New York Times,'' September 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the EPA and the state of Oklahoma agreed to a mandatory [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]] and buyout of the entire township. The similarly contaminated satellite towns of [[Treece, Kansas]] and [[Cardin, Oklahoma]] were included in the [[Tar Creek Superfund site]].

A 2006 [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] study showed 86% of Picher's buildings (including the town school) were badly undermined and subject to collapse at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.ok.gov/documents/TarCkLICRAT/Other_PicherSubsidenceRpt_Rv14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of 150 homes by an [[Fujita scale|EF4]] tornado in May 2008 accelerated the exodus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/tsa/weather-event_may10_2008pichertornado|title=Picher Tornado May 10, 2008|last=Service|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, 2009, the state of Oklahoma officially dis-incorporated the city of Picher, which ceased official operations on that day. The population plummeted from 1,640 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]] to 20 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. As of January 2011, only six homes and one business remain, their owners having refused to leave at any price. Except for some [[National Register of Historic Places|historic]] structures, the rest of the town's buildings were scheduled to be demolished by the end of the year. One of the last buildings, which had housed the former Picher mining museum was destroyed by arson in April 2015. (However, its historical archives and artifacts had already been shipped elsewhere by that point.)

Picher is among a small number of locations in the world (such as [[Gilman, Colorado]]; [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]]; and [[Wittenoom, Western Australia]]) to be evacuated and declared uninhabitable due to environmental and health damage caused by the mines the town once serviced.

The closest towns to Picher, other than nearby [[Cardin, Oklahoma|Cardin]], [[Treece, Kansas|Treece]], and [[Douthat, Oklahoma|Douthat]], are [[Commerce, Oklahoma|Commerce]], [[Quapaw, Oklahoma|Quapaw]] (the headquarters of the nation by that name), and [[Miami, Oklahoma]].

==History==
In 1913, as the [[Tri-State district]] expanded, lead and zinc ore were discovered on Harry Crawfish's claim and mining began. A townsite developed overnight around the new workings and was named Picher in honor of O. S. Picher, owner of [[Eagle-Picher|Picher Lead Company]]. The city was incorporated in 1918, and by 1920, Picher had a population of 9,726. Peak population occurred in 1926 with 14,252 residents and was followed by a gradual decline due to the decrease in mining activity, leaving Picher with only 2,553 by 1960.&lt;ref name=OSU&gt;[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=TR014 Dianna Everett. ''Tri-State Lead and Zinc District''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Picher area became the most productive lead-zinc mining field in the Tri-State district, producing over $20 billion worth of ore between 1917 and 1947. More than fifty percent of the lead and zinc metal used during World War I were produced by the Picher district. At its peak more than 14,000 miners worked the mines and another 4,000 worked in mining services. Many workers commuted by an extensive trolley system from as far away as [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]] and [[Carthage, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=OSU/&gt; Mining ceased in 1967 and water pumping from the mines ceased. The contaminated water from some 14,000 abandoned mine shafts, 70 million tons of mine tailings, and 36 million tons of mill sand and sludge remained as a huge environmental cleanup problem.&lt;ref name=OSU/&gt; As a result of national legislation to identify and remediate such environmentally hazardous sites, in 1980 the area was designated as part of the [[Tar Creek Superfund site]].

While some remediation took place in the following quarter century, contamination and other environmental hazards were found to be so severe that the government decided to close Picher and relocate its residents, as reported on April 24, 2006, by Reuters. Due in large part to the removal of large amounts of subsurface material during mining operations, many of the city's structures have been deemed in imminent danger of caving in.&lt;ref name=GillamC-2006-04-24&gt;Gillam, Carey. - [http://today.reuters.com/news/articlebusiness.aspx?type=naturalResources&amp;storyID=nN23131359&amp;from=business "FEATURE-Slow death consumes Oklahoma mining town"] - [[Reuters]] - April 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's pharmacist, Gary Linderman, was featured in the May 28, 2007, issue of ''[[People Magazine|People]]'' magazine in the ''Heroes Among Us'' article: "Prescription for Kindness". He vowed to stay as long as there was anyone left who needed him and to be the last one out of the city.&lt;ref name=People-2007-05-28&gt;Heroes Among Us: "Prescription for Kindness" - ''People Magazine'' - May 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Linderman, the only remaining resident of Picher,{{disputed inline|date=August 2017|reason=See talk page for details}} died on June 6, 2015, at age 60 after a sudden illness.&lt;ref name='linderman_latimes'&gt;{{cite web

===Tornado===
On May 10, 2008, Picher [[Mid-May 2008 tornado outbreak sequence#Picher, Oklahoma/Neosho, Missouri|was struck by]] an EF4 [[tornado]]. There were eight confirmed deaths, possibly including one child, and many other people injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=KTUL| accessdate=2008-05-11 | url=http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0508/518665.html| title=Six Dead, 150 Injured After Tornado Levels Town Of Picher |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514113249/http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0508/518665.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tornado first touched down near the [[Kansas]]–Oklahoma border in Oklahoma southwest of [[Chetopa, Kansas]], and tracked eastward. It struck Picher, causing extensive damage to 20 blocks of the city, with houses and businesses destroyed or flattened. The damage in Picher was rated at "[[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF4]]". At least 150 people were injured in Picher alone. The tornado continued eastward, passing just north of [[Quapaw, Oklahoma|Quapaw]] and [[Peoria, Oklahoma|Peoria]] before crossing [[Interstate 44]] into [[Missouri]]. Given the existing plan to vacate the city, the federal government decided against aid to rebuild homes, and the buyouts continued as previously scheduled, with people being assisted in relocation.&lt;ref name=EvansM-AP-2008-05-13&gt;Evans, Murry. - Weather: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24603128/ "Rebuilding unlikely in Okla. town"]. - [[Associated Press]]. - (c/o MSNBC.com) - May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Governor]] [[Brad Henry]] sent [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops as well as emergency personnel to assist the hardest hit area in Picher.&lt;ref name=KOTV-2008-05-12&gt;[http://www.newson6.com/Global/story.asp?S=8306515&amp;nav=menu682_2 "Tornado Death Toll Increases In Picher"]. - KOTV.com - May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of power from the tornado forced the city to go on a boiled water notice. Staff from the [[Rural Water|Oklahoma Rural Water Association]] arrived to assist, since the utility's testing equipment was destroyed by the storm. With an emergency generator to supply power, rural water staff had the system running normally only two days after the tornado struck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Water assists Picher after tornado strikes|year=2008|publisher=[[National Rural Water Association]]|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2008%2006%20June/Picher%20Tornado.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102181711/http://nrwa.org/NRWAupdates/2008%2006%20June/Picher%20Tornado.htm|archivedate=2011-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closure ===
In April 2009, residents voted 55&amp;ndash;6 to dissolve the Picher-Cardin school district; it graduated its final class of 11 in May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704195505/http://www.kswo.com/Global/story.asp?S=10242602 Final graduation set for Picher-Cardin schools ]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 the district's enrollment had dropped to a total of 49 students from approximately 343 students years prior. Remaining students were assigned to attend Commerce and Quapaw school districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/in-brief-vote-marks-end-for-picher-school/article/3359873 |title=In brief: Vote marks end for Picher school |publisher=NewsOK.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Image:Picherstadium.jpg|thumb|right|Picher-Cardin High School stadium, 2008]]

The city's post office was scheduled to close in July 2009, and the city ceased operations as a municipality on September 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Stogsdill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20090623_11_A1_PICHER590927 "Picher projects its end as official municipality",] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 29, 2009, all of the residents had been given federal checks to enable them to relocate from Picher permanently. The city is considered to be too toxic to be habitable. On the last day, all the final residents met at the school auditorium to say goodbye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/06/30/oklahoma.toxic.town/index.html#cnnSTCText | work=CNN | title='Last man standing' at wake for a toxic town - CNN.com | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of November 2010, it was reported that Picher still had "one business and six occupied houses."&lt;ref name="zero"&gt;Sheila Stogsdill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20101117_12_A1_ULNSiu895664 "Cardin population drops to 0 as buyout completed"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government carried out a similar relocation program for residents of the adjacent city of [[Treece, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmoving.org/Movers/Zip_Code/Moving-Company-in-74360.php|title=The Picher, Oklahoma Relocation|publisher=The Moving and Relocation Division for Oklahoma|date=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 29, 2009, Congress voted to allow the EPA to fund the relocation of the remaining citizens of Treece.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Starting in January 2011, almost all remaining commercial structures were scheduled to be demolished. Gary Linderman, owner of the Old Miner's Pharmacy, said he would stay until the last resident left.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/video/crews-set-demolish-final-picher-173500123.html]&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2014, standing abandoned buildings included the Picher-Cardin High School building, a Christian church, the mining museum, and a handful of mercantile buildings, as well as numerous abandoned houses.

The municipality of Picher was officially dissolved on November 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/12/04/Two-Oklahoma-towns-officially-dissolved-after-federal-buyout/UPI-21531386187942/][[UPI]], December 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Picher Mining Field Museum, which had been housed in the former Tri-State Zinc and Lead Ore Producers Association building, was destroyed by arson in April 2015. The museum archives had previously been sent to [[Pittsburg State University]], and other artifacts had been sent to the [[Baxter Springs, Kansas]] Heritage Center and Museum.&lt;ref name ="fire"/&gt; In March 2017 the often-photographed Christian church, which was originally a one-room schoolhouse, was also destroyed by fire.

The final resident,{{disputed inline|date=August 2017|reason=See talk page for details}} Gary Linderman, owner of the Ole Miner Pharmacy, died on June 9, 2015, at the age of 60 from a sudden illness,&lt;ref name='linderman_latimes' /&gt; which officially made Picher a ghost town and brought its population to 0.{{disputed inline|date=August 2017|reason=See talk page for details}}

==International==
In August 2016, a report produced by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) for the Conference of the Parties to the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], found "there is not enough research to quantify the relative risk of ENDS/ENNDS over combustible products.

In August 2014, the [[Forum of International Respiratory Societies]], which represents multiple [[pulmonary]] associated medical associations in the United States, Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia, released a statement in which they argued that e-cigarettes have not been demonstrated to be safe and their benefits as a smoking cessation tool or in harm reduction has not been adequately studied.&lt;ref name=FIRS2014/&gt; They recommended banning their use, or regulation as medicines or [[tobacco products]] if not banned, until adequate studies are performed.&lt;ref name=FIRS2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=&amp;NA;|title=E-Cigarettes|journal=Oncology Times|date=August 2014|volume=36|issue=15|pages=49–50|doi=10.1097/01.COT.0000453432.31465.77}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, the Forum of International Respiratory Societies released a position statement, stating "ENDS are devices that deliver aerosols of nicotine and other volatile chemicals to the lung. Their use has rapidly escalated among youths and they are now the most commonly used tobacco product among adolescents. Initiation of electronic cigarette use is strongly associated with the subsequent initiation of combustible tobacco product use among adolescents."&lt;ref name=FerkolFarber2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferkol|first1=Thomas W.|last2=Farber|first2=Harold J.|last3=La Grutta|first3=Stefania|last4=Leone|first4=Frank T.|last5=Marshall|first5=Henry M.|last6=Neptune|first6=Enid|last7=Pisinger|first7=Charlotta|last8=Vanker|first8=Aneesa|last9=Wisotzky|first9=Myra|last10=Zabert|first10=Gustavo E.|last11=Schraufnagel|first11=Dean E.|title=Electronic cigarette use in youths: a position statement of the Forum of International Respiratory Societies|journal=European Respiratory Journal|volume=51|issue=5|year=2018|pages=1800278|issn=0903-1936|doi=10.1183/13993003.00278-2018|pmid=29848575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the [[International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease]] released a statement asserting that the benefits and safety of e-cigarettes have not been scientifically proven.&lt;ref name=IUATLD2014/&gt; The statement highlighted concerns with regards to "re-normalization" of smoking behavior and exposure of third parties to possibly dangerous emissions from e-cigarettes, and strongly supported regulation of electronic cigarettes, preferably as medicines.&lt;ref name=IUATLD2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bam|first1=T.

The [[World Lung Foundation]] (now known as Vital Strategies) applauded the 2014 WHO report's recommendation for tighter regulation of e-cigarettes due to concerns about the [[Safety of electronic cigarettes|safety of e-cigarettes]] and the possible increased nicotine or tobacco addiction among youth.&lt;ref name=WLF2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vitalstrategies.org/press/who-right-to-call-for-e-cigarette-regulation/|title=WHO Right to Call for E-Cigarette Regulation|publisher=World Lung Federation|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[World Medical Association]] released a statement which stated, "Due to the lack of rigorous chemical and animal studies, as well as clinical trials on commercially available e-cigarettes, neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established.&lt;ref name=WMA2014/&gt; Lack of product testing does not permit the conclusion that e-cigarettes do not produce any harmful products even if they produce fewer dangerous substances than conventional cigarettes."&lt;ref name=WMA2014&gt;{{cite web|title=WMA Statement on Electronic Cigarettes and Other Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/e19/|publisher=World Medical Association|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
The [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) of Australia has stated that, "the quality and safety of electronic cigarettes is not known" due to the lack of studies, unlike conventional nicotine replacement therapies, and lists possible risks involved with buying or using electronic cigarettes.&lt;ref name=TGA2014/&gt; They also state, "The Australian Government is concerned about the use of electronic cigarettes in Australia.

A 2014 practice guideline by [[NPS MedicineWise]] states, "While use of e-cigarettes may be safer than smoking tobacco, so far there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness as aids in smoking cessation. There are also safety issues to consider and the long-term effects are unknown."&lt;ref name=NPS2014/&gt; This guideline recommends physicians steer patients away from e-cigarettes to "more established" methods of smoking cessation until safety and efficacy are established.&lt;ref name=NPS2014&gt;{{cite web|title=e-Cigarettes: a safe way to quit?|url=http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2014/e-cigarettes|publisher=NPS MedicineWise|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cancer Council Australia]] and [[Heart Foundation]] released a joint position statement that stated, "The limited evidence available points to a risk that widespread electronic cigarette use could undo the decades of public policy work in Australia that has reduced the appeal of cigarette use in children" and the "short and long term health effects of electronic cigarette use remain unknown."&lt;ref name=NCCP2014/&gt; They also consider claims that e-cigarettes can help quit smoking as "unsubstantiated" and urge "extreme caution on electronic cigarettes" while urging significant regulations of both nicotinic and non-nicotinic electronic cigarettes.&lt;ref name=NCCP2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Position Statement Electronic Cigarettes|url=http://wiki.cancer.org.au/policy/Position_statement_-_Electronic_cigarettes#cite_ref-Citation:Taleb_ZB.2C_Maziak_W_2014_37-0|publisher=Cancer Council Australia, Heart Foundation of Australia|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[Health Canada]] states in relation to the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act which became law on May 23, 2018 that "vaping is less harmful than smoking.&lt;ref name=HealthCanada2018/&gt; Many of the toxic and cancer-causing chemicals in tobacco and the tobacco smoke form when tobacco is burned."&lt;ref name=HealthCanada2018/&gt; They further state that "vaping products and e-cigarettes deliver nicotine in a less harmful way than smoking, and may reduce health risks for smokers".&lt;ref name=HealthCanada2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/smoking-tobacco/vaping.html|title=Smoking, vaping and tobacco|publisher=Health Canada|date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian [[Heart and Stroke Foundation]] has stated, "While early studies show some potential benefits, the effectiveness of e-cigarettes with nicotine as a smoking cessation device is not fully conclusive," and expressed concerns about the lack of long term studies with regard to health effects to the user as well as second hand exposure.&lt;ref name=HSF2014/&gt; They also note public health officials' concerns about renormalizing smoking behavior undermining current tobacco control as well as being a gateway for nicotine addiction and tobacco abuse.&lt;ref name=HSF2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart and Stroke Foundation: E-cigarettes in Canada|url=http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.9207931/k.D09C/Heart_and_Stroke_Foundation_Ecigarettes_in_Canada.htm|publisher=Heart and Stroke Foundation|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Cancer Research Center]] in Germany released a report in 2013 stating that e-cigarettes cannot be considered safe, in part due to technical flaws that have been found as well as unreliable information about product quality, including information provided by manufacturers.&lt;ref name=GCRC2013/&gt; This report concluded the fluids and aerosols in e-cigarettes can contain dangerous substances and can cause short term airway irritation and may be harmful in long term use, and the effects on second hand exposure causing harm cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name=GCRC2013/&gt; The report also concluded that the e-cigarettes, whether it contains nicotine or not, can alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms, but their ability to help quit smoking has not been proven.&lt;ref name=GCRC2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Cigarettes – An Overview|url=http://www.dkfz.de/en/presse/download/RS-Vol19-E-Cigarettes-EN.pdf|year=2013|publisher=German Cancer Research Center|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
The [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health of New Zealand]] has stated, "There is not enough evidence to be able to recommend e-cigarettes as an aid to quit smoking" and recommends more established treatments for smoking cessation.&lt;ref name=MHNZ2014/&gt; They also point interested readers to the 2014 WHO statement for further information.&lt;ref name=MHNZ2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), including E-cigarettes|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/tobacco-control/electronic-nicotine-delivery-systems-ends-including-e-cigarettes|publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Health|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cancer Society of New Zealand]] released a position statement which states, "Currently, there is limited evidence of the safety of e-cigarettes or their suitability as a smoking cessation aid" and "Before they are widely promoted, evidence is needed to ensure that e-cigarettes are a safe harm reduction alternative to tobacco smoking, that they are a safe and effective cessation aid, that they don’t undermine motivation to quit, and that they don’t act as a gateway to nicotine addiction for young people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Position Statement on Electronic Cigarettes|url=http://www.cancernz.org.nz/assets/files/info/Position%20Statements/2011/E-cigarette_Position%20statementFINALJul13.pdf|publisher=Cancer Society of New Zealand|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107150929/http://www.cancernz.org.nz/assets/files/info/Position%20Statements/2011/E-cigarette_Position%20statementFINALJul13.pdf|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippines==
The [[Food and Drug Administration (Philippines)|Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines]] released a statement saying that there has been little evidence published about the health effects of electronic cigarettes, including whether they help quit smoking.&lt;ref name=FDAP2014/&gt; The statement concluded that the available evidence does not support those who advocate for their use either as tools to help quit smoking or for harm reduction.&lt;ref name=FDAP2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Information on Electronic Cigarettes|url=http://www.fda.gov.ph/attachments/article/123228/FA2013-056%20-%20Consumer%20Information%20on%20Electronic%20Cigarettes.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
The [[Spanish Society of Pneumonology and Thoracic Surgery]] (SEPAR) released a position statement which states that the substances found in aerosol from e-cigarettes have not been demonstrated to be safe, and a number of chemicals which are carcinogens and can damage the lung have been found, though usually in concentrations smaller than conventional cigarettes.&lt;ref name=SEPAR2014/&gt; Studies done to date have been small in size and have had significant methodological flaws, making drawing any definitive conclusions about their ability to aid in smoking cessation impossible.&lt;ref name=SEPAR2014/&gt; The report concluded that "indiscriminate use" of e-cigarettes is a public health risk and they may encourage young people to start smoking, and therefore advocate regulation of e-cigarettes as a medicine and encourage smoking cessation through other more established means.&lt;ref name=SEPAR2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jimenez Ruiz|first1=CA|last2=Solano Reina|first2=S|last3=de Granda Orive|first3=JI|last4=Signes-Costa Minaya|first4=J|last5=de Higes Martinez|first5=E|last6=Riesco Miranda|first6=JA|last7=Altet Gómez|first7=N|last8=Lorza Blasco|first8=JJ|last9=Barrueco Ferrero|first9=M|last10=de Lucas Ramos|first10=P|title=The electronic cigarette.

In 2015 the [[National Health Service (England)|English National Health Service]] advice page on smoking said "E-cigarettes are not risk free, but on current evidence they carry a fraction of the risk of smoked tobacco. As well as nicotine, e-cigarette liquid and vapour can contain toxic substances, although these are either at lower levels than seen in cigarette smoke or at levels not associated with health risk. The current best estimate is that e-cigarette use carries only around 5% of the risk of smoking. E-cigarettes are still fairly new and we won’t have a full picture on their safety until they have been in use for many years, so it will be important to continue to monitor the evidence as it develops."&lt;ref name=BNHS2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic cigarettes|url=http://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice/e-cigarettes|website=Smokefree NHS|accessdate=19 November 2015|location=Are e-cigarettes safe to use?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK National Health Service concluded in November 2014, "While e-cigarettes may be safer than conventional cigarettes, we don’t yet know the long-term effects of vaping on the body. There are clinical trials in progress to test the quality, safety and effectiveness of e-cigarettes, but until these are complete, the government can’t give any advice on them or recommend their use."&lt;ref name=NHS2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop smoking treatments|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Smoking-%28quitting%29/Pages/Treatment.aspx|publisher=UK National Health Service|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the [[BBC]] reported that five [[Scottish NHS]] boards were considering reviewing their ban on e-cigarette use on hospital grounds, after 'new evidence showed they can help smokers quit'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Scottish health boards review e-cigarette policy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-35150816|publisher=[[BBC Scotland]]|date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the UK's National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training, which provides training and accreditation to NHS "stop smoking practitioners",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/impact/case-study-repository/nhs-stop-smoking-services UCL Research Impact case study], "Evidence for best practice within NHS Stop Smoking Services"; [http://www.ncsct.co.uk/usr/pub/NCSCT_final_report.pdf NCSCT Final Report on their first 3 years to March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; issued a new guideline downplaying concerns and stating that smoking cessation professionals should support e-cigarette users, though they remain unable to prescribe e-cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsct.co.uk/usr/pub/e-cigarette_briefing.pdf PDF], NCSCT briefing ''Electronic cigarettes'', accessed 1 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 policy statement by the UK's [[Faculty of Public Health]] recognizes that there are potential benefits from the use of e-cigarettes but raises concerns that their effectiveness is not yet proven, that e-cigarettes are less effective than nicotine replacement therapy, concerns regarding dual usage of e-cigarettes and tobacco, concerns regarding advertising and young people and finally concerns regarding e-cigarettes undermining "decades of lobbying by public health related organisations" that led to the "smoking ban and tobacco control legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People who want to quit smoking should consult their GP|url=http://www.fph.org.uk/people_who_want_to_quit_smoking_should_consult_their_gp|publisher=Faculty of Public Health|accessdate=7 March 2015}}; [http://www.fph.org.uk/uploads/UK%20Faculty%20of%20Public%20Health%20-%20Policy%20paper%20on%20electronic%20cigarettes%20-%20FINAL.pdf Full statement, PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) stated in 2016 for e-cigarettes to be banned in public places such as bars, cafes, restaurants, museums and schools over concern for second-hand vapor.&lt;ref name=Chandler2016&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/doctors-call-for-ecigarette-ban-in-public-places-over-passive-vaping-fears-a3278746.html|title=Doctors call for e-cigarette ban in public places over 'passive vaping' fears|author=Mark Chandler|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMA reported in 2013 that there was a possibility for smoking cessation benefits, but had concerns that e-cigarettes are less regulated than [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT), and that there was no [[peer reviewed]] evidence concerning their safety or efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bma.org.uk/news-views-analysis/news/2013/january/ecigarettes-not-proven-quitting-aid-says-bma|title=E-cigarettes not proven quitting aid, says BMA|work=British Medical Association|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, [[Cancer Research UK]] released a statement including, "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are almost certainly much safer than tobacco cigarettes and may help smokers to cut down or quit smoking. We support the use of high quality e-cigarettes because we believe that they have significant potential to help smokers who aren't otherwise ready or able to quit smoking by providing them with much safer alternatives to smoked tobacco. It is important that regulation does not stifle the development of this market nor make accessing these products by smokers more difficult. However, the current safeguards are insufficient to ensure that these products are as safe as nicotine replacement therapy and to ensure that they are not marketed to non-smokers and children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/policy_may2014_e-cigarette_briefing.pdf|title=Cancer Research UK Briefing: Electronic Cigarettes|publisher=Cancer Research UK|date=May 2014|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) guideline in 2013 recommended licensed nicotine replacement therapy as part of a program for harm reduction, but did not recommend e-cigarettes as they are unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicotine products can help people to cut down before quitting smoking|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/news/article/nicotine-products-can-help-people-to-cut-down-before-quitting-smoking|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal College of General Practitioners]] (RCGP) stated in 2016 that "although the long-term safety profile of EC use is still to be evaluated, it is accepted that vaping is an order of magnitude safer than conventional tobacco."&lt;ref name=RCGP2016/&gt; The RCGP recommended, among other things, that "Where a patient wants to quit smoking, and has not succeeded with other options, GPs [general practitioners] should recommend and support the use of ENDS."&lt;ref name=RCGP2016&gt;{{cite web|title=To vape or not to vape?

==United States==

=== Government agencies ===
In 2016, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that "Although ENDS [electronic nicotine delivery systems] may potentially provide cessation benefits to individual smokers, no ENDS have been approved as effective cessation aids."&lt;ref name=FDA2016/&gt; They also stated that "Although ENDS likely do not deliver the same level of toxicants as cigarettes, studies show that there are dangers associated with ENDS use".&lt;ref name=FDA2016&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/05/10/2016-10685/deeming-tobacco-products-to-be-subject-to-the-federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-as-amended-by-the|journal=Federal Register|agency=US Food and Drug Administration|volume=81|issue=90|pages=28974–29106|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the FDA concluded, "E-cigarettes have not been fully studied, so consumers currently don’t know: the potential risks of e-cigarettes when used as intended, how much nicotine or other potentially harmful chemicals are being inhaled during use, or whether there are any benefits associated with using these products.&lt;ref name=USFDA2016/&gt; Additionally, it is not known whether e-cigarettes may lead young people to try other tobacco products, including conventional cigarettes, which are known to cause disease and lead to premature death."&lt;ref name=USFDA2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Cigarettes (e-Cigarettes)|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm172906.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] concluded there is insufficient evidence to recommend e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, and recommended clinicians instead recommend more proven smoking cessation aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Women: Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1|publisher=United States Preventive Services Task Force|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, Smokefree.gov, a website run by the Tobacco Control Research Branch of the [[National Cancer Institute]] to provide information to help quit smoking, did not recommend the use of e-cigarettes, saying "The bottom line is that we just don’t know enough about e-cigs, so we don’t recommend that you use them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Cigarettes|url=http://smokefree.gov/e-cigarettes|publisher=Tobacco Control Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) states that users of e-cigarettes are exposed to many different types of chemical compounds, very small particles, and hazardous metals.&lt;ref name=NIOSH2016/&gt; Chemicals emitted in e-cigarette aerosols can include carcinogens such as [[formaldehyde]], [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polyaromatic hydrocarbons]], as well as various organic compounds that are irritating to the lung.&lt;ref name=NIOSH2016/&gt; Among flavoring compounds emitted in some e-cigarette aerosols are [[acetylpropionyl|2,3-pentanedione]] and [[diacetyl]], which NIOSH has linked to causing [[Bronchiolitis obliterans|obliterative bronchiolitis]], a devastating lung disease in workers.&lt;ref name=NIOSH2016/&gt; Additionally there is also a risk of burns following spontaneous combustion of the [[lithium battery]] in the device.&lt;ref name=NIOSH2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/tobacco/electronicnicotinedeliverysystems.html|title=Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace|date=16 November 2016|website=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=31 January 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical societies ===
In 2010, the [[American Medical Association]] called for e-cigarettes to be subject to the same FDA regulations as tobacco and nicotine products.&lt;ref name=AMA2014/&gt; The Association extended this policy in 2014, and endorsed measures aimed at preventing marketing of e-cigarettes to minors.&lt;ref name=AMA2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2014/2014-06-10-regulating-electronic-cigarettes.page|title=AMA Strengthens Position on Regulation of Electronic Cigarettes|publisher=AMA|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the [[American Heart Association]] released a policy statement in which they noted that "current evidence evaluating the efficacy of these products as a cessation aid is sparse, confined to 2 randomized controlled trials and 1 large cross-sectional study, anecdotal reports, and Internet-based surveys." The statement stated "there is not yet enough evidence for clinicians to counsel their patients who are using combustible tobacco products to use e-cigarettes as a primary cessation aid."&lt;ref name=Bhatnagar2014/&gt; It also noted that "E-cigarettes either do not contain or have lower levels of several tobacco-derived harmful and potentially harmful constituents compared with cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. In comparison with NRTs, e-cigarette use has increased at an unprecedented rate, which presents an opportunity for harm reduction if smokers use them as substitutes for cigarettes.&lt;ref name=Bhatnagar2014/&gt; However, although firm evidence is lacking, there are concerns that e-cigarette use and acceptance of e-cigarettes has the potential to renormalize smoking behavior, sustain dual use, and initiate or maintain nicotine addiction.&lt;ref name=Bhatnagar2014/&gt; Their use also could serve as a gateway to reinitiation of smoking by ex-smokers. Unregulated e-cigarette use also has the potential to erode gains in smoking cessation and smoke-free laws."&lt;ref name=Bhatnagar2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatnagar|first1=A.|last2=Whitsel|first2=L. P.|last3=Ribisl|first3=K.  M.|last4=Bullen|first4=C.|last5=Chaloupka|first5=F.|last6=Piano|first6=M. R.|last7=Robertson|first7=R.

Another statement released that month by the [[American Lung Association]] argued that the FDA should begin its regulatory oversight of electronic cigarettes, because otherwise, "there is no way for the public health, medical community or consumers to know what chemicals are contained in e-cigarettes or what the short and long term health implications might be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/tobacco-control-advocacy/federal/e-cigarettes.html|title=American Lung Association Statement on E-Cigarettes|publisher=American Lung Association|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] supports every smoker using any way they choose who are contemplating trying to quit smoking and in 2018 they stated to use FDA regulated medicine that have a track record of effectively helping efforts to stop smoking.&lt;ref name=ACS2018/&gt; For some smokers who do not try to quit smoking cigarettes using FDA regulated medicine they recommend to choose the least unsafe tobacco product and they stated transitioning to only using e-cigarettes is better than smoking combustible ones.&lt;ref name=ACS2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/e-cigarette-position-statement.html|title=American Cancer Society Position Statement on Electronic Cigarettes|publisher=American Cancer Society|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Cancer Society concluded in early 2014, "Because the American Cancer Society doesn’t yet know whether e-cigarettes are safe and effective, we cannot recommend them to help people quit smoking. There are proven methods available to help people quit, including pure forms of inhalable nicotine as well as nasal sprays, gums, and patches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What about electronic cigarettes? Aren’t they safe?|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/questionsaboutsmokingtobaccoandhealth/questions-about-smoking-tobacco-and-health-e-cigarettes|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923045623/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/questionsaboutsmokingtobaccoandhealth/questions-about-smoking-tobacco-and-health-e-cigarettes|archivedate=23 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Diabetes Association]] states "e-cigarettes are not supported as an alternative to smoking or to facilitate smoking cessation."&lt;ref name=ADA21015&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes--2015: Summary of Revisions|journal=Diabetes Care|volume=54|issue=38|pages=S4|doi=10.2337/dc15-S003|pmid=25537706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[American Association for Cancer Research]] and the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] released a statement noting that further research was needed regarding the regulation of electronic cigarettes.&lt;ref name=AACR2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacr.org/Newsroom/Pages/News-Release-Detail.aspx?ItemID=651#.VLLrumTF_3p|title=AACR, ASCO, Two Leading U.S. Cancer Organizations, Call for Regulation of E-cigarettes and Other Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems|date=8 January 2015|work=AACR Website|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement also called on the FDA [[Center for Tobacco Products]] to regulate all e-cigarettes that meet the definition of tobacco products.&lt;ref name=AACR2015/&gt;

In October 2015, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) recommends against e-cigarettes for quitting smoking and stated among adolescents, e-cigarette use is related with reduced quitting smoking.&lt;ref name=AAP2015&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Clinical Practice Policy to Protect Children From Tobacco, Nicotine, and Tobacco Smoke|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/136/5/1008.full.pdf|journal=Pediatrics|volume=136|issue=5|pages=1008–1017|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3108|issn=0031-4005|pmid=26504137}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also support increasing the legal age for sale of tobacco products including e-cigarettes to 21, since, according to the AAP, "80% of smokers began smoking prior to age 18 while adolescence is a period in which people are particularly susceptible to the addictive nature of nicotine."&lt;ref name=BiyaniDerkay2017/&gt; In 2015, the [[American College of Physicians]] policy position statement recommendations included banning flavoring, taxation of tobacco products to encompass e-cigarettes, and regulations of [[emission standard]]s associated with e-cigarettes.&lt;ref name=BiyaniDerkay2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biyani|first1=Sneh|last2=Derkay|first2=Craig S.|title=E-cigarettes: An update on considerations for the otolaryngologist|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|volume=94|year=2017|pages=14–16|issn=01655876|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2016.12.027|pmid=28167004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State and local agencies ===
The US [[National Association of County and City Health Officials]] stated in 2012, "Currently, little scientific evidence exists to show that e-cigarettes are effective cessation devices" and "Further research is needed on the health risks of e-cigarettes, but available evidence suggests harmful effects.&lt;ref name=NACCHO2012/&gt; They recommend to local health departments to advocate for regulation as a tobacco product to the extent allowable by law.&lt;ref name=NACCHO2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation of Electronic Cigarettes ("E-Cigarettes")|url=http://www.naccho.org/advocacy/positions/upload/12-04-e-Cigarettes.pdf|publisher=National Association of County and City Health Officials|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220210/http://www.naccho.org/advocacy/positions/upload/12-04-e-Cigarettes.pdf|archivedate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[California Department of Public Health]] issued a report that found e-cigarettes expose users and bystanders to harmful chemicals, there is no scientific evidence they help smokers quit, they are being heavily marketed, and teen use is growing rapidly.&lt;ref name=Chapman2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DCDIC/CTCB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Policy/ElectronicSmokingDevices/StateHealthEcigReport.pdf|title=State Health Officer's Report on E-Cigarettes: A Community Health Threat|publisher=California Tobacco Control Program|agency=California Department of Public Health|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7722">{{Main|Pre-conception counseling}}
'''Pre-conception counseling in the United States''' allows for optimization of [[prenatal care in the United States|US prenatal care]]. ''Pre-conception counseling'' is a meeting with a health-care professional (generally a [[physician]] or [[midwife]]) by a woman ''before'' attempting to become [[pregnant]]. It generally includes a ''pre-conception risk assessment'' for any potential [[complications of pregnancy]].

==Obstacles to pre-conception counseling in the United States==
Obstacles to pre-conception counseling in the United States include:
*It is too late in unintended pregnancies. The rate of [[Unintended pregnancy#United States of America|Unintended pregnancy in the United States]] is approximately 49%.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th"&gt;{{cite book

*Women not knowing, realizing, or understanding the benefits of visiting their physician or [[midwife]] before trying to become pregnant.
*Another common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment may be the lack of [[health insurance]]. However, most insurances will cover this as a screening visit. Also, many physicians will do the pre-conception screening during a regular office visit or gynecological visit if the woman just informs the doctor of her desire to become pregnant. Most gynecologists will inquire about child-bearing intentions anyway.

==Screening and monitoring in the United States==
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of women prior to conception is recommended to include the following:&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;
* Height and weight to calculate [[body mass index|BMI]]
* [[Blood pressure]]
* [[Medical history]]
* [[Abdominal examination|Abdominal]] and [[pelvic examination]]
* [[Pre-conception counseling in the United States#rubella|Rubella]]
* [[Pre-conception counseling in the United States#varicella|Varicella]]
* [[Pre-conception counseling in the United States#Domestic violence|Domestic violence]]
* Depression
* [[Blood lipids]] (cholesterol and HDL)
* [[Cervical screening]]

However, the overall lack of evidence precludes a recommendation for universal screening for [[thyroid disease in pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vissenberg | first1 = R. | last2 = Van Den Boogaard | first2 = E. | last3 = Van Wely | first3 = M. | last4 = Van Der Post | first4 = J.

===Rubella screening===
{{anchor|rubella}}
Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by [[serology]] is recommended in the US for all women of childbearing age at their first [[preconception counseling]] visit to reduce incidence of [[congenital rubella syndrome]] (CRS).&lt;ref name=icsi2010&gt;[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705032759/http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html |date=2008-07-05 }} By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant women of childbearing age should be offered [[rubella vaccination]].&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

===Varicella screening===
{{anchor|varicella}}
Immunity status of varicella should be performed at the pre-conception counseling session, in order to prevent the occurrence of [[congenital varicella syndrome]] and other adverse effects of [[varicella#pregnancy|varicella in pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; Generally, a person with a positive [[medical history]] of varicella infection can be considered immune.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; Among adults in the United States having a negative or uncertain history of varicella, approximately 85%-90% will be immune.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; Therefore, an effective method is that people with a negative or uncertain history of varicella infection have a [[serology]] to check antibody production before receiving the vaccine.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] recommends that all adults be immunized if seronegative.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

===Domestic violence===
It is recommended to screen for [[domestic violence]] at a preconception visit, because [[domestic violence during pregnancy]] a risk factor for [[miscarriage]], late entry into prenatal care, [[stillbirth]], [[premature labor]] and [[premature birth|birth]], fetal injury and [[low birth weight]], and detection can avail for specific counseling and intervention.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

There is evidence that direct interview screening result in a higher rate of reporting prenatal domestic abuse than a written, self-report questionnaire method.&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;

==Education ==
Education of women intending to be pregnant is recommended to include:&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt;
*[[Preterm labor]] education and prevention
*Substance use
*Weight and [[nutrition and pregnancy]]
*[[Domestic violence and pregnancy]]
*List of medications, [[dietary supplement]]s, [[herbal supplement]]s
*Accurate recording of menstrual dates
*Counseling in case of potential [[vaginal birth after Caesarean]]

==Vaccination and prophylaxis==
[[Vaccination]] and other prophylaxis of women intending to become pregnant is recommended to include:&lt;ref name=icsi2010/&gt; 
*[[Tdap]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Pride Center''' is a non-profit [[GLBT]] community center located at 2040 North Dixie Highway, in [[Wilton Manors, Florida]]. It serves primarily [[Broward County]] and [[Fort Lauderdale]], with some services provided in [[Palm Beach County]]. It hosts more than 60 regularly-meeting groups each month. Support, social and educational groups focus on women, seniors, youth, men, transgender, recovery, health, the arts, athletics, spirituality, games and more. It is also a major site for [[HIV]] testing and prevention, education and counseling, and also offers holistic and comprehensive support programs for persons living with [[HIV/AIDS]].

The center has 30,000 square feet of office space, and is located on a six-acre site. It celebrated 20 years of service in 2013. AIDS memorabilia that later would be, after its founding, displayed in the [[World AIDS Museum and Educational Center]] were first exhibited here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ross|last=Forman|title=World AIDS Museum opens in Fort Lauderdale|work=Windy City Times|date=August 26, 2014|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/World-AIDS-Museum-opens-in-Fort-Lauderdale/48764.html|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Princess Alexandra Hospital''' is a small hospital on [[Anguilla]].

It has a pharmacy, wards and a dialysis section. 

It suffered considerable storm damage as a result of [[Hurricane Irma]], losing its roof, equipment and bed space.  The British government and charitable donations have contributed towards the rebuilding program.  [[Tim Foy]] says "The United Kingdom government is committed to the full rehabilitation of the Princess Alexandra Hospital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Authority of Anguilla lays out purpose and goals of its Foundation |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82450-health-authority-of-anguilla-lays-out-purpose-and-goals-of-its-foundation |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  £4 million from the British Government is earmarked for the hospital.

The rebuilding programme is intended to include a [[computed tomography]] scanner and a new maternity wing, increasing the capacity from 4 to 8 patients. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lord Ahmad visits schools and hospitals in Anguilla |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/77078-lord-ahmad-visits-schools-and-hospitals-in-anguilla |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maternity wing was opened in November 2018 by  [[Blondel Cluff]] CBE, who is the [[Anguilla]] government’s representative in the United Kingdom and the Chief Executive Officer of the [[West India Committee]] that raised funds for the rebuilding. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cluff in Anguilla for opening of maternity ward at hospital |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82878-cluff-in-anguilla-for-opening-of-maternity-ward-at-hospital |accessdate=29 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ristra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|s|t|r|aː}}) is an arrangement of drying [[chili pepper|chile pepper]] pods, [[garlic]] bulbs, or other vegetables for later consumption. In addition to its practical use, the ristra has come to be a trademark of decorative design in the state of [[New Mexico]]. Typically, large chiles such as [[New Mexico chile]]s and [[Anaheim peppers]] are used, although any kind of chile may be used to construct a ristra.

[[Garlic]] can also be arranged into a ristra for drying and curing after the bulbs have matured and the leaves have died away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120415122446/http://aces.nmsu.edu/news/1999/091499_GARLIC.html Garlic] 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile Ristras|url=http://www.nps.gov/petr/learn/historyculture/chile.htm|website=National Park Service|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">The '''Safe bottle lamp''', called '''sudeepa''' or '''sudipa''' for ''good lamp'', is a safer [[kerosene lamp]] designed by [[Wijaya Godakumbura]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230052253/http://www.theworldchallenge.co.uk/2009-winner.php "A Bright Idea - Winner 2009 (Archived)"]&lt;/ref&gt; of Sri Lanka. The safety comes from heavier glass, a secure screw-on metal lid, and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over.

==History==
As surgeon Dr. Godakumbura saw many burn cases caused by kerosene lamp fires.  Over 1 million homes in Sri Lanka do not have electricity, and rely on kerosene lamps for illumination, often [[improvised]] lamps made from [[bottle]]s.  These tall lamps tip easily, and when they do, the [[candle wick|wick]] holder often falls out and starts a sudden, intense fire.  Often the fuel falls on a nearby person, setting them ablaze and resulting in severe [[burn (injury)|burns]], often fatal.

In 1992, Dr. Godakumbura set out to design a new lamp that was both safer, and inexpensive enough to be affordable by the impoverished Sri Lankans at risk for these fires.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Lanka Guardian [http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/09/dr-wijaya-godakumbura-and-wonderful.html "Dr. Wijaya Godakumbura and the Wonderful Lamp"], September 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting lamp is a small, flattened sphere, which resists tipping and rolling. It is made of thick glass to resist breaking, and has a screw-on metal cap that holds the wick in place and prevents spilling.

In 1993, with contributions from numerous sources, including [[Science Fiction]] writer and Sri Lanka resident [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the [[Canada|Canadian High Commission]], the lamp was put into production.

Available for a cost of less than US$0.25 each, over half a million of the new lamps have been sold, and Dr. Godakumbura hopes to continue producing the new lamps until use of improvised lamps drops to a small percentage of lamp use in Sri Lanka.

==The Foundation==
Having received a Rolex Award for Enterprise in 1998, Dr. Godakumbura established the Safe Bottle Lamp Foundation (SBLF), a non-profit organization. The Foundation is governed by a board of directors and employs two full-time staff .

In addition to the [[Rolex award|Rolex Award]], the foundation and Dr. Godakumbura have received a range of other local and international awards and grants. Among these are a Lindbergh Foundation Grant and a BBC [[The World Challenge|World Challenge]] Award. The project has been featured in many international publications such as TIME, Newsweek, Science and Nature, National Geographic and La Figaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safelamp.org/acclaim.html |title=The Safe Bottle Lamp Foundation (Archived Copy)|accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921172511/http://safelamp.org/acclaim.html|archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Godakumbura has represented the foundation in many international conferences on burn and accident prevention as a speaker or as a participant. The foundation and the Sudeepa lamp have been promoted as a replicable solution for other developing countries where accidental burns due to unsafe lamps is prevalent.

'''SCAAR''' ('''S'''wedish '''C'''oronary '''A'''ngiography and '''A'''ngioplasty '''R'''egister)
[http://www.ucr.uu.se/scaar/]

The SCAAR is a Swedish national registry that contains relevant medical data on consecutive patients from 29 hospitals in Sweden at which [[coronary angiography]] and PCI ([[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s) are performed. The registry was established in 1989. It is sponsored by the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] and is independent of funding from industry. The data technology was developed by, and is administered by the [[Uppsala Clinical Research Center]] ([http://www.ucr.uu.se/]). Since 2001, SCAAR has been Internet-based, with recording of data online through a Web interface. Data are transferred in an encrypted format to a central server at the Uppsala Clinical Research Center. All consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography or PCI in Sweden are registered in this database which provides a unique opportunity for prospective observational studies within the field of interventional cardiology.

'''Sentebale''' is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref name=cc-1113544&gt;{{EW charity|1113544|Sentebale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity was founded in 2006 by [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] and [[Prince Seeiso of Lesotho|Prince Seeiso]] of the [[Lesotho|Basotho]] Royal Family.

Prince Harry met Prince Seeiso on his gap year in [[Lesotho]] and was moved to help vulnerable children and young people in the country. After ten years working in Lesotho, in November 2016, the charity launched operations in Botswana.

Sentebale means 'Forget me not' in [[Sesotho]] and the name was chosen "as a memorial to the charity work of our own mothers, as well as a reminder to us all not to forget Lesotho or its children." (Prince Harry speaking at the [[Concert for Diana]]).

Lesotho has the 2nd highest rate of [[HIV]] in the world and there are over 37,000 children under 14 living with HIV.&lt;ref name="UNGASS"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNGASS|first=Lesotho|title=Global Aids Response Country Progress Report|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/knowyourresponse/countryprogressreports/2012countries/ce_LS_Narrative_Report[1].pdf|publisher=UNGASS|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has 360,000 orphans and around 10% of all children are vulnerable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ministry of Social Development|title=National Strategic Plan on Vulnerable Children April 2012 - March 2017|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentebale aims to combat these issues and works with vulnerable children and their communities, empowering them to reach their full potential. The charity is focused on community-led development which matches actual need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentebale Website|url=http://www.sentebale.org|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in Lesotho==

===Development===
Lesotho was 160/187 countries in the [[Human Development Index]] and described as having “low human development”.&lt;ref name="Human Development Report 2011"&gt;{{cite web|first=United Nations Development Programme|title=Human Development Report 2011|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/306.html|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=2012-11-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106102254/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/306.html|archivedate=2012-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 43.2% of the population are living below the national poverty line.&lt;ref name="Lesotho 2012 Facts and Figures"&gt;{{cite web|first=World Food Programme|title=Lesotho 2012 Facts and Figures|url=http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/lesotho%2030%20march%202012.pdf|publisher=World Food Programme|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The country also came 108/187 for [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="Human Development Report 2011"/&gt; 
Importantly, gender inequality in Lesotho does not follow the pattern of the majority of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. For example, males have lower [[literacy rates]], and school attendance and completion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=UNESCO Insititue for Statistics|title=Education (all levels) Profile Lesotho|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&amp;IF_Language=eng&amp;BR_Country=4260&amp;BR_Region=40540.|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to the traditional role of males in [[Basotho]] society. They are expected to spend their time herding [[livestock]]. This severely limits their access to education.

===Health===
Lesotho has a population of just 1.8 million,&lt;ref name="Lesotho 2012 Facts and Figures"/&gt; yet it is estimated there are at least 360,000 orphans, and 13% of all children are vulnerable; their rights to survival and development are not being met.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Life expectancy is on average just 41.2 years.&lt;ref name="Lesotho 2012 Facts and Figures"/&gt;

The country has the second highest rate of HIV/[[AIDS]] in the world. Knowledge about HIV prevention is also low. The two most common misconceptions on HIV/AIDS in Lesotho are that a person can become infected through mosquito bites or sharing food. Someone who has comprehensive knowledge of HIV is defined as someone who will "in response to a prompted question, agree that people can reduce their chances of getting the AIDS virus by having sex with only one uninfected, faithful partner and by using condoms consistently; know that a healthy-looking person can have the AIDS virus; and know that HIV cannot be transmitted by mosquito bites or by sharing food with a person who has AIDS."&lt;ref name="pdf.usaid.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesotho Demographic and Health Survey 2009|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADU407.pdf|publisher=Lesotho Demographioc and Health Survey (2009)|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lesotho, only 38% of women and 29% of men age 15-49 have comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Among youth, this figure is 39% for women and 29% for men.&lt;ref name="pdf.usaid.gov"/&gt;

==Sentebale's Work ==
Sentebale focuses on supporting vulnerable children. The charity runs five key projects to enable communities to improve health, care and education.
*Network Clubs and Camps – This programme contains three initiatives.&lt;ref name="Sentebale Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentebale Our Work|url=http://www.sentebale.org/home/OurWork.html|accessdate=2012-11-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706060635/http://www.sentebale.org/home/OurWork.html|archivedate=2012-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Sentebale runs week-long camps for HIV –positive children. These camps are led by Sentebale and supported by volunteers and health clinics. They are intended to educate and improve the confidence of children affected by HIV. 
#Network clubs for camp alumni are held twice a month. The aim of these camps is to foster “expert patients” who can educate the community and keep themselves and others safe. 
#Caregiver days connect medical professionals with the children and their families. This initiative has been successful in improving AntiRetroViral therapy (ARV) LINKS adherence and community support for those affected by HIV

*Herd Boys Education Programme – providing basic education to Herd Boys. This includes maths, literacy, learning to grow their own produce and HIV/AIDS knowledge and awareness. Sentebale supports five herd boy schools funding teachers, refurbishing properties, providing food and educational materials.
*Care for Vulnerable Children programme – Sentebale partners with 13 community led organisations across Lesotho providing education, care and support to some of the most disadvantaged children; those with disabilities and those who are orphans. Sentebale supports these organisations by providing funding, training and development support.
*School Bursaries – Sentebale offers bursaries for children to complete secondary school. These bursaries are comprehensive covering the hidden costs of education, such as clothing, food and educational resources.
*Letsema – A collaborative network connecting all the NGOs, grassroots organisations and community groups in Lesotho working with vulnerable children. Letsema is a communication and planning tool for groups enabling them to share information, tools and successes.

==Background to Lesotho==

Lesotho is a mountainous country, land-locked by [[South Africa]]. It has a land area of 30,300 square kilometers. Three quarters of the country is [[highland]] with a height more than 1,600m above sea level and a maximum height of 3,482m. There are mountain ranges in the east and running from north to south. In the centre of Lesotho the two largest rivers in Southern Africa, the [[Senqu]] and the [[Tugela]] have their source on a high plateau.&lt;ref name="Lesotho Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesotho Fact Sheet|url=http://www.lesotholondon.org.uk/quick|publisher=Lesotho High Commission in London|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lowlands continuous cultivation and the use of manure for fuel has led to leaching of soil nutrients. Soil erosion is a serious issue in Lesotho due to increasing human and livestock population pressure and heavy rainfall. The country has also been affected by severe droughts. The climate is variable with temperatures commonly dropping below zero in the highlands and reaching highs of 32 degrees Celsius in the lowlands.&lt;ref name="Lesotho Fact Sheet"/&gt;

In recent years severe droughts followed by heavy rains have led to significant decreases in food production. The availability of the staple crop, maize, has dropped by 77% since 2011. This has led to severe food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IRIN|title=Lesotho: Food Security goes from bad to worse|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95735/LESOTHO-Food-security-goes-from-bad-to-worse|publisher=IRIN Humanitarian News and Analysis|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The charity's first accounts published in March 2008 showed that despite raising more than £1 million in the first 18 months of its operation, just £84,000 was handed over to projects in Lesotho.&lt;ref name=cc-1113544 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/03/25/1206207047894.html |title=Harry accused of wasting over $2m |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period however, Sentebale spent £190,000 on salaries, £86,000 on a website, £26,000 on equipping its office in Maseru and £47,000 on work done before the charity was formally established.  Sentebale's director in Lesotho, Harper Brown, had received a salary and benefits package worth between £90,000 and £100,000 per year.&lt;ref name=cc-1113544 /&gt;

In 2009 [[Lord Ashcroft]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] deputy chairman, donated £250,000 to Sentebale to remedy financial difficulties at the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7062933/Boss-of-Prince-Harrys-charity-resigns-after-just-one-year.html |title=Boss of Prince Harry's charity resigns after just one year |author=Richard Eden |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new Chief Executive, Kedge Martin, joined in 2009. Before joining Sentebale Kedge Martin was the CEO of WellChild, a charity that provides care, support and research to long term, chronically sick children across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/Mobile/8231854/Kedge-Martin-tightens-her-grip-on-Sentebale.html |title=Kedge Martin tightens her grip on Sentebale |author=Tim Walker |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 report and accounts showed £2.089 million had been raised for the charity with £1.334 million being spent on charitable activities. This was an increase in funds raised by 16%. 72% of expenditure was spent directly on supporting orphans and vulnerable children in Lesotho. 27% was spent on fundraising and 1% on governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sentebale|title=Report and Accounts 2010 Sentebale|url=http://www.sentebale.org/Attachments/Signed%20accounts%202011.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-19}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Joseph's Health Centre''' is a large [[Catholic Church and health care|Catholic]] [[teaching hospital]] in western [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. It is located west of downtown, along the [[Lake Ontario]] shore at the intersection of [[The Queensway]] and Sunnyside Avenue, just west of [[Roncesvalles Avenue]]. It was founded in 1921 by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] order on the site of an orphanage. The same order also founded [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] in Toronto in 1892.

==Overview==
St. Joseph's Health Centre receives more than 97,000 emergency room visits every year, and sees more than 272,000 visits in its outpatient ambulatory care clinics. More than 21,000 patients are admitted to a hospital bed every year, with an average stay of five to six days and an occupancy rate of 100%. Yearly, more than 3,000 children are born at St. Joseph's. Over 160,000 diagnostic imaging procedures are done ever year and more than 30,000 surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjoe.on.ca/about/glance.php |title=At a Glance &amp;#124; St. Joseph's Health Centre Toronto |publisher=Stjoe.on.ca |date=March 8, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's, Children's and Family Health Program launched the St. Joseph's Urban Family Health Team (UFHT) at 27 Roncesvalles Ave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjoe.on.ca/programs/family/health_team.php |title=Family Health Team &amp;#124; St. Joseph's Health Centre Toronto |publisher=Stjoe.on.ca |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main focus of UFHT is to improve population health by focusing on chronic disease prevention and management. It offers patient education, health promotion, disease prevention and chronic disease management programs.

The Emergency Clinic is located on the west side of the hospital, on Glendale Avenue. It is a streamed clinic, with adults streamed into one clinic, and children into another. St. Joseph's wait times are regularly monitored by the Ontario Ministry of Health. In 2012, St. Joseph's Health Centre had one of the lowest wait times in Ontario to see a doctor. The Ambulatory Clinic is a day-time clinic for non-emergency visits for patients needing immediate medical attention. The Ambulatory Clinic is also located in the Glendale wing.

==History==
The original site at Sunnyside Avenue, and The Queensway, was the site of the 1800s Sunnyside Villa and farm, a home of [[John George Howard]], surveyor of Toronto. The Sacred Heart Orphanage was built on the site, operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph order. In 1921, the City of Toronto was considering expropriating the orphanage for a public high school. The order decided to convert part of the orphanage into a hospital to prevent expropriation, and St. Joseph's was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=St. Joseph's Health Centre |title=History of St. Joseph's Health Centre |url=http://www.stjoe.on.ca/about/heritage.php |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Sisters of St. Joseph moved its Mercy Hospital for Incurables long-term care hospital to a new facility north of St. Joseph's Hospital proper. Known as Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, it operated independently until 1980, when it was merged with St. Joseph's Hospital. The Our Lady of Mercy Wing, as it was known, was demolished in 2007. In 2012, the replacement Our Lady of Mercy Wing opened. It is a {{convert|130000|ft2|m2}} four-storey building housing a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a Paediatric Unit, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, an expanded Family Birthing Centre, and three new inpatient areas housing a total of 92 beds.

In 2011, a senior citizen was violently beaten and assaulted by security guards at the health centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-man-78-says-he-was-injured-by-hospital-staff-1.1064562]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2017, St. Joseph's Health Centre merged with [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] and [[Providence Healthcare (Toronto)|Providence Healthcare]] to form a new hospital network.&lt;ref name="tdotcom01"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adler|first1=Mike|title=Providence Healthcare, St. Joseph's and St. Michael's planning merger|url=https://www.toronto.com/community-story/7260725-providence-healthcare-st-joseph-s-and-st-michael-s-planning-merger/|publisher=toronto.com|accessdate=21 February 2018|location=Toronto, ON|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''THIRRA''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] web-based [[Electronic Health Records]] (EHR) System. The name THIRRA was derived from its project title Portable System for '''T'''eleHealth and '''H'''ealth '''I'''nformatics for '''R'''ural and '''R'''emote '''A'''reas.

== History ==

The THIRRA project was one of the pioneer eHealth telemedicine projects under the PANACeA network, funded by the [[International Development Research Centre]]. It was conceptualised in February 2007, with partners from Primary Care Doctors Organisation Malaysia (PCDOM), Sri Lanka Health Telematics, Healthnet Nepal and ICCDR,B of Bangladesh.

== Features of THIRRA ==
The main component of THIRRA is the Electronic Health Records System. Besides the EHR, it also has the Biosurveillance mode, that enables Public Health Departments to monitor and investigate infectious diseases outbreaks.

THIRRA can be used in an offline mobile mode, where no reliance on the Internet is required. Data is stored on the mobile devices such as laptops and netbooks. The users can synchronise the data with the main server when they return to the clinic/hospital.

THIRRA was written in the [[PHP]] programming language, using the [[CodeIgniter]] framework. The application is based on the Hierarchical Model View Controller (HMVC) design pattern, using the Modular Extension extension. This makes THIRRA modular by nature.

It stores data in the [[PostgreSQL]] database system and uses the [[JQuery UI]] Javascript framework for its Web 2.0 functionalities.

THIRRA is also integrated with another open source software called [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gem-pc/ Generic Engine for Modules] to expand its modules. Modules can be created by the health care professionals without requiring any programming knowledge.

It provides [[ICD-10]] classification for diagnosis and [[LOINC]] for coding of labs and imaging orders.

== License ==

THIRRA was released under the [[Mozilla Public License]] version 1.1.

== Sites ==

THIRRA is currently being used by the public health sector in the following countries
* Malaysia
* Nepal
* Philippines
* Sri Lanka

Users can use it on any device with Javascript enabled web browsers accessing it from a dedicated server in the clinics/data centre or run it locally from computers as light as netbooks.

'''Dr. Tara Grace Knowles-Teller''' is a fictional character on the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] drama ''[[Sons of Anarchy]],'' played by [[Maggie Siff]].

==Biography==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sonsofanarchy-therevelator-siff-hunnam.jpg.jpg|thumb|left|Tara and Jax in the season-one finale ''The Revelator''. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
Tara is a native of [[Charming, California]]. (She said her heritage was half-Irish.) Her mother died when Tara was nine, and according to ATF Agent Stahl, Tara had a "drunk daddy", whom Tara described as a "bit of a packrat". Tara was [[Jax Teller]]'s high-school sweetheart, and during that era she had a crow tattooed on her lower back representing her connection to [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club|SAMCRO]]. Tara was arrested in Jax's company at least three times in 1996. She left town when Jax was 19, in order to get away from small-town life and the influence of the club. According to his mother [[Gemma Teller Morrow|Gemma]], this broke Jax's heart.

After leaving Charming, Tara moved in with a cousin of her father's, who lived in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], studied at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]], and graduated with honors. She then attended medical school in Chicago (either [[Feinberg Medical School]] at [[Northwestern University]], according to her file in "[[Fun Town]]", or "Loyola Med" according to [[June Stahl|Agent Stahl]] in "[[Better Half (Sons of Anarchy)|Better Half]]") where she was at the top of her class, then she completed an internship at Chicago Presbyterian.

While in Chicago, Tara dated [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agent Joshua Kohn, and got pregnant, and had an abortion at six weeks. Kohn became intimidating, violent, and obsessive, so she took out a restraining order against him several months before she returned to Charming, after an absence of 10 years.

===Season 1===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}
Tara works as a Pediatric resident at the local hospital, St. Thomas. It is there that she tends to Jax's gravely ill infant son Abel during Abel's hospitalization.

Tara lives in her childhood home, which she inherited from her father when he died. She also drives a [[Oldsmobile Cutlass|Cutlass]] her father had parked in the garage under "two tons of old newspapers".

Tara's relationship with Jax upon her return to Charming is based primarily on their mutual concern for gravely ill Abel. Her psychotic ex-boyfriend Agent Kohn comes to Charming under the pretext of investigating SAMCRO, but is really there because he wants to resume his relationship with Tara. Afraid for her life, Tara seeks Jax's help in driving off Kohn. Jax stabs Kohn's car on her behalf, beats him bloody in an altercation at Floyd's barber shop, and then escorts him out of town. When Kohn returns in the dead of night and attacks Tara in her home, she shoots him in the gut and calls Jax for help.

When Jax arrives he is furious about the attack and shoots Agent Kohn in the head. Tara and Jax then fall into each other's arms and make love while Kohn's [[iPod]] plays the [[Andy Williams]] song "Can't Get Used to Losing You" on a continuous loop.

Following the killing of Kohn, Jax and Tara seem to settle into a largely healthy and positive romantic relationship. Tara spends more time with Jax at the clubhouse, plays nice with Gemma, and works to heal wounded club associate Cameron Hayes.

The Jax-Tara relationship soon seems to disintegrate after his ex-wife Wendy returns from rehab. In the penultimate season-one episode "The Sleep of Babies", Tara is seen sleeping alone while Jax and Wendy make love. In the final episode of the first season, "The Revelator", Tara tells Jax that she has arranged to return to Chicago as she does not believe she is cut out for life in Charming. This angers Jax, and he storms off. At the end of the episode Tara is seen to have changed her mind, and she turns up at Donna's funeral, where she and Jax share a kiss.

===Season 2===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}
Tara officially becomes Jax's "old lady" and is integrated into the club's world.  After Gemma is raped and abused, she turns to Tara for medical help.  Tara encourages Gemma to seek out counseling to deal with the psychological repercussions of the attack but Gemma is reluctant.  Tara's help with Gemma combined with her efforts at raising Abel begins to heal the rift between Tara and Gemma.  Tara's connection with Jax and SAMCRO, on the other hand, causes problems for her at work. When Gemma accidentally breaks Tara's nose after being startled, Margaret Murphy (a hospital administrator) assumes that Jax is responsible and warns Tara about the possible repercussions of being associated with SAMCRO.  Later, Margaret files a "hostile work environment" complaint against Tara after Gemma confronts the administrator about the hospital's desire to move Chibs to another facility because of an insurance issue.  Chibs later falsely complains of head pain and is able to stay at the hospital.  Margaret accuses Tara of coaching Chibs with his symptoms and has Tara's privileges suspended.

When Jax decides that he wanted to go nomad, Tara is upset that he made the decision without consulting her. However, unlike everyone else connected to the club, she feels like it might be the right decision given the tension between Jax and Clay.

Gemma lets Tara know that as Jax's "old lady", Tara has considerable prestige and respect in the club when other women in the club defer to her, and that she shouldn't "take any shit" from anyone.  Later, Tara confronts Margaret. The altercation turns violent and Tara then chokes and punches her.  She tells Margaret, "I know where you live, I know where your kids go to school" and informs her that the cops are on SAMCRO's payroll and that the club runs Charming.  Tara advises Margaret to keep her mouth shut and retract her complaint.  Margaret immediately agrees to do so.

In the season two finale, Tara attempts to convince Gemma to not get revenge on those that raped her, but is unsuccessful.  She is present at Jax's home when Cameron Hayes appears, and is tied to a chair by him before he kidnaps Abel Teller.  Tara is untied by Jax and tells him what has happened to his son. Jax and the rest of the club unsuccessfully try to save Abel while Tara is later seen being consoled by Deputy David Hale.

===Season 3===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}
Tara is still saddened by the loss of Abel. As time goes by, Jax continues to push her away with increasing vehemence. She feels Jax is pushing her away because he blames her for not preventing Abel's kidnapping. She visits a fugitive Gemma and helps her kill Gemma's father's caretaker. Tig helps the two of them cover it up. Tara later reveals to Gemma that she is six weeks pregnant.

After Jax leaves Tara, she catches him with CaraCara porn star, Ima. Tara then starts packing her things at Jax's house. He apologizes for what she saw earlier, but she feels he wanted her to see it, because he wants her gone and knew it was the one thing that would drive her away. She expresses that she thinks he is doing this because he hates her for what happened to Abel. Jax says that it is to protect her, but Tara doesn't believe him. When Jax goes after her, she is already pulling out of the driveway. As Tara leaves Jax's house it is shown that the recently ousted Calaveras MC leader, Hector Salazar, has been secretly stalking her and Jax.

Tara considers having an abortion, as she believes Jax is not ready for another child. Gemma tries to convince Tara to wait until Jax gets back from Belfast and look into Abel's eyes before she does anything. Gemma wants Tara to try to mend the relationship, because Jax hasn't been thinking clearly since Abel's abduction. Tara ultimately helps Gemma escape police custody so Gemma can go with Clay and Jax to Belfast.

Lyla asks Tara if she knows of any clinics that conduct abortions. When she goes with Lyla to have the procedure, they have a conversation about why Lyla is having the abortion. It turns out Lyla is having the same problems with Opie. He won't open up to her in fear of what might happen. Lyla also feels the baby is an inconvenience because she wants to continue working as a porn star. After the conversation, Tara schedules an abortion for herself, as well. Later, Tara reveals to Margaret Murphy that she is going to have an abortion; Margaret agrees it is a good idea and offers to drive Tara to the clinic. On the way, Salazar stages a car accident and abducts Margaret and Tara.

While Tara and Margaret are being held by Salazar, he becomes upset when his hostage demands aren't met and threatens to kill Margaret. Tara tries to persuade him not to and when he doesn't listen to her, she causes a distraction. She attacks Salazar's girlfriend and tries to get away. Salazar kicks her hard in the stomach. He goes to kick her a second time but stops when Tara tells him that she is pregnant.

When Tara gets a chance to go to the bathroom, she breaks off a piece of a mirror to use as a weapon. When Salazar's girlfriend breaks into the bathroom, Tara cuts her neck and almost escapes with Margaret, but Salazar stops them. After a stand off, Tara tells him his girlfriend is in the bathroom bleeding badly. She says she will keep his girlfriend alive if he lets Margaret go. When Salazar's girlfriend dies in the car, he throws Tara against the car and puts a gun to her head.

Salazar takes Tara to Jacob Hale's office, where he takes Hale hostage as well. When he gives his list of demands, one of them is for Jax to come to Hale's office. Tara sees Salazar pull out a knife, and he tells her he plans to kill her while Jax watches and then kill Jax. As Jax enters the office, Salazar is about to kill Tara, but Jacob Hale stabs him instead. Jax wrestles the gun from Salazar, gives it to Tara, and tells her to kill anyone who is not a cop. When the whole ordeal is over with Jax and Tara go to the doctor for an ultrasound to make sure the baby was not harmed. The baby is healthy and Jax and Tara hear the heartbeat and see the baby on the ultrasound. Jax and Tara then go to Gemma's house where Gemma hugs her. Tara sees Abel and happily holds him and welcomes him back home. In the season finale, Tara has become more involved with the club. She drives Jimmy O back to the garage in the trunk after SAMCRO buys him from the Russians. Jax makes sure that she wears a bulletproof vest to ensure her safety in case something goes wrong. When Stahl tells the club about the deal Jax made with her, which was actually a trap by the club to kill Stahl and Jimmy, she runs and hugs him distraught and fearing that the club will kill him in prison. In the closing minute of the season 3 finale, Tara reads letters from John Teller to his mistress Maureen Ashby implying that Gemma and Clay would be responsible for his death should it happen. The close up shot of Tara's face transitions to Jax's face, thus ending season 3.

Bridge between end of Season 3 and beginning of Season 4:
By the end of season 3 when Jax and the other Samcro members were hauled off to prison, Tara is a little over 8 weeks pregnant. However, in a special feature "appisode" (titled: Tara and Piney)- that took place day 85 of Jax's incarceration; a pregnant Tara is shown about 5 months along. In this appisode, Tara goes to [[Piney Winston|Piney]] for information on John Teller's death but is rebuked and told not to investigate further and that the past was "dead and buried" . In another special "appisode" (titled: Second Son) - which bridges the gap between seasons; Tara and Gemma visit Jax in prison. Tara has just given birth to baby Thomas, and she brings the baby to meet Jax for the first time. Jax is overjoyed. He apologizes for missing the delivery and promises he wouldn't miss anything important ever again.

===Season 4===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}
Tara is waiting to greet Jax on his return home. When Jax arrives he and Tara spend a little time with Abel and Thomas before Jax has to go inside the clubhouse for a meeting. When Tara and Jax meet at their house later, they waste no more time and begin making love. Jax then proposes to Tara by putting a ring on their son Thomas's finger. Before Tara can fully accept they have a serious talk about the future of their family. Jax explains that he is done with SAMCRO, but he has to stay until Clay steps down as president because he and Gemma won't let Jax walk away without conflict. He does assure her that as soon as Clay retires and once he has saved enough money to avoid living off his wife he will leave SAMCRO and they will start fresh as a normal family.

Later, at Opie and Lyla's wedding, Jax is the best man and Tara is the maid of honor. The next day Tara and Jax are having breakfast with their sons when they see on the news a story about four dead bodies found at the construction site of Charming Heights. She asks Jax to tell her all he knows about it. He tells her it was retaliation for him getting stabbed in prison. Later on she encounters Gemma in her office who asks why Tara is not wearing her engagement ring. Tara simply tells Gemma that she and Jax are just waiting for the right time to tell everyone. Later at the clubhouse a distraught Tara is reunited with Jax after he is rescued from the Russians. There she discovers, along with Jax, that the clubhouse had been trashed by Sheriff Roosevelt. To lighten up the mood she decides to announce the engagement.

During the season (and before) Tara has become more fearful of the consequences of being involved with SAMCRO and increasingly begins to think about the effect it will have on her son. This leads Tara to make the decision of leaving town with her son until things settle down. Tara is  also conflicted about the letters from Maureen Ashby. Gemma has found out she has them and tries most of the season to obtain them and destroy them. Piney also shows interest in them as a way to blackmail Clay, but Tara keeps them protected. Clay finds out about the letters and he is so fearful of them getting out, that he takes out a hit on her life from Romeo. Eventually after confronting Gemma about the letters, Tara admits that she is not capable of showing the letters to Jax, feeling that if he knew who his father truly was, Jax would get deeper into the club out of guilt, therefore getting him further from her.

Tara eventually heads to a medical conference in Oregon and takes Abel and Thomas with her, most likely for an indefinite stay. Jax accompanies her and on the way there the assassins hired by Clay try to kill her. Tara survives thanks to Jax, however during the fight her right hand gets smashed in a van door.  Her hand is repaired, but the nerves are terribly damaged. Her doctor affirms it is unknown if it is permanent but she feels otherwise and believes her career to be over. Jax, extremely upset himself, tries to comfort her, but Tara has become distant and asks him to leave her alone. She feels that now their future is set and they will never get out of Charming.  She's later encouraged by Jax that everything will go as they had planned, which Tara barely believes.

During the day she's visited by Jax's ex-wife Wendy, who makes it clear that she wants to know Abel better, as she gave up custody but not the right to know him. This unnerves Tara who feels she is Abel's true mother and becomes fearful that Wendy will take him away from her. Wendy leaves her number and Tara smashes the vase of flowers, screaming in anger. She's later put under psych watch and restrained to her bed. Jax begins to feel at a loss as how to take care of and comfort her.

Later Gemma comes to see her and confesses that it was Clay who wanted her dead because of the letters, which she gives to Gemma. She reveals later to Gemma that she was fully aware of her plan to have Clay killed by Jax and hide the letters that involve her and Unser, to prompt Jax to stay as President. Tara gives Jax a blood thinner to inject into Clay, who is recuperating at St. Thomas. She then tells Jax, in front of Gemma, that he will kill Clay and come get her and the boys, so they can leave Charming forever. This plan fails as Jax is forced to stay due to the influence of Romeo Parada and Luis Torres who are undercover CIA agents. They need SAMCRO to provide weapons and transport drugs or they will crush the club. Understanding that Jax has to become President, Tara decides to remain with him. In the season finale, with Gemma watching Tara stands behind Jax at the head of the table, one arm draped around him, mirroring a photo of Gemma and John Teller.

===Season 5===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}
Tara's hand is still in a cast, meaning that she's unable to perform surgeries. Despite losing ability to operate, she supports Jax as President of SAMCRO. The couple lacks certainty of "where it all goes," but Jax is clear that "no matter what happens, I want you to be my wife." Tara mocks the romanticism of a spontaneous wedding at Diosa to which Jax jokes, "I killed a Fed for you ... nothing says endless love like capital murder." A judge marries them in a quick ceremony with wedding rings that belonged to Gemma and JT. Tension rises between Tara and Gemma over controlling the family. Tara places Abel and Thomas in hospital daycare with Jax's support. Tara gains power by shutting out Gemma, who is not on visitor list at first. Gemma tries to hurt Tara by using Wendy to threaten a custody suit. Tara stands firm by warning Gemma not to hurt her or her family or Jax "might kill you." Tara strategically plans squashing RICO case with Lowen, Bobby and Jax. She volunteers at Stockton State Prison and asks Otto to recant his RICO statement.

Tara extends an olive branch to Gemma by placing her on daycare visitor's list and allowing her to watch the boys. Gemma is stoned when she wrecks her car with Abel and Thomas in the backseat. Tara punches Gemma when she confesses to being high while driving with the boys. Tara's fears intensify over the increasing threats to her family; she starts to defend and protect them in Gemma-like ways. Tara cuts her out of the family, but agrees to let Gemma back in if she helps Jax with getting intel from Clay on plot to undermine his leadership. Tara receives good prognosis for her hand and gets recruited for a surgical job in Oregon. Meanwhile, Otto agrees to Tara's plea on RICO if she will bring him Luann's crucifix.

Tara's career is on the line when she is investigated as an accessory to Otto's brutal murder of a prison nurse that was killed with Luann's crucifix. Jax assures Tara that they will get through the investigation just like they get through everything else to which she quips, "that's what scares me." She becomes guarded when Jax doesn't walk away after meeting his goal to save the MC with RICO shutdown. She is pressed to reply to the offer and internally struggles with moving on as it is the "last chance" for her and Jax to get out of Charming. While meeting to prepare Tara's defense, Lowen prompts Tara to think about legal custody of sons if anything was to happen to her. Tara agrees to [[Providence Health &amp; Services]] job offer before telling Jax.

Wendy confronts Tara with reality of risk associated with MC and shows her the shoulder bruise from the force of Jax jamming a speedball needle into it. Tara gasps with shock realizing that Jax is losing his way. The prison nurse's brother, Lee Toric, confronts Tara at the hospital and threatens to avenge her death. More than ever, Tara needs someone trustworthy to name as guardian of her sons in case of imprisonment or death. Tara has no permanent nerve damage and will be able to operate again. Tara requests clarity from Jax who does not come clean about intimidating Wendy.

Gemma confronts Tara about [[Providence Health &amp; Services]] offer and threatens Tara "I'm done with your power push." Gemma threatens to tell investigators that Tara planned the killing of an innocent nurse to reverse RICO. Tara enlists Wendy as guardian and is now more determined to pull her sons out of Charming's "cesspool." Jax disapproves of Wendy as Guardian, but Tara insists it is her 'job as an old lady to be strong ... when and where [he] can't be." She tells him she accepted a job offer in Oregon to spare them from becoming like Gemma and Clay, which will force the boys to relive their mistakes.

The season ends with Tara's arrest for conspiracy to commit Pamela Toric's murder.

===Season 6===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}
After a season of failed attempts to get herself and her sons out of Charming (including a false pregnancy and subsequently faked miscarriage to bar Gemma Teller-Morrow from gaining custody of Abel and Thomas, should Tara go to prison), and after Tara and Jax's relationship was tested (Tara and Jax are having problems with her being behind bars for her involvement in the death of a nurse. Jax is seen at the end of episode 1 cheating on Tara with Colette Jane, an escort handler) Tara finds herself at odds with everyone she was supposed to be able to trust and chooses to use the bullet she pulled from Bobby Munson's shoulder as evidence necessary to grant her witness protection, in turn making her a rat and a liability to the MC and to Jax himself. In a last-minute plot twist, Jax finds Tara at a park in Lodi. They talk for several minutes and then the scene cuts to the motel room Tara had been hiding in. The two come to an understanding and Jax surrenders himself to the mercy of DA Tyne Patterson in exchange for Tara's immunity for all the crimes she committed on behalf the MC, specifically that of the murder of Pamela Toric, for which she was accused in season 5 but did not have anything to do with. The DA agrees to what Jax offers her after a few moments of reluctance to believe that he will come through. With that, Jax has let Tara know that he truly loves her and their sons more than anything. They cry and make love. Tara and Jax agree to meet the DA at the Teller home at 6pm after he spends his last hours as a free man with his sons. He tells Chibs and Bobby he will most likely be sentenced to 25 years, with parole in 10, 7 if he's lucky. Tara gets home earlier than expected and the house is empty, save for Eli, the sheriff, who entered the house with her so they could talk in private and he could help her bring her suitcases into the house, as she decided not to run away and do what Jax asked of her; raise their sons.

When Eli leaves, stating he'll be outside, Tara calls for Wayne, assuming his truck outside meant he was in the house. Caught off guard, Gemma comes out of the laundry room and lunges for Tara, who cannot escape in time. Gemma hits her with an iron but doesn't knock her out. Tara struggles against Gemma's beating and her head is badly smashed on the sink, where Gemma then attempts to drown her. In one of the show's most gruesome moments, Tara struggles for several seconds before Gemma grabs a barbecue fork and stabs Tara multiple times in the back of the head and her neck. Blood gushing out of the back of her head, Tara collapses and dies.

Lt. Roosevelt walks in on the scene and discovers Gemma sitting on the floor next to Tara's body, in obvious shock. Gemma is mumbling incoherently about how it had to be done because she was going to rat out the MC. Roosevelt tells her she didn't rat out the MC, and that Jax is giving himself up to protect her. Immediately after this, Juice walks in, sees the scene, shoots Lt. Roosevelt twice in the back and then comforts Gemma. After this he begins cleaning up the murder scene. Jax returns home later that evening. He sees Lt. Roosevelt's legs on the kitchen floor, draws his gun, and then enters the kitchen, where he finds both Eli and Tara dead on the floor. Stunned, he drops his gun at Eli's feet and cradles Tara in his arms.

==Critical response==
''The New York Times''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; series-premiere review remarked on the "chemistry" between Jax and Tara, and described the character as "beautiful...refined and book-smart."&lt;ref name="nytsoa"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bellafante|first=Ginia|authorlink=Ginia Bellafante|title=Wild Bunch on Wheels, Playing by Its Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/television/03sons.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|publicationdate=2008-03-02|accessdate=2009-06-20 | date=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
