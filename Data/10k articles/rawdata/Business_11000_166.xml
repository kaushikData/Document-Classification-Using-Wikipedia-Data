'''Albert Bensimon''' (born 1948) is an [[Egyptian-Australian]] businessman from [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. He is most well known as the owner of [[Shiels Jewellers]]. He frequently appeared in television advertisements and became famous for his catchphrase "No Hoo-Haa".

Bensimon was born in [[Cairo, Egypt]]. His secondary education took place at the [[Christian Brothers College, Rose Bay|Christian Brothers College]] in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales]] followed by a stint at the [[London School of Economics]]. Bensimon is of [[Jewish]] descent.

In 1994, he helped to establish the [[Helpmann Academy]], named in honour of famous South Australian Sir [[Robert Helpmann]]. The academy is designed to promote the arts in South Australia. He was the first chairman and is still a member of its board.

At the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 South Australian state election]], Bensimon ran as a "No Hoo-Haa Party" candidate in the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Adelaide|Adelaide]], receiving a primary vote of 2.4 percent (492 votes). His "how-to-vote" ticket indicated a first preference for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. Bensimon is also a donor to the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2002/02/03/labor-still-a-chance-to-take-the-final-state/|title=Labor still a chance to take the final state|date=3 February 2002|work=Crikey|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Bensimon was rejected twice for membership of the gentlemen's club, [[The Adelaide Club]], which he claimed was due to [[anti-Semitism]]. This was denied by the Club president, who stated that it was "offensive" to suggest the club was racist and that it has "a diverse membership". In 2008, when another Egyptian-born Jewish businessman was accepted for membership, Bensimon claimed some credit for the move, saying "I broke the back of a small but influential element within the Adelaide Club."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/adelaide-club-move-ends-jewish-tension/story-e6frea83-1111116926408&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/natint/stories/s1583416.htm  |work=National Interest |date=5 March 2006 |title=The Roundup |accessdate=29 June 2006 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in 1892 to a Jewish family in New York City, Albert Boni moved, at an early age, with his family to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and completed his secondary school education there. He completed two years of college at [[Cornell University]] and one year at [[Harvard University]]. Instead of starting his senior year at Harvard, Boni convinced his father to finance the establishment (originally at 95 [[Fifth Avenue]]&lt;ref name=imholtz&gt;{{cite web|last1=Imholtz, Jr|first1=August|year=2006|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539612.pdf|title=Albert Boni: A Sketch of a Life in Micro-Opaque|website=American Antiquarian Society|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then at 135 [[MacDougal Street]]) of the Washington Square Bookshop&lt;ref name=macdougal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvshp.org/documents/PTownHistory.pdf|format=PDF|title=..regarding the historic significance of 133–139 MacDougal St|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Albert's brother Charles as a partner. The Boni brothers' book store became a meeting place for leftist, [[Greenwich Village]] writers and intellectuals. The Boni brothers, with two other partners, created the [[Little Leather Library Corporation|Little Leather Library]] of pocket-sized editions of literary classics bound in imitation leather. These editions were hugely successful — the [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] stores sold a million copies in one year. In 1913–1914 the Boni brothers published the short-lived literary magazine [[The Glebe (literary magazine)|''The Glebe'']]. In 1914, Albert Boni, with [[Lawrence Langner]] and others, founded the [[Washington Square Players]].&lt;ref name=albert-obit/&gt; In 1915 the Boni brothers sold the Washington Square Bookshop to Frank Shay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/bookshopdoor/theshop.cfm#1 The Shop: The Greenwich Village Bookshop Door, Harry Ransom Center, U. of Texas at Austin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 Albert Boni married Cornelia 'Nell' van Leeuwen, a widow with a young son, adopted by Albert Boni upon the marriage.&lt;ref name="HarryRansomCenter"&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00514/hrc-00514.html Albert Boni: An Inventor of His Readex Microprint Corporation Collection] at the [[Harry Ransom Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; With financial backing from [[Horace Liveright]]'s father-in-law, paper executive Herman Elsas, the two partners Albert Boni and Horace Liveright incorporated the publishing house [[Boni &amp; Liveright]] on February 16, 1917. Boni &amp; Liveright founded the [[Modern Library]] (originally called ''Modern Library of the World's Best Classics''), which was eventually acquired by [[Random House]]. The Modern Library was financed by $25,000 from [[Felix M. Warburg]] and the Boni brothers' uncle [[Thomas Seltzer (translator)|Thomas Seltzer]].&lt;ref name=imholtz/&gt; A year and a half after incorporating, Albert Boni sold his interest in Boni &amp; Liveright to Horace Liveright in 1919. However, the name of the firm remained "Boni &amp; Liveright" until 1928, when the name of the publishing house was changed to "Horace Liveright, Inc."

In 1923 the Boni brothers purchased the publishing company [[Maxim Lieber#Literary agency|Lieber &amp; Lewis]] and renamed it the "Albert and Charles Boni Publishing Company." In 1926, they purchased the publishing business of their uncle, [[Thomas Seltzer (translator)|Thomas Seltzer]]. In 1929 the Boni brothers created Boni Paper Books, which offered one soft-cover book per month for 12 months for a yearly subscription price of $5. Boni Paper Books failed during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1939 Albert Boni founded the [[Readex|Readex Microprint Corporation]], a microfilm publisher of reference materials. When Albert Boni retired in 1974 his only son, William, took over as president of Readex.&lt;ref name=HarryRansomCenter/&gt; Albert Boni died in Florida in 1981 and was survived by his wife, his son, and his son's three daughters.&lt;ref name=albert-obit/&gt;

[[File:Guide_to_the_Literature_of_Photography_and_Related_Subjects.pdf|150px|right|A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects published by Albert Boni (1943)]]
While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was conceived by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff who was showing his experimentation's related to the enlarging of photographs.  It occurred to Albert that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs this technology may enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space.  Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography.{{US patent|2260551A}}{{US patent|2260552A}}  This process proved to produce a 6" by 9" index card which stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing.  Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology.  He also published an article ''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=mdp.39015009825780 A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943)]'' which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.&lt;ref name=metcalf&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Metcalf|first1=K.

The '''''Ann Arbor Business Review''''' is a weekly business journal published in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. The publication, formerly distributed in a tab format but now primarily on-line, covers business news in the [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] and [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] areas.

==History and profile==
The publication started as ''Business Direct Weekly'' in January 2003 and became ''Business Review Washtenaw/Livingston'' in late 2004. It changed names again in 2005, becoming the ''Ann Arbor Business Review''.

Owned by [[Advance Publications]], it has the same parent company as ''[[The Ann Arbor News]]'', a daily [[newspaper]]. The two publications share a publisher but are editorially independent. The ''Ann Arbor Business Review'' drew attention in 2005 when it became the first publication to report that [[Google]] was making plans to move its [[AdWords]] headquarters to Ann Arbor.

The business journal is part of the Michigan Business Review network, which also includes the [[Novi, Michigan|Novi]]-based ''[[Oakland Business Review]]'' and the [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]-based ''[[Western Michigan Business Review]]''. Following the folding of the ''Ann Arbor News'' in July 2009 as a daily printed paper, the ''Ann Arbor Business Review'' ceased its regular printed offering on August 13 and joined the ''News'' as a primarily on-line publication, sharing the [[AnnArbor.com]] website and appearing in the AnnArbor.com print edition each Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Heflin, Cindy (July 9, 2009).

The '''Army-Navy "E" Award''' was an honor presented to companies during [[World War II]] whose production facilities achieved "Excellence in Production" ("E") of war equipment. The award was also known as the Army-Navy Production Award.  The award was created to encourage industrial [[mobilization]] and production of war time materials.  By war's end, the award had been earned by only 5% of the more than 85,000 companies involved in producing materials for the U.S. military's war effort.

These three separate awards continued until seven months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] had pulled the United States into [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=EndDetail&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#press |title=Army-Navy “E” Award Termination Sees Award Granted to 5% of Eligible Plants |work=[[United States Department of War|The War Department]] Bureau of Public Relations |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1945-12-05 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1942, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] proclaimed that the new Army-Navy "E" Award would merge the Navy "E", Army "A" and Army-Navy Munitions Board "Star" into a single, service-wide award.&lt;ref name=NewAward&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#circ |title=Circular No. 228, 1942: Army-Navy Production Award |work=[[United States Department of War|The War Department]] |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1942-07-08 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
All factories engaged in war production were eligible to receive the award. Government as well as privately owned plants were eligible, as were contractors.&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

Although the award was granted to industry, one academic institution and one individual received it. Iowa State College (now [[Iowa State University]]) received the award for its contribution to the production of uranium for the [[Manhattan Project]]. Dr. [[Harley A. Wilhelm]] received the award for inventing the [[Ames process]] for the extraction, purification and mass production of uranium for the Manhattan Project, which occurred at Iowa State College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ameslab.gov/about/our-history |title=Our History |publisher=[[Ames Laboratory]] |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some factors which were considered in selecting recipients were:&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

* Quality and quantity of production
* Overcoming of production obstacles
* Avoidance of work stoppages
* Maintaining of [[Fair Labor Standards Act|fair labor standards]]
* Training of additional labor forces
* Good record keeping in relation to health and safety

District procurement officers, chiefs of the supply services, agencies concerned with production and the Commanding Officers for the Matériel Commands would recommend plants, complete with the reasons for such recommendations.  An Award Board would review the recommended plants and decide on granting of the awards.&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

== Design ==
The award consisted of a [[Pennon|pennant]] for the production plant and emblems for all employees in the plant at the time the award was made. The pennant was a [[Swallowtail (flag)#Triangular swallowtail|triangular swallowtail]] with a white border, with a capital E within a yellow wreath of oak and laurel leaves on a vertical divided blue and red background. ARMY is on the red background and NAVY on the blue background. 

[[File:Army &amp; Navy. Bridgeport Brass Ordnance Employees Are Working For the Star - NARA - 534377.jpg|thumb|File:Army &amp; Navy. Bridgeport Brass Ordnance Employees Are Working For the Star]]
Plants that maintained an outstanding record of performance for six months after receiving their original Army-Navy E-Award were granted a star award, with a white star added to their pennant.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;  As with only a small percentage of all war production companies earning an Army-Navy "E" Award, only a small number of these earned stars, with a very small number of plants earning six stars by the end of the war. 

== Ceremony ==
Usually an Army officer and a Navy officer would be present at a ceremony, where the company would assemble all the employees involved in production. After the award of the pennant to the plant (to be flown), the employees present would receive individual pins.

A total of 4,283 companies received the award in the course of the war.&lt;ref name=EndDetail/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Herbert M. (1945). ''The Theatre Catalog.'' Philadelphia: Jay Emanuel Publications; page xviii&lt;/ref&gt; This amounted to about five percent of the companies engaged in war work.&lt;ref name=EndDetail/&gt;

== Program end ==
The Army-Navy "E" Award was terminated three months after the end of World War II, on December 5, 1945.&lt;ref name=EndDetail/&gt;

Born in [[Oklahoma]], McKinzie has a [[B.S.]] degree from [[East Central University]] as well as an [[M.B.A.]] from [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Parker |first=Marjorie H.| title=Past is Prologue: The History of Alpha Kappa Alpha 1908-1999 | year=1999 |publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated  |location=Chicago}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming president, she had various other roles in the sorority.&lt;ref name="uncrownedqueens"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/uncrownedqueens/Q/files_2005/biographies/mckinzie_barbara.htm|title=Uncrowned Queens: Barbara McKinzie|publisher=[[University at Buffalo]]|accessdate=2007-10-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uncrownedqueens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNealey 2006, op cit., p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[certified public accountant]] and former [[Comptroller]] at the [[Chicago Housing Authority]].&lt;ref name="uncrownedqueens"/&gt;

== Lawsuit to remove McKinzie ==
In July 2009, eight members of ΑΚΑ sued the sorority to have McKinzie removed as president. They alleged that she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of organization funds on personal items, including jewelry and clothing. Further, the suit alleged that the ΑΚΑ board approved a "pension stipend" of $4,000 a month for four years after McKinzie leaves office without the necessary approval of members, and that a $1 million life insurance policy was purchased for her. McKinzie was also accused of spending $900,000 on a life-sized wax statue of herself. McKinzie responded that $45,000 was actually spent on statues of herself and the sorority's first International President, the late Nellie Quander. McKinzie said the expenses were "consistent with furthering ΑΚΑ's mission," and that the lawsuit was "without merit." The plaintiffs additionally claimed that under McKinzie ΑΚΑ lost large sums in investments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160122011022/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/29/barbara-mckinzie-alpha-ka_n_247388.html Barbara McKinzie, Alpha Kappa Alpha President, Sued Over Personal Spending]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In October 2009, legal counsel for ΑΚΑ sent a letter to the plaintiffs' attorneys demanding that a web site supporting the lawsuit be removed from the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170223064121/http://www.friendsoftheweepingivy.com/pdf/Cooter's%20demand%20to%20shut%20down%20FOTWI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but the web site, Friends of the Weeping Ivy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.friendsoftheweepingivy.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912094926/http://www.friendsoftheweepingivy.com/ |archive-date=2017-09-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; remained online.

'''Christian counseling''' is distinct from secular [[Counseling psychology|counseling]]. According to the International Association of Biblical Counselors, Biblical counseling "seeks to carefully discover those areas in which a [[Christian]] may be disobedient to the principles and commands of Scripture and to help him learn how to lovingly submit to God's will."{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Counseling|url=https://www.allaboutgod.com/christian-counseling.htm|website=All About God|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian counselors, therefore, approach [[psychology]] through the lens of the [[Bible]].{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lelek|first1=Jeremy|title=Biblical Counseling Defined|url=http://christiancounseling.com/content/biblical-counseling-defined|website=Association of Biblical Counselors|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see the Bible as the source of all truth.

==History==
Christian counseling began in the end of the 1960s leading into the 1970s with the Biblical Counseling Movement directed by [[Jay E. Adams]] which brought to attention in his book ''Competent to Counsel'', a Christian-based approach which differed from the psychological and psychiatric solutions of the time. He was a devout [[Protestant]] who believed that it was the job of the church to heal people who he believed were morally corrupt, but labeled by society as mentally ill. He rejected other models of counseling, such as the [[medical model]], which gave clients a medical diagnosis based on a list of their behaviors or actions.  Adams believed the lists of maladaptive behaviors listed under each diagnostic category were actually behaviors emanating from our volitional nature, rather than an illness.  Maladaptive behaviors are a matter of [[sin]] and therefore subject to confrontation and education in God's word, exhorting the client to choose behavior that is obedient to God's word, thus removing the sin in their life.  Adams disagreed with any attempt to reclassify behavior that removed people from complete responsibility for their choices.

Adams gained converts but also lost popularity among people as well.{{clarify|1=What does "lost popularity among people mean? Which people? Professionals? Was he "popular" before he wrote the book?|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powlison|first1=David|title=The Biblical Counseling Movement|date=2010|publisher=New Growth Press|location=Greensboro|isbn=978-1-935273-13-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Adam's model of Nouthetic counseling identifies many scriptures that a counselor may use to exhort clients to change their behavior and come into obedience and away from sin.  The term "Nouthetic" is derived from the Greek word "noutheteo", meaning "to admonish".

Prior to this movement, counseling had become something more secular and not associated with the church. People such as [[Charles Darwin]], who questioned the book of Genesis and how life began in his book ''Origin of Species'' published in 1859. This caused panic in the church because it called into question everything that the church believed at the time. Following in that direction, Later [[Wilhelm Wundt]], a main contributor to the scientific method, introduced it to psychology and claimed that one's biological makeup was the reason why humans are the way they are. He was one of the main drivers behind psychology being looked at in the scientific realm. In addition to Wundt, [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that the church had failed to counsel in the correct way, so he came up with [[psychotherapy]], "the talking therapy", apart from the church. These were driving factors behind why the responsibility of counseling was moved away from the church and began to be secularized. The Church began to fall behind the ever-changing scientific field that seemed to blossom quickly. When Adams did come along he brought the attention back to the church but his influence faded in the 1980s only to be continued by [[David Powlison]]. Powlison converted to Christianity in his adult life and was extremely influential in this movement, publishing a journal, the ''Journal of Biblical Counseling'', which made his beliefs known.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Because of his work, Biblical counselors reflected on their movement and began to seek ways that it could improve which had never really been called to question before. His aim was to advance what had already been started by Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Heath|title=The Biblical Counseling Movement After Adams|date=2012|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-2813-2|pages=30–33}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration with psychology==
Efforts to combine counseling, psychotherapy or other scientific or academic endeavors with Christian or other religious perspectives or approaches are sometimes called "integration".  Integration of academic subjects with [[theology]] has a long history in academia and continues in many colleges and universities that have continued their founding religious underpinnings.&lt;ref name=stevenson07&gt;{{cite book |title = Psychology &amp; Christianity integration: Seminal works that shaped the movement |last1 =Stevenson |first1 = Daryl H. | first2 = Brian E | last2 = Eck | first3 = Peter C | last3 = Hill |year=2007 |publisher=[[Christian Association for Psychological Studies]] |location=Batavia, IL |isbn=978-0-9792237-0-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jCF1dwlLq6YC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple kinds of integration, as it has been defined differently over the years. The way in which Christianity has been integrated with psychology thus far is by considering the ways in which psychology and the [[Bible]] agree and not integrating the teachings of psychology that don't agree with the Bible. While this tactic is still in progress and continuing to be looked at, there have been significant efforts to try and integrate the two. [[Stanton Jones]] and [[Richard Buteman]] came up with a list of three different methods on how to integrate psychology and the Christian faith. The methods are called pragmatic eclecticism, metatheoretical eclecticism, and theoretical integration. The first method, pragmatic eclecticism, looks at the best solutions for resolving patients' problems based on previous research comparing different methods that have been used. The second method is concerned with the effectiveness of the counselor and looks at the tactics they are using that are beneficial and those that are not. The third method takes theories that are previously existing and makes that the baseline from which further research can build upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Stanton|last2=Buteman|first2=Richard|title=Modern psychotherapies: A comprehensive Christian appraisal|publisher=InterVarsity Press|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all integrators of Christianity and psychology do believe as underlying truth is that all truth is God's truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Daryl|last2=Ick|first2=Brian|last3=Hill|first3=Peter|title=Psychology &amp; Christianity Integration: Seminal Works that Shaped the Movement|date=2007|publisher=Christian Association for Psychological Studies|location=Batavia, Illinois|isbn=978-0-9792237-0-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Christian counseling focuses on a few main principles. It focuses on the care of the whole person, body, soul and spirit, as it is also sometimes named "soul-care", and maintains the values taught in the Bible. The aim of Christian counseling is to help people regain a sense of hope for their life that is found in [[Jesus Christ]]. Christian counseling believes that at the core of what they do is to help others achieve a better understanding of themselves and God which is rooted in the [[Holy Spirit]]'s conviction. Christian counselors seek to make people aware of the sin in their lives that has caused them suffering but also come to know the immense worth and value they have as a person to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Timothy|last2=Ohlschlager|first2=George|title=Competent Christian Counseling|date=1984|publisher=Waterbrook Press|location=Colorado Springs, Colorado|isbn=978-1-57856-517-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Jay E. Adams]] published ''Competent to Counsel'' in 1970, criticizing the influence of psychology throughout Christian counseling. He began the [[Nouthetic counseling]] movement which teaches that the Bible alone is sufficient for all counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.nanc.org/About-NANC/History | title = About | contribution = History | publisher = NANC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nouthetic counseling is strictly based on the Biblical scriptures and the power of the Holy Spirit separate from any psychological implementations, Christian counseling tries to implement psychology and Christianity still keeping God and biblical truths in the picture. While they do not take psychology as the absolute answer or solution to problems that people face, it is used as a tool in unity with Christianity to help people have a deeper understanding of themselves and God. Though some Christians do reject the teachings of science completely, others think that science and Christianity can be integrated, which Christian counseling aims to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Ken|title=Integrating Psychology and Christianity|url=http://www.northforest.org/SocialCulturalTopics/psychology.html#references|website=Integrating Psychology and Christianity|accessdate=4 December 2014}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8029">The term '''corporate immune system''', or '''corporate immune response''', refers to a process within [[corporation]]s that demands organizations within the company accomplish activities in a certain way, a form of [[Conformity|conformity tendencies]]. It is, in effect, the active form of [[groupthink]], when the past outcome of groupthink processes forces itself on organizations that are otherwise different.

The term is most commonly used to describe such processes that drive out [[innovation]] and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial activity]] within organizations. This is often found within in large multi-divisional companies, where it manifests itself as inter-divisional fighting, often subtle or unintended. [[Multinational corporation]]s are particularly common examples, as divisional differences can be compounded by different corporate structures, languages and even [[time zone]]s.

==Basic definition==
The term may refer to any organizational process that tends to drive out differences, or alternately demands [[conformity]]. The name refers to parallels with biological [[immune system]]s, which attempt to drive out "foreign" invaders and sometimes react negatively against the organism it is supposed to protect:

{{quote | text=Much as the human body sends out white blood cells to fight off anything that is aberrant to the greater host organism, corporations encourage -- often subtly -- the operations which have different work cultures to be more like everyone else. Importantly, this phenomenon often occurs even when the aberrant organization is superior to the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball Fisher, [http://www.thefishergroup.com/Free%20Resources/Teams_and_the_Bottom_Line.pdf "Teams and the Bottom Line"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919210016/http://www.thefishergroup.com/Free%20Resources/Teams_and_the_Bottom_Line.pdf |date=September 19, 2011 }}, The Fisher Group, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The immune system in the body is built into the cells in the bloodstream. It has the task of eliminating or neutralizing any alien bodies that find their way into the system. This system acts to prevent alien substances from affecting the body in a harmful way. However, as in the case of the rejection of an organ transplant, it is possible that the immune system may reject an alien body that is to its long-term benefit. By analogy, our belief is that most initiatives, and subsidiary initiatives in particular, face a corporate immune system that views them as alien and potentially harmful bodies.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|pp=153-154}}}}

The essence of the term is the ''activity'' of driving out differences, as opposed to the natural ''tendency'' to do so.

==Stifling innovation==
===Underlying issues===
Within any corporation, [[project manager|manager]]s are presented with new projects and have to gain funding and staffing resources to implement them. These projects may be organizational in nature, implementing a new sales and inventory system for instance, or product related, like manufacturing and marketing a new toy. The process of introducing and implementing new ideas is a well studied area of [[microeconomics|business theory]].{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=151}}

At any point in time, any particular manager might be presented with several new ideas, and has to choose which among these to promote. Implementation carries with it certain risks, both outright failure of the initiative, or through [[opportunity cost]]s when some other initiative is not carried out due to conflicting needs or lack of resources. In larger companies, many managers will present ideas that have to compete for larger pools of resources, as decided on by upper management. Corporations normally have well-defined procedures for assessing these proposals, in order to decide among the many concepts so the most rewarding and viable projects gain support.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}}

In an ideal corporation, the company would attempt to assess the proposal and decide whether or not to fund it based solely on its merits. Under these circumstances, it would be expected that most errors in this process would be the rejection of good ideas, rather than the approval of bad ones.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}} This is because large corporations are typically dedicated to certain markets, and dedicate a large amount of their resources to improving the processes that address those markets in order to improve efficiency as well as competitiveness. Ideas for new products or markets are generally more risky, or at least more difficult to assess, than ideas that apply to the existing corporation, which is better understood.{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}} That is, corporations tend to focus on "exploitation", to the detriment of "exploration".&lt;ref&gt;James March and Herbert Simon, "Organizations", Wiley, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manifestation and examples===
Real-world companies rarely act in a manner that one might consider "ideal". Among the many problems that might cause a good idea to be rejected are a lack of resources, a lack of market understanding, and any number of external or internal factors. Corporate immune response may be one of these internal factors, manifesting itself as internecine fighting between divisions, or simply the rejection of ideas from divisions that are "too different" to be understood. In this context, it could be any of "the set of organizational forces that suppress the advancement of creation-oriented activities such as initiatives."{{sfn|Birkinshaw|Ridderstråle|1999|p=153}}

[[Apple Computer]] has been a common example of the corporate immune response in action. During the late 1980s and the 1990s in particular, many ideas were promoted within the company, only to face severe attacks by other groups within the company. Many of these attacks were not based on real problems with the ideas, but more typically a perceived threat to the sales of an existing product. For instance, the [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] faced enormous problems within the company and almost caused its inventor to quit the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | work=The Spokesman-Review | date=October 10, 1993 | location=Spokane, Washington | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19931010&amp;id=Tm1XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TPEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6737,6192649 | title='Pirate' project blossomed into prized Apple product | page=21| accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other frequently-cited examples in computing include [[Taligent]], [[OpenDoc]], [[Workplace OS]], and the [[Star Trek project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Eric | last=Bangeman | url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2003/09/mac-09182003.ars | title=Mac.Ars takes on pre-Jobs Apple and the Paris Apple Expo 2003 | publisher=ArsTechnica | date=September 18, 2003 | accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2775">'''Dastan Islamovich Sarygulov''' ({{lang-ky|Дастан Дастан Ислам уулу Сарыгулов / Dastan İslam uulu Sarıgulov}}, born 1947) is a Kyrgyz businessman and politician.
After graduating as an engineer in 1970, he made a career in the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the 1970s to 1980s.
A protégé of the first Kyrgyz president, [[Askar Akayev]], he was given the position of governor of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] in 1991&amp;ndash;1992, and president of [[Kyrgyzaltyn]], a state company formed in 1992 with the purpose of the development of gold deposits.  In this position, he was alleged to have perpetrated serious fraud and embezzlement against the government.&lt;ref&gt;"The management of this newly formed state company was given to Dastan Sarygulov, who had no previous mining experience, but who was a close associate of president Akaev's wife" [...] "a man frequently charged with corruption and incompetence", quotations from Handrahan (ed.) ''Gendering ethnicity: implications for democracy assistance'', Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93252-3}},  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=jGTXJ65Z2j4C&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Dastan+Sarygulov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tdZzEdk64Y&amp;sig=AU9Ik_je9aQbZvRJDRTRZXflzF8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cx1KT8bhGdCfOpiJ2YQO&amp;ved=0CHcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dastan%20Sarygulov&amp;f=false p. 120]
&lt;/ref&gt;

When Akaev was ousted by the [[Tulip Revolution]], Sarygulov  managed to secure the position of state secretary in the cabinet of president  [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], formed after the [[Kyrgyzstani presidential election, 2005|2005 election]],  but was forced to step down under president in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1068439.html  May 16, 2006 (RFE/RL)]&lt;/ref&gt;
During his time in office, he also chaired an ideological committee where he proposed the adoption of "[[Tengrism]]" as an [[ethnocentric]] Kyrgyz national ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Marat, [http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/126 Kyrgyz Government Unable to Produce New National Ideology ], 22 February 2006, CACI Analyst, Central Asia-Caucasus Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7760">A '''shareholder derivative suit''' is a [[lawsuit]] brought by a [[shareholder]] on behalf of a [[corporation]] against a third party. Often, the third party is an [[insider]] of the corporation, such as an executive officer or director. Shareholder derivative suits are unique because under traditional [[corporation|corporate law]], management is responsible for bringing and defending the corporation against suit. Shareholder derivative suits permit a shareholder to initiate a suit when management has failed to do so. Because{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} derivative suits vary the traditional roles{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} of management and shareholders, many jurisdictions have implemented various procedural requirements to derivative suits.

==Purpose and difficulties==
Under traditional corporate business law, shareholders are the owners of a corporation. However, they are not empowered to control the day-to-day operations of the corporation. Instead, shareholders appoint directors, and the directors in turn appoint officers or executives to manage day-to-day operations.

Derivative suits permit a shareholder to bring an [[lawsuit|action]] in the name of the corporation against parties allegedly causing harm to the corporation. If the directors, officers, or employees of the corporation are not willing to file an action, a shareholder may first petition them to proceed. If such petition fails, the shareholder may take it upon himself to bring an action on behalf of the corporation. Any proceeds of a successful action are awarded to the corporation and not to the individual shareholders that initiate the action.

In recent years, “appraisal arbitrage” has developed as a form of shareholder litigation. Popular among hedge funds seeking to take advantage of favorable case law on valuation, such arbitrageurs buy shares in the target company of a transaction about to close and file suit claiming that the fair value of the company is higher than the ultimate price paid by the acquirer in the acquisition. The financial incentive is cashing in on a higher court-determined price plus default interest at 5% above the Federal Reserve discount rate, compounded quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gerstein|first1=Mark| last2=Connelly|first2=Blair| last3=Lightdale|first3=Sarah| last4=Rowen|first4=Zachary|title= Delaware Courts’ Recent Decisions on Appraisal may Discourage Opportunistic Appraisal Arbitrageurs|url= https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/delaware-courts%E2%80%99-recent-decisions-appraisal-may-discourage-opportunistic-appraisal|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
In most jurisdictions, a shareholder must satisfy various requirements to prove that he has a valid standing before being allowed to proceed. The law may require the shareholder to meet qualifications such as the minimum value of the shares and the duration of the holding by the shareholder; to first make a demand on the corporate board to take action; or to post bond, or other fees in the event that he does not prevail.

===Derivative suits in the United States===
In the [[United States]], corporate law is based on state law. Although the laws of each state differ, the laws of the states such as [[Delaware]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], and [[Nevada]] where corporations often incorporate, institute a number of barriers to derivative suits.

Generally in these states, and under the American Bar Association [[Model Business Corporation Act|guidelines]], the procedure of a derivative suit is as follows.  First, eligible shareholders must file a demand on the board.&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Business Corporation Act|MBCA]] § 7.42&lt;/ref&gt; The board may either reject, accept, or not act upon the demand. If after a period of time, days the demand has been rejected or has not been acted upon, shareholders may file suit.&lt;ref&gt;MBCA § 7.42(2)&lt;/ref&gt; If the board accepts the demand, the corporation itself will file the suit. If rejected, or not acted upon, the shareholder must meet additional pleading requirements.&lt;ref name="MBCA § 7.44d"&gt;MBCA § 7.44(d)&lt;/ref&gt; On the requirements being met by the shareholder, the board may appoint a “special litigation committee” which may move to dismiss.&lt;ref name="MBCA § 7.44d" /&gt; If the special litigation committee makes a required showing, the case will be dismissed. If the committee fails to make a showing, the shareholder suit may proceed.&lt;ref&gt;MBCA § 7.44(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

This model approach is followed to a greater or lesser degree among various states.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], for example, derivative suits must be brought to secure a judgment "in [the corporation's] favor."&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenberg v. Flying Tiger Line, Inc.'', 451 F.2d 267.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delaware]] has different rules in regards to demand and bond requirements too.

The famous case of ''[[Shaffer v. Heitner]]'', which ultimately reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], originated with a shareholder derivative suit against [[Greyhound Lines]].

===Derivative suits in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], an action brought by a minority shareholder may not be upheld under the doctrine set out in ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in 1843. Exceptions to the doctrine involve ''[[ultra vires]]'' and the "fraud on minority". According to Blair and Stout's "Team Production Theory of Corporate Law", the purpose of the suit is not to protect the shareholders, but to protect the corporation itself. Creditors, rather than shareholders, may bring an action, if a corporation faces [[insolvency]].

The [[Companies Act 2006]] provided a new procedure, but it did not reformulate the rule in ''Foss v Harbottle''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/en/ukpgaen_20060046_en.pdf Explanatory Notes on Companies Act 2006] pages 74&amp;ff&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, the procedure slightly modified the pre-existing rules, and provided for a new preliminary stage at which a ''prima facie’’ case must be shown. In Scotland where there had been no clear rules on shareholder actions on behalf of the company, the Act sought to achieve a result similar to that in England and Wales.

===Derivative suits in continental Europe===
Derivative shareholder suits are extremely rare in continental Europe. The reasons probably lie within laws that prevent small shareholders from bringing lawsuits in the first place. Many European countries have company acts that legally require a minimum share in order to bring a derivative suit. Larger shareholders could bring lawsuits, however, their incentives are rather to settle the claims with the management, sometimes to the detriment of the small shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Michael Sekyra, No derivative shareholder suits in Europe: A model of percentage limits and collusion, International Review of Law and Economics (IRLE) 2011, vol. 31 (1), p. 16-20 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1788919 (link).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Why do Shareholder Derivative Suits Remain Rare in Continental Europe?, 37 BROOKLYN J. INT'L L. 843-892 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative suits in New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] these can be brought under the Companies Act 1993 section 165 only with the leave of the court. It must be in the best interest of the company to have this action brought so benefits to company must outweigh the costs of taking action.

===Derivative suits in India===
In India, derivative suits are brought under the clauses of oppression and mismanagement.

'''Djoko Susanto''' (born '''Kwok Kwie Fo''', 1950, [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]) is an Indonesian [[entrepreneur]], successful businessman and well known as a new [[billionaire]] of [[Indonesia]] since 2011. Djoko was the owner of [[Alfamart]], retail business with mini-marts concept.

==Early life==
Djoko is the sixth out of 10 siblings, he only reached the 1st grade. He had to drop out of school because the Indonesian government banned students with Chinese names (he later changed his last name). At age 17 he started managing his parents' modest 560-foot stall inside Pasar Arjuna, a traditional market in [[Jakarta]]. The stall sold groceries at the time, but soon Djoko was peddling cigarettes and opening  more stalls. His success attracted the attention of clove cigarette tycoon [[Putera Sampoerna]]. Together they opened similar stalls and then opened a discount supermarket chain.

==Business empire==
Djoko continued his partnership with Putera Sampoerna until 2005, then Sampoerna sold his cigarettes business, 70% of his share to [[Philip Morris International|Altria]] including his share on the retail business run by Djoko. Altria did not desire on retail business and then sold their shares to Northstar, but Djoko later bought the shares from Northstar, making him own the major share of 65%. He later developed the retail business into Alfa Supermarket. Nowadays, under the management of PT. Sumber Alfaria Trijaya Tbk, they run more than 5,500 stores under several brands such as Alfamart, Alfa Express, Alfa Midi and Lawson. Thus business made Djoko become the 25th wealthiest person in Indonesia on 2011, and rose to rank 17th on early 2012, decrease to 20th by November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/djoko-susanto/ |title=Indonesia's 40 richest people November 2012 |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2013-01-31 |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase|title=e-file.lu}} 

'''e-file.lu''' is an electronic filing and communication platform in [[Luxembourg]] for [[secure transmission]] of data, documents and regulatory reports between financial institutions and Luxembourg authorities. It is broadly equivalent to the SEC’s [[EDGAR]] system in the USA or the FSA’s [[GABRIEL (FCA)|GABRIEL]] platform in the UK.

E-file was conceived and developed by [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]] and [[Finesti]] in cooperation with the [[Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier|CSSF]], Luxembourg’s financial regulatory authority.

==Data transmission==
It allows both automatic and manual transmission of data.
The e-file platform permits the transmission of formatted documents as well as data flows in [[XBRL]] or [[XML]] format. This flexibility and the modular architecture make transmission independent from the types of data and documents.

==Secure transmission==
E-file transmissions take place in a secure environment complying with the European and domestic regulatory requirements&lt;ref name="CSSF circular 08/334"&gt;[http://www.cssf.lu/uploads/media/cssf08_334eng.pdf CSSF Circular 08/334]&lt;/ref&gt; through [[data encryption]], 1024/2048 [[Bit|bits]] SSL certificates and [[HTTPS]] connection.
Such secure transmission is used for mandatory transmission of regulatory bank reports to the Luxembourg Central Bank (BCL) and the CSSF.

==Bank reporting==
E-file is also used for electronic bank reporting required under [[Basel II Accord|Basel II]], [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IRFS]] and [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|MiFID]] as well as for other legal and statistical reporting to the Luxembourg Central Bank (BCL) and the CSSF. Automated reports are transmitted in [[XBRL]] or [[XML]] format.

==UCI reporting==
In September 2008 the Luxembourg’s financial regulatory authority [[Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier|CSSF]] issued a circular 08/371&lt;ref name="CSSF circular 08/371"&gt;[http://www.cssf.lu/uploads/media/cssf08_371eng.pdf CSSF Circular 08/371]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the official adoption of the e-file platform for the mandatory transmission of UCI simplified and full prospectuses and annual and semi-annual reports both to the [[Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier|CSSF]] and to the electronic reference database of the financial centre’s investment funds set up by [[Finesti]].
The platform allows the final validation of the documents that are to be sent.

'''Enterprise relationship management''' or '''ERM''' is a business method in [[relationship management]] beyond [[customer relationship management]].

{{quote|ERM - Enterprise Relationship Management is basically a business strategy for value creation that is not based on cost containment, but rather on the leveraging of network-enabled processes and activities to transform the relationships between the organization and all its internal and external constituencies in order to maximize current and future opportunities.|Galbreath, 2002}}

==Overview==
[[Relationship management]] is not an entirely new concept. In fact, it has taken on many forms that address specific organizational constituencies (customers, channel partners, specialized service providers, employees, suppliers, etc.). The most obvious form is CRM ([[customer relationship management]]), which focuses on improving top-line growth by maximizing an organization's ability to identify sales and business opportunities with its customers. CRM's little brother PRM ([[partner relationship management]]), focuses on optimizing opportunity and downstream order management for an organization's channel partners (e.g. CISCO and its partner lead and referral management process) On the back end, we have ERP ([[enterprise resource planning]]) to manage internal operations including manufacturing, finance, HR, sales and distribution, etc. Specialized HRM ([[human resource management]]) solutions exist to manage employee benefits, collective agreements, performance reviews and so forth. And lastly, SCM ([[supply chain management]], either as an ERP module or as a stand-alone application) to manage the product flow, up and down a firm's value chain, with external partners/suppliers.
[[Image:net2.jpg|thumb|right|Making the links in a business network]]

However, according to Galbreath (2002), "for the most part CRM, human resources management (HRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM), partner relationship management (PRM) and similar programs have paid very little attention to the relationships that underpin those processes, or to the intangible – relationship – assets embedded in them."

Norman and Ramirez (1993) state, "One of the chief strategic challenges of the new economy is to integrate knowledge and relationships – devise a good fit between competencies (Competencies are the technologies, specialized expertise, business processes and techniques that a company has accumulated over time and packages in its offering) and customers and keep that fit current."  Galbraeth (2002) adds that "success in the relationship age requires a deliberate process of creating intangible, relationship assets, growing them and [[monetization|monetizing]] them".

Galbreath (2002) suggests that enterprise relationship management is a process that harmonizes and synergiezes  different organizational relationships to realize targeted business benefits and goal. Harbison et al. (2000)did some research on the performance of alliances and cited the following statistics in their study:
* "Strategic alliances have consistently produced a return on investment of nearly 17 percent among the top 2,000 companies in the world for nearly a decade. This return is 50 percent more than the average return on investment that the companies produced overall." Harbison et al. (2000)
* "The 25 companies most active in alliances achieved a 17.2 percent return on equity - 40 percent more than the average return on equity of the Fortune 500." - Harbison et al. (2000)
* "The 25 companies least active in alliances lagged the Fortune 500, with an average return on equity of only 10.1 percent." - Harbison et al. (2000)
* "Successful alliances recognize 20 percent profitability improvements as compared to only 11 percent for the less successful companies." - Harbison et al. (2000)
* "Revenue generation from highly successful alliances equates to 21 percent of overall firm sales as compared to 14 percent for less successful alliances." - Harbison et al. (2000)

In a similar study conducted for the supplier side (results of efficiently run supply chains based on electronic integration and quality processes) by Solomon Smith Barney Analyst Report, Teagarden{{Cite quote|date=October 2007}} (2000) presents the following statistics for suppliers:
* Inventory levels reduced by as much as 50 percent.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* Inventory turns doubled.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* Stock outs reduced ninefold.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* On-time deliveries increased by as much as 40 percent.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* Cycle times decreased by as much as 27 percent overall.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* Supply chain costs reduced by as much as 20 percent.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* Revenues increased by as much as 17 percent.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

When looking at these numbers, collaboration with outside firms becomes very attractive. But success in business, as in many other pursuits, is dependent on motivation, investment, trust, discipline and repeatability.

==Tools and methodologies==
ERM frameworks are needed because relationships are becoming prevalent and more integral to an organization's success. Although establishing inter-enterprise links is far from a new science, Klambach and Roussel{{Cite quote|date=October 2007}} (1999) affirm that nearly 60% of business alliances do not deliver anticipated benefits while Lovallo &amp; Kahneman{{Cite quote|date=October 2007}} (2003) and Selden &amp; Colvin{{Cite quote|date=October 2007}} (2003) estimate M&amp;A ( Mergers &amp; Acquisitions) failures range between 70% and 80%.

With statistics like these, the need to improve relationship success rates seems quite obvious. Many authors have addressed these issues from varying perspectives, including technology enabling a firm, reviewing or re-designing operational &amp; administrative processes, and transforming the culture to one that is more adapted to collaboration. As Galbreath (2002) and Norman &amp; Ramirez{{Cite quote|date=October 2007}} (1993) state, collaboration or rather the effective leveraging of relationship resources to create new sources of value, is a process of learning and developing new mental models and competencies (Senge{{Cite quote|date=October 2007}}, 1991) as well as obtaining resources through new means/sources.

ERM is still a relatively new field and few players stand-out with a complete ERM methodology and tools. Nevertheless, a host of best of breed tools and methodologies exist to carry out an ERM implementation, unfortunately they are not integrated and focus on very specialized problem areas. ERM tools can be viewed as enablers of an ERM methodology.

Fundamentally adopting ERM is a cultural and change management issue more than a technology or process one. Therefore, regardless of the methodology or tools that one may elect to use when integrating with outside firms, they must maintain a focus on the human side of the equations. The figure below illustrates the benefits of focusing on the human, cultural and change aspect of a project, notably deploying ERM in this case.

==Practical methodologies and frameworks==

===RIIM and PowerScope===
RIIM (Relationship Intelligence and Influence Management) is a registered method of Perfluence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perfluence.com/methods RIIM - Relationship Intelligence and Influence Management - Perfluence SA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a systemic approach based on the assumption that each relationship can be seen as a linear combination of five different kind of common relationships.

'''Finley Johnson Shepard''' (October 8, 1867 - August 22, 1942) was an executive at the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on October 8, 1867 in [[Manhattan, New York City]]. He married [[Helen Miller Gould]], the daughter of [[Jay Gould]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Helen Against Revolution |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743004,00.html |quote=&lt;!--It was not until 1913 that she married Railman Finley Johnson Shepard. In the 45 years of her spinsterhood—she was plain, plump, not much concerned with "Society" — she dedicated herself to good works while her brothers and sister went out in the world. She scarcely approved of Sister Anna, who spent much money, married successively Count Boniface ("Boni") de Castellane and the Due de Talleyrand; or smart Brother Frank Jay twice-divorced, who dabbled (and still does) in French gambling palaces; or her late Brother George Jay, whose second wife (Guinevere Sinclair) bore him three children before he married her in 1921. Helen Gould stayed by her father, who trained her in finance, took her in his confidence before he died of tuberculosis in 1892. --&gt;|publisher=[[Time magazine]] |date=January 25, 1932 |accessdate=2008-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Helen Gould Weds.

'''G.9972''' (also known as '''G.cx''') is a Recommendation developed by ITU-T that specifies a coexistence mechanism for networking transceivers capable of operating over electrical power line wiring. It allows [[G.hn]] devices to coexist with other devices implementing G.9972 and operating on the same power line wiring.&lt;ref name="BERGU14b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Berger, Lars T.|author2=Schwager, Andreas|author3=Galli, Stefano and Pagani, Pascal|author4=Schneider, Daniel M.|author5=Lioe, Hidayat.|date=February 2014|title=Current Power Line Communication Systems: A Survey|publisher=CRC Press|editor1=Berger, Lars T. |editor2=Schwager, Andreas |editor3=Pagani, Pascal and Schneider, Daniel M.|series=Devices, Circuits, and Systems|chapter=10|pages=253–270|isbn=9781466557529|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/b16540-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G.9972 received consent during the meeting of ITU-T Study Group 15, on October 9, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homegridforum.org/news_events/pr/10_09_09/ UNITED NATIONS ITU-T RATIFIES G.HN STANDARD FOR WIRED HOME NETWORKING], HomeGrid Forum Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; and final approval on June 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/United-Nations-ITU-Ts-Ghn-Approved-as-Global-Standard-for-Wired-Home-Networking-1274797.htm United Nations ITU-T's G.hn Approved as Global Standard for Wired Home Networking]&lt;/ref&gt;

G.9972 specifies two mechanisms for coexistence between [[G.hn]] home networks and [[broadband over power lines]] (BPL) [[Internet access]] networks:
* [[Frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM), in which the available spectrum is divided in two parts: frequencies below 10 or 14&amp;nbsp;MHz (specific value can be selected by the access network) are reserved for the access network, while frequencies above them are reserved for the in-home network.
* [[Time-division multiplexing]] (TDM), in which the available channel time is split equally between both networks. 50% of time slots are allocated for the access network, and 50% are allocated to the in-home network.

As a young man in the early 1940s, Nishijima became a student of the noted Zen teacher [[Kōdō Sawaki]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogensangha.org/gwn.htm|title=Introducing Master Gudo Wafu Nishijima|publisher=Dogen Sangha|accessdate=2005-12-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201031049/http://www.dogensangha.org/gwn.htm|archivedate=2005-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the end of the [[Second World War]], Nishijima received a law degree from [[Tokyo University]] and began a career in [[finance]]. It was not until 1973, when he was in his mid-fifties, that Nishijima was ordained as a Buddhist priest. His preceptor for this occasion was [[Rempo Niwa]],&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; a former head of the [[Soto Zen]] sect. Four years later, Niwa gave him [[Dharma transmission|shiho]], formally accepting him as one of his successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nishijima|first1=Gudō Wafu|last2=Cohen|first2=Jundo|authorlink2=Jundo Cohen|title=A Heart to Heart Chat on Buddhism with Old Master Gudo|publisher=PageFree Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|page=110|ISBN=9781589612129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nishijima continued his professional career until 1979.

During the 1960s, Nishijima began giving regular public lectures on Buddhism and [[zazen|Zen meditation]]. From the 1980s, he lectured in [[English language|English]] and had a number of foreign students, including [[Mike Luetchford]], his first Western Dharma Heir and founder of Dogen Sangha UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogensangha.org.uk/ |title=Dogen Sangha Bristol }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Bailey]], co-author with Nishijima of 'To Meet the Real Dragon,'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Meet-Real-Dragon-Gudo-Nishijima/dp/0956299903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425080329&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=to+meet+the+real+dragon |title=To Meet the Real Dragon }}&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[Brad Warner]], and teacher Jundo Cohen. In 2007, Nishijima and a group of his students organized as the [[Dogen Sangha International]]. In April 2012, Warner dissolved the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hardcorezen.blogspot.com/2012/04/dogen-sangha-international-is-no-more.html |title=Dogen Sangha International is No More |publisher=Hardcorezen.blogspot.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hardcorezen.blogspot.com/2012/04/dogen-sangha-international-post-mortem.html |title=Dogen Sangha International Post Mortem |publisher=Hardcorezen.blogspot.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nishijima was the author of several books in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and English. He was also a notable translator of [[Buddhist texts]]: working with student and Dharma heir [[Mike Chodo Cross]], Nishijima compiled one of three complete English versions of [[Dōgen]]'s ninety-five-fascicle ''Kana [[Shōbōgenzō|Shobogenzo]]''; he also translated Dogen's ''[[Shinji Shōbōgenzō]]''. He also published an English translation of [[Nagarjuna]]'s ''[[Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way]]'' (''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').

Nishijima had not been in good health for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gudoblog-e.blogspot.com/2011/01/announcement.html |title=Announcement |publisher=Dogen Sangha Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported by family that his final words, upon refusing further medical treatment, were, "I decide my death time by myself." Nishijima was often heard to say in teaching that "Life is just the fact in this moment; death is just the fact in this moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G0Pdq1ESf0 |title=Buddhist Life |publisher=The Story of Gudo Wafu Nishijima (Documentary) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three philosophies and one reality==

While studying the ''Shōbōgenzō'', Nishijima developed a theory he called "three philosophies and one reality,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nishijima Gudo Wafu|year=1987|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/DogenStudies/three_philosophies.pdf|title=Three Philosophies and One Reality|format=pdf|publisher=Windbell Publications, Tokyo|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which presents his distinctive interpretation of the [[Four Noble Truths]] as well as explaining the structure of [[Dogen]]'s writing. According to Nishijima, Dōgen carefully constructed the ''Shōbōgenzō'' according to a fourfold structure, in which he described each issue from four different perspectives. The first perspective is "[[idealism|idealist]]," "[[abstraction|abstract]]," "[[spirituality|spiritual]]," and "[[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]]"; Nishijima says this is the correct interpretation of the first Noble Truth (in mainstream Buddhism, the first Noble Truth is ''[[dukkha]]''). The second perspective is "concrete," "[[materialism|materialistic]]," "[[science|scientific]]," and "[[Object (philosophy)|objective]]" (in mainstream Buddhism, ''samudaya''). The third perspective is described as an integration of the first two, producing a "[[Philosophical realism|realistic]]" synthesis (mainstream, ''nirodha''). The fourth perspective is [[reality]] itself, which Nishijima argues cannot be contained in philosophy or stated in words, but which Dōgen attempts to suggest through [[poetry]] and [[symbol]]ism.  In mainstream Buddhism, the fourth Noble Truth is the [[Eightfold Path]].{{ref|1}}

Nishijima stated that "Buddhism is just Humanism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://gudoblog-e.blogspot.com/2007/04/buddhism-and-humanism.html Buddhism and Humanism]&lt;/ref&gt; and he explains [[Dogen]]'s teaching on [[zazen]] in terms of balancing the [[Autonomic Nervous System|autonomic nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogensangha.org/downloads/ANS&amp;Buddhism.PDF The Relation Between the Autonomic Nervous System and Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6887">The concept of the '''innovation system''' stresses that the flow of technology and information among people, enterprises, and institutions is key to an innovative process. It contains the interactions between the actors needed in order to turn an idea into a process, product, or service on the market.

==Development and diffusion of the concept==
Systems of Innovation are frameworks for understanding innovation which have become popular particularly among policy makers and innovation researchers first in Europe, but now anywhere in the world as in the 90's the World Bank and other UN affiliated institutions accepted. The concept of a 'system of innovation' was introduced by [[B.-Å. Lundvall]] in 1985 &lt;ref&gt;[[B.-Å. Lundvall]]  (1985) ‘Product innovation and user-producer interaction, industrial development’, Research Series 31, Aalborg: Aalborg University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “however, as he and his colleagues would be the first to agree (and as Lundvall himself points out), the idea actually goes back at least to  the [[Friedrich List]]´s conception of “The National System of Political Economy” (1841), which might just as well have been called “The National System of Innovation” (Freeman, 1995). Christopher Freeman coined the expression "National Innovation System" or in his 1988 study of the success of the Japanese economy.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, C. (1988) ‘Japan: A new national innovation system?’, in G. Dosi, C. Freeman, R. R. Nelson, G. Silverberg and L. Soete (eds.) Technology and economy theory, London: Pinter..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, C. (1995) The ”National System of Innovation” in Historical Perspective. Cambridge Journal of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept, similarly used as "National System of Innovation" or "National Innovation System" was later applied to regions and sectors. According to innovation system theory, [[innovation]] and technology development are results of a complex set of relationships among actors in the system, which includes enterprises, universities and research institutes.

Innovation systems have been categorized into [[national innovation system]]s, [[regional innovation system]]s, [[local innovation system]]s, [[technological innovation system]]s and sectoral innovation systems.

There is no consensus on the exact definition of an innovation system, and the concept is still emerging. Innovation is often the result of the interaction among an ecology of actors, and the term 'innovation ecosystem' is occasionally used to emphasize this. For some, the expression 'innovation ecosystem' is a subset or synonym of 'innovation system'. Others separate between the expressions, using the expression "innovation system" for labeling a planned innovation environment, and "innovation ecosystem" for an ecological innovation environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/56/2101733.pdf National Innovation Systems (OECD, 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the debate also started to study the problems that affect green innovation since in addition to the issues typical of innovation generally (such as market failures related to limited appropriability of economic benefits of knowledge), green growth innovation is also hindered by market failures related to the environment (pollution externalities). It is possible (and not uncommon) for an innovation system to successfully support innovation in many technology areas, but not in ones related to green growth. For this reason, it is necessary to focus on addressing both kinds of failures in order to drive innovation towards a green growth trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;A Guide to Innovation System Analysis for Green Growth. Enrico Botta, Colin McCormick, Jason Eis [http://gggi.org/gggi-develops-analysis-framework-to-strengthen-green-growth-innovation/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Definitions of National Innovation Systems ===
A national system of innovation has been defined as follows:

* “ .. the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse  new technologies.” (Freeman, 1987) 
* “ .. the elements and relationships which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new, and economically useful, knowledge ... and are either located within or rooted inside the borders of a nation state.” (Lundvall, 1992) 
* “... a set of institutions whose interactions determine the innovative performance ... of national firms.”  (Nelson, 1993) 
* “ .. the national institutions, their incentive structures and their competencies, that determine the rate and direction of technological learning (or the volume and composition of change generating activities) in a country.” (Patel and Pavitt, 1994) 
* “.. that set of distinct institutions which jointly and individually contribute to the development and diffusion of new technologies and which provides the framework within which governments form and implement policies to influence the innovation process.  As such it is a system of interconnected institutions to create, store and transfer the knowledge, skills and artefacts which define new technologies.” (Metcalfe, 1995)
* “.. a human social network that behaves like a sociobiological system, wherein people have developed patterns of behavior that minimize transaction costs caused by social barriers resulting from geography, lack of trust, differences in language and culture, and inefficient social networks.” (Hwang and Horowitt, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hwang|first=Victor and Greg Horowitt|title=The Rainforest: The Secret to Building the Next Silicon Valley|year=2012|publisher=Regenwald|location=Los Altos Hills|isbn=978-0615586724|pages=304|url=http://www.therainforestbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''International Securities Identification Number''' ('''ISIN''') uniquely identifies a [[security (finance)|security]]. Its structure is defined in [[ISO 6166]]. The ISIN code is a 12-character alphanumeric code that serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and [[settlement (finance)|settlement]].

==History==
ISINs were first used in 1981, but didn't reach wide acceptance until 1989, when the [[Group of Thirty|G30 countries]] recommended adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/cpis/2002/pdf/cpis_index.pdf|title=Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey Guide, Second Edition, International Monetary Fund, 2002, Washington DC - Appendix VII: International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) Code System|author=|date=|website=imf.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614080658/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/cpis/2002/pdf/cpis_index.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISIN was endorsed a year later by ISO with the ISO 6166 standard.

Initially information was distributed via [[CD-ROM]]s and this was later replaced by distribution over the internet.

In 2004 the European Union mandated the use of instrument identifiers in some of its regulatory reporting, which included ISIN as one of the valid identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2004/809/oj/eng|title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 of 29 April 2004 implementing Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards information contained in prospectuses as well as the format, incorporation by reference and publication of such prospectuses and dissemination of advertisements (Text with EEA relevance)|author=|date=|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6166'' (or ISO6166:2013 as of the 2013 revision) defines the structure of an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a [[Security (finance)#Fungible and non-fungible security|fungible security]].

Securities with which ISINs can be used are:
*[[Stock|Equities]] (shares, units, depository receipts)
*[[fixed income|Debt instruments]] ([[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and debt instruments other than international, international bonds and debt instruments, stripped coupons and principal, treasury bills, others)
*Entitlements ([[Pre-emption right|rights]], [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]])
*[[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] ([[Option (finance)|options]], [[Futures contract|futures]])
*Others (commodities, currencies, indices, interest rates)

ISINs consist of two alphabetic characters, which are the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code for the issuing country, nine alpha-numeric characters (the [[National Securities Identifying Number]], or NSIN, which identifies the security, padded as necessary with leading zeros), and one numerical [[check digit]]. They are thus always 12 characters in length. When the NSIN changes due to corporate actions or other reasons, the ISIN will also change. Issuance of ISINs is decentralized to individual [[national numbering agencies]] (NNAs). Since existing national numbering schemes administered by the various NNAs form the basis for ISINs, the methodology for assignment is not consistent across agencies globally.

An ISIN cannot specify a particular trading location, or another identifier, typically a [[Market Identifier Code|MIC]] ([[Market Identifier Code]]) or the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN. The currency of the trade will also be required to uniquely identify the instrument using this method.

== Usage and acceptance ==

Since 1989, when ISINs were introduced, they have slowly gained traction worldwide in their usage.

ISINs are being introduced worldwide and are the most popular global securities identifier. Trading, clearing and settlement systems in many countries have adopted ISINs as a secondary measure of identifying securities. Some countries, mainly in Europe, have moved to using the ISIN as their primary means of identifying securities. In addition new European regulations such as [[Solvency II Directive 2009|Solvency II]] increasingly require the ISIN to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dev.eiopa.europa.eu/Taxonomy/Full/2.0.1/EIOPA_XBRL_Filing_Rules_for_Solvency_II_reporting_2.0.1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007121238/https://dev.eiopa.europa.eu/Taxonomy/Full/2.0.1/EIOPA_XBRL_Filing_Rules_for_Solvency_II_reporting_2.0.1.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial model==

The ISIN is generally included in services sold by [[financial data vendors]] and intermediaries. These services are normally paid services as more value added data is included with the information. In general, the issuer of a security will include the ISIN in issuance papers or other documentation for identification purposes.

== Controversy ==
In 2009, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] was formally charged by the [[European Commission]] (EC) with abusing its position in licensing international securities identification codes for United States [[securities]] by requiring European [[financial firm]]s and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. "This behaviour amounts to unfair pricing", the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&amp;P. "The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and cannot be substituted”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2011, Standard and Poor's provided [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/39592/39592_2152_5.pdf six undertakings] to the European Commission to remedy the situation. The agreement is applicable to all consuming companies in the [[European Economic Area]]. These expired at the end of 2016.

== Examples ==

The examples below describes one approach for applying the [[Luhn algorithm]] on two different ISINs. The difference in the two examples has to do with if there are an odd or even number of digits after converting letters to number. Since the NSIN element can be any alpha numeric sequence (9 characters), an odd number of letters will result in an even number of digits and an even number of letters will result in an odd number of digits. For an odd number of digits, the approach in the first example is used. For an even number of digits, the approach in the second example is used. The [[Luhn algorithm]] can also be applied in the same manner for both types or lengths (alternating multiply the string of digits by 1 and 2, starting from the end of the string), being more generic.

=== Apple, Inc. ===

[[Apple inc|Apple, Inc.]]: ISIN '''US0378331005''', expanded from [[CUSIP]] '''037833100'''
The main body of the ISIN is the original CUSIP, assigned in the 1970s. The country code "US" has been added on the front, and an additional check digit at the end. The country code indicates the country of issue. The check digit is calculated using the [[Luhn algorithm]].

Convert any letters to numbers:

U = 30, S = 28. US037833100 -&gt; 30 28 037833100 

Collect odd and even characters:

3028037833100 = (3, 2, 0, 7, 3, 1, 0), (0, 8, 3, 8, 3, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the '''FIRST''' group) by 2:

(6, 4, 0, 14, 6, 2, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(6 + 4 + 0 + (1 + 4) + 6 + 2 + 0) + (0 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 0) = 45

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

45 mod 10 = 5

Subtract from 10:

10 - 5 = 5

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

5 mod 10 = 5

So the ISIN check digit is five.

=== Treasury Corporation of Victoria ===

TREASURY CORP VICTORIA 5 3/4% 2005-2016: ISIN '''AU0000XVGZA3'''.
The check digit is calculated using the [[Luhn algorithm]].

Convert any letters to numbers:

A = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. AU0000XVGZA -&gt; 10 30 0000 33 31 16 35 10.

Collect odd and even characters:

103000003331163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 6, 5, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the '''SECOND''' group) by 2:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 12, 10, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

27 mod 10 = 7

Subtract from 10:

10 - 7 = 3

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

3 mod 10 = 3

So the ISIN check digit is three.

=== BAE Systems ===

[[BAE Systems]]: ISIN '''GB0002634946''', expanded from SEDOL '''000263494'''

The main body is the [[SEDOL]], padded on the front with the addition of two zeros. The country code "GB" is then added on the front, and the check digit on the end as in the example above.

==Check-digit flaw in ISIN==

The Treasury Corporation of Victoria ISIN illustrates a flaw in ISIN's check digit algorithm which allows transposed letters: Suppose the ISIN was mis-typed as AU0000'''VX'''GZA3 (instead of AU0000'''XV'''GZA3)

A = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. "AU0000VXGZA" -&gt; 10 30 00 00 31 33 16 35 10".

Collect odd and even characters:

103000003133163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 5, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the '''SECOND''' group) by 2:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 12, 10, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

27 mod 10 = 7

Subtract from 10:

10 - 7 = 3

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

3 mod 10 = 3

So the ISIN check digit is ''still'' three '''even though two letters have been transposed'''.

Such flaw against a single transposed pair of letters or digits would have been avoided using two check digits instead of just one (i.e., a 97 modulus instead of the 10 modulus, like in [[International Bank Account Number|IBAN]] numbers which may also mix letters and digits). Some protocols require the transmission of additional check digits added to the full ISIN number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6235">'''Jean-Claude Larréché''' (born 3 July 1947) is a French [[organizational theorist]], and the Alfred H. Heineken Chaired Professor of marketing at [[INSEAD]], a post he has held since 1993. He is known for his pioneering work in the use of computer simulations (i.e. [[simulation games]]) in marketing training, his work at INSEAD on marketing excellence and customer focus, and his book ''[[The Momentum Effect]]''.

== Biography ==
Larréché received his degree for Ingénieur en électronique from INSA, Lyon in 1968, his MSc in Computer Science from the [[University of London]] in 1969, his MBA, INSEAD and his PhD at the Graduate School of Business of the Stanford University.

After completing his MBA in 1970 Larreche was working as a research assistant an INSEAD when he was asked to assist L’Oreal assess a computerised marketing model they were considering purchasing. He was fascinated by it and "decided to investigate the best places in the world to study marketing modelling." {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=49}}. Larréché is quoted as saying that he chose Stanford for his PhD so that he could study under Dave Montgomery, one of the founders of marketing modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1977, working with an assistant, [[Hubert Gatignon]], he developed his work on marketing modelling to create a teaching simulation called [[Markstrat]] {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=50}}. Markstrat is a game where teams of students compete against each other in an artificial world under realistic market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Meixner &amp; Rainer Haas, “Markstrat Simulation: Distance Learning for Marketing Students”, Paper presented at the 6th Annual EDEN Conference – Budapest, June 1997, http://www.boku.ac.at/mi/markstrat/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that Markstrat is now used in 8 out of the top 10 business schools in the world and 25 of the top 30 schools in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stratxsimulations.com/simulation/strategic-marketing-simulation/|title=Strategic marketing simulation game -Markstrat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently he developed the simulation [http://www.digbusinesslearning.com/ ''''''DiG - Discovery Innovation Growth] a versatile learning tool to develop competencies in innovation, customer centricity, value based marketing, business acumen, leadership and team performance (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digbusinesslearning.com/what-we-do-dig-leadership-game/|title=DIG - Business simulation game and leadership training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

In 1983, at the age of just 36 Larréché was appointed to the board of Reckitt &amp; Coleman (now [[Reckitt Benckiser plc]]) in a non-executive role after previously working for the firm in a consultancy capacity {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|pp=56–7}}. He remained on the board for 18 years. He founded a consultancy business, [http://stratxcorporate.com/about/ StratX], in 1984. {{Harv|Mazur|Miles|2007|p=52}}. The company currently offers experiential learning programs for top corporations and universities worldwide.

During the 1990s Larreche’s work began to concentrate on the underlying capabilities that impact on a business’s ability to compete in the marketplace. He published a series of reports based on surveys conducted with more than 1200 executives in hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Competitive Fitness of Global Firms''. (1998-2002). Financial Times Management/Financial Times Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The surveys attempted to define and evaluate the attributes, characteristics and behaviours of large global firms and assess their impact on corporate performance. That work, combined with computer modelling and his long-time work on customer focus,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Larreche's INSEAD executive education program "From Customer Focus: From Promise to Action"&lt;/ref&gt; converged on the concept of “momentum” – an attempt to map out a process for improving the efficiency of a firm’s growth. The culmination of this period of Larreche’s work was the publication in 2008 of ''The Momentum Effect: How to ignite exceptional growth'' {{Harv|Larreche|2008}}.

He received the following awards:
* 1995 – Marketing Educator of the Year, Club 55, the European Community of Marketing Experts.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Cary L. ''Who's Who in the Management Sciences''. 2000. Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-84064-237-7}}. p 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
* 1995 – "Best Case of the Year" Award for the Virgin Atlantic Airways case study in Relationship Marketing category, EFMD
* 1996 – "Overall European Case of the Year" Award for the Virgin Atlantic Airways case study, ECCH

'''John Michael Cocoris''' ({{lang-el|Γιάννης Μιχάλης Κόκκορης}}; September 17, 1877 – 1944) was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[businessman]].

Born in [[Leonidio]], he came to [[New York City|New York]] in 1895 to work in the [[sea sponge|sponge]] trade. In 1896, he worked with [[John K. Cheyney]] in [[Tarpon Springs]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu/~ufruss/documents/bernard%201965%20sponge%20boats%20in%20florida.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, he introduced sponge diving to the area and recruited Greek sponge divers from the [[Dodecanese Islands]]. By the 1930s, the sponge industry of Tarpon Springs was very productive, generating millions of dollars a year.

He died in 1944 in [[Duval County, Florida]].

==Early life and education==
Born on 2 January 1952 in [[Napier, New Zealand]], Hood attended [[Westlake Boys High School]] in [[Auckland]], where a [[House system|house]] has been named after him (Hood House).

During 1970 and 1976, Hood attended the [[University of Auckland]], where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.E.]] in 1972 and a [[Ph.D.]] in Civil Engineering in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/people.php?personid=131|title=John Hood|publisher=All Souls College, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.lu.se/upload/masters/John%20Hood_CV.pdf|title=John Hood - CV|author=John Hood|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104072907/http://www4.lu.se/upload/masters/John%20Hood_CV.pdf|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to Oxford, where he resided in [[Worcester College]] and studied for an M.Phil. in [[Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=John Hood biography | url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/vc/biog.shtml | publisher=University of Oxford | date=5 October 2004 | accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a Blue playing squash for Oxford University and also played [[first-class cricket]] for Oxford University in 1977.&lt;ref name=cric&gt;{{cite web | title=Cricinfo Cricket records | url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/14929.html | accessdate = 2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Career in New Zealand===
He has held a number of directorships in prominent New Zealand companies and bodies, including [[Fonterra]], [[Fletcher Challenge]] and the [[New Zealand Cricket]] review of 1995. His career at Fletcher Challenge is described in the book ''[[Battle of the Titans (book)|Battle of the Titans]]'' by Bruce Wallace. From 1998–2004, he was Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Auckland]].

===Vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford===
Hood's term as vice-chancellor of Oxford has been the subject of controversy. Hood had proposed to reform the 900-year-old tradition of complete self-governance by introducing a number of external members to council, and by separating academic and financial boards.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6190469.stm?ls | title=Oxford dons reject finance reform | publisher=BBC News | date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial proposal called for a majority of external members of council, bringing Oxford into line with all other UK universities except the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite news | last = MacLeod | first = Donald | title = Oxford debate: both sides claim victory | publisher = Guardian | date = 2006-11-15 | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/administration/story/0,,1948531,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a two-hour debate, the proposal was amended by Congregation to allow the election of a fellow insider to the council within five years, resulting in a majority of eight insiders (including the vice-chancellor) to the 15-member council.&lt;ref name="debate"/&gt; The amendment was supported by a majority of votes (657 to 502), with both supporters and opponents of the reforms claiming victory.&lt;ref name="debate"/&gt; 

The amended proposal was brought to vote by Congregation on 28 November 2006, and was defeated by 730 to 456 votes.&lt;ref name="lightfoot"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lightfoot | first = Liz | title = Oxford dons reject plans for outside rule | publisher = Telegraph | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/28/uoxford128.xml | accessdate = 2006-12-13 | location=London | date=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[postal vote]] was called on 5 December, with ballots being sent to all 3000 members of Congregation and votes being accepted until 18 December.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Smith | first = Alexandra | title = Oxford reforms face postal vote | publisher = Guardian | date = 2006-12-05 | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1964395,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 19 December it was announced that the proposal had once again been defeated, this time by 1540 to 997 votes.&lt;ref name="smith2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Alexandra | title = Oxford dons reject reform plans | publisher = Guardian | date = 2006-12-19 | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/administration/story/0,,1975328,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hood stated that he would not treat the defeat as a vote of [[no confidence]], citing a need to "put aside division, continue dialogue with all shades of opinion and, in an atmosphere of trust, tolerance and goodwill, promote the academic aims and ideals of Oxford".&lt;ref name="smith2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hood | first = John | title = Full statement on rejection of Oxford's reform plans | publisher = Guardian | date = 2006-12-19 | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/administration/story/0,,1975286,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boone"&gt;{{cite news | last = Boone | first = Jon | title = Oxford chief moves to quash speculation | publisher = Financial Times | date = 2006-12-18 | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e84a4068-8e3b-11db-ae0e-0000779e2340.html | accessdate = 2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed reform met with opposition not because it would invite outside opinion on the university's financial and academic decisions, but because of the impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university's academic reputation.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much power in the hands of the vice-chancellor.&lt;ref name=henry&gt;{{cite news | last = Henry | first = Julie | title = Passion in the cloisters as dons battle for the future of Oxford | publisher = Telegraph | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/12/nuni112.xml  | accessdate = 2006-12-13 | location=London | date=2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions.&lt;ref name=controversy&gt;{{cite news | last=MacLeod | first=Donald | title=Oxford reform plans face opposition | publisher=Guardian | date=2005-04-25 | url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1469950,00.html | accessdate=2007-01-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lord Patten of Barnes]] has stated that without reforms to Oxford's governance it will be more difficult to raise money that the university needs to advance, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Similarly, Hood has stated that the issue is not "whether there has to be change, but what kind of change."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Others have criticised the appointment of the [[Registrar (education)|Registrar]], [[Julie Maxton]], who is noted to be a former colleague of Hood.&lt;ref name="webcharm"/&gt; Maxton was chosen for the position of Registrar by way of a selection committee including consultants, external members of council, and the vice-chancellor of Cambridge.&lt;ref name="webcharm"/&gt;

Comparisons have been drawn&lt;ref name="webcharm"/&gt; with [[Lawrence Summers]], the 27th [[President of Harvard University|President]] of [[Harvard University]], who announced his resignation on 21 February 2006 following two motions of censure. Although individual academic staff have been critical of John Hood&lt;ref name=critics&gt;{{cite news | title=No-confidence vote looms for Oxford vice-chancellor | publisher=Guardian | date=2006-02-02 | url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1700863,00.html | accessdate=2007-01-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; no formal motions were brought forward calling for his resignation. However, an informal letter of confidence organised by his supporters in February 2006 attracted around 50 signatories from Members of [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]].&lt;ref name="webcharm"/&gt; Contested &lt;!-- contested by whom?--&gt; elections to the Council of the University by Congregation have resulted in the election of three leading critics of Hood's proposals, namely [[Susan Cooper (Physics)|Susan Cooper]] in 2005, [[Nicholas Bamforth]] in 2006&lt;ref name=Bamforth&gt;{{cite web | title=Congregation Election 8 June| url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/elections/pastelect/tt06/080606/results/result0806.shtml | accessdate = 2007-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Fraser (Geology)|Donald Fraser]] who was elected unopposed, also in 2006.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite web | title=Uncontested Elections 23 November| url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/elections/pastelect/mt06/231106/nominations/uncontested231106.shtml | accessdate = 2007-05-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 it was revealed that the University press office had been monitoring and editing comments in Hood's Wikipedia article in an attempt to protect his reputation.&lt;ref name=PressOffice&gt;{{cite web | title=Press office monitor Hood's Wiki profile | url=http://www.cherwell.org/archive/2007/06/01/press-office-monitor-hood-s-wiki-profile | accessdate=2015-05-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528140343/http://www.cherwell.org/archive/2007/06/01/press-office-monitor-hood-s-wiki-profile | archivedate=28 May 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same month, two further critics of Hood, Colin Thompson&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite web | title=Elections 7 June| url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2006-7/weekly/140607/acts.htm#4Ref | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter Robbins,&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite web | title=Uncontested Elections 7 June| url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/elections/pastelect/tt07/070607/results/uncontestcong0706.shtml | accessdate = 2010-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were elected to the Council.

'''Julián Ganzábal''' (born 25 August 1946) is a former professional [[tennis]] player from Argentina.

==Biography==
Ganzábal, the top ranked Argentine player on tour until the emergence of [[Guillermo Vilas]], first played [[Davis Cup]] tennis for [[Argentina Davis Cup team|Argentina]] in 1967.

He defeated two-time [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] winner [[Fred Stolle]] at [[Swiss Open (tennis)|Gstaad]] in 1969, but didn't go deep into a [[Grand Prix tennis circuit|Grand Prix]] tournament until 1972, when he reached the semi-finals at home in [[ATP Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]. Further semi-finals came at [[ATP Florence|Florence]] in 1974 and Berlin in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1010002360|title=ITF Tennis - Pro Circuit - Florence - 06 May - 12 May 1974|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1010002042|title=ITF Tennis - Pro Circuit - Berlin - 14 June - 20 June 1976|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a doubles player he partnered with Davis Cup teammate [[Lito Álvarez]] to finish runner-up at [[Dutch Open (tennis)|Hilversum]] in 1974. They were beaten in the final by another Argentine pairing of [[Tito Vázquez]] and Vilas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/NLC/1974-07-22/edition/0/page/10|title=Ondanks vermoeidheid zege Guillermo Vilas|date=22 July 1974|work=[[Trouw]]|publisher=22 July 1974|page=10|language=Dutch|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his best on clay, Ganzábal reached the third round of the [[1976 French Open]], with wins over [[Iván Molina]] and [[Trey Waltke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/72555353/|title=Paris|date=3 June 1976|work=[[The Pantagraph]]|page=24|accessdate=24 December 2015|location=Bloomington, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would remain his best performance in a Grand Slam tournament. Soon after the French Open, he reached his highest career [[ATP Rankings|ranking]] of 68 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenniscircus.com/il-museo-del-tennis-presenta/il-tennis-un-affare-di-famiglia-1parte-brothers-in-tennis/|title=Il tennis: un affare di famiglia (1°parte) - Brothers in Tennis|date=19 June 2014|publisher=tenniscircus.com|language=Italian|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganzábal ended his Davis Cup career in 1975, after 13 ties for his country. He finished with a 16/9 record overall, which included 14 singles wins.

Following retirement he trained his younger brother [[Alejandro Ganzábal]], who was also a professional tennis player. The brothers are now major investors in Argentina's real estate industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/738865-alianza-para-levantar-edificios-de-lujo|title=Alianza para levantar edificios de lujo|last=Sainz|first=Alfredo|date=15 September 2005|work=[[La Nación]]|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">'''Nyimpine Chissano''' (1970 &amp;ndash; 19 November 2007) was the eldest son of former [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] president [[Joaquim Chissano]]. A [[Maputo]]-based businessman, he had been linked to two high-profile murders in Mozambique, both of which are widely reported to have occurred because of their victims' anti-corruption activities.

==Carlos Cardoso==
Chissano was called as a witness in the 2002 trial of the murderers of [[Carlos Cardoso (journalist)|Cardoso]], and was said by a witness to have arranged the payment of US$46,000 to the killers.

==Austral Bank==
On 9 September 2006 the [[Mozambican News Agency]] (AIM) reported that the weekly [[Maputo]] newspaper ''Savana'' had published the 1998 contract between the privatised Austral Bank and Nyimpine Chissano, under which Chissano was to be paid US$3,000 a month for consultancy work. In the 2002 Cardoso trial, Nyimpine Chissano denied any contacts with Austral Bank.

==Antonio Siba-Siba Macuacua==
In April 2001, [[Austral Bank]] became insolvent and was taken over by the [[Bank of Mozambique]]. The Bank of Mozambique appointed an interim board of directors, led by the head of its banking supervision department, [[Antonio Siba-Siba Macuacua]]. One of Siba-Siba's first actions was to cancel contracts which he considered irrelevant to the bank's interests, and on 26 April 2001 he cancelled Austral's contract with Chissano. 

On 11 August 2001, Siba-Siba was murdered at Austral's Maputo headquarters; his killers have never been positively identified, but press reports in Mozambique have identified a former member of Joaquim Chissano's Presidential Guard as the murderer.

==Murder charges==
On 11 May 2006, AIM reported that the Mozambican public prosecutor's office had charged Nyimpine Chissano of "joint moral authorship" of the murder of Carlos Cardoso. AIM also quoted a report in the Mozambican journal ''Zambeze'' that a Maputo prosecutor, Fernando Canana, had issued an arrest warrant for Nyimpine Chissano which was subsequently suspended because of the intervention of Chissano's parents, former president Chissano and his wife. 

==Death==
Chissano was found dead at his home in Maputo on 19 November 2007. State radio reported that the [[cause of death]] had not been determined, but stated that Chissano had been suffering from an illness for some time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">'''On-ramping''' is the process of re-entering the [[workforce]] after taking a [[career break]] (usually to care for family). It is paired with the term "off-ramping", or exiting the workforce as a temporary career break.

The Hidden Brain Drain, a taskforce led by economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett, defined the term as "many professional women in the US do not drop out of their careers altogether, but they do take breaks. However, they often find it difficult to re-enter the workforce. This has been called 'off-ramping' (taking time out of a career for one reason or another) and 'on-ramping' (rejoining the career path). Women in the US, on average, spend a relatively short amount of time off-ramped (around 2.2 years), but even this can incur financial penalties. Women who spend around three years off-ramp see their earning power decrease by 37 per cent." &lt;ref name="EAH"/&gt; A study by the Center for Work-Life Policy found that more than 90 percent of those women who off-ramp eventually wish to on-ramp back into the work force.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hannah Seligson |title=Off Ramp to On Ramp: It Can Be a Hard Journey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/jobs/07return.html |work=[[NY Times]] |date=2008-12-06 |accessdate=2012-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears as early as 2005,&lt;ref name="WCS"/&gt; reaching public mention on [[NPR]]
&lt;ref name="MAR"/&gt; that same year. The term appears in articles in publications such as the [[Wall Street Journal]] &lt;ref name="SSW"/&gt; by 2006,
and by 2008 appears in formal training materials for organizations such as the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] &lt;ref name="WLW"/&gt; as a business [[best practice]].

Sylvia Ann Hewlett, as the likeliest originator of the term (in Hewlett &amp; Luce (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18578">[[File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Charles Lindbergh (left) and Raymond Orteig]]
The '''Orteig Prize''' was a reward  offered to the first [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] aviator(s) to fly non-stop from [[New York City]] to [[Paris]] or vice versa.&lt;ref name="Bak. Pages 28 and 29"&gt;Bak. Pages 28 and 29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Several famous aviators made unsuccessful attempts at the New York–Paris flight before the relatively unknown American [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in 1927 in his aircraft ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''.
However a number of lives were lost by men who were competing to win the prize. Six men died in three separate crashes, and another three  were injured in a fourth crash. 
The Prize occasioned considerable investment in aviation, sometimes many times the value of the prize itself, and advancing public interest and the level of aviation technology.
  
==Background==
The Orteig Prize was a $25,000 reward ({{Inflation|US|25000|1919|fmt=eq|r=-3}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} offered on May 22, 1919, by New York hotel owner [[Raymond Orteig]] to the first allied aviator(s) to fly non-stop from [[New York City]] to [[Paris]] or vice versa.&lt;ref name="Bak. Pages 28 and 29"/&gt; The offer was in the spirit of several [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|similar aviation prize]] offers, and was made in a letter to [[Alan Ramsay Hawley]], president of the [[Aero Club of America]] at the behest of Aero Club secretary [[Augustus Post]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gentlemen: As a stimulus to the courageous aviators, I desire to offer, through the auspices and regulations of the Aero Club of America, a prize of $25,000 to the first aviator of any Allied Country crossing the Atlantic in one flight, from Paris to New York or New York to Paris, all other details in your care.

Yours very sincerely,

Raymond Orteig&lt;ref&gt;Bak. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Aero Club replied on May 26 with Orteig confirming his offer three days later. His offer was accepted by the Aero Club and [[Augustus Post]] set up a formal structure to administer the competition.
 
Coincidentally, just a few weeks later [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|Alcock and Brown]] successfully completed the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic from [[Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]], winning an [[Daily Mail aviation prizes##Prizes 1913|earlier prize offer]], and in late June the British airship [[R34 (airship)|R34]] made an east-west crossing from [[RAF East Fortune|East Fortune]], Scotland, to [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], returning by the same route in early July.

On offer for five years, the goal of the prize seemed beyond the capacity of aircraft of the time and the prize attracted no competitors. After its original term had expired Orteig reissued the prize on June 1, 1925 by depositing $25,000 in negotiable securities at the Bryant Bank with the awarding put under the control of a seven-member board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Bak. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; By then the state of aviation technology had advanced to the point that numerous competitors vied for the prize.

==Attempts on the prize==
In 1926 the first serious attempt on the prize was made by a team led by French flying ace [[René Fonck]], backed by [[Igor Sikorsky]], the aircraft designer. Sikorsky, who put $100,000 towards the attempt, built an aircraft, the [[Sikorsky S-35|S-35]], for the purpose, and in September that year Fonck, with three companions, made their flight. However the aircraft was hopelessly overloaded and crashed in flames attempting to take off. Fonck and his co-pilot, Curtin, survived, but his companions, Clavier and Islamoff, were killed.

By 1927 three groups in the United States and one in Europe were known to be preparing attempts on the prize.

From the US:
*polar explorer [[Richard E. Byrd]], with [[Floyd Bennett]] and George Noville as crew, and backed by [[Rodman Wanamaker]], had commissioned an aircraft, a trimotor named [[America (aircraft)|''America'']] from designer [[Anthony Fokker]].
*aviators [[Clarence Chamberlin]] and [[Bert Acosta]], backed by [[Charles A. Levine|Charlie Levine]], planned an attempt in a [[Giuseppe Mario Bellanca|Bellanca]] aircraft named [[Columbia (WB-2)|''Columbia'']].
*a third team, [[Wooster and Davis|Stanton Wooster and Noel Davis]], prepared to try in a [[Keystone Pathfinder]], named [[American Legion (aircraft)|''American Legion'']] for [[American Legion|their principal supporters]],

Meanwhile, in France, [[Charles Nungesser]] and [[François Coli]] were preparing for an east-west crossing in a [[Pierre Levasseur (aircraft builder)|Levasseur]] aircraft, ''[[L'Oiseau Blanc]]''.

In April 1927 the various teams assembled and prepared for their attempts, but all suffered mishaps.

Chamberlin and Acosta undertook a series of flights, increasing ''Columbia's'' weight as they went to test the aircraft's capability and to simulate the planned takeoff weight. They also simulated the duration of the flight, setting an endurance record in the process. However their attempt was riven with arguments, between Levine and the others, resulting in Acosta leaving the team for Byrd's and his replacement, [[Lloyd Bertaud]], taking legal action against Levine over a contract dispute.

Byrd's team also made preparations. Wanamaker had the [[Roosevelt Field]] improved (Fonck's crash had been caused in part by the aircraft  hitting a sunken road running across the runway) while Byrd had a ramp built for ''America'' to roll down on takeoff, providing extra impetus. However, on 8 April Byrd's team, in ''America'', crashed during a test flight; Bennet was injured and unable to continue.

On 26 April Davis and Wooster, in ''American Legion'', also crashed on a test flight; this time both were killed.

On 8 May Nungesser and Coli set off from Paris in ''L'Oiseau Blanc'' to attempt an east-west crossing, a more difficult proposition given the prevailing winds; they were last seen off the coast of Ireland, but never arrived in New York and no trace of them was ever found, creating one of aviation's great mysteries.

Meanwhile, a late challenge, by solo flyer [[Charles Lindbergh]] in [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] aircraft ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', and backed by bankers in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], was started in February,  with Lindbergh arriving at Roosevelt Field in mid-May.

Lindbergh had chosen to fly solo, although this was not a requirement of the prize and required him to be at the controls for more than 30 hours. Following a period of bad weather, and before it had sufficiently cleared, Lindbergh took off for Paris, stealing a march on his rivals.

Lindbergh pursued a risky strategy for the competition; instead of using a tri-motor, as favored by most other groups, he decided on a single engined aircraft. The decision allowed him to save weight and carry extra fuel as a reserve for detours or emergencies. He also decided to fly the aircraft solo, so avoiding the personality conflicts that helped delay at least one group. To save weight which had contributed to the crashes of other contributors, Lindbergh also dispensed with non-essential equipment like radios, [[sextant]], and a parachute, although he did take an inflatable raft. The final factor in his success was his decision to fly into weather conditions that were clearing but not clear enough for others to consider safe. Lindbergh was quoted as saying "What kind of man would live where there is no danger? I don't believe in taking foolish chances. But nothing can be accomplished by not taking a chance at all."&lt;ref&gt;''Lindbergh: Flight's Enigmatic Hero'', Von Hardesty, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Orteig prize.jpg|thumb|Check presented to Lindbergh for winning the Orteig Prize]]After Lindbergh's success, the other teams had to re-evaluate their aims. 
Chamberlin decided to attempt a flight to Berlin, which his endurance flight had shown to be achievable, and for which the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce were offering a $15,000 prize. On 4 June Chamberlin (and, at the last minute, Levine) took off in ''Columbia'' for Berlin; they arrived over Germany after a flight of 42 hours but were unable to find their way to the city and landed, out of fuel, at [[Eisleben]], 60 miles to the south-west. They finally arrived in Berlin on 7 June.

Byrd, meanwhile, announced his aim was not simply the prize, but “to demonstrate that the world was ready for safe, regular, multi-person flight across the Atlantic” &lt;ref&gt;Bryson p202&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would head for Paris, as planned. He and his crew, Acosta, Noville and, as a late addition, [[Bernt Balchen]] (who actually did most of the flying) set off in ''America'' for Paris on 29 June. However, after a 40-hour flight they were unable to find the airfield at [[Le Bourget]] and turned back to ditch on the coast, landing at [[Ver-sur-Mer]], [[Normandy]], on 1 July.

Advancing public interest and aviation technology, the Prize occasioned investments many times the value of the prize. In addition, lives were lost by men who were competing to win the prize. Six men died in three separate crashes. Another three men were injured in a fourth crash. During the spring and summer of 1927, 40 pilots attempted various long-distance over-ocean flights, leading to 21 deaths during the attempts. For example, seven lives were lost in August 1927 in the Orteig Prize-inspired $25,000 [[Dole Air Race]] to fly from [[San Francisco]] to [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="dolerace"&gt;{{cite web | last =Conant| first =Jane Eshelman| authorlink = | date =Oct 10, 1955 | url= http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/27dolerace.html|title = Pioneer Pacific Fliers wrote Tragic Chapter In Air History | work =San Francisco Call-Bulletin| publisher = Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco| accessdate= 2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1927 saw a number of aviation first and new records. The record for longest time in the air, longest flight distance, and longest overwater flight were set and all exceeded Lindbergh's effort. However, no other flyer gained the fame that Lindbergh did for winning the Orteig Prize.

The Orteig Prize inspired the $10 million [[Ansari X Prize]] for repeated suborbital [[private spaceflight]]s.  Similar to the Orteig Prize, it was announced some eight years before it was won in 2004.&lt;ref name=belfiore2007&gt;

'''Patrick Dixon''' (born 1957) is an author and business consultant, often described as a [[futurist]], and chairman of the trends forecasting company Global Change Ltd.&lt;ref name=t50&gt;Ciaran Parker, ''The Thinkers 50''. [[Praeger Publishers]], 2005. {{ISBN|0-275-99145-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also founder of the international AIDS agency [[ACET (AIDS charity)|ACET]] and Chairman of the ACET International Alliance.

In 2005, he was ranked as one of the 20 most influential business thinkers alive according to the ''Thinkers 50'' (a private survey printed in 'The Times').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkers50.com/results-2005 Thinkers 50 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725200153/http://www.thinkers50.com/results-2005 |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Des Dearlove |author-link1=Des Dearlove|author2=[[Stuart Crainer]] |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/graduate_management/article597997.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |title=The Most Influential Management Gurus |newspaper=The Times| date=1 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611190429/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/graduate_management/article597997.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |archivedate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dixon was also included in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'''s 2010 "[[Happy List]]", with reference to ACET and his other work tackling the stigma of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-iiosi-happy-list-2010--the-100-1953745.html The IoS Happy List 2010 – the 100], Independent on Sunday, 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
Patrick Dixon studied Medical Sciences at [[King's College, Cambridge]] and continued medical training at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], London.&lt;ref name=t50/&gt; In 1978, while a medical student, he founded the IT startup Medicom, selling medical software solutions in the UK and the Middle East, based on early personal computers. After qualifying as a physician he cared for people dying of cancer at [[St Joseph's Hospice]] and then as part of the Community Care Team based at [[University College Hospital]], London, while also continuing IT consulting part-time.

In 1988&lt;ref name=t50/&gt; he launched the AIDS charity '''[[ACET (AIDS charity)|ACET]]''', following publication of his first book ''The Truth about AIDS'', which warned of an unfolding catastrophe that has since hit many nations in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. ACET grew rapidly, providing home care services across London and other parts of the UK, as well as a national sex education programme in schools, reaching more than 450,000 students.

Dixon no longer practices as a physician, but remains actively involved as Chairman of the ACET International Alliance. This is now a network of independent national AIDS care and prevention programmes, sharing the same name and values, active in 23 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acet-international.org www.acet-international.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends analysis, business consulting and writing==
Patrick Dixon now advises large corporations in many different industries on trends, [[strategic management|strategy]], [[risk management]] and opportunities for [[innovation]], giving [[keynote]]s to thousands of business leaders at corporate events each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighbureau.com/speakers/pdixon/ Patrick Dixon], speaker's profile at [[Leigh Bureau]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s Dixon has written 15 books covering a wide range of issues and macro-trends including [[social media]], [[multichannel marketing]], consumer shifts, [[demographics]], rise of [[emerging economies]], health care, [[biotechnology]], social issues, [[sustainability]], politics and [[business ethics]].

''Futurewise'', first published in 1998, uses the word FUTURE as a mnemonic standing for "Six Faces of the Future" which will impact every large business: '''F'''ast, '''U'''rban, '''T'''ribal, '''U'''niversal, '''R'''adical and '''E'''thical.&lt;ref name=t50/&gt; Dixon is optimistic about the capacity of human innovation to solve complex challenges: &lt;blockquote&gt;This millennium will witness the greatest challenges to human survival that we have ever seen, and many of them will face us in the early years of the first century.  It will also provide us with science and technology beyond our greatest imaginings, and the greatest shift in values for over 50 years. ''Futurewise'', page xi&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Building a Better Business'', published in 2005, describes a new approach to leadership, management, marketing, teams, brands, customer relations, innovation, strategy, corporate governance and values. The book applies lessons from [[volunteering]] and non-profit organisations in motivating and inspiring large numbers of people to achieve great things. In it, Dixon argues that all successful leadership derives from an appeal to a common desire for a better future—for customers, workers, [[shareholder]]s and [[community|communities]].  He attacks the "dangerous" obsession with [[shareholder value]] in many global corporations: {{quote|Our society has come to see that a strategy to build shareholder value without a clear mission based on robust ethical values, is a complete nonsense.  In fact it has proved one of the fastest ways of destroying an entire global business.}}

''Sustainagility'', published in 2010 and co-authored by Johan Gorecki, describes [[green technology]] and innovations across a wide range of industries, which Dixon believes will help to transform and protect the world.

==Personal life==
Dixon is married to Sheila, with four grown up children including the pop artist [[Paul Dixon (musician)|Paul Dixon]] (known as fyfe, previously David's Lyre), and lives in London where the family is active in local church and community life.

==Works==
Patrick Dixon publishes video messages on his web TV site. He claims over 15 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalchange.com/cv.htm Patrick Dixon CV] on Global Change website&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube shows over 5 million video views on his channel there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/pjvdixon/about About] Patrick Dixon, Youtube.

==Career==
From 1983 until 1984, Pradeep worked at a software company in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/meet-the-boss-pradeep-paunrana-managing-director-arm-cement/|title=Meet the Boss: Pradeep Paunrana, managing director, ARM Cement|date=2014-02-07|work=How We Made It In Africa|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning US$40,000 annually. He returned to Kenya in 1984, at the age of 24 at the request of his father who handed him the keys to the business in exchange for a percentage ownership, but no salary. Pradeep, therefore became the [[Managing Director]] of ''Athi River Mining Limited'', as the company was known at the time.

From annual sales of KSh6 million (approx.US$70,000) in 1984, the business has grown to annual sales of KSh14 billion (approx.US$160 million), in 2014. In 1994, the company which started with manufacturing fertilizer, animal feeds, ceramics, glass and plastics, began making cement for the first time. In 2007, the company which had changed names to '''[[ARM Cement Limited]]''' listed its shares on the [[Nairobi Securities Exchange]] (NSE). Over the years, the company has grown into the largest manufacturer of cement in East Africa, producing 2.6 million tonnes annually. Pradeep Paunrana, personally owns 18% of the company shares, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Pradeep-Paunrana/-/1248928/1990146/-/item/0/-/kq4sgv/-/index.html|

'''Ray Robert Allen''' (July 5, 1920 &amp;ndash; April 6, 2010) was a [[municipal]] [[public official]] and [[banker]] in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], who, in 1977, was secretary-treasurer and then finance director when the city converted from the [[City commission government|commissioner]] to the [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council]] form of government.

==Background==
Allen was born in [[Yell County, Arkansas|Yell County]], [[Arkansas]], to Frank F. Allen and the former Martha Walker. The family moved to [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas Parish]] in northeastern Louisiana, where Allen graduated from the since defunct [[Newellton High School]] in [[Newellton, Louisiana|Newellton]].&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Ray R. Allen, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Allen  studied [[accounting]] at Alexandria Business College and [[LaSalle Extension University]], a [[Distance education|correspondence school]] based in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theadvocate/obituary.aspx?n=ray-r-allen-nandad&amp;pid=141625719|title=Ray R. "Nandad" Allen|work=[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|The Advocate]]|date= April 9, 2010|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alexandria municipal finance==
In 1947, Allen began his municipal tenure as a cashier and then an accountant in the Alexandria finance department. From 1963-1977, while he was the Alexandria secretary-treasurer, the city budget grew from $9 million to $40 million.&lt;ref name=adtt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20100407/NEWS01/100407042/-1/NEWSFRONT2/Ray+Allen++former+city+of+Alexandria+finance+director++dies+at+age+of+89|title=Ray Allen, former city of Alexandria finance director, dies at age of 89|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'', April 7, 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His municipal service spanned the administrations of [[Mayor]]s [[Carl B. Close]] (1947–1953), [[W. George Bowdon, Jr.]] (1953–1969), [[Ed Karst]] (1969–1973), [[John K. Snyder]] (first term from 1973–1977), and [[Carroll E. Lanier]] (first two years, 1977–1979).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

At the time of his retirement from the city service in January 1979, Allen told the ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'' that some mayors and commissioners had objected when he prevented their utilization of city funds for questionable purposes. At the time, Allen said, "Everybody wanted the city finances for something different. Everybody had a pet project ... If some of them had had their way, they'd have taken all of the city's money and put it in their own special projects and left nothing for anyone else. So it was a continual war keeping them from gaining control of the finances of the city," Allen said.&lt;ref name=adtt/&gt;

Allen noted that different city commissioner often pressured him to permit spending of funds for their own projects: "I made a lot of people mad by following the law. They wanted to get rid of me, and if I played the political game, they might have. They were looking for ways to put me in jail, but I followed the law, and they couldn’t do it. I won my battle, and they lost."&lt;ref name=adtt/&gt;

He credited Lanier with bringing stability to municipal finances, both as finance and utilities commissioner from 1969–1973 and as mayor for a five-and one-half-year term beginning in 1977. Lanier was unseated as commissioner in 1973 by businessman and attorney [[Arnold Jack Rosenthal]], who thereafter convinced the council to hire Velda Mae LaBorde Lee (1935–2011) of rural Flatwoods in Rapides Parish as an [[internal auditor]] to check Allen's financial practices. Formerly of [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]] in north Louisiana, Lee was an honor graduate of [[Louisiana Tech University]] and obtained a master's degree in accounting from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. She was only the second woman in Louisiana to obtain [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] designation. Later she was finance director in the second Snyder administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetowntalk/obituary.aspx?n=velda-laborde-lee&amp;pid=149104009|title=Velda LaBorde Lee, CPA|publisher=''The Town Talk'', March 6, 2011|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velda Lee and her husband, James Mack Lee (1930-1991), had two children, Michael Arnie Lee and Kathy Lee Beebe Baugh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;

When Rosenthal criticized Allen for "insubordination", as reported by ''The Town Talk'', Allen sued for [[defamation]] but won no judgment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Snyder fired Allen in 1977, but Lanier quickly elevated him to the new finance director position. Lanier was unseated by Snyder in 1982, who served a second four-year term amid much controversy.&lt;ref name=adtt/&gt;

In 1970, Allen received the [[Charles E. Dunbar|Charles E. Dunbar Jr.]], Career Service Award from the Louisiana Civil Service League for his service as secretary-treasurer.&lt;ref name=adtt/&gt;

==Later years==

After leaving city service, Allen was affiliated with First Bank for ten years, having retired as a bank officer. He also worked as an accountant for Petron Inc., and he did bookkeeping for the Masonic Children's Home in Alexandria.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;
 
Allen was a deacon at the large Calvary [[Southern Baptist|Baptist]] Church in Alexandria and a former member of Parkview Baptist Church. He was often called upon to lead the invocation at city council meetings. He was affiliated with the [[Masonic lodge]]. A superior [[ping pong]] player, Allen often competed with students at [[Louisiana College]] in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. He died of natural causes at the age of eighty-nine at his Alexandria residence at 3807 Gingerbread Road. He was predeceased by his wife, the former Lily Hinds (February 4, 1928 &amp;ndash; September 19, 2007, a daughter of Mumford Hinds (1888-1971) and the former Lola Walker of [[Ajax, Louisiana|Ajax]], an [[unincorporated community]] in [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Allen&amp;GSfn=Lily&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdy=2007&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSst=20&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=47720604&amp;df=all&amp;|title=Lily Hinds Allen|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray and Lily married in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]; their mothers coincidentally had the maiden name "Walker" but were unrelated.

The Allens were survived by two daughters. Gale Allen Henry (born December 1947) of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], was previously married to Robert Paul "Bob" Devenney (1948-2002), the father of two of the Allens' four grandchildren, Brent Christopher Devenney (born 1970), a Southern Baptist pastor in [[South Burlington, Vermont|South Burlington]], [[Vermont]], and Chad Joseph Devenney (born 1975) of Kansas City. Bob Devenney is interred beside his parents at Resthaven Memorial Gardens and Mausoleum in [[Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=136684235|title=Robert Paul Devenney (Allen's former son-in-law)|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gale subsequently married Charles Bender Henry, Sr. (1939-2013), a deputy with the [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]] Sheriff's Department in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] who died at the age of seventy-three after a long battle with [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bender Henry, Sr., ''[[Monroe News Star]]'', January 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Henry&amp;GSfn=Charles&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdy=2013&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSst=20&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=104028607&amp;df=all&amp;|title=Charles Bender Henry, Sr. (Allen's son-in-law)|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger daughter, Deborah Ray Allen Poirrier (born April 1952) of Baton Rouge, is the widow of businessman James Alton "Jim" Poirrier (1937-2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Poirrier&amp;GSfn=James&amp;GSby=1937&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=130574555&amp;df=all&amp;|title=James A.

"Mike" Wiley (1948-2003), an Alexandria native who was the chief juvenile detective and the 2001 "Deputy of the Year" for the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Department. A board member of the [[Renaissance Home for Youth]] and the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Clubs]] of Alexandria, Wiley died at the age of fifty-five of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. He was the father of the other two Allen grandchildren, Mason Allen Wiley (born 1972) of [[DeRidder, Louisiana|DeRidder]] in [[Beauregard Parish, Louisiana|Beauregard Parish]], and Melissa Ashley Wiley Despino (born 1973) of Alexandria. At the time of the Allens' deaths, Melissa was married to Tommy Ray Bergeron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Wiley&amp;GSfn=Michael&amp;GSby=1948&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSst=20&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=64643807&amp;df=all&amp;

Services were held on April 10, 2010, at the Hixson Brothers Funeral Home Chapel in Alexandria. The Allens are interred at Alexandria Memorial Gardens.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''Robert Godlonton''' (1794–1884) ('''"Moral Bob"''') was an influential politician of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]].

He was an [[1820 Settlers|1820 Settler]], who developed the press of the Eastern Cape and led the [[Eastern Cape]] separatist movement as a representative in the Cape's [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Legislative Council]].

== Early life ==

Robert Godlonton was born in London on 24 September 1794. He was a weak and sickly child and after he was orphaned at the age of twelve he was apprenticed at a printing office.

He emigrated to the Cape as part of the [[1820 settlers]], taking with him a small printing press. However the British Governor, fearing the beginnings of a free press, confiscated the press and compensated the price.

== Business career and printing industry ==

[[File:Robert Godlonton signed - Narrative of Irruption of Kafir Hordes - Grahamstown Journal.jpg|thumb|right|Signed copy of Robert Godlonton's publication in defence of settler grievances against the Xhosa and their liberal defenders in Cape Town.]]

After unsuccessful attempts at farming, he became a clerk at a landdrost's office and was gradually promoted over the next ten years.

The Cape was finally given freedom of the press in 1828, due largely to the efforts of the journalist and politician [[John Fairbairn (educator)|John Fairbairn]]. In 1834 Godlonton became partner in the ''Grahamstown Journal'' and in 1839 he took over the business. The firm, now renamed Godlonton &amp; White, became the leading newspaper in the Eastern Cape. He eventually developed a wide range of business interests, but his primary activity remained newspapers and the printing industry. He gained a controlling stake in the Kingwilliamstown Gazette, the Uitenhage Times, the Queenstown Free Press, the Eastern Province Herald, the Eastern Province Monthly Magazine, the Friend of Bloemfontein, and Het Grahamstads Register en Boeren-vriend.

With the time and resources of his business success, he able to concentrate on additional personal publications, such as ''"Narrative of the Irruption of the Kafir Hordes (1836)"'' and ''"Notes on the Separation of the Eastern from the Western Province"'', proposing a stronger colonial policy against the neighbouring [[Xhosa people]] and calling for more British immigration to the Eastern Cape to bolster its White population.

== Political career ==

Godlonton began to involve himself in politics soon after he arrived in the Cape. He took an active role in the [[Xhosa Wars|frontier wars]] as member of the board of defence and, although never elected a municipal commissioner, he diligently attended town and committee meetings in the area.
Later, as his business enterprises grew, he began to take a much stronger role in Cape politics.

=== Confrontation with Lieut-Governor Stockenström ===

[[File:Andries Stockenstrom - Cape Colony Archives.jpg|thumb|right|1st Baronet Sir [[Andries Stockenström]], military leader and architect of a system of peace treaties with the neighbouring Xhosa Chiefs.]]

Godlonton's early political career was taken up by a long campaign against the Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern Cape, [[Andries Stockenström]].

[[Andries Stockenström|Stockenström]], who professed considerable respect for the Xhosa, had developed a completely new frontier policy that involved the exchange of diplomatic agents as reliable "ambassadors" between the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa Chiefs]]. This system was underlain by formal treaties to guard the border and return any stolen cattle from either side. Importantly, Stockenström forbade colonial expansion into Xhosa land. With this key provision, the treaty system soon brought a degree of peace to the frontier.

However many frontier colonists resented Stockenström's restrictions on their expansion into Xhosa land. As one settler ominously remarked of the Xhosa lands: ''"The appearance of the country is very fine, it will make excellent sheep farms."''

Godlonton swiftly came to the forefront as the leader of this Eastern Cape settler movement. He used his newspapers to condemn Stockenström's treaty system and advocate seizing the Xhosa lands. He also used his considerable influence in the religious institutions of the 1820 British settlers to drive his opinions, declaring that: ''"the British race was selected by God himself to colonise Kaffraria"''.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=63}} In the face of massive pressure and ruinous lawsuits, Stockenström was eventually dismissed and his treaty system was dismantled by the new British Governor, Maitland. A fresh wave of frontier violence soon developed, eventually building up to the [[Xhosa Wars|Amatola War]] which broke out in 1846.{{sfn|Anon|2010}}

Stockenström died soon afterwards but crucially, Godlonton's attacks on him and his treaty system made an opponent of Stockenström's friend and ally [[John Molteno]], who would come to confront Godlonton's political movement decades later.{{sfn|Molteno|1900|p=}}

=== Leader of the Eastern Cape Separatists ===

From his leadership of the frontier settlers' attacks on Stockenstrom's treaty system, Godlonton had acquired a very prominent and powerful position in the Eastern Cape.
In the 1840s he thus began to take on the role of self-appointed leader of the Eastern Cape separatist movement. This movement accused the Cape Town-based government of being overly lenient in its frontier policy, and called for the political capital to be moved to a city nearer the frontier or, barring that, for the white [[Eastern Cape]] to be allowed to secede as a separate state. It also supported greater British imperial involvement in southern Africa.

In 1849 – 50 Godlonton took a controversial stand in support of the British Governor's attempt to use the Cape as a penal colony. In the wake of this "Convict Crisis", the Governor appointed him to the Cape's Legislative Council, resulting in the other Council members resigning en masse in protest. Godlonton also unsuccessfully opposed the implementation of the multi-racial [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] in 1851/2.

In 1854, the Cape was granted its [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|first parliament]], with the old Legislative Council becoming an elected upper house – sharply divided between representatives of the Eastern and Western Cape. Godlonton represented the Eastern Cape in this new Legislative Council for the next 25 years.

In the new parliament, Godlonton led the separatist cause in the upper house of parliament, while his colleague [[John Paterson (Cape politician)|John Paterson]] led the movement in the lower house.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=50}}

=== Opposition to responsible government ===

Meanwhile, Stockenström's old protege, Molteno, claiming direct British rule in southern Africa to be unjust and inept, was leading a growing movement for "[[Responsible Government]]", to make the Cape's Executive democratically accountable (or "responsible" as it was known), and thus give the Cape a degree of independence from Britain. As this movement grew in power throughout the 1860s, Godlonton redirected his considerable resources towards opposing it. Finally, as a member of the Legislative Council, he chaired the 1871 ''Commission on Federal Devolution'' in a last-ditch attempt to split the Cape and weaken the Responsible Government movement, but the following year Molteno gained parliamentary control and became the Cape's first Prime Minister.

The new Prime Minister immediately included several representatives of the Eastern Cape into his government. This, together with the rising economic prosperity of the Cape and the ''[[Seven Circles Act|Seven Circles Bill (May 1874)]]'' finally extinguished the separatist movement.
Godlonton was permitted to retain his parliamentary seat until its dissolution in 1878.

== Legacy ==

Godlonton's role as the press advocate of [[Eastern Cape]] frontier opinion mirrored the powerful role that [[John Fairbairn (educator)|John Fairbairn]] (and later [[Saul Solomon]]) played as leading press advocates of [[Western Cape]] liberal opinion.

He was immensely influential for his work in elaborating on and immortalising the trials and grievances of the British frontier settlers. His influence on frontier historiography was far greater than his effects on the affairs of his day. During his lifetime his political movement was largely thwarted, and he was eventually out-maneuvered by his Western Cape opponents, nonetheless in years to come his legacy was to survive and influence the expansionist policies of the later [[Progressive Party (Cape Colony)|Progressive Party]].

== Later life and family ==

Robert Godlonton was outspoken in his beliefs and earned the nickname "Moral Bob". He was a staunch Methodist, like a great many of the 1820 settlers of the Eastern Cape, who was strongly involved in Church and Missionary activity. He was a prominent leader of the Cape's Methodist community, friends with other powerful churchmen such as John Ayliff, [[Henry Hare Dugmore]] and Henry Calderwood among others and, together with such men, formed a powerful business clique. They also formed the majority of the municipal commissioners in the Eastern Cape.

His first wife, Mary Ann, died in 1844, and the following year he married his second wife Sarah Richards.

He died in Grahamstown on 30 May 1884.

'''Vladimir Pavlovich Peftiev''' ({{lang-be|Уладзiмiр Паўлавiч Пефцiеў}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Владимир Павлович Пефтиев}}, born 1 July 1957) is a Belarusian businessman, investor and philanthropist.

== Biography ==
Vladimir Pavlovich Peftiev was born on 1 July 1957 in the city of [[Berdyansk]], Ukraine.&lt;ref name="sanctions2011"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1519425050511&amp;uri=CELEX:32011R0588 Council Regulation (EU) No 588/2011 of 20 June 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 concerning restrictive measures against President Lukashenko and certain officials of Belarus]&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in the Ukraine at the Institute of Railway Transport Engineers (currently [[Dnipropetrovsk National University of Rail Transport]]), graduating in 1979 with a diploma in electromechanical engineering.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} From 1979 till 1988 he worked with [[Belarusian Railway]] and then with [[Minsk Metro]] as chief engineer, following which in 1988 he began a career in private business.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Business ==
=== Overview ===
Peftiev's business interests since leaving [[Minsk Metro]] have included technological development, special equipment and military exports, telecommunications, medical technology, IT- technology, and sports{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Controversies, criticism ==
===EU sanctions===
In 2011, after the wave of repressions that followed the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election in Belarus]], the [[Council of the European Union]] listed Peftiev and his three companies [[BelTechExport]], Sport Pari and BT Telecommunications as sanctioned entities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=61552 Поўны спіс 208 беларускіх чыноўнікаў, якім забаронены ўезд у ЕС] – [[Nasha Niva]], 11 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the Council's decision, Peftiev has been described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014D0750|title=COUNCIL DECISION 2011/357/CFSP of 20 June 2011 amending Decision 2010/639/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against certain officials of Belarus|date=20 June 2011|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|[A] person associated with President Lukashenko and his family. Chief economic advisor of President Lukashenko and key financial sponsor of the Lukashenko regime. Chairman of the Council of Shareholders of Beltechexport, the largest export/import company of defence products in Belarus}}

Peftiev protested the Council's decision in the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] of the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The team that defended Vladimir Peftiev in court included world famous specialists in the field of human rights, including: professor of Yale University and former President of Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Michael Reisman and former Director of International Law department of University of Bonn, General Director of the office of the Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl from 1992 to 1996, professor Rudolf Dolzer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/36638383/The_Aim_of_Sanctions_is_to_Hurt|title=The Aim of Sanctions is to Hurt|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of October 2014, before the case had been decided, the sanctions were dropped by the EU Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014D0750&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2014, the General Court of European Union decided in Peftiev’s and his companies’ favour, annulling the sanctions and ruling that the Council of the European Union and European Commission had made serious mistakes while evaluating Peftiev's business activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=160487&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=24475, part 7, "The plea in law concerning manifest errors of assessment," articles 148–206.&lt;/ref&gt; That was mentioned by professor Dolzer in his interview on May 8, 2018 to Latvian newspaper “Dienas bizness”, in which he pointed out to the false information in the Internet that was used against Vladimir Peftiev, and namely with regard to illegal incomes of Mr. Peftiev, his Forbes rating, weapons exports to North Korea, Ivory Coast and China, his sponsoring of Lukashenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/36638383/The_Aim_of_Sanctions_is_to_Hurt|title=The Aim of Sanctions is to Hurt|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council did not appeal the Court's decision.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The European General Court’s judgment of 9 December 2014 concerning Peftiev reads, in part (clause 149):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=160486&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=24560|title=CURIA – Documents|last=|first=|date=|website=curia.europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|the Court held that [the sanctions involving Belarus] should be annulled in so far as they concern Mr Peftiev. By virtue of that annulling judgment, the annulled acts, in so far as they concern Mr Peftiev, are deleted retroactively from the legal order and deemed never to have existed … and consequently Mr Peftiev is deemed never to have been listed.}}

This decision of European General Court was left unattended by mass media. Moreover, various sources continued to publish disproved information that originated before or during of sanctions, instead of deleting it from their servers according to the court’s decision. This was described by Professor Rudolf Dolzer in his article «Weeding Out Fake Journalism» for 10th issue of Forbes Georgia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbes.ge/news/4899/Weeding-Out-Fake-Journalism|title=Weeding Out Fake Journalism|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbes.ge/news/4883/Forbes-Georgia-in-English-10|title=Forbes Georgia in English - Issue #10|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{Quote|Notwithstanding this clear decision, published in 2014, many concerned Internet sources, including respected data information providers, have decided, for whatever reason, to ignore the highest European Court, and still today, in 2018, have on their servers the outdated, discredited information. Another aspect of fake news has come out. A portion of the media ignored the judgment of the European Court of Justice in favor of Mr. Peftiev, even though the original fake news underlying the sanctions had been published in virtually all media. While fake news was considered newsworthy, its refutation by the court went unnoticed by the same media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbes.ge/news/4899/Weeding-Out-Fake-Journalism|title=Weeding Out Fake Journalism|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a book of maxims by Vladimir Peftiev titled "Maxims of a Man of Schemes"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.akkadiapress.uk.com/our-books/maxims-man-schemes/|title=Akkadia Press|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780995689046|title=ISBN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published with a foreword by the British philosopher and author [[A. C. Grayling]]. The foreword says:&lt;blockquote&gt;These striking, amusing and sometimes pungent aphorisms are so full of a certain kind of pragmatic wisdom that I am moved to quote Professor Higgins on Mr Alfred Doolittle: that the latter was "the most original moralist" that the former had encountered for many years. The hard truths of practical life are apt to wring from people of experience a view of how to navigate the maze of routes that lies between desire and success; it is not, invariably, a view for the faint-hearted or those persuaded more by Aristotle than Gordon Gekko; but it will certainly strike a chord with many who have ventured that maze, and will certainly provide a preparation – and for some a warning – to those planning or wishing to do so. No-one can fail to profit, therefore – in at least one relevant sense of that term – from these maxims, offered by one who has been all the way through that maze and back. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Peftiev’s contributions are helping to preserve the memory of Belarusian soldiers and fighters who fell in the Polish and Lithuanian uprisings of the nineteenth century, the Russian-French War of 1812 (the [[Patriotic War of 1812]]), and the First and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]. Thousands of unique artifacts, photographs, documents and letters have been collected so far, and in 2012 an exhibition at the Belarusian State Museum made many visible to the public.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Other publications supported by Peftiev in recent years have included books and albums of the work of Belarusian artists Vladimir Zinkevich, Alexander Slucky, Viktor Alshevsky, and celebrated ballet choreographer Valentin Elizarev.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1999, Peftiev's companies partnered with Elizarev and the French Embassy in Belarus to produce the ballet ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'' (inspired by Victor Hugo's ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|Notre Dame de Paris]]'') at The National Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For several years, Peftiev's companies also sponsored the Yuri Bashmet International Music Festival in Minsk and the Belarusian vocal quintet Clear Voice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Early life==
William Temple Thomson Mason was born on July 24, 1782 at [[Raspberry Plain]]. "Temple", as his family called him, was [[Thomson Mason]]'s third child and youngest son with his second wife Elizabeth Westwood Wallace.&lt;ref name=GH1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/053-0012_Catoctin_Rural_Historic_District_1989_DRAFT_Nomination.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Catoctin Rural Historic District | date= December 13, 1988| accessdate=February 17, 2008 | publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources | author=Eugene M. Scheel &amp; John S. Salmon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after his father’s English cousin, Sir William Temple.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; While Temple was still an infant, Temple's father died on February 26, 1785 and he was raised by his mother and older half-brothers.&lt;ref name=GH1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;

At the age of 19, Temple was sent to the [[College of William and Mary]] to obtain a gentleman’s education.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; He spent two years at the college, graduating in 1803.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; Having reached the legal age of 21, Temple received a parcel of land in northern Loudoun County near [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] not far from Raspberry Plain, the house in which he grew up.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; According to Thomson Mason's last will and testament, recorded in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] on September 26, 1784, he had bequeathed to Temple, his brother Westwood Thomson Mason and their half-brother, Abram Barnes Thomson Mason, several hundred acres of land along the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; On November 29, 1803,&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; at the [[Loudoun County Courthouse]] in Leesburg, the three brothers filed a document which partitioned the land, with Temple receiving {{convert|757|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;

==Family and career==
Temple Mason built his home, [[Temple Hall]], in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] between 1810 and 1812. On June 16, 1812, Temple married Ann Eliza Carroll, daughter of Nicholas Maccubbin Carroll and Anne Jennings, in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland.&lt;ref name=GH1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; Their first child, Temple Anna, was born at Temple Hall in 1813.&lt;ref name=GH1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;

Temple Mason not only oversaw the management of his prosperous Temple Hall farm, but also became involved in the community life of Leesburg.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; He served as a [[vestryman]] at [[St. James Episcopal Church (Leesburg, Virginia)|St. James Episcopal Church]] and oversaw the [[polling station|polls]] during elections in Loudoun County.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; As a mark of his increased social standing in the community, Temple's estate became a hub of Leesburg society.&lt;ref name=HMDB2/&gt; On August 9, 1825 [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette]] during his [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette#Grand tour of America|grand tour]] of the United States and  accompanied by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John Quincy Adams]] and former President [[James Monroe]] (who was then residing at his [[Oak Hill (James Monroe House)|Oak Hill]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] in southern Loudoun County) visited Temple Hall.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt; The three gentlemen witnessed the [[baptism]] of Mason's two youngest daughters; Lafayette became the godfather for Mary Carroll, and Adams and Monroe became as Maria Louisa's godfathers.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HMDB2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=12954 | title=Temple Hall | date=October 25, 2008 | accessdate=February 17, 2008 | publisher=Historical Marker Database | author=[[Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason served one term in the Virginia House of Delegates, from 1830-1831, temporarily displacing veteran [[James McIlhaney]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Virginia State Library 1978) p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of Temple Mason's sons and one of his daughters, Templeanna (1819-1849), died before the American Civil War. The same Leesburg, Virginia graveyard contains the remains of his sons Thomas Henry Carroll Mason (1822-1838) and Westwood Thomson Mason (1819-1854), the latter of whom died in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Charles Carroll Mason (d. 1866) and Nicholas Carroll Mason (1810 - 1874) did not serve in either army in that conflict and are also buried in that cemetery; likewise William Temple Thomson Mason, Jr. (1800-1891), who would die and be buried in Tennessee. William T.T. Mason's daughter Eliza Mason Welch (1820-1899) married in Maryland in 1836 but spent most of her adult years and died in Iowa. In the 1850 U.S. Federal census, Mason owned more than a dozen enslaved people.&lt;ref&gt;In the 1850 U.S. Federal Census slave schedule, Loudoun County, Virginia, William Mason owned a dozen enslaved people and Thompson Mason owned at least 35&lt;/ref&gt; William T.T. Mason of Washington, D.C. owned at least four enslaved people in 1860, a 5 year old black girl, 16 year old mulatto woman and 30 and 59 year old black and mulatto males.&lt;ref&gt;1860 U.S. Federal Census for Loudoun County, unstated. An indexing problem may exist, for ancestry.com also includes a link to six slaves of William McPherson in Loudoun County's Southern District to William Mason. The 1860 Virginia slave indexes are not available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
On January 2, 1857, six years after the death of his wife, and at the age of 75, Temple sold Temple Hall to Henry A. Ball for the sum of $50,000 and retired to [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HMDB2/&gt; Temple Mason died in 1862 and was interred in the Old Episcopal Churchyard in Leesburg.&lt;ref name=GH1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP2"/&gt;
