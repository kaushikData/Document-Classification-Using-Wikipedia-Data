==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

'''Acotyledon''' is used to refer to [[seed plant]]s or spermatophytes that lack [[cotyledon]]s, such as [[orchid]]s and [[dodder]]. Orchid seeds are tiny with underdeveloped embryos. They depend on [[mycorrhizal fungi]] for their early nutrition so are [[myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophs]] at that stage.

Although some authors, especially in the 19th century and earlier, use the word acotyledon to include plants which have no cotyledons because they lack seeds entirely (such as [[fern]]s and [[moss]]es),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution-url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=acotyledon |contribution=acotyledon |url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1913 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710101105/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Znw-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=acotyledon+Cuscuta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B-W0cC6Xnq&amp;sig=TgueUvNSVcfbZ_0fIrtS4JNqE1s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1uMTS4yoMoK9lAeVssGEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAw | contribution = acotyledons | title = A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art | author = William Thomas Brande | year = 1842 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H_MCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=acotyledon+Cuscuta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ar5j3x_CIM&amp;sig=LVVlrsnlHqxiGUsZWcQNQsQMBCk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1uMTS4yoMoK9lAeVssGEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwCQ | contribution = acotyledons | title = The treasury of botany | editor = John Lindley, Thomas Moore | year = 1866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others restrict the term to plants which have seeds but no cotyledons.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=acotyledon&amp;use1828=on | contribution = acotyledon | title = American Dictionary of the English Language | author = [[Noah Webster]] | year = 1828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flowering plants]] or angiosperms are divided into two large groups. [[Monocotyledon]]s or monocots have one seed lobe, which is often modified to absorb stored nutrients from the seed so never emerges from the seed or becomes photosynthetic. [[Dicotyledon]]s or dicots have two cotyledons and often germinate to produce two leaf-like cotyledons. [[Conifers]] and other [[gymnosperm]]s lack flowers but may have two or more cotyledons in the seedling.

'''Al-Musta'sim Billah''' (full name: '''al-Musta'sim-Billah Abu-Ahmad Abdullah bin al-Mustansir-Billah'''; {{Lang-ar|المستعصم بالله أبو أحمد عبد الله بن المستنصر بالله}}; 1213 – February 20, 1258) was the last [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]; he ruled from 1242 until his death.

==Biography==
Al-Musta'sim succeeded his father in late 1242.

He is noted for his opposition to the rise of [[Shajar al-Durr]] to the Egyptian throne during the [[Seventh Crusade]]. He sent a message from Baghdad to the Mamluks in Egypt that said: "If you do not have men there tell us so we can send you men."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Maqrizi, p.464/vol1&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al-Musta'sim had to face the greatest menace against the caliphate since its establishment in 632: the invasion of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] forces that, under [[Hulagu Khan]], had already wiped out any resistance in [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. In 1255/1256 Hulagu forced the Abbasid to lend their forces for the campaign against [[Alamut]].

In 1258, Hulagu invaded the Abbasid domain, which then consisted of only Baghdad, its immediate surroundings, and southern Iraq. In his campaign to conquer Baghdad, Hulagu Khan had several columns advance simultaneously on the city, and laid siege to it. The Mongols kept the people of Abbasid Caliphate in their capital and executed those who tried to flee.

[[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad was sacked]] on February 10 and the caliph was killed by [[Hulagu Khan]] soon afterward. It is reckoned that the Mongols did not want to shed "royal blood", so they wrapped him in a rug and trampled him to death with their horses. Some of his sons were massacred as well; one of the surviving sons was sent as a prisoner to Mongolia, where Mongolian historians report he married and fathered children, but played no role in Islam thereafter.

''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' reports that upon finding the caliph's great stores of treasure which could have been spent on the defense of his realm, Hulagu Khan locked him in his treasure room without food or water, telling him "eat of thy treasure as much as thou wilt, since thou art so fond of it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/y#a5823 Yule-Cordier Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Furat; translated by le Strange, 1900, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/journalroyalasi48irelgoog#page/n335/mode/1up  293]–300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbasid Caliph in Cairo==

The [[Mamluk]] Sultans and Syria later appointed an [[Abbasid Caliph]] in Cairo, but they were even more symbolic than the by-now marginalized Abbasid Caliphs in Baghdad. Even though they kept the title for about 250 years more, other than installing the Sultan in ceremonies, these Caliphs had little importance. After the [[Ottomans]] conquered [[Egypt]] in 1517, the Abbasid Caliph of Egypt, [[Al-Mutawakkil III]] was transported to [[Constantinople]], and Sultan [[Selim I]] announced himself to be a [[Ottoman Caliphate|Caliph]].

'''Alfred the Gorilla''' ({{circa|1928}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 9 March 1948) arrived in [[Bristol Zoo]], in England, in 1930 and became a popular attraction and animal celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/acBlyEkETBKkpOIII5QdvQ] BBC&lt;/ref&gt; His fame grew to international proportions during World War II and after his death he remained an important mascot for the city of [[Bristol]].

Alfred's distinct personality led to his popularity amongst younger visitors and he quickly became  one of the zoo's main attractions. His profile was further increased during World War II when visiting soldiers took images and stories of Alfred back to their home countries with articles about him appearing in the US and Australian press. After Alfred died in 1948, his taxidermic form was put on display in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]] where he continued to act as a mascot for the city. Alfred's form was stolen from the museum in 1956 and was missing for a weekend before he was discovered and returned, a mystery that remained unsolved until the death of one of the perpetrators in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/mar/04/bristol-alfred-gorilla-theft-mystery Alfred the Gorilla mystery solved] 4 March 2010 The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; He remains on display in Bristol today and served as part of the inspiration for the popular [[Wow! Gorillas]] trail in 2012.

== Gorillas and Bristol ==
Bristol's connection with gorillas dates back to the first gorilla bones ever brought to Britain. After being sent to [[Liberia]] as a missionary in 1836, the American naturalist [[Thomas S. Savage|Dr. Thomas Savage]] wrote to Professor [[Richard Owen]] in London, declaring,

'' 'I have found the existence of an animal of extraordinary character in this locality, and which I have reason to believe is unknown to the naturalist. As yet I have been unable to obtain more than a part of a skeleton.' ''&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p38&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter included a sketch of a skull which Savage speculated might be related to a chimpanzee. Savage also wrote to [[Samuel Stutchbury]] of the Bristol Institution, a forerunner of the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Stutchbury had more remains sought out and in 1847 Captain George Wagstaff obtained three skulls from the [[Gabon River]] in [[West Africa]]. When these arrived in Bristol, Stutchbury sent them to Owen who published a paper, on the specimens proposing to call the species Troglodytes Savagei after Thomas Savage.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Zoological Society of London, Volume 3, 1849, p391. https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh0hAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the full paper was published in 1849, however, Dr. [[Jeffries Wyman]] of Harvard had already published a description of the bones with Savage's own preferred name of ''Troglodytes gorilla''. The skulls were returned to Stutchbury and can be found in Bristol Museum's collection today.

The first living gorilla reached Europe in the 1880s, although a ‘very unusual chimpanzee’ exhibited by a travelling showman in England in 1860 was later thought to be gorilla. Most of the early gorillas sent to Europe died within a couple of years, often from lung disease. One of the longest lived resided at Breslau Zoo and reached the age of seven. The first living gorilla to reach Bristol Zoo, purchased for £75, arrived in 1900 but died after a short period.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Van Bruggen, ‘International Zoo News’, 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Alfred was initially found by an Expedition from the [[American Museum of Natural History]], New York and [[Columbia University]] in 1928 in what was then [[Belgian Congo]]. The expedition members were told that a pair of gorillas had been shot for ‘raiding’ a farmer's field for food, afterwards a baby was discovered and suckled by a local woman.&lt;ref&gt;H. Paddon, ‘Biological Objects and "Mascotism": The Life and Times of Alfred the Gorilla’ in S.J.M.M. Alberti, The Afterlives of Animals - A Museum Menagerie (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The baby gorilla was later sold to a Greek merchant and taken to the town of [[Mbalmayo]] in modern-day [[Cameroon]], where the expedition encountered him playing in the streets. He was described by the Expedition as ‘the liveliest specimen of his kind we had ever seen’.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Alfred was sold to an Italian who, after bringing him to Europe, sold him on to an animal dealer. Bristol Zoo, already successful in rearing chimpanzees, acquired Alfred for £350.&lt;ref&gt;H. Paddon, ‘Biological Objects and "Mascotism": The Life and Times of Alfred the Gorilla’ in S.J.M.M. Alberti, The Afterlives of Animals - A Museum Menagerie (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred spent a few months housed in Rotterdam in 1930 before continuing to Bristol Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Van Bruggen, ‘International Zoo News’, 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred was named after Alfred Mosely, Companion of Honour,a benefactor of the zoo, it was his gift to the Nation&lt;ref&gt;Harry Edwards, ‘The Old Cliftonian’, 13 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Although during his life he was thought to be a [[mountain gorilla]], it is more likely that he was a [[western lowland gorilla]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Life at Bristol Zoo ==
Alfred arrived at Bristol Zoo on 5 September 1930, which was thereafter celebrated as his birthday. His cage was positioned just inside one of the entrances and this prominent position, alongside his vibrant personality, meant that he quickly became one of the Zoo's main attractions. During his first two years at the zoo, Alfred regularly took walks around the grounds with his keeper Frank Guise. He did this on the end of a long collar and chain and was well known for wearing woollen jumpers.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his third year at the zoo Alfred had grown to weigh eight stones. His increasing strength had become a concern to his keepers and when he broke a photographer's tripod during his birthday celebrations, his walks around the zoo were curtailed. Alfred also caught whooping cough during these early years but received medical help. This remained the only significant illness that he contracted until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being confined to his enclosure Alfred continued to be a popular attraction and he was featured beating his breast on a radio broadcast from the zoo in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred became the oldest gorilla to survive in captivity in 1938 and later that year visitors were invited to guess his weight on a specially constructed machine. The closest guess the public managed was 20 stones, with Alfred actually coming in at 26 stones, four pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39.&lt;/ref&gt; His diet was completely vegetarian which was an innovation in the practice of keeping captive gorillas and cost the zoo just £3 a week.

== Popularity, habits and personality ==
Alfred's status at the zoo led to him becoming something of a local celebrity with visitors, especially with children. Their recollections often refer to Alfred as having a number of distinct character traits and quirks that made up his personality. On occasion he would approach the children who stood around his cage and make what they perceived as friendly gestures and conversations with them.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L4, 19 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popularity ===
Although Alfred's habits could occasionally be perceived as offensive by some of the zoo's visitors, many of the children who saw him regularly formed a deep bond with him. One visitor even going as far as to say that because of Alfred's ruder habits, he both ‘loved and hated him’ at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L19, 9 November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Others recall simply enjoying the gorilla's company and would sit beside the cage for hours just to be close to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L8, 24 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; His status as one of the zoo's man in attractions is reflected by the fact that many of them recall that rather than ‘going to the zoo’, they would often think of their visits as ‘going to see Alfie’.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L5, 4 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other visitors made regular trips to the zoo on their way through Bristol to other destinations. One woman from the West Midlands recalls that they would drop in on the gorilla every year on their way to a campsite in Somerset. She also notes Alfred's habit of wearing a large hessian sack like a holiday maker wearing a handkerchief on their head which always amused her.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L12, 20 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperament and nickname ===
Alfred was allegedly offended by Rosie the Elephant being allowed to walk past his enclosure which would cause him to sulk.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39.&lt;/ref&gt; He also allegedly harboured a dislike of bearded men, double decker buses and aeroplanes.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Article, AHOTW: Bristol Museum's Alfred the gorilla, http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8940000/8940723.stm&lt;/ref&gt; This stood in contrast for the affection he reciprocated towards his early keepers Frank Guise and Bert Jones, as well as to the sparrows who visited his enclosure to pick at breadcrumbs. He would sometimes be tickled by his keeper and a crowd would gather to watch.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L6, 10 June 1993&lt;/ref&gt; As fascism rose in Europe Alfred acquired the nickname, the ‘Dictator of Bristol Zoo’.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habits ===
Alfred was also fond of making and throwing snowballs. At the age of three years he can be seen doing just that in the company  of two young children in a photo from January 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p39.&lt;/ref&gt; His expertise at throwing however, was not limited to snowballs. Alfred, one visitor recalled, 'used to express his opinion of the human race by picking up large lumps of his droppings and hurling them accurately at the spectators in front of his cage. It was a delight for small schoolboys to be able to act as cheerleaders to this somewhat one-sided contest’.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Edwards, ‘The Old Cliftonian’, 13 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred also had a habit of urinating on visitors after climbing the bars of his cage. One child was beckoned over by the gorilla and when she approached he urinated on her head, the story is still remembered by her grandchildren today who often ask to see the gorilla who ‘did a wee on great grandma’ when they visit the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L9, 1 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer described how Alfred was her favourite animal at the zoo and she has many memories but her favourite is of her aunt eating plums in front of Alfred. He kept asking her for some and when she simply laughed at him he went to the back of his cage and threw his dung at her. She continued to laugh and not feed him so he climbed the bars of his cage and urinated on her. The writer got in trouble for telling her aunt that the incident was her fault and she should have given Alfred the plums.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L17, 4 August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred was also fond of playing hide and seek with visitors.&lt;ref&gt;James Belsey, ‘Bristol Evening Post’, 30 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; One visitor recalled how she once got her head stuck in the bars of Alfred's cage when she was ten. She was later rescued by a St. Johns ambulance worker. ‘How did Alfred react to my dilemma’, she recounted, ‘he just sat in the corner of his cage clapping his hands loudly and laughing’.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L14, 24 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; She now tells the story to her grandchildren when they visit the zoo.

== Wartime ==
Although some animals were moved from the zoo during the war years, Alfred remained in Bristol. His diet of fruit and vegetables became stretched however, and the zoo took to seeking sponsors in order to feed its animals. Alfred was sponsored by Albert Glisten, Fellow of the Zoological Society and Chairman of Southend United Football Club.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of US Army troops in Bristol allowed Alfred's popularity to spread further as soldiers sent images and stories featuring the gorilla across the Atlantic. Articles concerning Alfred were reproduced in American newspapers and he retained his celebrity status throughout the war. One visitor to the museum recalled that her late great-great-uncle Bill was Alfred's keeper in the 1940s. Alfred was fond of Bill and would comb his keeper's hair and eat chocolate from his teeth. Bill would occasionally be picked up and taken to the zoo on his days off as Alfred would sometimes not go into his night cage without him. She also noted the gorilla's dislike of bombs and anti aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L15, 26 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Guard of the 11th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment was based in the zoo's cafeteria during World War Two. One member based at the zoo recalled how they were not allowed to march and parade in front of Alfred's cage lest he become aggressive. At the time the troops discussed the causes of this, musing that it might be that their uniforms reminded Alfred of other primates. On reflection, as the keepers also wore uniforms, the writer concluded that it was more likely the marching itself which upset the gorilla. He also recalled how night watch at the zoo was his scariest experience during his time in the Home Guard. On the one hand, he was worried about Germans appearing out of the dark but he was equally concerned that if a bomb dropped near the zoo the animals might escape from their cages. ‘Often, 17 year olds like myself exchanged our fears about what one would do if, spare the thought, in such an event the monstrous form of Alfred were to lumber forward out of the darkness’, he recalled, ‘probably run towards the enemy!’ he concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L13, 23 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In 1946 Alfred became sluggish and overweight before being diagnosed with thyroid deficiency. He recovered from the illness after treatment however, and later returned to his former strength.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred died on 10 March 1948. The press at the time speculated that ‘his pet hate got him in the end’, linking Alfred's dislike of aeroplanes with the passage of one over the zoo shortly before his death. The actual cause of his demise was tuberculosis which he contracted a year before and despite his keepers best efforts, he had been unable to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Barnett, ‘The Dictator of Bristol’  in Nonesuch, the University of Bristol Magazine, Spring 1999, p40.&lt;/ref&gt; His death was mourned by many of the regular visitors to the zoo, some of whom were even inspired to compose poems in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L1, 13 March 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Alfred's death gorillas were kept almost continuously at the zoo until the mid-1990s. An article in the Western Daily Press noted the departure of two gorillas in 1995 breaking this pattern of keeping gorillas at the zoo. The departing gorillas were named Diana and Jeremy, aged 23 and 12 respectively. They were sent to London Zoo to live with another female named Zaire. The author noted that the conditions in Bristol's ape house had been criticised, prompting a £5 million redevelopment of the building in order for it to house small animals. A new ape house, the article declared, was not likely to appear for at least four years and the gorillas were unlikely to return, much to the disappointment of the keeper Mike Colbourne.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shorney, ‘Western Daily Press’, 18 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxidermy ==
Following his death Alfred was mounted by the taxidermists [[Rowland Ward]] of London in a pose representing him on all fours. He was returned to Bristol City Museum and was put on display near the heavily frequented museum cafe. His bones and organs were sent to the Anatomy Department at [[Bristol University]].

== Display ==
At first, Alfred's interpretation in the museum was very minimal, detailing only a few key pieces of information about the gorilla. Despite this, his position near the cafe, combined with the fame he had been accorded during his life, made him one of the most visited and celebrated exhibits. Many of those who saw Alfred in the zoo as children continued to visit him once he became an exhibit in the museum. The feelings that they had for him when he was alive often carried over into his second ‘life’ as an exhibit, maintaining and sustaining his fame. Later encounters with his taxidermic form were particularly memorable for those who could remember Alfred from his time at the zoo. One visitor, for example, encountered the gorilla unexpectedly when visiting her granddaughter at Bristol University more than forty years after Alfred's demise.&lt;ref&gt;Bristol Museum, Alfred Archive L7, 15 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred was moved in 1988 to the World Wildlife gallery on the museum's first floor where his exhibit was now positioned alongside a number of different specimens and displays. His interpretation was expanded during this move and he began to appear more and more on publicity material for the museum in photographs as well as in cartoon form. These moves allowed Alfred's form to become a part of a larger narrative on biology and conservation whilst retaining his status as a celebrated local mascot and historical object.

== Theft ==
In 1956 Alfred went missing from the museum after being stolen by a group of students as a prank. After three days he was found and returned to his case although the full story surrounding the theft took more than fifty years to come to light.

== Celebrations and Competitions ==
In 1993 people were asked to send in their memories about Alfred as part of a competition to win four free tickets to Bristol Zoo. This was part of the celebrations held to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Alfred's death which also included a series of talks and tours at the museum. The letters that were received added a great deal of anecdotal information about Alfred to the museum's archive

Alfred's eightieth birthday was celebrated at the museum in 2010 with a series of activities and events. Children drew him birthday cards showing the gorilla's continuing public appeal as part of the history of Bristol and as a curiously for younger visitors to the museum. A bust of Alfred's head is also on display at Bristol's M Shed museum after formerly being displayed at the entrance to the gorilla enclosure at Bristol Zoo.

== Legacy ==
Alfred remains a prominent figure in the museum's collection appearing regularly in guides, trails and children's events. Alfred has also featured in a several films and plays. Tom Kelpie's award-winning short film spoof Who Stuffed Alfred the Gorilla as well as the original footage filmed by the American exhibition who first discover him playing the streets of Mbalmayo. Nick Jones and Toby Lucas also made a short documentary on Alfred in 2008.

Alfred featured in Peter Nichols’ 1979 light comedy [[Born in the Gardens]]. One of Alfred's kidnappers, Ron Morgan, also allegedly wrote a play about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.family-announcements.co.uk/localworld/view/1007704/ron-morgan&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's life and status are also often still used to promote discussion regarding the history and evolution of conservation techniques and the practice of keeping primates in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;One article in Nonesuch magazine by Ray Barnett featured an accompanying piece by Sanjida O’Connell consisting of an interview with Charlotte Uhlenbroek exploring the way Primate conservation has moved on since Alfred’s day. Sanjida O’Connell, ‘Nonesuch’, Spring 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's status as a mascot for Bristol was further cemented in 2011 when the [[Wow! Gorillas]] project was launched across the city to raise awareness about the extinction crisis facing primates. The project was also held to mark the 175th anniversary of [[Bristol Zoo]] and raised over £420,000 for charity.

'''Authoritarian personality''' is a state of mind or attitude characterized by belief in absolute [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] or submission to someone else’s authority, as well as the administration of that belief through the oppression of one's subordinates. It usually applies to individuals who are known or viewed as having an authoritarian, strict, or oppressive personality towards subordinates.

==Historical origins==
[[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik]], [[Daniel Levinson]], and [[Nevitt Sanford]] theorized in their 1950 book, ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', about a personality type that involved the "potentially fascistic individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adorno |first1=T. W. |last2=Frenkel-Brunswik |first2=E. |last3=Levinson |first3=D.J. |last4=Sanford |first4=R. N. |date=1950 |title=The Authoritarian Personality |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]] |isbn=978-0-06-030150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They labeled it the "authoritarian personality" based on earlier writings by [[Erich Fromm]] that used this term.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, J. &amp; Scheepers, P. (1993). "[http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/14330/3357.pdf?sequence=1 Theoretical and methodological foundations of the authoritarian personality]".  ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', 29, pp.&amp;nbsp;345–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the historical influences for their theory included the rise of [[fascism]] in the 1930s, [[World War II]], and [[the Holocaust]], a main component of the "authoritarian personality" is being susceptible to [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] ideology and anti-democratic political beliefs. Their large body of research (known as the Berkeley studies) focused mainly on prejudice within a psychoanalytic/psychosocial theoretical framework (i.e., [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] and Frommian).

==Original theory==
Adorno et al. (1950) viewed the authoritarian personality as having a strict [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]] that controls a weak [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] unable to cope with strong [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] impulses.  The resulting intrapsychic conflicts cause personal insecurities, resulting in that person's superego to adhere to externally imposed conventional norms (conventionalism), and to the authorities who impose these norms (authoritarian submission).  The ego-defense mechanism of projection occurs as indicated when that person avoids self-reference of the anxiety-producing id impulse, by displaying them onto "inferior" minority groups in the given culture (projectivity), with associated beliefs that are highly evaluative (power and toughness), and rigid (stereotypy).  Additionally, there is a cynical view of humanity and a need for power and toughness resulting from the anxieties produced by perceived lapses in society's conventional norms (destructiveness and cynicism). Other characteristics of this personality type are a general tendency to focus upon those who violate conventional values and act harshly towards them (authoritarian aggression), a general opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies (anti-intraception), a tendency to believe in mystic determination (superstition), and finally, an exaggerated concern with promiscuity.
 
In regards to child development, the formation of the authoritarian type occurs within the first few years of the person's life, strongly shaped by the parents and family structure.  "Hierarchical, authoritarian, exploitative" parent-child relationships may result in this personality type (Adorno et al., 1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;482–484).  Parents who have a need for domination, and who dominate and threaten the child harshly, and demand obedience to conventional behaviors with threats, foster the characteristics of this personality.  In addition, the parents have a preoccupation with social status, and communicate this to the child in terms of rigid and externalized rules.  The child then suffers from suppressed feelings of resentment and aggression towards the parents, who are instead, idealized with reverence.

[[Alfred Adler]] provided another perspective, linking the "will to power over others" as a central [[neurosis|neurotic]] trait, usually emerging as aggressive over-[[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]] for felt and dreaded feelings of inferiority and insignificance. According to this view, the authoritarian's need to maintain control and prove superiority over others is rooted in a [[worldview]] populated by enemies and empty of equality, empathy, and mutual benefit.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Early research==
These researchers' most noteworthy measurement for authoritarianism is the "F-scale", designed to tap a set of beliefs thought to be associated with authoritarianism without the need for specific out-groups indicated. Kirscht and Dillehay (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Kirscht, JP, &amp; Dillehay, RC. (1967). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6L4fBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dimensions of Authoritarianism: A Review of Research and Theory]''. University of Kentucky Press: Lexington, TN.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined several problems with the Berkeley studies, including response bias. Response bias results from the F scale being uniformly worded in a confirming direction. Hence, if one tends to respond in agreement with items, regardless of their content, one is rated as an authoritarian by such a test. Several studies have shown that more variance of the F scale can be explained by response bias than the content of the items (Kirscht &amp; Dillehay, 1967).

Actual assessment of 16 Nazi criminals at Nuremberg trials (reported in Zillmer, ''et al.'', 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Zillmer, E. A., Harrower, M., Ritzler, B.A., and Archer, R.P. (1995). ''The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals''. LEA Hillside, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by clinicians using the Rorschach inkblots, and in one study, the F scale for authoritarianism, found that these ex-Nazis score high on three dimensions (anti-intraception, superstition and stereotyping, and projectivity), but not all nine dimensions as the theory predicted.

One of the first applications of the authoritarian scales in academia was by Stern and colleagues, in the early 1950s, at the University of Chicago (as reported in Wiggins, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, J.S. (1980). ''Personality and Prediction: Principles of Personality Assessment''. Addison-Wesley. Reading, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesized prediction was that "authoritarian" students would have difficulty in the sciences and humanities, and use of an attitudinal scale was a successful predictor.

==Validity==
Soon after the publication of ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', the theory became the subject of many criticisms. Theoretical problems involved the psychoanalytic interpretation of personality, and methodological problems focused on the inadequacies of the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]. Another criticism is that the theory of the Berkeley group insinuates that authoritarianism exists only on the right of the political spectrum. As a result, some have claimed that the theory is corrupted by political bias. Kreml found that although there were stylistic similarities between authoritarians and anti-authoritarians (dogmatism, rigidity, etc.), construct variables like a) the relative need for order, b) the relative need for power, c) rejection or acceptance of impulse, and d) extroversion versus introversion, differentiated the two types and could underpin a full-spectrum psycho-political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kreml, William P. (1977). ''The Anti-Authoritarian Personality''. Oxford ; New York : Pergamon Press.{{ISBN|978-0-08-021063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiggins provided an insightful explanation of how the authoritarian construct is an example of the synthetic approach to personality assessment. In short, in the synthetic approach, the assumption is that those with authoritarian personality characteristics are assessed with researcher's intuitive model of what characteristics fit the criterion role requirements of the predicted situation (support of Fascism). Hence, it is not a completely empirical approach to prediction, but rather based on "arm chair" situational analysis of the criteria, and intuited psychological characteristics to be assessed that fit the situation. More recently, Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Jost, JT., Glaser, J., Kruglanski, AW., and Sulloway, FJ. (2003). "Political conservatism as motivated social cognition." ''Psychological Bulletin'', 129. pp&amp;nbsp;339–375.&lt;/ref&gt; have presented how the traditional research in authoritarianism or conservatism has confounded the psychological variables (e.g., personality characteristics) with the political criteria (conservative attitudes). Hence the scales measuring individual differences on authoritarianism often include the criteria attitudinal statements of political ideologies.

Although the authoritarian is a personality construct, Adorno et al. (1950) proposed that the social environment influenced the expression of prejudice expressed, based upon the "climate of opinion" that exists at the time. Hence, ideological beliefs created within the culture and other social forces shape the prejudices of the given authoritarian individual. However, as noted by Taylor (1998),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. (1998). "[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-07091-002 The social being in social psychology]." In ''The Handbook of Social Psychology'', 4th, ed. (Eds. Gilbert, D.T., Fiske, S., and Lindzey, G). pp.&amp;nbsp;58–95.&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesized interaction of society and the individual is lost to most of the subsequent research that implemented the F scale in differential psychological studies. Given the science of personality assessment, the variety of methods Adorno, ''et al.'' used are now unsupported, and might explain that lack of empirical studies using the F scale or the other scales developed by Adorno ''et al.'' in subsequent research. An example of the social environment impact is presented by Gibb (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, C. A. (1969). "Leadership." ''The Handbook of Social Psychology'', Vol IV. pp.&amp;nbsp;205–282. Lindzey. G., &amp; Aronson, E. (Eds.). Addison-Wesley: Reading, Mass&lt;/ref&gt; in his critique of personality traits and leadership, where a study by Katz suggested that the social situation can override personality differences. In the study, groups of black and white students were formed. Some mixed racial groups had students scoring high authoritarian F scores, and in other mixed groups, low F score students. Comparisons of high authoritarian white students to those not scoring authoritarian indicated that the former student type were more cooperative and less willing to endorse stereotypes towards blacks. Situational norms against prejudicial perceptions might have influenced authoritarian students to act less prejudicial in order to conform to the prescribed norm.

After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis, Canadian psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]] found in 1981 that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Almeyer added: "The reader familiar with the matter knows that most these criticisms [of the ''Authoritarian Personality''] are over 25 years old, and now they might be considered little more than flaying a dead horse. Unfortunately the flaying is necessary, for the horse is not dead, but still trotting around—in various introductory psychology and developmental psychology textbooks, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Altemeyer|Altemeyer, B.]] (1981). ''Right-Wing Authoritarianism''. University of Manitoba Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88755-124-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current reinterpretations==
[[Bob Altemeyer]] conducted a series of studies on what he labeled [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA), and presents the most recent analysis of this personality type.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1998). The other "authoritarian personality".  Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 30, 47-91.&lt;/ref&gt;   The focus of RWA research is political preferences as measured through surveys, that suggest three tendencies as noted in attitudinal clusters.  These are: 1) submission to legitimate authorities; 2) aggression towards sanctioned targeted  [[minority group]]s; and 3) adherence to values and beliefs perceived as endorsed by followed leadership.  McCrae &amp; Costa (1997)&lt;ref&gt;McCrae and Costa (1997). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121346454500329 Conceptions and correlates of openness to experience]. Handbook of Personality Psychology. (Hogan, R., Johnson, J., &amp; Briggs, S., Eds). pp.&amp;nbsp;835–847. Academic Press: San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; report that the big 5 dimension of openness to experience is negatively correlated to RWA (r=-0.57) as measured by the NEO-PI-R Openness scale.

Later, Jost, Glaser, [[Arie W. Kruglanski|Kruglanski]], and Sulloway (2003) have proposed that authoritarianism, RWA and other similar constructs of [[political conservatism]] are a form of motivated [[social cognition]].  These researchers propose that conservatism has characteristics similar to those of authoritarianism, with resistance to change, and justification for inequality as the core components.  In addition, conservative individuals have needs to manage uncertainty and threat with both situational motives (e.g., striving for security and dominance in social hierarchies) and dispositional motives (e.g., terror management and self-esteem).  Despite its methodological deficiencies, the theory of the authoritarian personality has had a major influence on research in political, personality, and social psychology.

The research on social cognition and motivation is continued by John Duckitt and Chris Sibley. They distinguish two different aspects of [[world view]]s that lead to two different kinds of authoritarianism. A view of the social world as dangerous and threatening leads to [[right wing authoritarianism]], while the view of the world as a ruthlessly competitive jungle in which the strong win and the weak lose leads to [[social dominance orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duckitt |first1=John |last2=Sibley |first2=Chris G. |title=A Dual-Process Motivational Model of Ideology, Politics, and Prejudice |journal=Psychological Inquiry |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=2-3 |pages=98–109|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10478400903028540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent reinterpretation called regality theory is based on [[evolutionary psychology]]. Regality theory sees the authoritarian attitude as a reaction to perceived collective danger. It is argued that this theory adds an evolutionary level of analysis and avoids the political bias that authoritarianism theory is often accused of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bio Base Europe''' is an [[innovation]] and training center for the [[biobased economy]]. It is a platform that supports the development of sustainable, biobased products such as bio-chemicals, bio-plastics, bio-materials, bio-detergents, bio-energy, etc. from renewable biomass resources. Its mission is to stimulate sustainable development and economic growth by facilitating R&amp;D and training for biobased process development. It consists of a [[#Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant|Pilot Plant]] for the biobased economy located in the port of Ghent ([[Belgium]]), and a [[#Bio Base Europe Training Center|Training Center]] for the biobased economy in Terneuzen ([[Netherlands]]).

== History ==
On December 12, 2008, [[Europe]], [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]] have allocated €21 million to the [[Interreg]] IV project Bio Base Europe. Bio Base Europe is the largest Interreg project ever granted to the Dutch-Flemish border region. The founding fathers are [[Ghent Bio-Energy Valley]] and [http://www.bioparkterneuzen.com Bio Park Terneuzen].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbeu.org/sites/default/files/Bio%20Base%20Europe%20press%20release%20final_0.pdf Announcement on BBEU website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112222243/http://www.bbeu.org/sites/default/files/Bio%20Base%20Europe%20press%20release%20final_0.pdf |date=November 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Bio Base Europe has been awarded the Sail of Papenburg prize for best innovative project by [[the Association of European Border Regions]] (AEBR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aebr.eu/en/sail_of_papenburg/region_award.php Announcement on AEBR website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant ==

[[File:BBEPP pilot scale fermenters.jpg|thumb|400px|Fermenters at Bio Base Europe with volumes of 100L, 4500L and 15000L.]]
Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant is a pilot test facility for the biobased economy, built with the aim to close the gap between scientific feasibility and industrial application.  It operates from kg to ton scale. The pilot plant hosts a range of process equipment to scale up biobased processes to industrial scale. Tests done in the [[pilot plant]] enable to assess operating costs, specific strengths and weaknesses of new biobased processes before costly, large-scale investments in production plant facilities are made. Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant has no industrial shareholders, and operates according to the open innovation service model. Companies and research centres throughout the world that are active in the biobased economy can access these facilities for their technological developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sectie.ewi-vlaanderen.be/sites/default/files/documents/KBBE%20Success%20stories_14sep2010.pdf KBBE success stories presented at the KBBE towards 2020 conference]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes done in the pilot plant can be divided into the following categories

1.	[[Biorefining]]: Biomass fractionation and [[pretreatment]]

2.	[[Industrial biotechnology]]

3.	[[Green chemistry]]

4.	[[Downstream processing]]

In the '''biorefining operations''', biomass can be fractionated in its various parts. These operations involve a.o. milling and pulping, dispersion, homogenizing, physical separation such as centrifugation and decantation, filtration including dead end particulate filtration and cross flow membrane filtration,… [[Biomass]] can also be pretreated prior to enzymatic hydrolysis, involving pulping and homogenisation reactions, jet cooking, acid or alcaline treatment, steam explosion, etc. 
'''White or industrial biotechnology''' processes involves the use of microorganisms and their enzymes in so-called [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes or biocatalytic reactions. Fermentations can be performed from 1 to 15.000 litre scale and involve both batch, fed batch or continuous operations. Reactors for enzymatic reactions are present that can be used with either water of organic solvents.
'''Green chemistry''' is performed in explosion proof installations such as glass-lined chemical reactors (1 - 6.000 l scale) that are suited to perform under vacuum or under pressure. The Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant is also equipped with filter dryers for solvent extraction of liquids and solids.
'''Downstream processing''' for the recovery of pure products after biochemical or chemical conversion involves various equipment for extraction, evaporation, demineralization, ion exchange, carbon treatment, crystallization, spray drying, lyophilisation, etc.

Continuous process lines can be built up by connecting unit operations with mobile positive and centrifugal pumps, heat exchangers, dosing pumps, flexible and fixed piping and instrumentation.

== Bio Base Europe Training Center ==

The Bio Base Europe Training Center is an education, network and exhibition center promoting the development of a sustainable biobased economy. It offers general and company-specific training and connects closely with the market demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sectie.ewi-vlaanderen.be/sites/default/files/documents/KBBE%20Success%20stories_14sep2010.pdf KBBE success stories presented at the KBBE towards 2020 conference]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bio Base Europe Training Center works according to the one-stop-shop concept. The training center offers companies a wide range of trainings for their process operators and technical staff. For example, a training portfolio can be used by logging into a web-based learning management system. Furthermore, specific training and a full training program for technical staff are offered and support in hiring new process operators can be obtained. In addition, the Bio Base Europe Training Center is developing dynamic process simulators which can be used for the training of operators.

The '''biosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίος ''bíos'' "life" and σφαῖρα ''sphaira'' "sphere") also known as the '''ecosphere''' (from Greek οἶκος ''oîkos'' "environment" and σφαῖρα), is the worldwide sum of all [[ecosystem]]s. It can also be termed the zone of [[life]] on [[Earth]], a closed system (apart from [[Sun|solar]] and [[cosmic radiation]] and [[heat]] from the interior 
of the Earth), and largely self-regulating.&lt;ref name = "ColumbiaEncyc"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the most general [[Geophysiology|biophysiological]] definition, the biosphere is the global [[ecology|ecological]] system integrating all [[living beings]] and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]], [[geosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The biosphere is postulated to have [[evolution|evolved]], beginning with a process of [[origin of life|biopoiesis]] (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or [[biogenesis]] (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

== Origin and use of the term ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Oceanography]] ---&gt;
[[Image:90 mile beach.jpg|thumb|A [[beach]] scene on Earth, simultaneously showing the lithosphere (ground), hydrosphere (ocean) and atmosphere (air)]]
The term "biosphere" was coined by geologist [[Eduard Suess]] in 1875, which he defined as the place on Earth's surface where life dwells.&lt;ref&gt;Seuss, E. (1875) ''Die Entstehung Der Alpen'' [''The Origin of the Alps'']. Vienna: W. Braunmuller.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the effect of both [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Matthew F. Maury]] on the [[Earth sciences]]. The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (see [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]]), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term "[[ecosystem]]" by Sir [[Arthur Tansley]] (see [[Ecology (history)|ecology history]]). Vernadsky defined [[ecology]] as the science of the biosphere. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] concept for integrating [[astronomy]], [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[biogeography]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]] and, generally speaking, all life and Earth sciences.

=== Narrow definition ===
Geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms (the "[[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]" or "[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]" as referred to by biologists and ecologists). In this sense, the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model, the other three being ''[[geosphere]]'', ''[[hydrosphere]]'', and ''[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]''. When these four component spheres are combined into one system, it is known as the [[Ecosphere (planetary)|Ecosphere]]. This term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Möller |first=Detlev|date=December 2010|title=Chemistry of the Climate System|publisher=De Gruyter |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-3-11-022835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second International Conference on Closed Life Systems defined ''biospherics'' as the science and technology of analogs and [[model (abstract)|models]] of [[Earth]]'s biosphere; i.e., artificial Earth-like biospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bebarta |first=Kailash Chandra|date=2011|title=Dictionary of Forestry and Wildlife Science|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |location = New Delhi| page=45 |isbn=978-81-8069-719-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may include the creation of artificial non-Earth biospheres&amp;mdash;for example, human-centered biospheres or a native [[Mars|Martian]] biosphere&amp;mdash;as part of the topic of biospherics.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Every part of the planet, from the [[polar region|polar]] ice caps to the [[equator]], features life of some kind. Recent advances in [[microbiology]] have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the Earth's terrestrial surface, and that the total mass of [[microbial]] life in so-called "uninhabitable zones" may, in [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], exceed all animal and plant life on the surface. The actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure. Birds typically fly at altitudes as high as {{convert|1,800|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} and fish live as much as {{convert|8,372|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} underwater in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 2006" /&gt;

There are more extreme examples for life on the planet: [[Rüppell's vulture]] has been found at [[altitude]]s of {{convert|11,300|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}; [[bar-headed goose|bar-headed geese]] migrate at altitudes of at least {{convert|8,300|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}; [[yak]]s live at elevations as high as {{convert|5,400|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} above sea level; [[mountain goat]]s live up to {{convert|3,050|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}.

== Artificial biospheres ==
[[File:Biosphere 2 4888964549.jpg|thumb|Biosphere 2 4888964549|Biosphere 2 in Arizona.]]
Experimental biospheres, also called [[closed ecological system]]s, have been created to study ecosystems and the potential for supporting life outside the earth. These include spacecraft and the following terrestrial laboratories:
* [[Biosphere 2]] in [[Arizona]], United States, 3.15 acres (13,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
* BIOS-1, BIOS-2 and [[BIOS-3]] at the Institute of Biophysics in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], in what was then the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=BioScience | date=Oct 1997 | volume=47 |issue=9 | pages=575–85 | title= Bios-3: Siberian experiments in bioregenerative life support | author=Salisbury FB | author2=Gitelson JI | author3=Lisovsky GM | doi=10.2307/1313164 | pmid=11540303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative ([[MELiSSA]]) at [[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]]

==Extraterrestrial biospheres==
No biospheres have been detected beyond the Earth; therefore, the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical. The [[rare Earth hypothesis]] suggests they should be very rare, save ones composed of [[microbe|microbial]] life only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Peter D.|last2=Brownlee|first2=Donald|title=[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare earth: why complex life is uncommon in the universe]]|date=2004|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-95289-5|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Earth analog]]s may be quite numerous, at least in the [[Milky Way galaxy]], given the large number of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=New Estimate for Alien Earths: 2 Billion in Our Galaxy Alone|url=https://www.space.com/11188-alien-earths-planets-sun-stars.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=Space.com|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the planets discovered orbiting [[TRAPPIST-1]] could possibly contain biospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rees|first1=Sir Martin|title=These new worlds are just the start. There are many more life-supporting planets out there waiting to be discovered|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/02/22/many-life-supporting-planets-soon-will-see-clearly/|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given limited understanding of [[abiogenesis]], it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres.

Based on observations by the [[Kepler Space Telescope]] team, it has been calculated that provided the probability of abiogenesis is higher than 1 to 1000, the closest alien biosphere should be within 100 light-years from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Amri Wandel, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269116658_On_the_abundance_of_extraterrestrial_life_after_the_Kepler_mission On the abundance of extraterrestrial life after the Kepler mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future, for example on [[Terraforming of Mars|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Robert Zubrin ; With Richard Wagner ; Foreword by Arthur C|title=[[The Case for Mars|The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must]]|date=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1451608113|edition=Rev., Updated}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of Earth's biosphere is called [[terraforming]].&lt;ref name="Fogg1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fogg|first1=M.J.|title=Terraforming Mars: A review of current research|journal=Advances in Space Research|volume=22|issue=3|year=1998|pages=415–420|issn=0273-1177|doi=10.1016/S0273-1177(98)00166-5|bibcode=1998AdSpR..22..415F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9684">As a result of advances in technology, [[information technology]] has become a highly important economic sector. Although it is relatively new, this industry still experiences many of the workplace culture problems of older industries. [[Bullying]] is common in IT, leading to high sickness rates, low [[morale]], poor [[productivity]] and high [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]].&lt;ref name="Marcello"&gt;Marcello C Perceptions of Workplace Bullying Among IT Professionals: A correlational analysis of workplace bullying and psychological empowerment of Workplace Bullying Among IT Professionals (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT professionals.&lt;ref name="Thomson2"&gt;Thomson R [http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/04/03/230127/IT-profession-blighted-by-bullying.htm IT profession blighted by bullying] Computer Weekly 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying in IT is most commonly downwards hierarchical (such as manager to employee) but can also be horizontal (such as employee to employee) or upwards hierarchical (such as employee to manager).&lt;ref name=Marcello/&gt;

==Incidence==
In 2002, a survey of UK staff by [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting]] found that 21% of respondents in the IT industry have been bullied once or more in the past year. Seven per cent claimed to have suffered chronic bullying.&lt;ref&gt;Towner N [http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2002/10/23/190478/One-in-five-IT-workers-gets-bullied.htm One in five IT workers gets bullied] Computer Weekly 23 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Chartered Management Institute]] conducted a survey of IT managers finding that more than three out of 10 managers have been bullied during the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;Shifrin T [http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2005/09/27/211941/Bullying-is-widespread-survey-shows.htm Bullying is widespread, survey shows] Computer Weekly 27 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a survey carried out by trade union [[Unite the Union|Unite]] of IT professionals showed 65% believed they had been bullied at work, and 22% had taken time off work because of stress caused by bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insight.bt.com/news/IT-workers-suffer-bullying-claims-union "IT workers suffer bullying", claims union] BT Business&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson R [http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/03/24/229943/IT-workers-being-bullied-says-union.htm IT workers being bullied, says union] Computer Weekly 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[International Data Group#IDG Connect|IDG Connect]] conducted research which showed that 75% of 650 IT professionals surveyed claimed to have been bullied at work, while 85% said they had seen others bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.idgconnect.com/abstract/8621/it-careers-success-vs-bullying|title=IT Careers: Success vs. Bullying |publisher= IDG Connect | date= 4 August 2014| accessdate=16 October 2014|author=Cave, Kathryn}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report formed part of an extensive series of articles conducted by the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thechangemap.wordpress.com/2014/09/11/bullying-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-it/|title=Bullying: The Uncomfortable Truth About IT |publisher= Pam Farmer |date= 11 September 2014| accessdate=16 October 2014|author=Farmer, Pam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press release stated: “These results in no way prove that things are worse in IT than elsewhere and are weighted by the self-selecting nature of the study. However, via a blend of new statistics, detailed feedback from over 400 in-depth testimonials, along with insight from a range of industry experts, this report paints a pretty comprehensive picture of a seemingly endemic problem.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.realwire.com/releases/IDG-Connect-Research-Shows-75-of-IT-Professionals-Surveyed-Report|title=IDG Connect Research Shows 75% of IT Professionals Surveyed Report Being Bullied at Work |publisher= Real Wire |work= |date=4 August 2014| accessdate=16 October 2014|author=Cave, Kathryn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Impacts of a [[bullying culture]] can include:&lt;ref name=Marcello/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomson2/&gt;
* Victims are stressed and take more sick leave
* Damage to the productivity, morale and performance of the whole company
* High staff turnover which may exacerbate any [[skills shortage|skill shortages]]
* Giving a company a bad [[reputation]], making it harder to get good staff and get new business.

==Manifestations==
Victims reported:&lt;ref name=Marcello/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomson2/&gt;
* Unachievable deadlines (see [[setting up to fail]])
* Excessive monitoring and supervision (see [[micromanagement]])
* Constant criticism on minor matters (see [[hypercriticism]])
* Being ridiculed, [[humiliated]] and [[intimidated]]
* Being [[marginalised]] and asked to do pointless or ill-defined work below their capabilities.
* Being ostracised (see [[social rejection]])

==Comments from victims and researchers==
Comments from victims and researchers include:&lt;ref name=Marcello/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomson2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin G [http://www.itcontractor.com/Articles_IR35_News_Advice/view_article.asp?id_no=4526&amp;photopage=0 IT Contractors being bullied at work] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322113910/http://www.itcontractor.com/Articles_IR35_News_Advice/view_article.asp?id_no=4526&amp;photopage=0 |date=March 22, 2012 }} IT Contractor 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Internal [[grievance]] procedures are commonly not impartial and are open to [[abuses of power]] - the bully himself may have a close relationship with the investigating party and there may be [[conflicts of interest]] (see [[quasi-judicial]])
* Complaining against the bully may only make the bullying worse and the victim may fear repercussions
* Victims often conclude that the only solution is to leave the company or the Information Technology industry altogether
* IT professionals may be technically brilliant but often lack social skills ([[soft skills]])
* Some managers may be technically "hands-off" and feel threatened by the technical skills of their subordinates
* There is often a culture of [[cronyism]], [[protectionism]] and [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/212000.html jobs for the boys]
* Middle managers are prone to being bullied from above and/or below in the hierarchy
* A high percentage of senior IT management possess very poor [[people skills]] or may have a [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality
* [[Mediation]] needs to be done by a fully trained impartial external mediator with a good track record, which are not available at most workplaces
* A system to report bullying anonymously may be helpful
* Victims often have [[misplaced loyalty]] with a company and stay too long [[trusting]] that they would get support
* Bullying in IT is often encouraged and institutionalized as a way of boosting competitiveness among employees 
* Information Technology bullies may use their advanced computer skills to hack into their victim's computers and/or participate in [[cyberbullying]] against their victim

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13461">'''Plant callus''' (plural ''calluses'' or ''calli'') is a growing [[mass]] of unorganized plant [[parenchyma]] cells. In living plants, callus cells are those cells that cover a plant wound. In biological research and biotechnology callus formation is induced from plant tissue samples (explants) after surface sterilization and plating onto tissue culture medium [[in vitro]] (in a closed culture vessel such as a [[Petri dish]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/~sd21/tisscult/what.htm What is Plant Tissue Culture?]&lt;/ref&gt;    The culture medium is supplemented with [[Plant hormone|plant growth regulators]], such as [[auxin]]s, [[cytokinin]]s, and [[gibberellin]]s, to initiate callus formation or [[Somatic Embryogenesis|somatic embryogenesis]].  Callus initiation has been described for all major groups of land plants. [[Image:Callus1.jpg|thumb| ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' parenchyma cells in culture]]

Plant callus is usually derived from [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] tissues. The tissues used to initiate callus formation depends on plant species and which tissues are available for [[explant culture]]. The cells that give rise to callus and somatic embryos usually undergo rapid division or are partially undifferentiated such as [[meristem]]atic tissue.

== Morphology ==
Specific [[auxin]] to [[cytokinin]] ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Friable calluses fall apart easily, and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures.  Callus can directly undergo direct [[organogenesis]] and/or [[embryogenesis]] where the cells will form an entirely new plant. This process is known as callus culture

== Callus cells deaths ==
Callus can brown and die during culture, but the causes for callus browning are not well understood.  In ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'' callus cells, small organized callus cells became disorganized and varied in size after browning occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Yang |author2=Guo, Xiulian |author3=Lu, Ran |author4=Niu, Bei |author5=Pasapula, Vijaya |author6=Hou, Pei |author7=Cai, Feng |author8=Xu, Ying |author9=Chen, Fang|title=Changes in morphology and biochemical indices in browning callus derived from Jatropha curcas hypocotyls|journal=Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)|volume=98|issue=1|pages=11–17|doi=10.1007/s11240-009-9533-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Browning (chemical process)|Browning]] has also been associated with oxidation and [[Natural phenol|phenolic]] compounds in both explant tissues and explant secretions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Yinghui |author2=Armstrong, Charles L. |author3=Dong, Jimmy |author4=Feng, Xiaorong |author5=Fry, Joyce E. |author6=Keithly, Greg E. |author7=Martinell, Brian J. |author8=Roberts, Gail A. |author9=Smith, Lori A. |author10=Tan, Lalaine J. |author11=Duncan, David R. |title=Lipoic acid—an unique plant transformation enhancer|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant|volume=45|issue=6|pages=630–638|doi=10.1007/s11627-009-9227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rice, presumably, a condition which is favorable for scutellar callus induction induces necrosis too.&lt;ref name="pazuki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pazuki |first=Arman |last2=Sohani |first2=Mehdi |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013 |title= Phenotypic evaluation of scutellum-derived calluses in ‘Indica’ rice cultivars |url= http://aas.bf.uni-lj.si/september2013/08Pazuki.pdf |format=PDF |journal= Acta Agriculturae Slovenica |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=239–247 |doi=10.2478/acas-2013-0020 |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Callus cells are not necessarily genetically homogeneous because a callus is often made from structural tissue, not individual cells.{{clarify|reason=why would cells derived from "structural tissue" be any less "genetically homogenous" than a population of cells derived from a single cell?|date=August 2016}} Nevertheless, callus cells are often considered similar enough for standard scientific analysis to be performed as if on a single subject. For example, an experiment may have half a callus undergo a treatment as the [[experimental group]], while the other half undergoes a similar but non-active treatment as the [[control group]].

Plant calluses derived from many different cell types can differentiate into a whole plant, a process called regeneration, through addition of plant hormones to the culture medium.  This ability is known as [[totipotency]].  Regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell allows [[transgenesis|transgenics]] researchers to obtain whole plants which have a copy of the transgene in every cell.  Regeneration of a whole plant that has some genetically transformed cells and some untransformed cells yields a [[chimera (plant)|chimera]].  In general, chimeras are not useful for genetic research or agricultural applications.

Genes can be inserted into callus cells using biolistic bombardment, also known as a [[gene gun]], or ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''.  Cells that receive the gene of interest can then be recovered into whole plants using a combination of [[plant hormone]]s.  The whole plants that are recovered can be used to experimentally determine gene function(s), or to enhance crop plant traits for modern agriculture.

Callus is of particular use in [[micropropagation]] where it can be used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics.

==History==
[[File:Duhameldemonceau.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau by François-Hubert Drouais. He is shown working on his ''Éléments d’architecture navale'', his most famous work. Duhamel du Monceau was the first to describe callus formation that he observed growing over the wound of an elm tree.]]

In 1908, E. F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">Capital punishment is legal in most countries of the [[Middle East]]. Much of the motivation for the retention of the death penalty has been religious in nature, as [[Islam and capital punishment|the Qur'an allows or mandates executions]] for various offences.

==Moratoria and abolition==
===Israel===
Almost all death penalties were abolished by legislation in 1954 except for serious crimes committed during wartime. The last execution to ever take place in Israel was that of [[Adolf Eichmann]], who was convicted for his role in the Holocaust, in 1962. A moratorium has since been placed on all further execution.

In 2018 January 2018, [[Knesset]] passed a bill introducing death penalty for [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="DeathPenaltyHalamish"&gt;{{cite news|title=Netanyahu demands death penalty for Halamish terrorist|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-demands-death-penalty-for-halamish-terrorist/|accessdate=27 July 2017|publisher=Times of Israel|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-5188931/Israeli-leaders-push-terrorist-death-penalty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/israel-will-todesstrafe-fuer-terroristen-einfuehren-15347505.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-deathpenalty/israeli-death-penalty-advocates-win-preliminary-vote-in-parliament-idUSKBN1ES1DT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In Turkey, capital punishment was fully abolished in 2004 for all crimes. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Abolition advocacy==
===Attempts===
In Lebanon in 2008, then-Justice Minister [[Ibrahim Najjar]] introduced a draft law to Parliament which would abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/Oct/11/Najjar-presents-draft-law-to-abolish-death-penalty.ashx|title = Najjar presents draft law to abolish death penalty|publisher = The Daily Star|date = October 11, 2008&lt;!-- 12:00 AM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the law failed to pass, he continued to advocate for the abolition for the rest of his time in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/Aug/29/Justice-Ministry-campaigns-to-abolish-death-penalty.ashx|title = Justice Ministry campaigns to abolish death penalty|author = Josie Ensor|publisher = The Daily Star|date = August 29, 2009&lt;!-- 12:00 AM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farouk Ksentini, chairman of Algeria's National Advisory Commission for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (CNCPPDH), stated in 2010 that he would advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. This aroused opposition from Islamist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2010/03/11/feature-02|title = Algeria resurrects death penalty debate|author = Ademe Amine|publisher = Maghrebia|date = 2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Cell'''|セル|Seru|lead=yes}} is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. He makes his debut in chapter #361 {{nihongo|''The Mysterious Monster, Finally Appears!!''|謎の怪物、ついに出現!!|Nazo no Kaibutsu, Tsui ni Shutsugen!!}}, first published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' on February 16, 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazines/322149 |title=週刊少年ジャンプ　1992/02/16　表示号数11 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cell is an evil [[synthetic biology|artificial life form]], created using [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s from several of the main characters, who travels back in time so he can become the perfect being. In order to reach this goal, he must absorb Androids [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Android #17|#17]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Android #18|#18]].

==Creation and conception==
After [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], Toriyama's former editor during ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' and early ''Dragon Ball'', expressed dissatisfaction with first Androids #19 and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Doctor Gero|#20]] and later Androids #17 and #18 as villains, Toriyama created Cell.&lt;ref name="ST2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |page=6 |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illustrations"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL　大全集 1 COMPLETE　ILLUSTRATION |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–207 |isbn=4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama has expressed some kind of regret regarding the design of Cell, calling it tedious to draw all the little spots on his body&lt;ref name="Illustrations"/&gt;. In addition, he did not initially plan for the character to be able to transform, but gave him this ability after his then-current editor Yū Kondō described Cell as "ugly."&lt;ref name=ST2/&gt; Toriyama intended for Cell's second form to last longer than it did; Kondō found the form to be silly and urged him to hasten the first appearance of the next transformation.&lt;ref&gt;"Dragon Ball Q&amp;A" section, Dragon Ball Full Color Androids Saga volume 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell originally evolves from a [[cicada]]-like form into his {{nihongo|Imperfect Cell|不完全体セル|Fukanzentai Seru}} form, which is still [[insect]]-like in appearance. Both his first form and his second {{nihongo|Semi-Perfect Cell|半完全体セル|Hankanzentai Seru}} form have a long tail that ends in a stinger-like appendage and allows it to absorb other organisms. The tail recedes under his wings in his final {{nihongo|Perfect Cell|完全体セル|Kanzentai Seru}} form, although he then uses it to spawn {{nihongo|Cell Juniors|セルジュニア|Seru Junia}}, minuscule childlike versions of himself. After his supposed death, Cell returns even stronger, in a form often called {{nihongo|Super Perfect Cell|超完全体セル|Chō Kanzentai Seru}} or {{nihongo|Revived Cell|復活セル|Fukkatsu Seru}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide|date=October 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===''Dragon Ball''===
Cell is an artificial life form (referred to as a "Bio-Android") created by [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Doctor Gero|Doctor Gero]]'s supercomputer from the cells of the universe's strongest warriors, possessing the genetic information of [[Goku]], [[Vegeta]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Frieza]], and King Cold in an underground complex beneath Gero's secret laboratory. Cell is designed to evolve into the "perfect" being by absorbing two of Gero's previous creations, [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Android #17|#17]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Android #18|#18]]. The Cell that appears as the primary antagonist of his titular arc is from the future, awakening after his development is complete to find that the Androids have been destroyed by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]]. After he kills Trunks, Cell uses his time machine while regressing into an egg to travel back four years, to before the androids appeared, arriving in the present timeline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=A Farewell to Arms|volume=31|date=February March 3, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After hatching and [[Metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] from his larval, cicada-like form into his insect-like Imperfect form, Cell kills off thousands of people and absorbs them to increase his power in preparation to absorb the Androids. After he's managed to absorb the energy of entire cities of people, Cell finds Android #17 during his fight with Piccolo, defeating the both of them easily&lt;ref name="New Piccolo"&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=New Piccolo...Last Piccolo?|volume=31|date=April 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; before [[List of Dragon Ball Characters#Android 16|Android 16]] holds him off. However, he is able to make an opening to absorb #17 and evolves into a larger, more human-like form. This form, Semi-Perfect Cell, quickly dispatches 16, but he is unable to absorb #18 thanks to the intervention of [[Tien Shinhan]], who holds him back at the cost of his own life force&lt;ref name="New Cell"&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=The New Cell|volume=31|date=May 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being rescued by Goku, along with a surviving Piccolo.

Cell tracks Android #18, destroying islands to intimidate her into showing herself, but before he can destroy the island that #18 is hiding on, Vegeta appears and quickly defeats him&lt;ref name="Super Vegeta"&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Cell's Last Chance|volume=32|date=June 23, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Before he can be killed, Cell talks Vegeta into letting absorb Android #18 so he can give him a better fight, and upon doing so, he assumes his final form, which is much more human like and eloquent. In this form, Cell easily defeats [[Krillin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=The Complete Cell|volume=32|date=July 14, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Vegeta&lt;ref name="Reversal"&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=A Reversal|volume=32|date=July 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Trunks, but spares all of them so that they can come to his own fighting tournament, the {{nihongo|Cell Games|セルゲーム|Seru Gēmu}} to find a worthy opponent to face him, intending to destroy Earth when he wins and wanting to enjoy the fear he causes in others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Cell's Idea|volume=33|date=September 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A week later, in the first round of the Cell Games, he quickly defeats [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Mr. Satan|Mr. Satan]] before moving onto Goku, who quits upon realizing Cell is stronger than him&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Last Resort|volume=34|date=December 8, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Goku then nominates his son, [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]], as Cell's next opponent, to everyone's surprise. Though Gohan puts up a good fight and proves himself his father's superior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=The Successor|volume=34|date=December 15, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cell easily takes the upper hand due to his pacifistic nature. Wanting to avoid killing Cell if he can help it, Gohan warns Cell that if he is pushed too far, he will lose control of his anger and kill him, which only drives Cell to torment him further, excited to see this power. He spawns {{nihongo|Cell Juniors|セルジュニア|Seru Junia}}, miniature versions of himself who begin to fight the heroes, causing Gohan's rage to slowly swell. It is only when Cell mercilessly kills Android #16 after he had encouraged Gohan to fight that Gohan snaps, transforming into a Super Saiyan 2&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Gohan Unleashed|volume=34|date=February 2, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Gohan effortlessly, violently kills all the Cell Juniors, and then proceeds to effortlessly overpower Cell, aiming to prolong his suffering, dealing so much damage that Cell regurgitates Android #18 and reverts to his previous form&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Cell, Brought to Bay|volume=35|date=February 23, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In desperation, Cell tries to self-destruct and destroy the Earth, but Goku sacrifices himself to ensure that Cell detonates elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=The End of the Cell Game|volume=35|date=March 2, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, Cell is able to survive thanks to his unique physiology, which allows him to regenerate from a special [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] in his head and grow more powerful whenever he has almost been killed, returning to his Perfect form even stronger than before&lt;ref name="Zenkai"&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Gohan's Pain|volume=35|date=March 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He easily kills Trunks, and when Vegeta attacks him in retaliation, he easily swats him aside. Before he can kill him, Gohan takes the blast in his place, which breaks his arm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=The Tables Turn|volume=35|date=March 16, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With victory in his grasp, Cell decides to destroy the planet with one last ''Kamehameha'', claiming he has the power to destroy the entire [[Solar System]]&lt;ref name="Solar Kamehameha"&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Father and Son|volume=35|date=March 23, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Assisted by his father in spirit, Gohan retaliates with his own ''Kamehameha'', ultimately overpowering Cell with Vegeta's help, destroying his cell nucleus and killing him once and for all&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Kamehameha vs. Kamehmeha|volume=35|date=March 30, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mr. Satan, however, takes credit for the victory and becomes a hero.

Upon being resurrected by the Dragon Balls and returning to the future, Trunks destroys Androids #17 and #18, and is confronted by the Cell of his timeline, who plans to kill Trunks and use his time machine in the same way his alternate self had. However, Trunks showcases his newfound power and easily kills him, finally bringing peace to the future&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Peace to the Future|volume=35|date=April 27, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In filler episodes of the anime, Cell makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief. Cell tries absorbing two siblings, but is prevented from doing so by Krillin, giving chase to the three and nearly killing Krillin before he notices Piccolo and Tien Shinhan on the way and escapes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Our Hero Awakes|number=146|date=July 1, 1992|series=Dragon Ball Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In his posthumous appearances, he is shown causing trouble in Hell along with Frieza, King Cold and the [[Ginyu Force]]. He is defeated by Goku and Pikkon and sent to prison, and is later seen watching Goku's battle with [[Majin Boo]] on a crystal ball, openly wondering why Goku quit against him and then went on to fight Boo, whom he acknowledges to be a stronger opponent than himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Vegeta's Respect|number=280|date=October 18, 1995|series=Dragon Ball Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''Dragon Ball Super''===
A few years later, Goku imagines Cell in a training sequence, defeating him with a blow to the head&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Who Will the 100 Million Zeni Peace Reward Go To…?!|number=1|date=July 5, 2016|series=Dragon Ball Super}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When he travels back to the past again, Trunks reacts in confusion to seeing Goku alive as he remembers his death from Cell's self-destructing and not long after, Bulma is revealed to have retained the Time Capsule that Cell had stolen from Trunks to return to the present timeline. Cell is remembered by Trunks when he notes the differences between Gohan as a child, in particular when he fought Cell, and him as an adult upon meeting him for the first time in years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Master and Pupil Reunited Gohan and "Future" Trunks!|number=52|date=July 17, 2016|series=Dragon Ball Super}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An illusion of Cell appears in the Forest of Fear to Krillin and Goku&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Goku and Krillin Back to the Old Training Grounds|date=January 22, 2017|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;, attacking the pair and growing in size before Krillin concentrates and dispels the illusion by confronting his fear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Beat The Fearsome Foes!

=== In other media ===
In ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', after Goku is sent to Hell by accident, he confronts both Cell and Frieza, whose bodies have been rendered temporarily immortal due to the upset in the balance between the two worlds. Though Cell and Frieza trap Goku with their new joint attack and freeze him using a witch below them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Resurrection of Cell and Frieza|date=April 23, 1997|number=43|series=Dragon Ball GT}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they too are frozen after foolishly venturing down to gloat at him, and due to being dead, they cannot thaw out like Goku did. Goku accidentally breaks the ice Cell and Frieza are trapped within to pieces, implying that Cell and Frieza have been erased from existence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=17 Times 2|date=April 30, 1997|number=44|series=Dragon Ball GT}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths. Cell and Frieza also appear in the GT live action show, with new forms.

Cell appears in a TV ad for ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'', questioning why he is not in the film while Frieza brags that he is, Cell then remarks that Frieza only has a non-speaking appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Dragon Ball Film's TV Ad Has Voice Cameo by Cell |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-21/2013-dragon-ball-film-tv-ad-has-voice-cameo-by-cell |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Video games ====
Cell appears in a number of [[List of Dragon Ball video games|video games]] as a boss and playable character, most notably the ''Budokai'', ''Budokai Tenkaichi'' and ''Raging Blast'' series. He is also a playable character in the ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Collectible Card Game]]''. In several games, Cell has forms that have been created specifically for the installment.

In the 1995 game ''Dragon Ball Z: Super Battle'', after Goku defeats Cell, he gives him a Senzu Bean and allows him to live, Cell promising to return and win.

In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Budokai]]'', Cell has a nightmare where he accidentally absorbs Krillin and becomes {{nihongo|Cellin|セルリン|Serurin}}, with the form leaving him weaker.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2003 game ''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2'', Cell is revived by Bobbidi and becomes a Majin, his appearance being altered with the letter "M" on his forehead alongside black lining appearing under his eyes. This form is short-lived, as [[Majin Boo]] terminates Bobbidi, with Cell being absorbed afterward by Boo.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 video game ''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi'', Cell defeats Gohan and confronts Super 17, defeating him when the two conflict over a shared interest in killing Goku.

In the 2015 game ''[[Dragon Ball: Xenoverse]]'', Cell appears as a mentor for the player, teaching the ''Perfect Kamehameha'', ''Perfect Shot'', ''All Clear'' and ''Gravity Impact'' to the player. Within the context of the game's story mode, Cell defeats Gohan until the player intervenes in their fight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=February 24, 2015|quote='''Cell:''' Oh, I'm sorry! Are you scared at my return?}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the version of the character from Trunks' timeline is able to reach his Perfect form thanks to Towa's strengthening, though he is destroyed by the player and Trunks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=February 24, 2015|quote='''Cell:''' Did you bring your friend along for the ride? Is he from the past, too? I'm warning you, interfere and I'll exterminate you.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 2016 game ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2]]'', Cell shows up in his Perfect Form and fights Trunks, also meeting Android 16 for the first time and fighting alongside him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 25, 2016|quote='''Cell:''' So it would seem this stranger is my ally.

Cell is able to reach his Perfect form after defeating both Piccolo and #16 and absorbing #17 and #18 at the same time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 25, 2016|quote='''Android 17:''' You gotta be kidding me!}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When an empowered Android #17 fights Piccolo, Trunks warns the player Cell that succeeding in absorbing him would mean an even larger power boost than in the main timeline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 25, 2016|quote='''Trunks:''' If Cell absorbs 17 in this state, he'll grown terrifyingly strong!}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cell himself shows up empowered, easily dominating Android #16. Cell later fights alongside the corrupted Cell Juniors, and welcomes Metal Cooler to the Cell Games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 25, 2016|quote='''Cell:''' Heh..

In the 2018 game ''[[Dragon Ball FighterZ]]'', Cell defeats Android 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball FighterZ|developer=Arc System Works|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=January 26, 2018|quote='''Krillin:''' What have you done to my wife?!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is confronted by Goku and Krillin while aiming a beam at her and Android 21&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball FighterZ|developer=Arc System Works|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=January 26, 2018|quote='''Cell:''' Well, if it isn't Goku and his annoying, nose-less sidekick...!}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After being defeated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball FighterZ|developer=Arc System Works|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=January 26, 2018|quote='''Krillin:''' Cell!

Cell is also a playable character in the crossover fighting game ''[[Battle Stadium D.O.N.]]'', as well as a support character in the Shonen Jump crossover ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]''.

== Voice actors ==
[[File:Norio Wakamoto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norio Wakamoto]] has been Cell's Japanese voice actor in every single piece of ''Dragon Ball'' media.]]
[[File:Travis Willingham by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Travis Willingham]] was Cell's English voice actor from 2009 to 2014 because of Clarke's unavailability]]
Norio Wakamoto is the Japanese voice of Cell and revealed that when he voiced the forms of Cell, the first form is monster-like, he used a raspy voice which he said was a pain. He toned it down for the second, and by the final form he was able to perform comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=Shueisha|pages=172–177|language=Japanese |isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English Funimation dub, Cell is voiced by [[Dameon Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-12-07/dragon-ball-z-kai-buu-saga-to-air-on-toonami/.109619|title=Dragon Ball Z Kai's Buu Saga to Air on Toonami|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke considers Cell one of his more "fun and entertaining" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Madman|title=Dameon Clarke (voice of Cell) talks DragonBall Z + Borderlands|date=2013-12-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY-GosLQZzA|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime around the release of ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'|Resurrection 'F']]'', in which Frieza returned, Clarke said he began receiving questions about a film featuring Cell's return, which he himself supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Florida Supercon|title=Borderlands Handsome Jack, Dameon Clarke Q&amp;A at Florida Supercon 2015|date=2015-08-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQdCPGMDhQs|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abilities ==
Cell is among one of the most powerful antagonists of the original manga. Possessing the genetic material of the some of the world's strongest fighters, he is a master martial artist with superhuman strength, endurance, and speed. He can fly, create energy beams and forcefields using his ''[[Qi|ki]]'', a form of energy derived from his own life force, and with his stinging tail, he can absorb others, either stabbing them with the tail to dissolve them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Cell|volume=30|date=February 16, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; or engulfing them within it to consume them. It is by absorbing others that he increases his own power.

Cell has access to the abilities of those whose cells he was created from, including the ''Kamehameha'', Goku's signature technique, Tien Shinhan's ''Solar Flare'', Vegeta's ''Galick Gun'' and Frieza's ''Death Beam''. Thanks to his Namekian cells, Cell can [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] portions of his body shortly after they have been destroyed, which he demonstrates during his battles with Android #16, Vegeta, Goku, and Gohan. In the manga, Cell states that he can regenerate so long as a nucleus in his head remains intact&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Gohan's Pain|volume=35|date=March 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though this is contradicted by an earlier scene in which Cell regenerated after having the top half of his body, head included, destroyed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Kamehameha Full Power|volume=34|date=December 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is retconned in the Funimation dub, in which Cell states that he can regenerate from just a single cell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Cell Returns!|date=December 20, 2000|series=Dragon Ball Z|number=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After his near-death experience, he gains the ability to use ''Instant Transmission'', another technique of Goku's, which allows him to [[teleportation|teleport]] by placing his fingers to the center of his head and thinking of his intended destination.

Cell's strength progresses over the course of his self-titled story arc; at the beginning of the arc, in his Imperfect state, he is outmatched by Piccolo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Ginger Town Showdown|volume=31|date=February 25, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is too weak to absorb the Androids. However, after he absorbs thousands of humans using his tail, his power grows to the point that he is easily able to best Piccolo and Android #17&lt;ref name="New Piccolo"/&gt;, absorbing the latter to progress into his next form, which quickly dispatches Android #16&lt;ref name="New Cell"/&gt;, an opponent equal in power to his previous state. This power is in turn eclipsed by his final, Perfect form. In this state, Cell easily toys with and defeats Vegeta&lt;ref name="Reversal"/&gt;, who had similarly overpowered his Semi-Perfect form&lt;ref name="Super Vegeta"/&gt;, without even approaching anything near his full power. At full power, Cell is far stronger than even Goku and Gohan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=Cell vs. Gohan|volume=35|date=February 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the year they spent in the Room of Spirit and Time, with only Super Saiyan 2 Gohan proving capable of defeating him. After nearly being killed by his own self-destruction, Cell's Saiyan biology greatly boosts his power once more&lt;ref name="Zenkai"/&gt;, allowing him to break Gohan's arm with a single blast and match his final Kamehameha with his own. In this form, he compares his power to that of a Super Saiyan 2 and claims to have enough power to destroy the Solar System&lt;ref name="Solar Kamehameha"/&gt;.

Through his tail, Cell is able to create minuscule, childlike versions of himself known as {{nihongo|Cell Juniors|セルジュニア|Seru Junia}}, which are also colored differently from him&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=16's Secret Weapon|volume=34|date=January 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They have a portion of Cell's power, as they were able to overwhelm most of the Z Fighters, as Cell would&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|cartoonist=[[Akira Toriyama]]|story=[[Dragon Ball]]|title=The Little Cells|volume=34|date=January 26, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but had trouble with Piccolo, Vegeta, and Trunks.

Within the church proper are the last four (or, by some definitions, five) [[Stations of the Cross|Stations]] of the [[Via Dolorosa]], representing the final episodes of [[Passion of Jesus|Jesus' Passion]]. The church has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the Resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis.

Today, the wider complex accumulated during the centuries around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre also serves as the headquarters of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], while control of the church itself is [[Simultaneum|shared]] among several [[Christian denominations]] and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] and [[Roman Catholic]], and to a lesser degree the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]]. Meanwhile, [[Protestant]]s, including [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], have no permanent presence in the Church. Some Protestants prefer [[The Garden Tomb]], elsewhere in Jerusalem, as a more evocative site to commemorate Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

[[File:Golgotha (Church of the Holy Sepulchre).jpg|thumb|Traditional site of Golgotha]]
Constantine's church was built as separate constructs over the two holy sites: the great [[basilica]]&lt;ref name=basilica/&gt; (the ''Martyrium'' visited by [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] in the 380s), an enclosed [[colonnade]]d [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] (the ''Triportico'') with the traditional site of Calvary in one corner, and across a courtyard,&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] called the ''[[Resurrection of Jesus|Anastasis]]'' ("Resurrection"), where Jesus is believed to have been buried.&lt;ref name=mcmahon/&gt;

The church was consecrated on 13 September 335. Each year, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates the anniversary of the [[consecration]] of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) on 13 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commemoration of the Founding of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) at Jerusalem|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=102593|publisher=[[Orthodox Church in America]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]], 13 September currently falls on 26 September of the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).{{cn|date = October 2013}} --&gt;

In the centre of the rotunda is a small building called the ''Kouvouklion'' in Greek{{efn|Kουβούκλιον; Modern Greek for small compartment}} or the ''[[Aedicula]]'' in Latin,{{efn|English ''aedicule'' or ''edicule'', the Latin diminutive of ''aedes'', "house", meaning "small house" or "shrine"}} which encloses the tomb.&lt;ref name=natburial&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-christ-tomb-burial-church-holy-sepulchre/|title=Jesus' Burial Tomb Uncovered: Here's What Scientists Saw Inside|date=31 October 2016|last=Romey|first=Kristin|work=National Geographic|access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there are several thick window wells extending through the marble sheath, from the interior to the exterior that are not marble clad. They appear to reveal an underlying limestone rock, which may be part of the original [[Rock-cut architecture|living rock]] of the tomb.

===Damage and destruction (614–1009)===
This building was damaged by fire in May of 614 when the [[Sassanid Empire]], under [[Khosrau II]], invaded Jerusalem and captured the [[True Cross]]. In 630, the Emperor [[Heraclius]] restored it and rebuilt the church after recapturing the city. After Jerusalem came under Arab rule, it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites. A story reports that the [[Umar|Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab]] visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony; but at the time of prayer, he turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius added that Umar wrote a decree prohibiting Muslims from praying at this location. The building suffered severe damage due to an earthquake in 746.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sepulchrum Domini Through the Ages: Its Form and Function|last=Kroesen|first=Justin|publisher=Leuven|year=2000|isbn=9789042909526|location=|pages=11|quote=|via=WorldCat, Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. The damage was repaired in 810 by [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch Thomas]]. In the year 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent to the Church. In 938, a new fire damaged the inside of the basilica and came close to the rotunda. In 966, due to a defeat of Muslim armies in the region of Syria, a riot broke out, which was followed by reprisals. The basilica was burned again. The doors and roof were burnt, and the Patriarch [[John VII of Jerusalem|John VII]] was murdered.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On 18 October 1009, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] ordered the complete destruction of the church as part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adémar de Chabannes]] recorded that the church of Saint George at [[Lod|Lydda]] 'with many other churches of the saints' had been attacked, and the 'basilica of the Lord's Sepulchre destroyed down to the ground'. ...The Christian writer Yahya ibn Sa'id reported that everything was razed 'except those parts which were impossible to destroy or would have been too difficult to carry away'." {{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage was extensive, with few parts of the early church remaining.&lt;ref name="Morris 2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Europe reacted with shock and expulsions of Jews (for example, [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[monk]] [[Rodulfus Glaber]] blamed the [[Jews]], with the result that Jews were expelled from [[Limoges]] and other French towns{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}) and an impetus to later [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DISK1e7JXA8C&amp;q=crusades#v=snippet&amp;q=crusades&amp;f=false |last=Bokenkotter |first=Thomas |year=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |page= 155| isbn=0-385-50584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yaU-cpc8sWgC&amp;pg=PT1339&amp;lpg=PT1339&amp;dq=diarmaid+macculloch+church+of+the+holy+sepulchre+crusade#v=snippet&amp;q=%22church%20of%20the%20holy%20sepulchre%22&amp;f=false|title=A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years|last=MacCulloch|first=Diarmaid|date=2009-09-24|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141957951|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy Sepulchre IMG 0451.jpg|thumb|View of Holy Sepulchre courtyard also showing the [[Immovable Ladder]]]]
In wide-ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1027–28, an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] (Al-Hakim's son) agreed to allow the rebuilding and redecoration of the Church.&lt;ref name="Lev 1991"&gt;{{cite book| last=Lev| first=Yaacov| title=State and Society in Fatimid Egypt| page=40 |publisher=E.J.

In addition, the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by Al-Hakim and the re-establishment of a [[Patriarch]] in Jerusalem. Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made.&lt;ref name="Lev 1991"/&gt; Despite the Byzantines spending vast sums on the project, "a total replacement was far beyond available resources.

===Crusader period (1099–1244)===
[[File:GA Ordre du Saint-Sépulcre.svg|left|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]

Many historians maintain that the main concern of [[Pope Urban II]], when calling for the [[First Crusade]], was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of [[Asia Minor]] in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on 15 July 1099.&lt;ref name="Morris 2005"/&gt;
 [[File:Prise de Jérusalem par les Croisés, le 15 juillet 1099 Emil Signol, Musée du Château Versailles.JPG|thumb|right|Painting by [[Émile Signol]] (1804–1892) of the capture of [[Jerusalem]] by the [[Crusaders]] on 15 July 1099&lt;br /&gt;1. The Holy Sepulchre&lt;br /&gt; 2. The [[Dome of the Rock]]&lt;br /&gt; 3. Ramparts]]
The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use [[List of kings of Jerusalem|the title "king"]] during his lifetime, and declared himself "Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri" ("Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre"). By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been the location where Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; although the cistern later became the "Chapel of the Invention of the Cross," there is no evidence of the rumour before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th century repairs by Monomachos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|Crusader [[graffiti]] in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]

According to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the "ancient [[Georgians]]" and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Venetian Adventurer: The Life and Times of Marco Polo, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William of Tyre]], chronicler of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style and added a bell tower.&lt;ref name="Savage37"&gt;''Pilgrimages and Pilgrim shrines in Palestine and Syria after 1095'', Henry L. Savage, ''A History of the Crusades: The Art and Architecture of the Crusader States'', Volume IV, ed. Kenneth M. Setton and Harry W. Hazard, (University of Wisconsin Press, 1977), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchs]], and was also the site of the kingdom's [[scriptorium]]. The church was lost to [[Saladin]],&lt;ref name="Savage37" /&gt; along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the [[Third Crusade]] allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, with the curious consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under [[interdict]]. The church seems to have been largely in Greek Orthodox Patriarch [[Athanasius II of Jerusalem]]'s hands, c. 1231–47, during the Latin control of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pringle|first=Denys |title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 3, The City of Jerusalem: A Corpus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0jH6VPi4-gC&amp;pg=PA31|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39038-5|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both city and church were captured by the [[Khwarezm]]ians in 1244.&lt;ref name="Savage37" /&gt;

Sometime in the fourteenth century, a marble sheath was placed to envelop the remains of Christ's tomb, probably to prevent pilgrims from laying their hands on the original rock or taking small pieces as souvenirs.&lt;ref name=natburial/&gt;

===Ottoman and later periods===
[[File:Plan of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and adjacent structures in Jerusalem - Chrysanthus of Bursa - 1807.jpg|thumb|Top view of the church and surrounding areas, detailed descriptions in Greek, 1807]]
[[File:ChurchOfTheHolySepulcher1885.png|thumb|Church of the Holy Sepulchre (1885). Its appearance has essentially not changed since the 12th century.]]

The [[Franciscan]] friars renovated it further in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an ante-chamber.&lt;ref name="Murphy56"/&gt; After the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable "[[firman (decree)|firman]]" from the "[[Sublime Porte]]" at a particular time, often through outright bribery, and violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was discussed at the negotiations to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.&lt;ref name="Mailáth"&gt;{{cite book| title=Geschichte der europäischen Staaten, Geschichte des östreichischen Kaiserstaates| url=https://books.google.com/?id=_0MJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| first=János Nepomuk Jozsef| last=Mailáth| volume=4| page=262| publisher=F. Perthes| location=Hamburg| year=1848|trans-title=History of the European states, history of Austrian Imperial State}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, weary of the squabbling, the "Porte" issued a "firman" that divided the church among the claimants.

A fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Aedicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Aedicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809–1810 by architect Nikolaos Ch. Komnenos of [[Mytilene]] in the then current [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Baroque]] style. The fire did not reach the interior of the Aedicule, and the marble decoration of the Tomb dates mainly to the 1555 restoration, although the interior of the ante-chamber, now known as the "Chapel of the Angel," was partly rebuilt to a square ground-plan, in place of the previously semi-circular western end. Another [[firman (decree)|decree]] in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and set a "[[Status quo (Holy Land sites)|status quo]]" for arrangements to "remain forever," causing differences of opinion about upkeep and even minor changes,&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtml |title=The Church of the Holy Sepulchre: A Work in Progress |work=The Bible and Interpretation |date=May 2009 |first=Raymond |last=Cohen |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including disagreement on the removal of the "[[Immovable Ladder]]", an exterior ladder under one of the windows; this ladder has remained in the same position since then.

[[File:Floorplan of the CotHS.JPG|thumb|right|The church after its 1808 restoration]]
The cladding of red marble applied to the Aedicule by Komnenos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since 1947 it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British authorities]]. A careful renovation is undergoing, funded by a $4 million gift from [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] of [[Jordan]] and a $1.3-million gift from Mica Ertegun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-tomb-opened-church-holy-sepulchre/|work=National Geographic|title=Exclusive: Christ's Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries|first=Kristin|last=Romey|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current dome dates from 1870, although it was restored between 1994–1997, as part of extensive modern renovations to the church which have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white ''[[meleke]]'' [[limestone]] was struck.&lt;ref name="Hesemann170"&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael| last=Hesemann| title=Die Jesus-Tafel| publisher=Freiburg| year=1999| page=170| isbn=3-451-27092-7| language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east of the ''Chapel of Saint Helena'', the excavators discovered a void containing a 2nd-century drawing of a Roman ship, two low walls which supported the platform of Hadrian's 2nd-century temple, and a higher 4th-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica.&lt;ref name="Murphy56"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Jerome Murphy-O'Connor| first=Jerome| last=Murphy-O'Connor| title=The Holy Land| url=http://libro.eb20.net/Reader/rdr.aspx?b=415896| date=February 1998| pages=56, 59| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0191528675| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lancaster |first=James E. |title=Finding the Keys to the Chapel of St. Vartan |url=http://coastdaylight.com/stvartan.html|work=Jim Lancaster's Web Space| accessdate=2 March 2012| year=1998| quote=the height difference can be easily seen; the yellowish wall on the left is the 4th century wall, the pinkish wall on the right is the 2nd century wall.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the [[Chapel of Saint Vartan]], and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new Chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the ''Chapel of Saint Helena''.&lt;ref name="lancaster"/&gt;

In 2016, restoration works were performed in the Aedicule.

By the night of 28 October, the original limestone burial bed was revealed intact. This suggested that the tomb location has not changed through time and confirmed the existence of the original limestone cave walls within the Aedicule.  The tomb was resealed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;

==Description==
===Parvis (courtyard)===
The courtyard facing the entrance to the church is known as the [[parvis]].

Located around the parvis are a few smaller structures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

South of the parvis, opposite the church:
* Broken columns—once forming part of an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]—stand opposite the church, at the top of a short descending staircase stretching over the entire breadth of the parvis. In the 13th century, the tops of the columns were removed and sent to Mecca by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmids]].
* The Gethsemane [[Metochion]], a small Greek Orthodox monastery.

On the eastern side of the parvis, south to north:
* The Monastery of St Abraham (Greek Orthodox)
* The Chapel of St John (Armenian Orthodox)
* The Chapel of St Michael (Coptic/[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]]), giving access to the roof of the Chapel of St Helen and the Ethiopian monastery.
North of the parvis, in front of the church façade or against it:
* Chapel of the Franks—a blue-domed [[Roman Catholic]] Crusader chapel dedicated to [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], which once provided exclusive access to Calvary. The chapel marks the 10th Station of the Cross (the stripping of Jesus' garments).
* A [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] and chapel, directly beneath the Chapel of the Franks, dedicated to St. [[Mary of Egypt]].
* The tomb of [[Philip d'Aubigny]] (Phillipe Daubeney, d. 1236)—a knight, tutor, and royal councilor to [[King Henry III of England]] and signer of the [[Magna Carta]]—is placed in front of, and between, the two original entrance doors of the church, of which the eastern one is walled-up. It is one of the few tombs of crusaders and other Europeans not removed from the Church after the Muslim recapture of Jerusalem in the 12th century. A stone marker was placed on his tomb in 1925, sheltered by a wooden trapdoor which hides it from view.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A group of three chapels is bordering the parvis on its west side. They originally formed the [[baptistery]] complex of the Constantinian church. The southernmost chapel was the vestibule, the middle chapel the actual [[baptistery]], and the north chapel the chamber in which the patriarch [[chrism]]ated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Now they are dedicated as (from south to north)
* The Chapel of [[St. James the Just]] (Greek Orthodox),
* The Chapel of [[St. John the Baptist]] (Greek Orthodox),
* The Chapel of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]] (Greek Orthodox; at the base of the bell tower).

===Bell tower===
The church's [[bell tower]] is located to the left of the façade. It is currently almost half its original size.&lt;ref name=custodia&gt;{{cite web| title=Parvis and Entry| url=http://www.sepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4100| publisher=Gerusalemme San Salvatore Convento Francescano St. Saviour's Monastery| accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Façade and entrance===
{{see also|Immovable Ladder}}
The entrance to the church, a single door in the south [[transept]]—through the crusader [[façade]]—is found past a group of streets winding through the outer [[Via Dolorosa]], by way of a local [[souq]] in the [[Muristan]]. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news| title=Trouble in a holy place| url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-06-28/news/9906280038_1_holy-sepulcher-control-the-church-church-representatives | last=LoLordo| first=Ann| work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]| date=28 June 1999| accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Immovable Ladder]]", in its latest incarnation, stands beneath a window on the façade.

Historically, two large, arched doors allowed access to the church. However, only the left-hand entrance is currently accessible, as the right door has long since been bricked up. These entrances are located in the [[parvis]] of a larger courtyard, or plaza.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Calvary (Golgotha)===
{{main|Calvary}}
[[File:Голгофа.jpg|thumb|The Altar of the Crucifixion]]
[[File:Golgotha Stone Chapel of Adam.jpg|thumb|The Rock of Calvary as seen in the Chapel of Adam]]
Just inside the church is a stairway climbing to [[Calvary]] (Golgotha), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The exit is via another stairway opposite the first, leading down to the [[ambulatory]]. The Golgotha and its chapels are just south of the main altar of the Catholicon.

On the ground floor, underneath the Golgotha chapel proper, are the Chapel of Adam and the Treasury of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, holding many relics including an alleged fragment of the Holy Cross.

The raised Chapel of the Calvary, or Golgotha Chapel, contains the apex of the Rock of Calvary (12th Station of the Cross). It is split into two halves, one Greek Orthodox and one Catholic, each one with its own altar. The northern half with the main altar belongs to the Greek Orthodox. The rock can be seen under glass on both sides of the altar, and beneath the altar there is a hole in the rock, said to be the place where the cross was raised. Due to the significance of this, it is the most visited site in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre along with the Tomb of Jesus. The Roman Catholic ([[Franciscan]]) Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross (11th Station of the Cross) stretches south of it. Between the Catholic and the Orthodox altar, there is a statue of Mary, believed by some to be miraculous. It marks the 13th Station of the Cross, where Jesus' body was removed from the cross and given to his family and disciples.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Beneath the Calvary and the two chapels there, on the main floor, there is the Chapel of Adam. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. According to some, at the crucifixion, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill the skull of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Cook of State University of New York, lecture series&lt;/ref&gt; The Rock of Calvary appears cracked through a window on the altar wall, with the crack traditionally claimed to be caused by the earthquake that occurred when Jesus died on the cross, while some scholars claim it to be the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.&lt;ref name=Patriarchate&gt;{{cite web |title=The Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulcher |accessdate=2014-09-19 |url= http://monastery.org/sephist.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524035048/http://monastery.org/sephist.html |archivedate=24 May 2008 |publisher= Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone of Anointing===
Just inside the entrance to the church is the Stone of Anointing (also Stone of the Anointing or Stone of Unction), which tradition believes to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. However, this tradition is only attested since the crusader era (notably by the Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] pilgrim [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] in 1288), and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Murphy56"/&gt;

The wall behind the stone is defined by its striking blue balconies and [[tau cross]]-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]]), and is decorated with lamps. The modern three-part mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus' body, preceded on the right by the [[Descent from the Cross]], and succeeded on the left by the [[Burial of Jesus]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The wall was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks the view of the rotunda, separates the entrance from the Catholicon, sits on top of the now-empty and desecrated graves of four 12th-century crusader kings—including [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]]—and is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is to be seen as [[Stations of the Cross|the 13th Station of the Cross]], which others identify as the [[Descent from the Cross|lowering of Jesus from the cross]] and locate between the 11th and 12th stations on Calvary.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, [[Copts]], Greeks and [[Western Christianity|Latins]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Immediately to the left of the entrance is a bench that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring. To the right of the entrance is a wall along the ambulatory containing, to the very right, the staircase leading to Golgotha. Further along the same wall is the entrance to the Chapel of Adam.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Rotunda and Aedicule===
[[File:Aedicule which supposedly encloses the tomb of Jesus-LR1.jpg|thumb|right|The Aedicule]]
The [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]] is located in the centre of the Anastasis, beneath the larger of the church's two domes. In the center of the Rotunda is the chapel called the [[Aedicule]], which contains the Holy Sepulchre itself. The Aedicule has two rooms, the first holding the Angel's Stone, which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second is the tomb itself. Possibly due to the fact that pilgrims laid their hands on the tomb or to prevent eager pilgrims from removing bits of the original rock as souvenirs, a marble plaque was placed in the fourteenth century on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-christ-tomb-burial-church-holy-sepulchre/| title=Jesus' Burial Tomb Uncovered: Here's What Scientists Saw Inside| date=31 October 2016| last=Romey| first=Kristin| work=National Geographic| access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ''status quo'', the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the [[Holy Saturday]] ceremony of the [[Holy Fire]] led by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch (with the participation of the Coptic and Armenian patriarchs).&lt;ref name=holyfire&gt;{{cite web| title=Miracle of Holy Fire which happens every year| url=http://www.holyfire.org/eng/index.htm| work=Holyfire.org| accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To its rear, in a chapel constructed of iron [[latticework]] upon a stone base semicircular in plan, lies the altar used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Historically, the [[Georgian Orthodox|Georgians]] also retained the key to the Aedicule.&lt;ref name=Janin&gt;{{cite book| last=Janin| first=Raymond| year=1913| page=35| url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mu4MAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=35| title=Échos d'Orient| volume=16| publisher=Institut français d'études byzantines|trans-title=Echos of the Orient}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Desandoli&gt;{{cite book| last=DeSandoli| first=Sabino| title=The Church of Holy Sepulchre: Keys, Doors, Doorkeepers| year=1986| publisher=Franciscian Press| page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Brief Description of the Holy Sepulchre Jerusalem and Other Christian Churches in the Holy City: With Some Account of the Medieval Copies of the Holy Sepulchre Surviving in Europe| url=https://www.amazon.com/description-Sepulchre-Jerusalem-Christian-mediaeval-ebook/dp/B00KVNHI6A| first=George| last=Jeffery| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1919| page=69| accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2016 to March 2017, the Aedicule underwent restoration and repairs after the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] declared the structure unsafe. Much of the $3 million project was funded by the [[World Monuments Fund]].&lt;ref name="2017restoration"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Goldman| first1=Russell| title=Tomb of Jesus Reopens to Public After $3 Million Restoration| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/world/middleeast/tomb-of-jesus-reopens-jerusalem.html| newspaper=The New York Times| date=22 March 2017| accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West of the Aedicule, to the rear of the Rotunda, is a chapel (see "[[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea|Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea]]") located in a Constantinian apse and containing an opening to a rock-cut ancient Jewish tomb. This chapel is where the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays.

To the right of the Sepulchre on the northwestern edge of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use (see "[[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Franciscan area north of the Aedicule|Franciscan area north of the Aedicule]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seetheholyland.net/tag/chapel-of-the-apparition/| title=Catholic Chapel of the Apparition| publisher=See The Holy Land.net| access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Catholicon''' – On the east side opposite the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today ''the Greek Orthodox [[Katholikon|catholicon]]''. The second, smaller dome sits directly over the centre of the [[crossing (architecture)|transept crossing]] of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] where the ''compas'', an [[omphalos]] once thought to be the center of the world (associated to the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.&lt;ref name=hammers&gt;{{cite web| title=The Cross of Golgotha| url=http://www.michaelhammers.com/en/projects/golgotha-cross-holy-sepulcher-jerusalem| publisher=Michael Hammers| date=24 June 2014| accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East of this is a large [[iconostasis]] demarcating the Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the throne of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] on the south side facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox [[Patriarch of Antioch]] on the north side. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| title=Bedlam.

===Ambulatory===
[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-08-Prison of Christ.jpg|thumb|The "Holy Prison", or Prison of Christ]]
* '''Prison of Christ''' – In the north-east side of the complex there is The Prison of Christ, alleged by the Franciscans to be where Jesus was held. The Greek Orthodox allege that the real place that Jesus was held was the similarly named Prison of Christ, in their Monastery of the Praetorium, located near the [[Ecce Homo (church)|Church of Ecce Homo]], between the Second and Third Stations of the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The Armenians regard a recess in the Monastery of the Flagellation at the Second Station of the Via Dolorosa, as the Prison of Christ. A cistern among the ruins beneath the [[Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu]] on Mount Zion is also alleged to have been the Prison of Christ. To reconcile the traditions, some allege that Jesus was held in the Mount Zion cell in connection with his trial by the Jewish [[High Priest]], at the Praetorium in connection with his trial by the Roman governor Pilate, and near the Golgotha before crucifixion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Further to the east in the ambulatory are three chapels (from south to north):{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}
* '''Greek Chapel of Saint Longinus''' – The Orthodox Greek chapel is dedicated to [[Saint Longinus]].
* '''Armenian Chapel of Division of Robes'''
* '''Greek Chapel of the Derision''' – the southernmost chapel in the ambulatory.

===Chapel of Saint Helena===
[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-07-St Helen Chapel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem]], called by the Armenians "St. Gregory the Illuminator"]]
* [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]] – between the first two chapels are stairs descending to the Chapel of Saint Helena.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}
* Chapel of Vartan (or Vardan) Mamikonian – on the north side of the Chapel of Saint Helena is an ornate [[wrought iron]] door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the [[quarry]], and which leads to the Chapel of [[St. Vartan|Saint Vartan]]. The latter chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are open only on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.holysepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4119|title=Chapel of St. Helena|website=www.holysepulchre.custodia.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapel of the [[Invention of the Holy Cross]] – another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of Saint Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross, believed to be the place where the [[True Cross]] was found.

===Franciscan area north of the Aedicule===
* The Franciscan Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene – The chapel indicates the place where [[Mary Magdalene]] met Jesus after his resurrection.&lt;ref name="fran"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Franciscans at the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspfran.html|publisher=The Franciscans of the Holy Land |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Franciscan Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament (or Chapel of the Apparition) – in memory of Jesus' meeting with his mother after the Resurrection.&lt;ref name="fran"/&gt;

===Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea===
* The [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] Chapel of [[Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Saint Nicodemus]]. On Sundays and feast days it is furnished for the celebration of Mass.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It is accessed from the Rotunda, by a door west of the Aedicule. On the far side of the chapel is the low entrance to an almost complete 1st-century Jewish tomb, initially holding six ''[[Rock-cut tomb#Kokh|kokh]]''-type funeral shafts radiating from a central chamber, of which two are still exposed. Although this space was discovered recently{{when|date=July 2012}} and contains no identifying marks, many Christians believe{{vague|date=July 2012}} that Saints Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were buried here.

Since Jews always buried their dead outside the city, the presence of this tomb proves that the Holy Sepulchre site was outside the city walls at the time of the crucifixion.

===Armenian monastery south of the Aedicule===
South of the Aedicule is the "Place of the Three Marys", marked by a stone canopy and a large modern wall mosaic. From here one can enter the Armenian monastery which stretches over the ground and first upper floor of the church's southeastern part.

==Status quo==
[[File:Immovable Ladder CotHS.jpg|thumb|right|The "[[Immovable Ladder]]". Detail from photograph of main entrance above the façade.]]

The Sultan's firman (decree) of 1853, known as the "[[Status quo of Holy Land sites|status quo]]", pinned down the now permanent statutes of property and the regulations concerning the roles of the different denominations and other custodians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/80014324|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa : a historical encyclopedia|last=Michael.|first=Dumper,|last2=E.|first2=Stanley, Bruce|date=2007-01-01|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079195|oclc=80014324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary custodians are the [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Churches, with the Greek Orthodox Church having the lion's share. In the 19th century, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures in and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas.{{citation needed |date = October 2013}} The Greek Orthodox act through the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]] as well as through the [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]]. The Roman Catholics act through the [[Franciscan]] [[Custody of the Holy Land]].

The establishment of the 1853 status quo did not halt controversy and sometimes violence, which continues to break out occasionally. On a hot summer day in 2002, a [[Coptic monasticism|Coptic monk]] moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Chris|title=Christian History Corner: Divvying up the Most Sacred Place|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/julyweb-only/7-29-52.0.html|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=[[Christianity Today]]|date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1314466,00.html | work=[[The Guardian]]| location=London| title=Punch-up at tomb of Jesus| date=28 September 2004| accessdate=2014-09-19| first=Allyn| last=Fisher-Ilan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catholic monks in Jerusalem 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Franciscan]]s during the procession on The Calvary, 2006]]
On [[Palm Sunday]], in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek [[monk]] was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite news| title=Christians brawl at Jesus' tomb| url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Christians-brawl-at-Jesus-tomb-3218579.php| first=Sarah| last=El Deeb| agency=Associated Press| work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday, 9 November 2008, a clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks during celebrations for the [[Feast of the Cross]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news| title=Riot police called as monks clash in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre| work=[[The Times]]| subscription=yes| date=10 November 2008| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2099808.ece| accessdate=2014-09-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olaughlin&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/11/middleeast| date=10 November 2008| title=The monks who keep coming to blows in Jerusalem| work=The Guardian| last=O'Laughlin| first=Toni| accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance. A wooden ladder was placed there at some time before 1852, when the ''status quo'' defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. This ladder, the "Immovable Ladder", in its latest incarnation, remains to this day, in almost exactly the same position it occupied in century-old photographs and engravings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coastdaylight.com/ladder.html |title=Holy Sepulchre Ladder |publisher=Coastdaylight.com |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=herman&gt;{{cite web| quote=An unusual and rare location of the ladder was documented by an Israeli tour guide in February 2009| url=http://www.dannythedigger.com/newsletter/who-moved-thy-ladder| title=Who moved thy ladder?| publisher=Danny the Digger| accessdate=2014-09-19| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it must be replaced whenever it falls apart. An engraving by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] in 1839 also shows the same ladder in the same position.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717452/ |title=Entrance to the holy sepulchre; title page, vol. 1 |date=1842 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one controls the main entrance. In 1192, [[Saladin]] assigned door-keeping responsibilities to the Muslim [[Nusaybah clan|Nuseibeh]] family. The wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved doors.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Cook of University of New York, lecture series&lt;/ref&gt; The Joudeh Al-Goudia family were entrusted as custodian to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre by Saladin in 1187.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Jesus's tomb unveiled after $4m restoration| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/jesus-tomb-to-be-unveiled-to-public-after-4m-restoration| last=Sherwood| first=Harriet| newspaper=The Guardian| date=21 March 2017| accessdate=2 July 2018| location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite occasional disagreements, the religious services take place in the Church with regularity and coexistence is generally peaceful. An example of concord between the Church custodians is the recent (2016–17) full restoration of the Aedicule.

=== 2018 Tax/Land affair ===

In late February 2018 after a tax dispute over 152 million euros of uncollected taxes on church properties the Church had closed until further notice. The city hall stressed that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and all other churches are exempt from the taxes, with the changes only affecting establishments like "hotels, halls and businesses" owned by the churches.&lt;ref name=i24&gt;{{cite news| title=Church at Jesus's burial site closed for second day after tax dispute| url=https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/168589-180226-church-at-jesus-s-burial-site-closed-for-second-day-after-tax-dispute| date=26 February 2018| work=i24NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[NPR]] had reported that the Greek Orthodox Church calls itself the second-largest landowner in Israel, after the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Greek Orthodox Church Sells Land In Israel, Worrying Both Israelis And Palestinians| last=Estrin| first=Daniel| url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/12/02/565464499/greek-orthodox-church-sells-land-in-israel-worrying-both-israelis-and-palestinia| date=2 December 2017| work=[[Weekend Edition]]| network=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a lock in protest against an Israeli legislative proposal which would expropriate church lands that had been sold to private companies since 2010, a measure which church leaders assert constitutes a serious violation of their property rights and the status quo. In a joint official statement the church authorities protested what they considered to be the peak of a systematic campaign in
&lt;blockquote&gt;'a discriminatory and racist bill that targets solely the properties of the Christian community in the Holy Land,' adding, 'This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe.'&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lis  and  Nir Hasson,  [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/jerusalem-s-church-of-holy-sepulchre-closed-indefinitely-in-protest-of-israeli-bill-city-tax-policy-1.5847184 Jerusalem churches warn of Israel's 'systematic' erosion of Christian presence in Holy Land]  [[Haaretz]]  25  February  2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2018 Taxation affair does not cover any church buildings or religious related facilities (because they are exempt by law),&lt;ref name="Notredame"&gt;{{cite news| title=בעיריית ירושלים לא מתרגשים מהכנסייה| url=https://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/367223| trans-title=The Jerusalem Municipality is not moved by the church| last=Token| first=Benny| date=27 February 2018| work=Arutz Sheva| language=Hebrew| accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but commercial facilities such as the Notre Dame Hotel which was not paying the [[Rates (tax)#Israel|arnona tax]], and any land which is owned and used as a commercial land.&lt;ref name="Notredame"/&gt; The church hold the rights to land where private homes have been constructed, and some of the disagreement had been raised after the [[Knesset]] had proposed a bill that will make it harder for a private company not to extend a lease for land used by homeowners.&lt;ref name="jpost2"&gt;{{cite news| title=WATCH: Pilgrims Face Closed Doors at Church of the Holy Sepulchre| url=http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Pilgrims-upset-after-not-being-able-to-enter-Church-of-the-Holy-Sepulchre-543659| date=26 February 2018| agency=Reuters| accessdate=2 July 2018| newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the JPost &lt;blockquote&gt;'The stated aim of the bill is to protect homeowners against the possibility that private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their houses or apartments stand.'&lt;/blockquote&gt; The church leaders have said that such a bill will make it harder for them to sell church owned lands.&lt;ref name="jpost2"/&gt;

==Connection to temple of Venus==
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|right|Jerusalem after being rebuilt by Hadrian. Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route.]]
The site of the Church had been a temple of Venus before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had actually been located there because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (which is now the location of the (smaller) [[Muristan]]); the forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the (other) main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the ''Russian Mission in Exile'').{{cite web |url= http://www.generationword.com/jerusalem101/52-holy-sepulcher.html | title= Church of the Holy Sepulcher |website= Generation Word | access-date= 31 May 2018}}

From the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any ''tomb'' would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.&lt;ref name="Corbo"&gt;{{cite book| first=Virgilio| last=Corbo|trans-title=The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem| year=1981| title=Il Santo Sepolcro di Gerusalemme| publisher=Franciscan Press| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wYFtAAAAMAAJ| language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. [[Dan Bahat]], the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.&lt;ref name="BahatBAR"&gt;{{cite journal| first=Dan| last=Bahat| title=Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?| url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=12&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=1| work=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]| date=May–June 1986| subscription=yes| accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:JerusalemBonfils.jpg|thumb|upright|Tourists and pilgrims at one of the two access gates to the Holy Sepulchre courtyard, photo by [[Bonfils]], 1870s]]
The New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall,&lt;ref&gt;for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Jocelyn M. C. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rHd1MDlV-eUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Funerary+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=mfHeS-XqKYniywT0nb3_CA&amp;cd=21#v=onepage&amp;q=Funerary%20art&amp;f=false Death and Burial in the Roman World]'', pp. 48–49, JHU Press. 1996. {{ISBN|0-8018-5507-1}}. An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the site of the Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It has been well documented by archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the east of the current site of the Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since [[Herod Agrippa]] (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry and outside the city during the early 1st century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trainor|first1=Terry|title=Bedlam.

The church is a part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].

The Christian Quarter and the (also Christian) Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem are both located in the northwestern and western part of the Old City, due to the fact that the Holy Sepulchre is located close to the northwestern corner of the walled city. The adjacent neighbourhood within the Christian  Quarter is called the [[Muristan]], a term derived from the Persian word for hospital—Christian pilgrim hospices have been maintained in this area near the Holy Sepulchre since at least the time of [[Charlemagne]].

==Influence==
From the 9th century, the construction of churches inspired in the Anastasis was extended across Europe.&lt;ref name="SantoStefano"&gt;[http://www.abbaziasantostefano.it/storia.htm Monastero di Santo Stefano: Basilica Santuario Santo Stefano: Storia], Bologna.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is [[Santo Stefano (Bologna)|Santo Stefano]] in [[Bologna]], Italy, an agglomeration of seven churches recreating shrines of Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

Several churches and monasteries in Europe, for instance, in Germany and Russia, and at least one church in the United States have been modeled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other [[holy places]] for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land. They include the [[:de:Heiliges Grab (Görlitz)|Heiliges Grab]] of [[Görlitz]], constructed between 1481 and 1504, the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], constructed by [[Patriarch Nikon]] between 1656 and 1666, and [[Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery]] built by the [[Franciscans]] in Washington, DC in 1898.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

'''Communalness''', as suggested by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr.]], is a level of an [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomenon which originates from [[Artificial consciousness|electronic sentience]], and represents a broader mode of thinking than just normal [[consciousness]]. While consciousness is limited to the individual, communalness describes a complex organization of numerous individuals which on a higher level is tightly connected to each other. Such an organization would maybe have the same intimate awareness of its own existence as a whole as people have consciousness of their own bodies.

'''Coop''' is a fictional character who appeared in the American television [[supernatural]] [[drama]] ''[[Charmed]]'', which aired on [[The WB|the WB Television Network]] (the WB) from 1998 to 2006. The character was created by executive producer [[Brad Kern]] and was portrayed by [[Victor Webster]]. Coop is depicted as a Cupid, a magical being associated with love, who is over two centuries old. He appeared in the last seven episodes of the final season of ''Charmed'', and appears in [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] works from the [[expanded universe]] material, such as the series' [[Charmed (comics)|comic book adaptation]].

== Fictional character background ==

===Television===
{{Main|List of Charmed episodes}}
Cupids are a race of magical beings associated with [[love]].&lt;ref name="Episode 32"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Heartbreak City|title=Heartbreak City|series=Charmed|serieslink=Charmed|airdate=2000-01-20|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coop was sent by the [[Elders (Charmed)|Elders]] to help [[Phoebe Halliwell|Phoebe]] with her love life.&lt;ref name="Episode 172"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Engaged and Confused|title=Engaged and Confused|series=Charmed|serieslink=Charmed|airdate=2006-02-26|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave her advice, and took her to the past to see her past loves ([[Cole Turner]], Dex Lawson, etc.), allowing her to love again.&lt;ref name="Episode 173"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Generation Hex (Charmed)|title=Generation Hex (Charmed)|series=Charmed|serieslink=Charmed|airdate=2006-04-16|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the series, they fall in love (Coop falls first and Phoebe falls for Michael, whom Coop was manipulating Phoebe to love), although it was forbidden for a Cupid to fall in love with a human, similar to how it was forbidden for [[Whitelighter]]s to date, marry, or have children with their charges. Only later in the series does Phoebe begin to admit her feelings for Coop.

In the show's finale, the future adult Wyatt exclaims "Uncle Coop!" upon seeing him, which accidentally lets slip that Coop is Phoebe's husband and thus his and Chris' uncle. While Chris immediately hits Wyatt to hush him up since he has revealed the unknown future, Phoebe seems freaked out at this idea, since she knows about the forbidden nature of this romance. After he tries to talk to her and reassure her to no avail, he finds himself attacked by [[Billie Jenkins|Billie]]'s manipulative demon friend Dumain for his ring's time travel ability. Also in the finale, Piper uses his ring to travel through time to save Phoebe and Paige.

When Phoebe's calls for him fail, Wyatt and Chris reveal that their love is given a blessing (and was the main underlying reason he was actually sent down) by the Elders to make up for all the events they put her through as a Charmed One. In the exact words of Wyatt, "It wasn't, and it will not be, a forbidden love." In addition to that, she was able to bring him to her by simply thinking of him due to their connection. The Charmed Ones are able to use Billie's Projection power to travel back in time, and after they vanquish the Triad and Piper vanquishes Dumain, Paige retrieves his ring from Christy and Piper gives it back to him upon their return to the present.

The same episode, which depicts the futures of the Charmed Ones, shows their wedding and the three daughters they eventually have.&lt;ref name="Episode 178"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Forever Charmed|title=Forever Charmed|series=Charmed|serieslink=Charmed|airdate=2006-05-21|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season 3, Phoebe is told that an apple peel in water will take the form of the first letter of the name of her true love. It is a "C," which at that time was meant to imply [[Cole Turner|Cole]]. This prediction does come to pass though, as Coop is revealed to be her true love.&lt;ref name="Episode 48"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=All Halliwell's Eve|title=All Halliwell's Eve|series=Charmed|serieslink=Charmed|airdate=2000-10-26|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also noteworthy is the fact that Phoebe became briefly infatuated with the unnamed Cupid that the sisters aided in the Season 2 episode, "Heartbreak City".  The Cupid in that episode also told Phoebe that her heart was closed to the men in her life, and that she was falling for him because she loved the idea of love.

===Literature===
In 2010, ''Charmed'' gained an officially licensed continuation in the form of a [[Charmed (comics)|comic book]], which is often billed as ''[[Charmed: Season 9]]''.  The series is published monthly by Zenescope Entertainment. Set eighteen months after [[Forever Charmed|the series finale]], Coop is seen living a happy, demon-free life with his wife Phoebe and their first daughter,&lt;ref name="Issue 1 Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reisinger|first=Adam|title=Charmed Comic Review, Issue #1|url=http://www.adamreisinger.com/2010/07/charmed-comic-review-issue-1.html|work=adamreisinger.com/|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is named Prudence Johnna Halliwell and nicknamed P.J. by Grams.&lt;ref name="Issue 5 Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reisinger|first=Adam|title=Charmed Comic Review, Issue #5: Unnatural Resources|url=http://www.adamreisinger.com/2011/01/charmed-comic-review-issue-5-unnatural.html|work=adamreisinger.com/|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th issue of the comic, ''Cupid's Harrow'', after he expressed grief over the fact that he never got to know his family, Phoebe arranged for him to meet his distant relatives, the Coopersmiths. In Issue #20 of the comic, ''The Old Witchero'', Coop and Phoebe welcomed their second daughter, Parker Halliwell.

== Characterization ==
Actor Victor Webster has said of his character, "I think he just loves life, he loves love. I think he's very charming and easy-going and lighthearted. I think he just generally enjoys being around people and really helping people." He says he was chosen for the part because he displays many of those traits himself.&lt;ref name=CharmedMag12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldon|first=Dave|date=Sep–Oct 2006|title=I'm With Cupid|journal=[[Charmed Magazine]]|issue=12|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also claimed that playing "the perfect guy" was something of a struggle, "Coop is extremely confident. He knows all about love and relationships, and the problem with a guy who's so sure of himself is that you can play him very cocky and arrogant, and that can be somewhat off-putting." The actor explains that falling in love takes a great deal of humility, and that required him to bring a self-deprecating quality to his performance: "you learn about your faults and how to overcome them if the relationship means that much to you."&lt;ref name=CupidsArrow&gt;{{cite web|last=Eramo|first=Steven|url=http://www.visimag.com/xpose/x98_feat01.htm|title=Cupid's Arrow|accessdate=2009-01-06|publisher=Visimag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Webster has admitted that his biggest fear in playing the role of Cupid was the chance that he would have to wear [[diaper]]s, and has joked, “If that was the case, then I was going to ask for at least one million dollars per episode!”&lt;ref name=CupidsArrow/&gt; One of his first questions before accepting the part was, "Am I going to be naked the whole time?"&lt;ref name=CharmedMag12/&gt; When asked if he would be wearing Cupid's iconic diaper and [[wing]]s, Webster quipped, "Big safety pins down the side," before explaining that he would in fact be "dressed very dapper – suits, button-down shirts, sports coats."

Discussing the challenges of playing a mythological character, the actor says that his approach was to make Coop a "real person". He explains, "If you get into the mythological character and you start playing it otherworldly, it just comes off weird. I think he would just be a regular guy. He'd be very charming. He'd be very confident. Let's say he wasn't Cupid, let's say he's a master of love, what would he have? That's how I start looking at it. I think he'd have a great sense of humor, sense of style. He can probably dance and cook and tell good jokes, be a lot of fun, have a lot of positive energy, want to lift you up. Obviously he would take great care of himself. He would look immaculate the whole time."&lt;ref name=LovesCupid&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hare|first=Kate|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-victorwebstercharmed,0,2910370.story|title=Webster Loves Being 'Cupid' on 'Charmed'|accessdate=2009-01-16|publisher=ZAP2it.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==
All of Coop's powers, with the exception of [[telekinesis]], [[immortality]], [[Teleportation|beaming]], [[extra-sensory perception|sensing]], and [[Healing factor|regeneration]], were shown to derive from his ring. However, in earlier seasons, cupids did require their rings to teleport. Coop has used these additional powers via his ring:
*Stopping time (only applies to charges) - Coop has the ability to slow down time to the degree that they appear to be frozen in time, while causing that being and even others to be at normal speed, as well, for an indefinite period.
*Suggestion - Coop can slip into people's hearts and minds and implant thoughts. He mainly uses this power to set people on the path to love by making them realize their true feelings for another.
*[[Time travel]] - Coop can travel through time, but doesn't (or is not allowed to) manipulate the past. Coop used this power to take Phoebe back in time to some of her past loves. Anyone who has the ring is able to access this power at least as shown by Piper Halliwell and Christy Jenkins.
*[[Holograms]] - Coop also has the ability to project light- and energy-based images of all shapes and sizes for a variety of effects and reasons. He used it to show Phoebe another part of her past.
*Reality warping (on a limited scale) - Coop has used this power to see how blocked Phoebe's heart really was and unblocked it, to insert Paige into Henry's body, and to absorb the soul of a deceased child into his ring and transport the child to Cupid's Temple.

Besides his ring, Coop also owns a Cupid's Bow, which was introduced in Issue #11 of the comic, ''Last Witch Effort''.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
'''Cosmic pluralism''', the '''plurality of worlds''', or simply '''pluralism''', describes the philosophical belief in numerous "[[world]]s" ([[planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s or [[natural satellite]]s) in addition to [[Earth]] (possibly an infinite number), which may harbour [[extraterrestrial life]].

The debate over pluralism began as early as the time of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 – c. 546 BC) as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical argument]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5–9&lt;/ref&gt; long predating the scientific [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican conception]] that the Earth is one of numerous [[planet]]s. It has continued, in a variety of forms, until the modern era.

==Ancient Greek debates==
In [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the debate was largely philosophical and did not conform to present notions of [[cosmology]]. Cosmic pluralism was a corollary to notions of infinity and the purported multitude of life-bearing worlds were more akin to parallel universes (either contemporaneously in space or infinitely recurring in time) than to different solar systems. After [[Anaximander]] opened the door to an infinite universe, a strong pluralist stance was adopted by the [[atomists]], notably [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Epicurus]]. While these were prominent thinkers, their opponents—[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]—had greater effect. They argued that the Earth is unique and that there can be no other systems of worlds.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;

==Medieval Islamic thought==
Many medieval Muslim scholars endorsed the idea of cosmic pluralism. Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]  (676–733) wrote "Maybe you see that God created only this single world and that God did not create humans besides you. Well, I swear by God that God created thousands and thousands of worlds and
thousands and thousands of humankind."&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

[[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] (1149–1209), in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world in his Matalib, rejects the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] notion of the Earth's centrality within the universe. Instead he argues that there are "a thousand thousand worlds (alfa alfi 'awalim) beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has."&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; To support his theological argument, he cites the [[Qur'an]]ic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds," in surah [[fatiha]] emphasizing the term "Worlds."

Two Qur'anic verses support the idea of God being Lord of multiple worlds: 1:2 and 41:09. Qur'an 16:8 says "He has created other things of which ye have no knowledge."&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

Cosmic pluralism was depicted in fictional [[Arabic literature]]. "[[The Adventures of Bulukiya]]", a tale from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), depicted a [[cosmos]] consisting of different worlds, some larger than Earth and each with their own inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholastic thinkers==
Eventually the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian system was challenged and pluralism reasserted, first tentatively by [[scholastics]] and then more seriously by followers of [[Copernicus]]. The [[telescope]] appeared to prove that a multitude of life was reasonable and an expression of God's creative omnipotence; still powerful theological opponents, meanwhile, continued to insist that although the Earth may have been displaced from the center of the cosmos, it was still the unique focus of God's creation. Thinkers such as [[Johannes Kepler]] were willing to admit the possibility of pluralism without truly supporting it.

==Renaissance==
[[Giordano Bruno]] introduced in his works the idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One. Bruno (from the mouth of his character Philotheo) in his ''De l'infinito universo et mondi'' (1584) claims that "innumerable celestial bodies, stars, globes, suns and earths may be sensibly perceived therein by us and an infinite number of them may be inferred by our own reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Teaching this was among the charges the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]] made against him.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Firpo, Il processo di Giordano Bruno, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment==
During the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the later [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream possibility. [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]'' (''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds'') of 1686 was an important work from this period, speculating on pluralism and describing the new Copernican cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/2529.html Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]— Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], astronomers such as [[William Herschel]] and even politicians, including [[John Adams]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. As greater [[scientific skepticism]] and rigour were applied to the question it ceased to be simply a matter of philosophy and theology and was properly bounded by astronomy and biology.

The French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] was one of the chief proponents of cosmic pluralism during the latter half of the nineteenth century. His first book, ''La pluralité des mondes habités'' (1862) was a great popular success, going through 33 editions in its first twenty years. Flammarion was one of the first people to put forward the idea that extraterrestrial beings were genuinely alien, and not simply variations of earthly creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925)]— The Internet Encyclopedia of Science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern thought==
In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the term "cosmic pluralism" became largely archaic as knowledge diversified and the speculation on extraterrestrial life focused on particular bodies and observations. The historic debate continues to have modern parallels, however. [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], for instance, could well be considered "pluralists" while proponents of the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]] are modern skeptics.

Modern Islamic scholars like [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] point to the Qur'an (42:29) to argue for life on other planets: "And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them". The verses uses the word ''da’bbah'', which denotes living creatures on the surface of a planet.&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

'''Cynthia Jane Kenyon''' (February 21, 1954) is an [[United States|American]] [[molecular biologist]] and [[biogerontologist]] known for her genetic dissection of [[aging]] in a widely used [[model organism]], the roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and professor at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] ([[UCSF]]).

==Career==
Cynthia Kenyon graduated valedictorian in chemistry and biochemistry from the [[University of Georgia]] in 1976. She received her PhD in 1981 from [[MIT]] where, in Graham Walker's laboratory, she looked for genes on the basis of their activity profiles, discovering that [[DNA]]-damaging agents activate a battery of [[DNA repair]] genes in [[E. coli]]. She then did postdoctoral studies with Nobel laureate [[Sydney Brenner]] at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in [[Cambridge]], England, studying the development of ''C. elegans.''

Since 1986 she has been at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF), where she was the [[Herbert Boyer]] Distinguished Professor of [[Biochemistry]] and [[Biophysics]] and is now an [[American Cancer Society]] Professor.   In 1999 she co-founded [[Elixir Pharmaceuticals]] with [[Leonard Guarente]] to try to discover and develop drugs that would slow down the process that makes people age.&lt;ref name=MIT/&gt;

In April 2014, Kenyon was named Vice President of Aging Research at [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company focused on health, well-being, and longevity. Prior to that, she served as a part-time advisor beginning in November 2013. Kenyon will remain affiliated with UCSF as an emeritus professor.

Her early work led to the discovery that [[Hox gene]]s, which were known to pattern the body segments of the fruit fly (''Drosophila'') also pattern the body of ''C. elegans''. These findings demonstrated that Hox genes were not simply involved in segmentation, as thought, but instead were part of a much more ancient and fundamental [[metazoan]] patterning system.

Michael Klass discovered that lifespan of ''C. elegans'' could be altered by mutations, but Klass believed that the effect was due to reduced food consumption ([[caloric restriction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Klass MR | title=A method for the isolation of longevity mutants in the nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' and initial results | journal=MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT  | volume=22 | issue=3–4 | year=1983 | pages=279–286 | id= | pmid=6632998 | doi=10.1016/0047-6374(83)90082-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Johnson later showed that the 65% [[life extension]] effect was due to the mutation itself rather than due to caloric restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Friedman DB, Johnson TE | title=A mutation in the ''age-1'' gene in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' lengthens life and reduces hermaphrodite fertility | journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] | volume=118 | issue=1 | year=1988 | pages=75–86  | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/118/1/75.long | format=[[PDF]] | pmc = 1203268 | id= | pmid=8608934}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993,  Kenyon's discovery that a single-gene mutation ([[Daf-2]]) could double the lifespan of ''C. elegans'' and that this could be reversed by a second mutation in [[daf-16]]m,&lt;ref name="pmid8247153"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Kenyon C, Chang J, Gensch E, Rudner A, Tabtiang R | title=A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=366 | issue=6454 | year=1993 | pages=461–464 | pmid=8247153 | doi=10.1038/366461a0| bibcode=1993Natur.366..461K }}&lt;/ref&gt; sparked an intensive study of the molecular biology of aging, including work by [[Leonard P. Guarente|Leonard Guarente]] and [[David Andrew Sinclair|David Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan|first1=David Ewing|title=The Enthusiast|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/408433/the-enthusiast/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=August 15, 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyon's findings have led to the discovery that an evolutionarily-conserved hormone signaling system influences aging in other organisms, perhaps also including mammals.

Kenyon has received many honors, including the King Faisal Prize for Medicine, the American Association of Medical Colleges Award for Distinguished Research, the Ilse &amp; Helmut Wachter Award for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and La Fondation IPSEN Prize, for her findings. She is a member of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].  She was President of the [[Genetics Society of America]] for 2003.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.genetics-gsa.org/about/past_officers.shtml|title=Past and Present GSA Officers |publisher= GSA|accessdate= 27 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; She is also one of featured biologists in the 1995 science [[documentary]] [[Death by Design / The Life and Times of Life and Times (film)|Death by Design / The Life and Times of Life and Times]].

==Personal diet==
Kenyon's research prompted her to make personal dietary changes.

In 2000, when she discovered that putting sugar on the worms' food shortened their lifespans, she stopped eating high [[glycemic index]] carbohydrates and started eating a [[low-carbohydrate diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=B |title=In Methuselah's Mould. |journal=PLOS Biology |date=January 2004 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=E12 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020012 |pmid=14758367 |pmc=322746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kingsland |first1=James |title=I want to live forever |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18024175.300-i-want-to-live-forever.html |work=New Scientist |date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Platoni |first1=Kara |title=Live, Fast, Die Old |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/2006-01-18/news/live-fast-die-old |work=East Bay Express |date=January 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020029/http://www.eastbayexpress.com:80/2006-01-18/news/live-fast-die-old/full|archivedate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She briefly experimented with a [[calorie restriction]] diet for two days, but couldn't stand the constant hunger.&lt;ref name=newscientist1 /&gt;

'''Davros''' is a character from the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. He was created by screenwriter [[Terry Nation]], originally for the 1975 serial ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]''. Davros is a major enemy of the series' protagonist, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], and is the creator of the Doctor's deadliest enemies, the [[Dalek]]s. Davros is a genius who has mastered many areas of science, but also a [[megalomania]]c who believes that through his creations he can become the supreme being and ruler of the Universe. The character has been compared to the infamous dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] several times, including by the actor [[Terry Molloy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2005/03/15/features_davros_feature.shtml | title= Doctor Who: My life as Davros | work=BBC |accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Julian Bleach]] defined him as a cross between Hitler and the renowned scientist [[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2224999/Dr-Who-villain-Davros-a-cross-between-Stephen-Hawking-and-Hitler.html | title= Dr Who villain Davros - a cross between Stephen Hawking and Hitler | work=Telegraph Online | date=1 July 2008 | accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davros is from the planet [[Skaro]], whose people, the [[Kaled]]s, were engaged in a bitter thousand-year [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] with their enemies, the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]]. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] eye mounted on his forehead to take the place of his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile [[Life support|life-support]] chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair for more than a few minutes without dying. Davros' voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, [[staccatissimo]] speech of the Daleks.

Davros first appeared in the 1975 serial ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', written by [[Terry Nation]]. Nation, creator of the Dalek concept, had deliberately modelled elements of the Daleks' character on [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology, and conceived of their creator as a scientist with strong [[fascism|fascist]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ian Levine|Levine, Ian]] (Director) |date=10 April 2006 |title=Genesis of a Classic |medium=Documentary accompanying ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' DVD |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location= |time=13:35 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical appearance of Davros was developed by visual effects designer Peter Day and sculptor John Friedlander, who based Davros' chair on the lower half of a Dalek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ian Levine|Levine, Ian]] (Director) |date=10 April 2006 |title=Genesis of a Classic |medium=Documentary accompanying ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' DVD |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location= |time=35:00 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] told Friedlander to consider a design similar to [[the Mekon]] from the ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' comic ''[[Dan Dare]]'', with a large dome-like head and a withered body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ian Levine|Levine, Ian]] (Director); [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] (Interviewee) |date=10 April 2006 |title=Genesis of a Classic |medium=Documentary accompanying ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' DVD |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location= |time=36:00 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast in the role of Davros was [[Michael Wisher]], who had previously appeared in several different roles on ''Doctor Who'' and had provided Dalek voices in the serials ''[[Frontier in Space]]'', ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[Death to the Daleks]]''. Wisher based his performance as Davros on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Michael Wisher | title = The Making of Shakedown &amp; DreamWatch '94 Highlights | medium = [[VHS]] | publisher = Dreamwatch Media Ltd | location = [[London]] |date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prepare for filming under the heavy mask, Wisher rehearsed wearing a paper bag over his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ian Levine|Levine, Ian]] (Director) |date=10 April 2006 |title=Genesis of a Classic |medium=Documentary accompanying ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' DVD |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location= |time=43:40–47:30 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedlander's mask was cast in hard latex, with only the mouth revealing Wisher's features; make-up artist Sylvia James shaded the mask's tones and blackened Wisher's lips and teeth to hide the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ian Levine|Levine, Ian]] (Director); [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] (Interviewee) |date=10 April 2006 |title=Genesis of a Classic |medium=Documentary accompanying ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' DVD |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location= |time=37:00 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'', Davros is played by [[David Gooderson]] using the mask Friedlander made for Wisher after it was split into intersecting sections to get as good a fit as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Information text from [[Destiny of the Daleks]] DVD&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Terry Molloy]] took over the role in ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'', a new mask was designed by Stan Mitchell.

==Character history==

===Encounters with the Fourth Doctor===
[[File:Davros Wisher.png|200px|thumb|right|Michael Wisher as Davros in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]''.]]

The [[Fourth Doctor]] ([[Tom Baker]]) first encountered Davros ([[Michael Wisher]]) in ''Genesis of the Daleks'' when he and his companions were sent to Skaro to avert the creation of the Daleks. As chief scientist of the Kaleds and leader of their elite scientific division, Davros devised new military strategies in order to win his people's thousand-year war against the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]] race that also occupies Skaro. When Davros learned his people were evolving from exposure to [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[biological weapon]]s used in the war, he artificially accelerates the process to his design and stores the resulting tentacle creatures in tank-like "Mark III travel machines" partly based on the design of his wheelchair. He later names these creatures "Daleks", an [[anagram]] of Kaleds.

Davros quickly becomes obsessed with his creations, considering them to be the ultimate form of life compared to others. When other Kaleds attempted to thwart his project, Davros arranges the extinction of his own people by using the Thals, whom he mostly killed with the Daleks later. Davros then weeds out those in elite scientific division who are loyal to him so he can have the Daleks eliminate the rest. However, the Daleks ultimately turn on Davros, killing his supporters before shooting him when he tries to halt the Dalek production line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial | title = [[Genesis of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One|BBC1]] | location = London | date=8 March – 12 April 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'', it is revealed that Davros (now played by [[David Gooderson]]) was not killed, but placed in [[suspended animation]] and buried underground. The Daleks unearth their creator to help them break a [[logic]]al impasse in their war against the [[android (robot)|android]] [[Movellan]]s. However, the Dalek force is destroyed by the Doctor, and Davros is captured and imprisoned in suspended animation by the humans, before being taken to Earth to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial | title = [[Destiny of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director Ken Grieve, Producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One|BBC1]] | location = London | date=1–22 September 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Dalek Civil War===
In the [[Fifth Doctor]] story ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'', Davros ([[Terry Molloy]]) is released from his [[space station]] prison by small Dalek force aided by human [[mercenary|mercenaries]] and Dalek duplicates. The Daleks require Davros to find an [[antidote]] for a Movellan-created [[virus]] that has all but wiped them out. Believing his creations to be treacherous, Davros begins using [[mind control]] on Daleks and humans, ultimately releasing the virus to kill off the Daleks before they can exterminate him. Davros expresses a desire to build a new and improved race of Daleks, but he apparently succumbs to the virus himself before he can escape, his [[physiology]] being close enough to that of the Daleks for the virus to affect him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial | title = [[Resurrection of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One|BBC1]] | location = London | date=8–15 February 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the [[Sixth Doctor]] story ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', Davros goes into hiding as "The Great Healer" of the funeral and [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] preservation centre Tranquil Repose on the planet Necros. There, creating a clone of his head to serve as a decoy while modifying his body to fire electric bolts and his chair able to hover, Davros uses the frozen bodies to engineer a new variety of white armoured Daleks loyal to him, but he is captured by the original Daleks and taken to Skaro to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial | title = [[Revelation of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC1]] | location = London | date=23–30 March 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davros appears as the [[Dalek variants#Imperial Dalek Emperor|Emperor Dalek]] in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial | title = [[Remembrance of the Daleks]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Ben Aaronovitch]], Directors Andrew Morgan, [[John Nathan-Turner]] (uncredited), Producer John Nathan-Turner | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One|BBC1]] | location = London | date=5–26 October 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with his white and gold Daleks now based on Skaro and termed "[[Dalek variants#Imperial Daleks|Imperial Daleks]]", fighting against the grey "Renegade Dalek" faction. By this time, Davros has been physically transplanted into a customised Dalek casing. He is only revealed as the Emperor in the final episode. Both Skaro and the Imperial Dalek [[Mother ship|mothership]] are apparently destroyed (in the future) when the [[Seventh Doctor]] tricks Davros into using the [[Time Lord]] artefact known as the [[Hand of Omega]] which makes Skaro's Sun go supernova. However, a Dalek on the bridge of Davros' ship reports that the Emperor's escape pod is being launched and a white light is seen speeding away from the ship moments before its destruction, leaving a clear route to bring Davros back in the future.

===The Time War and the Reality Bomb ===
[[File:Davros Bleach.jpg|thumb|right|Davros, as he looked in both 2008 and 2015, played by [[Julian Bleach]]]]
During the revived series, Davros was referred to in the episode "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005) by the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]), who explains that the Daleks were created by "a genius... a man who was king of his own little world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Dalek |episode-link=Dalek (Doctor Who episode) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Robert Shearman]], Director [[Joe Ahearne]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=30 April 2005 |season= |series-no=1 |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again by the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) in the episode "[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" (2007), where he refers to the Daleks' creator as believing that "removing emotions makes you stronger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Evolution of the Daleks |episode-link=Evolution of the Daleks |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Helen Raynor]], Director [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=28 April 2007 |season= |series-no=3 |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davros makes his first official appearance in the episode "[[The Stolen Earth]]" (2008), portrayed by [[Julian Bleach]]. The episode reveals that Davros was thought to have died during the first year of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], when his command ship "flew into the jaws of the Nightmare Child" at the Gates of Elysium despite the Doctor's failed efforts to save him. But Davros was pulled out of the time lock of the war by Dalek Caan (voiced by [[Nicholas Briggs]]), using his own flesh to create a "new empire" of Daleks who place him in the Vault as their prisoner to make use of his knowledge. Under Davros' guidance, the Daleks steal 27 planets, including Earth, and hide them in the Medusa Cascade, one second out of sync with the rest of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Stolen Earth |episode-link=The Stolen Earth |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=28 June 2008 |season= |series-no=4 |number=12 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the follow-up episode "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" (2008), it is revealed that the stolen planets are required as a power source for Davros' ideal [[final solution]]: the reality bomb, which produces a wavelength that would cancel out the electrical field binding atoms to reduce all life outside the Crucible into nothingness in both his universe and countless other realities. But Davros learns too late that Dalek Caan, who came to the realisation of his race's atrocities as a consequence of saving his creator, used his prophecies and influence to ensure the Daleks' destruction while manipulating events to bring the Tenth Doctor and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) together for the role the latter would play. Though the Doctor attempts to save him, having earlier taunted the Doctor for turning his companions into killers and being the cause of the deaths of countless people during his travels, Davros furiously refuses the Doctor's help and accuses him of being responsible for the destruction while screaming: "Never forget, Doctor, you did this! I name you forever: ''You'' are the Destroyer of Worlds!" Thus the Doctor is forced to leave Davros to his fate as the Crucible self-destructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Journey's End |episode-link=Journey's End (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=5 July 2008 |season= |series-no=4 |number=13 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remembering the Twelfth Doctor ===
Davros returns in the two-part Series 9 opening "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]" and "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015), having escaped the Crucible's destruction and ending up on a restored Skaro with his life being prolonged by the Daleks. But when the aged Davros' health begins to fail, he remembers his childhood self, played by Joey Price, meeting the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) during the Kaleds' thousand-year war prior to ''Genesis of the Daleks''. The young Davros finds himself lost on the battlefield and surrounded by handmines, with the Doctor throwing his [[sonic screwdriver]] to the boy with the intent to save him before learning his name and leaving the child to his fate. Davros, seeking a final revenge on the Doctor, employs Colony Sarff ([[Jami Reid-Quarrell]]) to bring him to Skaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Magician's Apprentice |episode-link=The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who) |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Steven Moffat]], Director [[Hettie MacDonald]], Producer [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=19 September 2015 |season= |series-no=9 |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it appears that the Doctor has lost his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) to the Daleks, Davros manages to trick the Doctor into using his regeneration energy to heal him, extending his own life while infusing every Dalek on Skaro with the energy. But the Doctor reveals Davros' scheme has also revitalised the decomposing Daleks left to rot in Skaro's sewers, causing them to revolt and destroy the city. The Doctor then discovers the Daleks have a concept of mercy and are allowed to have the word in their vocabulary when he encounters Clara having disguised herself in a Dalek's robotic chassis. The Doctor and Clara escape, the former having an epiphany as to how Davros somehow put a sliver of compassion into the Daleks. He then returns to the battlefield in Davros' childhood, using a Dalek gun to destroy the handmines with the one bit of compassion in Davros' life instilled in the Daleks' design to ensure Clara being saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Witch's Familiar |episode-link=The Witch's Familiar |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |credits=Writer [[Steven Moffat]], Director [[Hettie MacDonald]], Producer [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] |first= |last= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |date=26 September 2015 |season= |series-no=9 |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==

===Comic strips===
''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' printed several comics stories involving Davros. The first, "Nemesis of the Daleks" (#152–155), with the Seventh Doctor, features an appearance of a Dalek Emperor. Speaking with the Emperor, the Doctor addresses him as Davros, but the Emperor responds "Who is Davros?" The Doctor initially assumes Davros' personality has been totally subsumed, but in the later strip "[[Emperor of the Daleks]]" (#197–202) this Emperor is shown as a different entity from Davros. Set prior to ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' in Davros' timeline, but after in the timeline of the Doctor, the latter, accompanied by [[Bernice Summerfield]], together with help from the Sixth Doctor, ensures that Davros will survive the wrath of the Daleks so that he can assume the title of Emperor, allowing history to take its course. "Up Above the Gods" (#227), a vignette following up on this, features the Sixth Doctor and Davros having a conversation in the TARDIS.

===Audio plays===
Terry Molloy has reprised his role as Davros in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] [[radio drama|audio plays]] produced by [[Big Finish Productions]], mostly notably ''[[Davros (Doctor Who audio)|Davros]]'' (taking place during the [[Sixth Doctor]]'s era), which, through flashbacks, explored the scientist's life prior to his crippling injury, which is attributed to a Thal nuclear attack (an idea that first appeared in [[Terrance Dicks]]' novelisation of ''Genesis of the Daleks'').

''Davros'', which does not feature the Daleks, apparently fills in the gaps between ''Resurrection of the Daleks'' and ''Revelation of the Daleks'',&lt;ref&gt;A timeline provided with ''The Complete Davros Collection'' placed ''Davros'' after ''Resurrection of the Daleks''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has the scientist trying to manipulate the galaxy's economy into a war footing similar to Skaro's. The Sixth Doctor manages to defeat his plans, and Davros is last heard when his ship explodes, an event obliquely mentioned in ''Revelation''. However the Doctor thinks he has survived. Davros also mentions he will work on a plan to combat famine, tying into Revelation of the Daleks.

''[[The Davros Mission]]'' is an original audio adventure (without the Doctor) available on the Complete Davros Collection DVD box set.  It takes place directly after the television story ''Revelation'', while leaving the planet Necros and beginning Davros' trial.  At the end of ''Davros Mission'', he turns the tables on the Daleks, forcing them to do his bidding.  The Big Finish miniseries [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#I.2C Davros|I, Davros]], also features trial scenes, but mostly explores his early life. In those four stories, his journey is seen from his boyhood, to just before ''Genesis of the Daleks''.

''[[The Curse of Davros]]'' begins with Davros and the Daleks working together to try and alter the outcome of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] using technology that Davros has created that allows him to swap peoples' minds, with matters becoming more complicated when the [[Sixth Doctor]] uses the device to swap bodies with Davros in an attempt to subvert the Daleks' plans from the inside. At the end, Davros and the Doctor are returned to their original bodies with the aid of the Doctor's new companion Flip Jackson, and Davros is left with an army of Daleks who have had their minds wiped. These Daleks presumably become the "Imperial Daleks", first seen in ''Remembrance of the Daleks''.

In ''[[The Juggernauts]]'', Davros is on the run from the original Daleks.  He hatches a plan to add human [[Nervous system|tissue]] to robotic [[List of Doctor Who robots#M|Mechanoids]], using them, along with his own Daleks, to destroy the originals.  At the end of the story, the [[self-destruct]] mechanism of Davros' life-support chair explodes, destroying an entire human colony. It is not clear how Davros survives to become the Dalek Emperor as seen in ''Remembrance''. However, in the DVD, the Davros Connections, director Gary Russell points out that the explosion of Davros' life-support chair leaves the listener to believe there is little of Davros left. This fits chronologically the fact that in "Remembrance" Davros is seen as a head inside the Emperor Dalek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/DavrosBoxset.htm The Davros Connections DVD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208152946/http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/DavrosBoxset.htm |date=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Daleks Among Us]]'', Davros returns to Azimuth, a planet that was invaded by the Daleks long ago, presenting himself as a victim of Dalek enslavement to infiltrate an underground movement against the repressive government- so desperate to prevent riots about individual actions during the Dalek occupation that official policy is now that the Dalek invasion never happened- seeking the remnants of an old experiment he carried out on the planet. This experiment is revealed to be Falkus, a clone of Davros's original body that was intended to be a new host for his mind, with Falkus having evolved an independent personality since the Daleks left Azimuth. Falkus attempts to acquire the Persuasion Machine, a dangerous device that the [[Seventh Doctor]] has been tracking with his companions [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Klein|Elizabeth Klein]] and [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Will Arrowsmith|Will Arrowsmith]], but the Doctor is able to trick Falkus into using the reprogrammed Persuasion Machine to destroy himself and his Daleks, while Davros flees in an escape pod. Davros is last shown trapped on the planet Lamuria, faced with the spectral former residents of the planet who sought to punish all criminals in the universe. 

By the time of the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio play ''[[Terror Firma]]'' (set after ''Remembrance''), Davros is commanding a Dalek army which has successfully conquered the Earth. His mental instability has grown to the point where "Davros" and "the Emperor" exist within him as [[Disassociative identity disorder|different personalities]]. His Daleks recognise this instability and rebel against Davros. By the story's end the Emperor personality is dominant, and the Daleks agree to follow him and leave Earth.

===Novels===
''Terror Firma'' may contradict{{or|date=January 2018}} the events of the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], in which an unmerged Davros is placed on trial by the Dalek Prime, a combination of the Dalek Emperor and the [[Dalek variants#Dalek Supreme|Dalek Supreme]]. In the novel the Dalek Prime claimed that the planet Antalin had been [[Terraforming|terraformed]] to resemble Skaro and was destroyed in its place.  A subterfuge to destroy Daleks aligned to Davros; both on Skaro (Antalin) and those that remained hidden within Dalek ranks on Skaro (original).  Despite finding evidence of threat to Skaro via evidence found on 22nd century earth of Davros' mission to 1960s Earth and seeing the event via time-tracking equipment, the Dalek Prime allowed the destruction of Skaro to destroy Daleks allied to Davros. Dalek Prime also claimed that the Dalek/Movellan war (and indeed most of Dalek history before the destruction of "Skaro") was actually faked for Davros' benefit; in fact another ruse designed to bait Davros into giving evidence against himself (as he does in his trial.) Skaro is later seen to be intact and undamaged, and one character notes that it is quite possible the Dalek Prime is lying in order to weaken Davros' claim to leadership of the Daleks, while using foreknowledge of events to destroy and entrap Davros and his allies.

''War of the Daleks'', like the comic strips and audio plays, is of uncertain [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] when it comes to the television series. At the conclusion of ''War'', Davros was seemingly disintegrated by a [[Dalek variants#Spider Daleks|Spider Dalek]] on the order of the Dalek Prime. However, Davros had previously recruited one of the Spider Daleks as a [[sleeper agent]] for just such an eventuality, and even he was not certain in the end if he was being disintegrated or being [[Teleportation|teleported]] away to safety, leaving the possibility open for his return.

===Short fiction===
[[Paul Cornell]]'s dark vignette in the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' Brief Encounters series, "An Incident Concerning the Bombardment of the Phobos Colony" occurs sometime between "Resurrection of the Daleks" and his assumption of the role of Emperor.

===Theatre===
In 1993, Michael Wisher, the original Davros, with [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]], who had played his confederate, Nyder, reprised the role in an unlicensed one-off amateur stage production, ''[[The Trial of Davros]]''. The plot of the play involved the Time Lords putting Davros on trial, with Nyder as a witness.

Terry Molloy played Davros in the remounting of the play, again with Miles, for another one-off production in 2005. During the production, specially shot footage portrayed Dalek atrocities.

In 2008, Julian Bleach appeared live as Davros at the [[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|Doctor Who Prom]], announcing that the [[Royal Albert Hall]] would become his new palace, and the audience his "obedient slaves".&lt;ref name="Prom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a116433/doctor-who-and-davros-take-over-proms.html |title='Doctor Who' and Davros take over Proms |accessdate=29 July 2008 |last=Rawson-Jones |first=Ben |date=28 July 2008 |work=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unofficial BBC representation===
BBC staff have traditionally created [[Christmas tape|parodies]] of its own programming to be shown to colleagues at Christmas events and parties. The BBC's 1993 Christmas tape parodied the allegedly robotic, dictatorial and ruthless management style of its then Director-General, [[John Birt]], by portraying him as Davros taking over the BBC, carrying out bizarre mergers of departments, awarding himself a bonus and singing a song to the tune of [[I Wan'na Be Like You]] describing his plans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVB6LdQF3BA John and Janet, Christmas Tape 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elia Abu Madi''' (also known as '''Elia D. Madey'''; {{lang-ar|إيليا أبو ماضي}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|Īlyā Abū Māḍī&amp;nbsp;}}''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Lebanese Arabic]] Transliteration: {{transl|apc|Īlya Abu Māḍi}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈʔiːlja (ʔa)buˈmɑːdi|pron}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) (15 May 1890&amp;nbsp;– 23 November 1957) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] poet.

==Early life==
Abu Madi was born in the village of Al-Muhaydithah, now part of [[Bikfaya]], [[Lebanon]], in 15 May 1890 in a [[Christian]] family. At the age of 11 he moved to [[Alexandria, Egypt]] where he worked with his uncle.

==Career and Works==
In 1911, Elia Abu madi published his first collection of poems, ''Tazkar al-Madi''. Shortly after, he was exiled by the Ottoman Turkish authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFSIf5Zz26gC&amp;pg=PA63|title=My Mother's Zither|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2002|isbn=0815607393|editor-last=Benson|editor-first=Kathleen|location=New York|pages=63|editor-last2=Kayal|editor-first2=Philip|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he left [[Egypt]] for the [[United States]], where he settled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. In 1916 he moved to [[New York City|New York]] and began a career in journalism. In New York Abu Madi met and worked with a number of Arab-American poets including [[Kahlil Gibran]]. He married the daughter of [[Najeeb Diab]], editor of the Arabic-language magazine ''Meraat ul-Gharb'', and became the chief editor of that publication in 1918. His second poetry collection, ''Diwan Iliya Abu Madi'', was published in New York in 1919; his third and most important collection, ''Al-Jadawil'' ("The Streams"), appeared in 1927. His other books were ''Al-Khama'il'' ("The Tickets")&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/uoc/PDF-FILES/(11)%20Dr.%20Imteyaz%20Ahmad.pdf|title=Abu Madi: A Voice of Modernity in Contemporary Arabic Poetry|last1=Ahmad|first1=Imtyaz|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1940) and ''Tibr wa Turab'' (posthumous, 1960).

In 1929 Abu Madi founded his own periodical, ''Al-Samir'', in [[Brooklyn]]. It began as a monthly but after a few years appeared five times a week.

His poems are very well known among Arabs; poet, author, and journalist Gregory Orfalea wrote that "his poetry is as commonplace and memorized in the Arab world as that of [[Robert Frost]] is in ours."&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In ''A Community of Many Worlds: Arab Americans in New York City'', ed. Kathleen Benson, Syracuse University Press, 2002, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">An '''ethnic bioweapon''' (''biogenetic weapon'') is a type of theoretical [[bioweapon]] that aims to harm only or primarily people of specific ethnicities or [[genotype]]s.

== History ==
One of the first modern fictional discussions of ethnic weapons is in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1942 novel ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (republished as ''The Day After Tomorrow''), in which a race-specific [[radiation]] weapon is used against a so-called "[[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]]" invader{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

=== Genetic weapons ===
In 1997, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] referred to the concept of an ethnic bioweapon as a possible risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Cohen|title=Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy|date=1997-04-28|work=Sam Nunn Policy Forum, University of Georgia|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|accessdate=2006-07-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118074748/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|archivedate=2004-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 some biological weapon experts considered such a "genetic weapon" plausible, and believed the former [[Soviet Union]] had undertaken some research on the influence of various substances on human genes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plague/interviews/davis.html Interview of Dr Christopher Davis, UK Defence Intelligence Staff], ''Plague War'', [[Frontline (TV series)|Frontline]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2000 policy paper [[Rebuilding America's Defenses]], think-tank [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) described ethnic bioweapons as a potentially "politically useful tool". PNAC went on to provide substantial staffing for the Bush Jr administration.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century'' |url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |date=September 2000 |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817122719/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of a "genetic bomb" is presented in [[Vincent Sarich]]'s and [[Frank Miele]]'s book, ''[[Race: The Reality of Human Differences]]'', published in 2004. These authors view such weapons as technically feasible but not very likely to be used. (page 248 of paperback edition.)

In 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) considered bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups as a possibility, and highlighted problems that advances in science for such things as "treatment to [[Alzheimer's]] and other debilitating diseases could also be used for malign purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the official view of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] was "The potential to target a particular ethnic group with a biological agent is probably not far off. These scenarios are not the product of the ICRC's imagination but have either occurred or been identified by countless independent and governmental experts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/gas-protocol-100605.htm Preventing the use of biological and chemical weapons: 80 years on], Official Statement by Jacques Forster, vice-president of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], 10-06-2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the US government held a congressional committee, ‘Genetics and other human modification technologies: sensible international regulation or a new kind of arms race?’, during which it was discussed how “we can anticipate a world where rogue (and even not-so-rogue) states and non-state actors attempt to manipulate human genetics in ways that will horrify us”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebadgeronline.com/2018/05/ethic-bioweapons-conspiracy-reality/|title=Ethnic-bioweapons: between conspiracy and reality - The Badger|date=2018-05-08|work=The Badger|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that a specific virus that targets individuals with a specific DNA sequence is within possibility in the near future. The magazine put forward a hypothetical scenario of a virus which caused mild flu to the general population but deadly symptoms to the [[President of the United States]]. They cite advances in personalized gene therapy as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine suggested the possibility of a virus used as an ethnic bioweapon that could [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] a "genetically-related ethnic population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/15/can-there-be-war-without-soldiers-weapons-cyberwarfare/|title=Can There Be War Without Soldiers?|last=Brooks|first=Rosa|date=2016-03-15|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli "ethno-bomb" controversy ==
In November 1998, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Israel was attempting to build an "ethno-bomb" containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel planning 'ethnic' bomb as Saddam caves in|author=Uzi Mahnaimi|author2=Marie Colvin|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date=1998-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired News]]'' also reported the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel's Ethnic Weapon? |publisher=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,16272,00.html |date=1998-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9904,ridgeway,3697,6.html |title=Ethnic Warfare |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |author=James Ridgeway |date=1999-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''[[Foreign Reports|Foreign Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9811&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;D=0&amp;P=28059 |title=UPI report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jeff|title=Debunking the “ethno-bomb”|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/02/news_154/|website=Salon|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'', describing the claims as "[[blood libel]]", reported that the likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic [[Doron Stanitsky]]. Stanitsky had sent his completely fictional work about such a weapon to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as "wholly fantastical", with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now Playing: A Blood Libel For The 21st Century|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=1998-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/talk.politics.mideast/QJKAhCi8UY0/uTqlQUSv8goJ|title=Google Groups quoting Haaretz|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and no sources were ever identified. Neither of the authors of the ''Sunday Times'' story, [[Uzi Mahnaimi]] and [[Marie Colvin]], have spoken publicly on the matter{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

==Russian ban on export of biological samples==
In May 2007, a Russian newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]'' reported that the Russian government banned all exports of human biosamples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=769777|title=Россия блюдет человеческий образец
|date=2007-05-29|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=[[Kommersant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report claims that the reason for the ban was a secret [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] report about on-going development of "genetic bioweapons" targeting Russian population by Western institutions. The report mentions the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], American International Health Alliance, Department of Medical Biotechnology of Jagiellonian University, [[United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division]], Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology Warsaw University, and [[United States Agency for International Development]].

[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Thermophile]]s, a type of extremophile, produce some of the bright colors of [[Grand Prismatic Spring]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]
An '''extremophile''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|extremus}}'' meaning "extreme" and Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|philiā}}'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}}) meaning "love") is an [[organism]] that thrives in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment|extreme conditions]] that are detrimental to most [[life|life on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rampelotto | first1 = P.

==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that [[microbial life]] has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot, for example—that would be completely inhospitable to [[complex organisms]]. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far under the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration Rover Launches - Press kit |accessdate=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to astrophysicist Steinn Sigurdsson, "There are viable [[Endospore|bacterial spores]] that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth—and we know they're very hardened to [[radiation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BBC Staff |title=Impacts 'more likely' to have spread life from Earth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14637109 |date=23 August 2011 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[bacteria]] were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep under the ice in [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20130206"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gorman |first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html |date=6 February 2013 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Mariana Trench|Marianas Trench]], the deepest place in Earth's oceans.&lt;ref name="LS-20130317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes Thrive in Deepest Spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date=17 March 2013 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NG-20130317"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glud |first1=Ronnie |last2=Wenzhöfer |first2=Frank |last3=Middleboe |first3=Mathias |last4=Oguri |first4=Kazumasa |last5=Turnewitsch |first5=Robert |last6=Canfield |first6=Donald E. |last7=Kitazato |first7=Hiroshi |title=High rates of microbial carbon turnover in sediments in the deepest oceanic trench on Earth |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1773 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1773 |date=17 March 2013 |journal=[[Nature Geoscience]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=284–288 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..284G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some microorganisms have been found thriving  inside rocks up to {{convert|1900|ft}} below the sea floor under {{convert|8500|ft}} of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.&lt;ref name="LS-20130317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LS-20130314"&gt;{{cite web |last=Oskin |first=Becky |title=Intraterrestrials: Life Thrives in Ocean Floor |url=http://www.livescience.com/27899-ocean-subsurface-ecosystem-found.html |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of the researchers, "You can find microbes everywhere—they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are."&lt;ref name="LS-20130317" /&gt; A key to extremophile adaptation is their [[amino acid]] composition, affecting their [[protein folding]] ability under particular conditions.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe, each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as [[polyextremophile]]s. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as ''Thermococcus barophilus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1999 | title = Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | doi = 10.1099/00207713-49-2-351 | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 351–359 | pmid=10319455 | last1 = Marteinsson | first1 = VT | last2 = Birrien | first2 = JL | last3 = Reysenbach | first3 = AL | last4 = Vernet | first4 = M | last5 = Marie | first5 = D | last6 = Gambacorta | first6 = A | last7 = Messner | first7 = P | last8 = Sleytr | first8 = UB | last9 = Prieur | first9 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the [[Atacama Desert]] might be a [[radioresistant]] [[xerophile]], a [[psychrophile]], and an [[oligotroph]]. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low [[pH]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Ajar Nath|last2=Verma|first2=Priyanka|last3=Kumar|first3=Murugan|last4=Pal|first4=Kamal K.|last5=Dey|first5=Rinku|last6=Gupta|first6=Alka|last7=Padaria|first7=Jasdeep Chatrath|last8=Gujar|first8=Govind T.|last9=Kumar|first9=Sudheer|date=2014-05-31|title=Diversity and phylogenetic profiling of niche-specific Bacilli from extreme environments of India|journal=Annals of Microbiology|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=611–629|doi=10.1007/s13213-014-0897-9|issn=1590-4261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Psychrophile]]/Cryophile: An organism capable of survival, growth or reproduction at temperatures of -15&amp;nbsp;°C or lower for extended periods; common in cold soils, [[permafrost]], [[polar ice]], cold ocean water, and in or under alpine snowpack. Psychrophilic organisms live in environments at temperature below -15&amp;nbsp;°C. Low temperatures cause the energy within proteins to slow, which prevents them from functioning.  Their proteins have adapted their amino acid composition to live in  cold conditions. They have a high amount of [[glycine]] amino acids, which small size allows for more flexibility within the protein once it is folded. Psychrophiles also have a low concentration of charged amino acids, hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids, and proline residues. The low amount of charged amino acids reduces the amount of interactions between them, while the reduced amount of hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids allows the non-polar core of the protein to be smaller. Psychrophilic proteins have a small amount of [[proline]] amino acids because they cause a rigid structure. These adaptations allow psychrophilic proteins to be more flexible so they do not freeze under cold conditions.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Radioresistant]]: Organisms resistant to high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], most commonly ultraviolet radiation, but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation

; [[Thermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 45–122&amp;nbsp;°C. Normally high temperatures cause proteins to unfold and prevent them from functioning; thermophilic proteins have adapted their proteins to cope with these conditions. They have a higher amount of [[cysteine]] amino acids, which form [[disulfide bond]]s once the protein has folded. These disulfide bonds cause the protein to fold up tighter and become more rigid. They also have more charged amino acids, both positive and negative, that interact with each other to increase how rigid the protein is. When proteins become more rigid they are less likely to unfold due to high temperature. Even one extra disulfide bond can raise the temperature at which the protein folds by 6&amp;nbsp;°C. These adapted proteins allow thermophilic extremophiles to survive at high temperatures.&lt;ref name='Reed 2013'/&gt;

; [[Thermoacidophile]]: Combination of [[thermophile]] and [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]] that prefer temperatures of 70–80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH between 2 and 3

; [[Xerophile]]: An organism that can grow in extremely dry, desiccating conditions; this type is exemplified by the soil microbes of the [[Atacama Desert]]
&lt;!--; [[GFAJ-1]]: An [[organism]] in the family [[Halomonadaceae]] that can tolerate extreme levels of [[arsenic]], but [[GFAJ-1]] can go a step further. When starved of [[phosphorus]], it can incorporate [[arsenic]] into its [[DNA]] and continue growing.--&gt;

== In astrobiology ==
[[Astrobiology]] is the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]: [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth]]. Astrobiology makes use of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[solar physics]], [[biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[ecology]], [[planetary science]], [[geography]], and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last1=Ward |first1=P.

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in [[Japan]] involved a variety of [[bacteria]] including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of [[prokaryotic cell]]s is essential for successful growth under [[hypergravity]].

On September 2015, scientists from [https://www.cnr.it/en CNR-National Research Council] of Italy reported that [[Sulfolobus solfataricus|''S.soflataricus'']] was able to survive under Martian radiation at a wavelength that was considered extremely lethal to most bacteria. This discovery is significant because it indicates that not only bacterial spores, but also growing cells can be remarkably resistant to strong UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastascusa|first1=V.|last2=Romano|first2=I.|last3=Di Donato|first3=P.|last4=Poli|first4=A.|last5=Della Corte|first5=V.|last6=Rotundi|first6=A.|last7=Bussoletti|first7=E.|last8=Quarto|first8=M.|last9=Pugliese|first9=M.|last10=Nicolaus|first10=B.|title=Extremophiles Survival to Simulated Space Conditions: An Astrobiology Model Study|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|date=9 January 2015|volume=44|issue=3|pages=231–237|doi=10.1007/s11084-014-9397-y|pmid=25573749|bibcode=2014OLEB...44..231M|pmc=4669584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University conclusively reported that [[endospore]]s of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299±28&amp;nbsp;m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecraft may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal impact speed is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barney|first1=Brandon L.|last2=Pratt|first2=Sara N.|last3=Austin|first3=Daniel E.|title=Survivability of bare, individual Bacillus subtilis spores to high-velocity surface impact: Implications for microbial transfer through space|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=June 2016|volume=125|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2016.02.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063315300088|bibcode=2016P&amp;SS..125...20B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid [[asphalt]] lake, [[Pitch Lake]]. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells/gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25051/ Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake.] ''the physics arXiv blog'' 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2047 Microbial Life in a Liquid Asphalt Desert.]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, until recently [[boron]] tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of ''Bacillus boroniphilus'', borophiles came into discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahmed| first1 = Iftikhar| last2 = Yokota| first2 = Akira| last3 = Fujiwara| first3 = Toru| year = 2006| title = A novel highly boron tolerant bacterium, Bacillus boroniphilus sp. nov., isolated from soil, that requires boron for its growth | url = | journal = Extremophiles | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 217–224 | doi = 10.1007/s00792-006-0027-0 | pmid = 17072687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.

== Industrial uses ==
The thermoalkaliphilic [[catalase]], which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, ''[[Thermus brockianus]]'', found in [[Yellowstone National Park]] by [[Idaho National Laboratory]] researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30&amp;nbsp;°C to over 94&amp;nbsp;°C and a pH range from 6–10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the ''T. brockianus'' catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA transfer==
Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell's chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnsborg | first1 = O | last2 = Eldholm | first2 = V | last3 = Håvarstein | first3 = LS. | year = 2007 | title = Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function | url = | journal = Res Microbiol | volume = 158 | issue = 10| pages = 767–78 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 | pmid = 17997281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below.  However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.

The bacterium ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.  This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile.  ''D. radiodurans'' is competent to perform [[Transformation (genetics)|genetic transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = BE | last2 = Setlow | first2 = JK. | year = 1968 | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 176–83 | pmid = 5303325 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.1.176|bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M | pmc=285920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.

'''Green Boots''' is the name given to the [[unidentified decedent|unidentified corpse]] of a climber that became a landmark on the main Northeast ridge route of [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|work=BBC Future|author=Nuwer, Rachel|date=8 October 2015|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151008-the-tragic-story-of-mt-everests-most-famous-dead-body |title=The tragic tale of Mt Everest’s most famous dead body}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q6Y_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c1YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1200,2723423&amp;dq=green-boots+everest&amp;hl=en | title = Everest's Trail of Corpses | work = The Victoria Advocate | date = 20 May 2007 | first = Tim | last = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his identity has not been officially confirmed, he is believed to be [[Tsewang Paljor]], an Indian climber who died on Mount Everest in 1996. The term ''Green Boots'' originated from the green mountaineering boots the body wore. All expeditions from the north side encountered the body curled in the limestone alcove cave at {{convert|8500|m|abbr=on}}. In 2006, a different climber, [[David Sharp (mountaineer)|David Sharp]], died during a solo climb in what is known as "Green Boots' Cave".

In May 2014, Green Boots was reported missing,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|work=BBC Future|author=Nuwer, Rachel|title=Death In the Clouds|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151008-the-graveyard-in-the-clouds-everests-200-dead-bodies|date=9 October 2015|quote=Adventurer Noel Hanna made this discovery in May 2014, when he was surprised to find not only that Green Boots’ cave was devoid of its familiar resident, but also that many of the bodies on the north side – one stretch of which is sometimes referred to as “rainbow ridge,” for the colourful down suits of its many fallen climbers – seemed to have vanished. Hanna estimates that, previously, up to 10 bodies were visible on the push to the summit, but in 2014 he only counted two or three. “I would be 95% certain that [Paljor] has been moved or covered with stones,” Hanna says.}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably removed or buried.&lt;ref name=Nuwer&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=9 October 2015 |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151008-the-graveyard-in-the-clouds-everests-200-dead-bodies |title=Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's 200+ bodies |work=BBC Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, as a greater number of climbers returned, according to 2-stage hearsays he was noticed again at the same altitude and may have simply been covered with a few stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2017/05/27/everest-2017-weekend-update-may-27/|website=alanarnette.com|date=May 27, 2017|title=Everest 2017: Weekend Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded video footage of Green Boots was filmed on 21 May 2001 by French climber Pierre Paperon. In the video, Green Boots is shown lying on his left side, facing toward the summit. According to Paperon, [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]] told him that it was the body of a Chinese mountaineer who had attempted the climb six months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|N-nh4smWbTA|"Everest Pierre Paperon 6 bis"}} {{fr icon}}. 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the corpse became known both as a landmark on the north route and for its association with the death of David Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Quinlan |first=Mark |date=25 May 2012|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/reclaiming-the-dead-on-mt-everest-1.1206082 |title=Reclaiming the dead on Mt. Everest |publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 2014, Green Boots' body was reported to be missing from view, presumably removed or buried.&lt;ref name=Nuwer/&gt; A body was discovered hanging alongside a tent and other debris on the side of a cliff-face in 2017, which some have speculated to be the transported body of "Green Boots".&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2017/05/27/everest-2017-weekend-update-may-27/|website=alanarnette.com|title=Everest 2017: Weekend Update|date=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible identities==
===Tsewang Paljor===
Green Boots is commonly believed to be Indian climber [[Tsewang Paljor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ed |last=Douglas |coauthors= |title=Over the Top |date=15 August 2006 |work=Outside Magazine |url=http://outsideonline.com/outside/destinations/200609/mount-everest-climbing-ethics-1.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912163732/http://outsideonline.com/outside/destinations/200609/mount-everest-climbing-ethics-1.html |archivedate=12 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was wearing green Koflach boots on the day he and two others in his party summited in 1996, although it is possible the body may instead have been that of his team member Dorje Morup. The [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|Everest disaster of 1996]] saw the deaths of eight climbers, which included five climbers from the Adventure Consultants and [[Mountain Madness]] expeditions on the southeast route, and three fatalities on the northeast route. These were the climbers from the [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP) expedition from India. The expedition was led by [[Commandant]] Mohinder Singh and was the first Indian ascent of Everest from the east side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Singh | first =Mohinder | title =Everest: The First Indian Ascent from North | publisher =Indian Publishers Distributors | year = 2003 | isbn= 81-7341-276-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1996, Subedar [[Tsewang Samanla]], [[Lance Naik]] [[Dorje Morup]], and Head Constable Tsewang Paljor were caught in the blizzard, just short of the summit. While three of the six-member team turned back down, Samanla, Morup, and Paljor decided to go for the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Krakauer | first =Jon | title =[[Into Thin Air]] | publisher =Anchor Books | year =1997 | isbn=03-8549-208-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 15:45 [[Nepal Time]], the three climbers radioed to their expedition leader that they had arrived, a claim that was subsequently disputed by [[Jon Krakauer]], who based on an analysis of an interview given by a later Japanese team, believes they may have stopped {{convert|150|m|ft|0}} short of the topmost point but been confused by poor visibility. They left an offering of [[prayer flags]], [[khata]]s, and [[piton]]s. Here, the leader Samanla decided to spend extra time for religious ceremonies and instructed the other two to move down.

There was no radio contact after that. Back at the camps below, team members saw two headlamps moving slightly above the Second Step&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; at {{convert|8570|m|ft|0}}. None of the three managed to come back to high camp at {{convert|8300|m|ft|0}}.

Controversy later arose over whether or not a team of Japanese climbers from [[Fukuoka]] had seen and potentially failed to assist the missing Indian climbers. The group had left their camp at {{convert|8300|m|ft|0}} at 06:15 Beijing time, reaching the summit at 15:07. Along the way, they encountered others on the trail. Unaware of the missing Indians, they believed these others, all of whom were wearing goggles and oxygen masks under their hoods, were members of a climbing party from Taiwan. During their descent, begun at 15:30, they reported seeing an unidentifiable object above the Second Step. Below the First Step, they radioed in to report seeing one person on a fixed rope. Thereafter, one of the climbers, Shigekawa, exchanged greetings with an unidentifiable man standing nearby. At that time, they had only enough oxygen to return to C6.

At 16:00, the Fukuoka party discovered from an Indian in their group that three men were missing.&lt;ref name="uiaa"/&gt; They offered to join the rescue but were declined. Forced to wait a day due to bad weather, they sent a second party to the summit on the 13th. They saw several bodies around the First Step, but continued to the summit.

Initially, there were some misunderstandings and harsh words regarding the actions of the Fukuoka team, which were later clarified. According to [[Reuters]], the Indian expedition had made claims that the Japanese had pledged to help with the search but instead had pressed forward with their summit attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=India probes Everest deaths, questions Japanese team | date= | publisher=Reuters | url =http://outside.away.com/peaks/japan.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201024/http://outside.away.com/peaks/japan.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese team denied that they had abandoned or refused to help the dying climbers on the way up, a claim that was accepted by the Indian-Tibetan Border Police.&lt;ref name="uiaa"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Hiroo| last=Saso| title=Misunderstandings Beyond the North Ridge| publisher=International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation| url=http://www.uiaa.ch/article.aspx?c=226&amp;a=120| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224103225/http://www.uiaa.ch/article.aspx?c=226&amp;a=120|archivedate=24 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Kohli, an official of the Indian Mountaineering Federation, who earlier had denounced the Japanese, later retracted his claim that the Japanese had reported meeting the Indians on 10 May.

===Dorje Morup===
While it is commonly believed that Green Boots is the body of Head Constable Tsewang Paljor, a 1997 article, titled "The Indian Ascent of Qomolungma by the North Ridge", published by P. M. Das, deputy leader of the expedition in ''[[Himalayan Journal]]'', raises the possibility that it could instead be that of Lance Naik Dorje Morup. Das wrote that two climbers had been spotted descending by the light of their head-torches at 19:30, although they had soon been lost from sight.&lt;ref name=Himalayan&gt;{{Cite journal | first=P. M. | last=Das | title=The Indian Ascent of Qomolungma by the North Ridge | year=1997 | work=Himalayan Journal | url =https://www.himalayanclub.org/hj/53/7/the-indian-ascent-of-qomolungma-by-the-north-ridge/ |volume=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the leader of the second summit group of the expedition radioed base camp that they had encountered Morup moving slowly between the [[Three Steps|First and Second Steps]]. Das wrote that Morup "had refused to put on gloves over his frost-bitten hands" and "was finding difficulty in unclipping his safety carabiner at anchor points."&lt;ref name=Himalayan/&gt; According to Das, the Japanese team assisted in transitioning him to the next stretch of rope.

The Japanese group discovered the body of Tsewang Samanla above the Second Step later on. On the return trip, the group found that Morup was still making slow progress. Morup is believed to have died in the late afternoon on 11 May. Das states that Paljor's body was never found.

A second ITBP group also came across the bodies of Samanla and Morup on their return from the summit. Das wrote that they encountered Morup "lying under the shelter of a boulder near their line of descent, close to Camp 6" with intact clothing and his rucksack by his side.&lt;ref name=Himalayan/&gt;

==Green Boots in perspective==
Green Boots joined the ranks of roughly 200 corpses remaining on Everest by the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite news|last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2012/11/there-are-over-200-bodies-on-mount-everest-and-theyre-used-as-landmarks/ |title=There Are Over 200 Bodies on Mount Everest, And They're Used as Landmarks |work=Smithsonian Magazine |date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2007/05/16/16188/corpses-litter-the-death-zone.html | title = Corpses litter the 'death zone' near Everest's summit, frozen for eternity | first = Tim |last = Johnson | work = McClatchy Newspapers | date= 7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown when the term ''Green Boots'' entered Everest parlance. Over the years it became a common term, as all the expeditions from the north side encountered the body of the climber curled up in the limestone [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]] cave. The cave is located at 27,890 feet (8,500 m) and is littered with oxygen bottles. It is located below the first step on the path. 

Another fallen climber who earned a nickname, "Sleeping Beauty", is [[Francys Arsentiev|Francys Distefano-Arsentiev]], who died in 1998 during an unsuccessful descent from Everest after summiting. Her body remained where she fell and visible until 2007, when it was ceremonially hidden from view.&lt;ref name=Nuwer/&gt; 

Additional bodies are located in "rainbow valley", an area below the summit strewn with corpses wearing brightly colored mountaineering apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parker |first=Alan |date=24 May 2012 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/everest-the-open-graveyard-waiting-above/ |title=Everest: 'The open graveyard waiting above' |website=Maclean's}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another named corpse is that of [[Hannelore Schmatz]], who, with a prominent position on the south route, earned the moniker "the German woman"; she summited in 1979 but died at 8,200 m altitude during her descent.&lt;ref name=dwhelga&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.dw.com/abenteuersport/helga-hengge-everest-english/ |title=Helga's Everest nightmare |website=Abenteuer Sport |publisher=DW.com |date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained there for many years but was eventually blown further down the mountain.&lt;reF name=dwhelga/&gt;

In 2006, British mountaineer [[David Sharp (mountaineer)|David Sharp]] was found in a [[hypothermic]] state in Green Boots' Cave, by climber [[Mark Inglis]] and his party. Inglis controversially continued his ascent without offering assistance, and Sharp died of extreme cold some hours later. Approximately three dozen other climbers would have passed by the dying man that day; it has been suggested that those who noticed him mistook Sharp for Green Boots and therefore paid little attention.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite news |last1=Breed |first1=Allen G. |last2=Gurubacharya |first2=Binaj | url = http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=305837&amp;rel_no=1 | title = Part II: Near top of Everest, he waves off fellow climbers: 'I just want to sleep' | date = 18 July 2006 | work = Oh My News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

His theological origins in [[Hinduism]] are unclear. Alternate theories include him having ancient roots, being a non-Aryan deity who was Sanskritized by the Vedic Aryans, or that he is a fusion deity who emerged in literary works from folk [[Yaksha]] protector deities and theological symbolism.&lt;ref name=ludvik2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

While Hanuman is one of the central characters in the ancient [[Hindu epic]] ''Ramayana'', the evidence of devotional worship to him is missing in the texts and archeological sites of ancient and most of the medieval period. According to Philip Lutgendorf, an American Indologist known for his studies on Hanuman, the theological significance and devotional dedication to Hanuman emerged about 1,000 years after the composition of the ''Ramayana'', in the 2nd millennium CE, after the arrival of Islamic rule in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Paula Richman 2010"&gt;Paula Richman (2010), ''Review: Lutgendorf, Philip's Hanuman's Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey'', The Journal of Asian Studies; Vol 69, Issue 4 (Nov 2010), pages 1287-1288&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhakti movement]] saints such as [[Samarth Ramdas]] expressed Hanuman as a symbol of nationalism and resistance to persecution.&lt;ref name=lele114/&gt; In the modern era, his iconography and temples have been increasingly common.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p177"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

Outside India, Hanuman shares many characteristics with the Hindu versions in India, but differs in others. He is heroic, brave and steadfastly chaste, much like in the Sanskrit tradition, but not celibate. He marries and has children in other cultures, as is the case in a few regional versions in India. Hanuman is stated by scholars to be the inspiration for the allegory-filled adventures of a monkey hero in the ''[[Xiyouji]]'' (Journey to the West) – the great Chinese poetic novel influenced by the travels of Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] (602–664 CE) to India.&lt;ref name=brithanuman&gt;Wendy Doniger, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hanuman Hanuman: Hindu mythology], Encyclopaedia Britannica; For a summary of the Chinese text, see [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Xiyouji Xiyouji: NOVEL BY WU CHENG’EN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

==Nomenclature==
[[File:A Hanuman sculpture in Singapore.jpg|left|upright=0.8|thumb|Hanuman with a [[Namaste]] (Anjali Hasta) posture.]]
The meaning or the origin of word "Hanuman" is unclear. In the Hindu pantheon, deities typically have many synonymous names, each based on the noble characteristic or attribute or reminder of that deity's mythical deed.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}} Hanuman has many names like Maruti, Pawansuta, Bajrangbali, Mangalmurti but these names are rarely used. Hanuman is the common name of the vaanar (semi-ape, semi-man) god.

One interpretation of the term is that it means "one having a jaw (''hanu'') that is prominent (''mant'')". This version is supported by a Puranic legend wherein baby Hanuman mistakes the sun for a fruit, attempts to heroically reach it, is wounded and gets a disfigured jaw.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

A second, less common interpretation is that the name derives from the Sanskrit words ''Han'' ("killed" or "destroyed") and ''maana'' (pride); the name implies "one whose pride was destroyed". This epithet resonates with the story in the ''Ramayana'' about his emotional devotion to [[Rama]] and [[Sita]]. He combines two of the most cherished traits in the Hindu [[bhakti]]-[[shakti]] worship traditions: "heroic, strong, assertive excellence" and "loving, emotional devotion to personal god".&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Philip Lutgendorf | title=Hanuman's Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVFC2Nx-LP8C&amp;pg=PA31 | accessdate=14 July 2012 | year= 2007 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-530921-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

A third conjecture is found in Jain texts. This version states that Hanuman spent his childhood on an island called ''Hanuruha'', which served as the origin of his name.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

Linguistic variations of "Hanuman" include ''Hanumat'', Anuman ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]), Hanumantha ([[Kannada]]), Hanumanthudu ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). Other names of Hanuman include:

* ''Anjaneya'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 68|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anjaniputra'' (Kannada), Anjaneyar'' (Tamil), ''Anjaneyudu'' (Telugu), ''Anjanisuta'' all meaning "the son of Hanuman's mother [[Añjanā|Anjana]]".
* ''Kesari Nandan'', based on his father, which means "son of [[Kesari (Ramayana)|Kesari]]"
* ''Maruti'', or the son of the wind god;&lt;ref name="Claus2003p280"/&gt;
* ''Bajrang Bali'', "the strong one (''bali''), who had limbs (''anga'') as hard as a [[vajra]] (''bajra'')"; this name is widely used in rural North India.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

* ''Sankata Mochana'', the remover of dangers (''sankata'')&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

Outside the Indian subcontinent, though his iconography and the details of his legends vary, his names are phonetic similar to the Indian version:

== Historical development ==
[[File:StandingHanumanCholaDynasty11thCentury.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=0.8|Standing Hanuman, [[Chola]] Dynasty, 11th century, [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]

===Vedic roots===
The earliest mention of a divine monkey, interpreted by some scholars as the proto-Hanuman, is in hymn 10.86 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. The twenty-three verses of the hymn are a metaphorical and riddle-filled legend. It is presented as a dialogue between multiple characters: the god [[Indra]], his wife Indrani and an energetic monkey it refers to as ''Vrisakapi'' and his wife ''Kapi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/s/9c ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.८६], Rigveda, Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lutgendorf23/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} The hymn opens with Indrani complaining to Indra that some of the soma offerings for Indra have been allocated to the energetic and strong monkey, and the people are forgetting Indra. The king of the gods Indra responds by telling his wife that the living being (monkey) that bothers her is to be seen as a friend, and that they should make an effort to coexist peacefully. The hymn closes with all agreeing that they should come together in Indra's house and share the wealth of the offerings.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

This hymn, which includes an explicit discussion of sex and differences between species, has been interpreted in a number of ways by contemporary scholars.&lt;ref name=lutgendorf23/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|305}} R.N.&amp;nbsp;Dandekar states that it may metaphorically refer to another fertility god, while Wendy Doniger compares it to a horse sacrifice. Stephanie Jamison states that the hymn mentions a bull-monkey, a euphemism for a horse and fertility ritual, very different from the later era Hanuman. According to Philip Lutgendorf, there is "no convincing evidence for a monkey-worshipping cult in ancient India".&lt;ref name=lutgendorf23&gt;Philip Lutgendorf (1999), [http://www.manushi.in/docs/106.%20Like%20Mother,%20Like%20Son.pdf Like Mother, Like Son, Sita and Hanuman], Manushi, No. 114, pages 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tamil roots===
The orientalist [[F. E. Pargiter]] (1852-1927) theorized that Hanuman was a [[Dravidian folk religion|proto-Dravidian]] deity.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|40}} According to this theory, the name "Hanuman" derives from the Tamil word for male monkey (''ana-mandi''), first transformed to "Anumant" – a name which remains in use. "Anumant", according to this hypothesis, was later Sanskritized to "Hanuman" because the ancient Aryans confronted with a popular monkey deity of ancient Dravidians coopted the concept and then Sanskritized it.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Legend of Ram–Retold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIALB4WXHOMC&amp;pg=PT56 |publisher=PublishAmerica |isbn=978-1-4512-2350-7 |pages=56–|date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Murray Emeneau, known for his Tamil linguistic studies, this theory does not make sense because the Old Tamil word ''mandi'' in [[Sangam literature|Caṅkam literature]] can only mean "female monkey", and Hanuman is male. Further, adds Emeneau, the compound ''ana-mandi'' makes no semantic sense in Tamil, which has well developed and sophisticated grammar and semantic rules. The "prominent jaw" etymology, according to Emeneau, is therefore plausible.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

In Valmiki's ''Ramayana'', estimated to have been composed before or in about the 3rd century BCE, Hanuman is an important, creative character as a simian helper and messenger for Rama. The character evolved over time, reflecting regional cultural values. It is, however, in the late medieval era that his profile evolves into more central role and dominance as the exemplary spiritual devotee, particularly with the popular vernacular text ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' by [[Tulsidas]] (~ 1575 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Ludvik|editor=F.S.

==Birth==

According to Hindu legends, Hanuman was born to [[Añjanā|Anjana]] and father [[Kesari (Ramayana)|Kesari]].&lt;ref name="Williams2008p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Puranas&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nmmkM0fVS-cC Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas Vol 2.(D-H)] pp=628-631, Swami Parmeshwaranand, Sarup &amp; Sons, 2001, {{ISBN|978-81-7625-226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanuman is also called the son of the deity [[Vayu]] (Wind god) because of legends associated with Vayu's role in Hanuman's birth. One story mentioned in [[Eknath]]'s ''Bhavartha Ramayana'' (16th century CE) states that when Anjana was worshiping Shiva, the King [[Dasharatha]] of [[Ayodhya]] was also performing the ritual of [[Putrakameshti|Putrakama]] [[yagna]] in order to have children. As a result, he received some sacred pudding ([[payasam]]) to be shared by his three wives, leading to the births of [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], and [[Shatrughna]]. By divine ordinance, a [[Kite (bird)|kite]] snatched a fragment of that pudding and dropped it while flying over the forest where Anjana was engaged in worship. [[Vayu]], the [[Hindu]] deity of the wind, delivered the falling pudding to the outstretched hands of Anjana, who consumed it. Hanuman was born to her as a result.&lt;ref name=Puranas/&gt;{{vn|date=May 2017}}

==Childhood==
According to Valmiki's Ramayana, one morning in his childhood, Hanuman was hungry and saw the rising red colored [[sun]]. Mistaking it for a ripe fruit, he leapt up to eat it. In one version of the Hindu legend, the king of gods [[Indra]] intervened and struck his thunderbolt. It hit Hanuman on his jaw, and he fell to the earth as dead with a broken jaw. His father, Vayu (air), states Ramayana in section 4.65, became upset and withdrew. The lack of air created immense suffering to all living beings. This led  lord [[Shiva]], to intervene and resuscitate Hanuman, which in turn prompted Vayu to return to the living beings.As the mistaken done by god Indra,he grants Hanuman a wish that his body would be as strong as Indra's [[Vajra]],where as his Vajra can also not harm him.Along with Indra other gods have also granted him wishes such as God [[agni]] granted hanuman a wish that [[fire]] won't harm him,God [[Varuna]] granted a wish for hanuman that [[water]] won't harm him,God [[Vayu]] granted a wish for hanuman that he will be as fast as [[wind]] and the wind won't harm him.Lord [[Brahma]] has also granted hanuman a wish that he can move at any place where he cannot be stopped at anywhere,Lord [[Vishnu]] also grants hanuman a weapon for Hanuman which is named as "Gada".Hence this wishes makes Hanuman a [[Immortality|immortal]],who has unique powers and strong.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Ludvik|title=Hanumān in the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki and the Rāmacaritamānasa of Tulasī Dāsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCXQN0qoAe0C |year=1994|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1122-5|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another Hindu version of his childhood legend, which Lutgendorf states is likely older and also found in [[Jainism|Jain]] texts such as the 8th-century ''Dhurtakhyana'', Hanuman's [[Icarus]]-like leap for the sun proves to be fatal and he is burnt to ashes from the sun's heat. His ashes fall onto the earth and oceans.&lt;ref name=Lutgendorf188/&gt; Gods then gather the ashes and his bones from land and, with the help of fishes, from the water and re-assemble him. They find everything except one fragment of his jawbone. His great-grandfather on his mother's side then asks [[Surya]] to restore the child to life. Surya returns him to life, but Hanuman is left with a disfigured jaw.&lt;ref name=Lutgendorf188&gt;{{cite book | author=Philip Lutgendorf | title=Hanuman's Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVFC2Nx-LP8C&amp;pg=PA31 | accessdate=26 May 2017 | year= 2007 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-530921-8 |pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanuman said to have spend his childhood in [[Kishkindha]].

Some time after this event, Hanuman begins using his supernatural powers on innocent bystanders as simple pranks, until one day he pranks a meditating sage. In fury, the sage curses Hanuman to forget the vast majority of his powers. 

== Adulthood ==
There is quite a lot of variation between what happens between his childhood and the events of the ''Ramayana'', but his story becomes much more solid in the events of the Ramayana. After [[Rama]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]], searching for Rama's kidnapped wife, [[Sita]], arrive in Kishkindha, the new king, and Rama's newfound ally, the monkey king [[Sugriva]], agrees to send scouts in all four directions to search for Rama's missing wife. To the south, Sugriva sends Hanuman and some others, including the great bear [[Jambavan]]. This group travels all the way to the southernmost tip of India, where they encounter the ocean with the island of [[Lanka]] (modern day [[Sri Lanka]]) visible in the horizon. The group wishes to investigate the island, but none can swim or jump so far (it was common for such supernatural powers to be common amongst characters in these epics). However, Jambavan knows from prior events that Hanuman used to be able to do such a feat with ease, and lifts his curse. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Valmiki's Ramayana|last=Pai|first=Anant|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1978|isbn=|location=India|pages=1–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curse lifted, Hanuman now remembers all of his godlike powers. He is said to have transformed into the size of mountain, and flew across the narrow channel to Lanka. Upon landing, he discovers a city populated by the evil king [[Ravana]] and his demon followers, so he shrinks down to the size of an ant and sneaks into the city. After searching the city, he discovers Sita in a grove, guarded by demon warriors. When they all fall asleep, he meets with Sita and discusses how he came to find her. She reveals that Ravana kidnapped her and is forcing her to marry him soon. He offers to rescue her but Sita refuses, stating that her husband must do it (A belief from the time of [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient India]]). &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hanuman|last=Pai|first=Anant|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1971|isbn=|location=India|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What happens next differs by account, but a common tale is that after visiting Sita, he starts destroying the grove, prompting in his capture. Regardless of the tale, he ends up captured in the court of Ravana himself, who laughs when Hanuman tells him that Rama is coming to take back Sita. Ravana orders his servants to light Hanuman's tail on fire as torture for threatening his safety. However, every time they put on an oil soaked cloth to burn, he grows his tail longer so that more cloths need to be added. This continues until Ravana has had enough and orders the lighting to begin. However, when his tail is lit, he shrinks his tail back and breaks free of his bonds with his superhuman strength. He jumps out a window and jumps from rooftop to rooftop, burning down building after building, until much of the city is ablaze. Seeing this triumph, Hanuman leaves back for India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Upon returning, he tells his scouting party what had occurred, and they rush back to Kishkindha, where Rama had been waiting all along for news. Upon hearing that Sita was safe and was awaiting him, Rama gathered the support of Sugriva's army and marched for Lanka. Thus begins the legendary Battle of Lanka.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout the long battle, Hanuman played a role as a general in the army. During one intense fight, Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was fatally wounded and was thought to die without the aid of an [[Sanjeevani (plant)|herb]] from a Himalayan mountain. Hanuman was the only one who could make the journey so quickly, and was thus sent to the mountain. Upon arriving, he discovered that there were many herbs along the mountainside, and did not want to take the wrong herb back. So instead, he grew to the size of a mountain, ripped the mountain from the Earth, and flew it back to the battle. This act is perhaps his most legendary among Hindus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the end, Rama revealed his divine powers as the incarnation of the God Vishnu, and slew Ravana and the rest of the demon army. Finally finished, Rama returned to his home of Ayodhya to return to his place as king. After blessing all those who aided him in the battle with gifts, he gave Hanuman his gift, who threw it away. Many court officials, perplexed, were angered by this act. Hanuman replied that rather than needing a gift to remember Rama, he would always be in his heart. Some court officials, still upset, asked him for proof, and Hanuman tore open his chest, which had an image of Rama and Sita on his heart. Now proven as a true devotee, Rama cured him and blessed him with immortality, but Hanuman refused this and asked only for a place at Rama's feet to worship him. Touched, Rama blessed him with immortality anyways, which according to legend, is set only as long as the story of Rama lives on. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Centuries after the events of the Ramayana, and during the events of the Mahabharata, Hanuman is now a nearly forgotten demigod living his life in a forest. After some time, his half brother through the god [[Vayu]], [[Bhima]], passes through looking for flowers for his [[Draupadi|wife]]. Hanuman senses this and decides to teach him a lesson, as Bhima had been known to be boastful of his superhuman strength (at this point in time supernatural powers were much rarer than in the Ramayana but still seen in the Hindu epics). Bhima encountered Hanuman lying on the ground in the shape of a feeble old monkey. He asked Hanuman to move, but he would not. As stepping over an individual was considered extremely disrespectful in this time, Hanuman suggested lifting his tail up to create passage. Bhima heartily accepted, but could not lift the tail to any avail. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bheema and Hanuman|last=Chandrakant|first=Kamala|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1980|isbn=|location=India|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhima, humbled, realized that the frail monkey was some sort of deity, and asked him to reveal himself. Hanuman revealed himself, much to Bhima's surprise, and the brother's embraced. Hanuman prophesied that Bhima would soon be a part of [[Kurukshetra War|a terrible war]], and promised his brother that he would sit on the flag of his chariot and shout a battle cry that would weaken the hearts of his enemies. Content, Hanuman left his brother to his search, and after that prophesied war, would not be seen again. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Attributes==
Hanuman has many attributes:
[[File:Hanuman fetches the herb-bearing mountain, in a print from the Ravi Varma Press, 1910's.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Hanuman fetches the herb-bearing mountain, in a print from the Ravi Varma Press, 1910s]]
* ''[[Chiranjivi]]'' (immortal): various versions of ''Ramayana'' and ''Rama Katha'' state towards their end, just before Rama and Lakshmana die, that Hanuman is blessed to be immortal. He will be a part of humanity forever, while the story of Rama lives on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joginder Narula|title=Hanuman, God and Epic Hero: The Origin and Growth of Hanuman in Indian Literary and Folk Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-5jAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Manohar Publications|isbn=978-81-85054-84-1|pages=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Kurūp'' and ''Sundar'': he is described in Hindu texts as ''kurūp'' (ugly) on the outside, but divinely ''sundar'' (beautiful inside).&lt;ref name=Lutgendorf188/&gt;
* ''Kama-rupin'': He can shapeshift, become smaller than the smallest, larger than the largest adversary at will.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|45–47, 287}} He uses this attribute to shrink and enter Lanka, as he searches for the kidnapped Sita imprisoned in Lanka. Later on, he takes on the size of a mountain, blazing with radiance, to show his true power to Sita.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Robert P. (Introduction, translation and annotation) (1996).

Princeton University Press, New Jersey. 0691066620. pp. 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Strength'': Hanuman is extraordinarily strong, one capable of lifting and carrying any burden for a cause. He is called ''Vira'', ''Mahavira'', ''Mahabala'' and other names signifying this attribute of his. During the epic war between Rama and Ravana, Rama's brother Lakshmana is wounded. He can only be healed and his death prevented by a herb found in a particular Himalayan mountain. Hanuman leaps and finds the mountain. There, states ''Ramayana'', Hanuman finds the mountain is full of many herbs. He doesn't know which one to take. So, he lifts the entire Himalayan mountain and carries it across India to Lanka for Lakshmana. His immense strength thus helps Lakshmana recover from his wound.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|6, 44–45, 205–210}} This legend is the popular basis for the iconography where he is shown flying and carrying a mountain on his palm.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|61}}
[[File:Hanuman showing Rama in His heart.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Hanuman showing Rama in His heart]]
* ''Innovative'': Hanuman is described as someone who constantly faces very difficult odds, where the adversary or circumstances threaten his mission with certain defeat and his very existence. Yet he finds an innovative way to turn the odds. For example, after he finds Sita, delivers Rama's message, and persuades her that he is indeed Rama's true messenger, he is discovered by the prison guards. They arrest Hanuman, and under Ravana's orders take him to a public execution. There, the Ravana's guards begin his torture, tie his tail with oiled cloth and put it on fire. Hanuman then leaps, jumps from one palace rooftop to another, thus burning everything down.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|140–141, 201}}
* ''Bhakti'': Hanuman is presented as the exemplary devotee (''bhakta'') of Rama and Sita. The Hindu texts such as the ''Bhagavata Purana'', the ''Bhakta Mala'', the ''Ananda Ramayana'' and the ''Ramacharitmanas'' present him as someone who is talented, strong, brave and spiritually devoted to [[Rama]].&lt;ref name=ludvik12&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Ludvik|title=Hanumān in the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki and the Rāmacaritamānasa of Tulasī Dāsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCXQN0qoAe0C |year=1994|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1122-5|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rama stories such as the ''Ramayana'' and the ''Ramacharitmanas'', in turn themselves, present the Hindu [[dharma|dharmic]] concept of the ideal, virtuous and compassionate man (Rama) and woman (Sita) thereby providing the context for attributes assigned therein for Hanuman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A Kapoor|editor=Gilbert Pollet|title=Indian Epic Values: Rāmāyaṇa and Its Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVnK3q48dL0C&amp;pg=PA181 |year=1995|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-6831-701-5|pages=181–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Hindery|title=Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-FswBLvTkvQC&amp;pg=PA100|year =1978|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0866-9|pages=100–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Learned Yogi'': In the late medieval texts and thereafter, such as those by [[Tulasidas]], attributes of Hanuman include learned in [[Vedanta]] philosophy of Hinduism, the [[Vedas]], a poet, a polymath, a grammarian, a singer and musician par excellence.&lt;ref name=ludvik12/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p146"/&gt;
* ''Remover of obstacles'': in devotional literature, Hanuman is the remover of difficulties.&lt;ref name=ludvik12/&gt;

==== Ramayana ====
[[File:Hanuman finds Sita in the ashoka grove, and shows her Rama's ring.jpg|150px|thumb|Hanuman finds Sita in the ashoka grove, and shows her Rama's ring]]

The [[Sundara Kanda]], the fifth book in the Ramayana, focuses on Hanuman. Hanuman meets [[Rama]] in the last year of the latter's 14-year exile, after the demon king Ravana had kidnapped Sita. With his brother [[Lakshmana]], Rama is searching for his wife [[Sita]]. This, and related Rama legends are the most extensive stories about Hanuman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Ludvik|editor=F.S.

Numerous versions of the ''Ramayana'' exist within India. These present variant legends of Hanuman, Rama, Sita, Lakshamana and Ravana. The characters and their descriptions vary, in some cases quite significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter J.

====Mahabharata====
[[File:Hanuman statue and shrine. South of Chennai.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Roadside Hanuman shrine south of [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]]]
The ''Mahabharata'' is another major epic which has a short mention of Hanuman. In Book 3, the Vana Parva of the ''Mahabharata'', he is presented as a half brother of [[Bhima]], who meets him accidentally on his way to Mount Kailasha. A man of extraordinary strength, Bhima is unable to move Hanuman's tail, making him realize and acknowledge the strength of Hanuman. This story attests to the ancient chronology of the Hanuman character. It is also a part of artwork and reliefs such as those at the Vijayanagara ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dallapiccola | first=A.L. | last2=Verghese | first2=Anila | title=Narrative Reliefs of Bhima and Purushamriga at Vijayanagara | journal=South Asian Studies | volume=18 | issue=1 | year=2002 | doi=10.1080/02666030.2002.9628609 | pages=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

==== Other literature ====
Apart from Ramayana and Mahabharata, Hanuman is mentioned in several other texts. Some of these stories add to his adventures mentioned in the earlier epics, while others tell alternative stories of his life. The ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' mentions Hanuman in [[Rameswaram]].&lt;ref name="Eck1991"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diana L.

In a South Indian version of ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', Hanuman is described as the son of Shiva and [[Mohini]] (the female avatar of Vishnu), or alternatively his mythology has been linked to or merged with the origin of Swami [[Ayyappa]] who is popular in parts of South India.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p146"/&gt;

==== Hanuman Chalisa ====
The 16th-century Indian poet [[Tulsidas]] wrote ''[[Hanuman Chalisa]]'', a devotional song dedicated to Hanuman. He claimed to have visions where he met face to face with Hanuman. Based on these meetings, he wrote ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'', an [[Awadhi language]] version of Ramayana.&lt;ref name="Ludvík1994"&gt;{{cite book | author=Catherine Ludvík | title=Hanumān in the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki and the Rāmacaritamānasa of Tulasī Dāsa | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCXQN0qoAe0C&amp;pg=PA164 | accessdate=14 July 2012 | year=1994 | publisher=Motilal Banarasidas publ. | isbn=978-81-208-1122-5 | pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
Hanuman appears with a Buddhist gloss in Tibetan (southwest China) and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotanese]] (west China, central Asia and northern Iran) versions of Ramayana. The Khotanese versions have a [[Jātaka]] tales-like theme, but are generally similar to the Hindu texts in the storyline and character of Hanuman. The Tibetan version is more embellished, and without attempts to include a Jātaka gloss. Also, in the Tibetan version, novel elements appear such as Hanuman carrying love letters between Rama and Sita, in addition to the Hindu version wherein Rama sends the wedding ring with him as a message to Sita. Further, in the Tibetan version, Rama chides Hanuman for not corresponding with him through letters more often, implying that the monkey-messenger and warrior is a learned being who can read and write letters.&lt;ref name=whitfield212&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan Whitfield|author2=Ursula Sims-Williams|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArWLD4Qop38C&amp;pg=PA212 |year=2004|publisher=Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

In the Sri Lankan versions of Ramayana, which are titled after Ravana, the story is less melodramatic than the Indian stories. Many of the legends recounting Hanuman's bravery and innovative ability are found in the Sinhala versions. The stories in which the characters are involved have Buddhist themes, and lack the embedded ethics and values structure according to Hindu dharma.&lt;ref name="Holt2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

In both China and Japan, according to Lutgendorf, much like in India, there is a lack of a radical divide between humans and animals, with all living beings and nature assumed to be related to humans. There is no exaltation of humans over animals or nature, unlike the Western traditions. A divine monkey has been a part of the historic literature and culture of China and Japan, possibly influenced by the close cultural contact through Buddhist monks and pilgrimage to India over two millennia.&lt;ref name= Lutgendorf353/&gt; For example, the Japanese text ''Keiranshuyoshu'', while presenting its mythology about a divine monkey, that is the theriomorphic [[Shinto]] emblem of [[Hie Shrine|Hie]] shrines, describes a flying white monkey that carries a mountain from India to China, then from China to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Karl Payne|title=Re-Visioning "Kamakura" Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5nJT5NYvn4C&amp;pg=PA65| year= 1998|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-2078-7|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Japanese shrines and village boundaries, dated from the 8th to the 14th centuries, feature a monkey deity as guardian or intermediary between humans and gods.&lt;ref name= Lutgendorf353/&gt;&lt;ref name=ohnuki42/&gt;

The Jātaka tales contain Hanuman-like stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Lutgendorf|title=Hanuman's Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVFC2Nx-LP8C |year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804220-4|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Buddha is described as a monkey-king in one of his earlier births in the ''[[Mahakapi Jātaka]]'', wherein he as a compassionate monkey suffers and is abused, but who nevertheless continues to follow [[dharma]] in helping a human being who is lost and in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter D.

=== Jainism ===
{{main article|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}

''Paumacariya'' (also known as ''Pauma Chariu'' or ''Padmacharit''), the [[Jainism|Jain]] version of Ramayana written by Vimalasuri, mentions Hanuman not as a divine monkey, but as a [[Vidyadhara]] (a supernatural being, demigod in Jain cosmology).&lt;ref name=kelting15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Pereira|title=Monolithic Jinas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMTgiygj4-oC |year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-2397-6|pages=36–37, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Pavangati]] (wind deity) and [[Añjanā|Anjana]] Sundari.

In the Jain version, Hanuman is not [[celibate]], Rama is a pious Jaina who never kills anyone, and it is Lakshamana who kills Ravana. Hanuman is a sexually active personality in the Jain versions, marries princess [[Anangakusuma]], the daughter of Kharadushana and [[Ravana]]'s sister Chandranakha. Ravana also presents Hanuman one of his nieces as a second wife. After becoming an ally of [[Sugriva]], Hanuman acquires a hundred more wives. Hanuman becomes a supporter of Rama after meeting him and learning about [[Sita]]'s kidnapping by Ravana. He goes to [[Lanka]] on Rama's behalf, but is unable to convince Ravana to give up Sita. Ultimately, he joins Rama in the war against Ravana and performs several heroic deeds.&lt;ref name="Philip_2007"/&gt;{{rp|50–51}} Later Jain texts, such as ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' (9th century CE) by [[Gunabhadra (Jain monk)|Gunabhadra]] and ''[[Anjana-Pavananjaya]]'' (12th century CE), tell the same story.

In several versions of the Jain ''Ramayana'' story, there are passages that explain to Hanuman, and Rama (called Pauma in Jainism), that attachment to women and pleasures are evil. Hanuman, in these versions, ultimately renounces all social and material life to become a Jain ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eva de Clercq|editor=Colette Caillat and Nalini Balbir|title=Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecKCrO6nLiAC|year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3247-3|pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
In [[Sikhism]], the Hindu god Rama has been referred to as Sri Ram Chandar, and the story of Hanuman as a ''[[siddha]]'' has been influential. After the birth of the martial Sikh [[Khalsa]] movement in 1699, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Hanuman was an inspiration and object of reverence by the Khalsa.&lt;ref name="louis143"/&gt; Some Khalsa regiments brought along the Hanuman image to the battleground. The Sikh texts such as ''Hanuman Natak'' composed by Hirda Ram Bhalla, and ''Das Gur Katha'' by Kavi Kankan describe the heroic deeds of Hanuman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Sikh Zafar-namah of Guru Gobind Singh: A Discursive Blade in the Heart of the Mughal Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUUfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149| year=2013|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993145-3|pages=149–150 with note 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Louis Fenech, the Sikh tradition states that [[Guru Gobind Singh]] was a fond reader of the ''Hanuman Natak'' text.&lt;ref name="louis143"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

During the colonial era, in Sikh [[Seminary|seminaries]] in what is now [[Pakistan]], Sikh teachers were called ''bhai'', and they were required to study the ''Hanuman Natak'', the Hanuman story containing ''Ramcharitmanas'' and other texts, all of which were available in Gurmukhi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Stratton Hawley|author2=Gurinder Singh Mann|title=Studying the Sikhs: Issues for North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWJGAECpClsC&amp;pg=PA98 |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1426-2|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the primary Sikh Scripture, outright rejects the validity of supremacy of Hanuman. [[Bhagat Kabir]], a prominent writer of the scripture explicitly states that the being like Hanuman does not know the glory of the divine.

The non-Indian versions of Ramayana, such as the Thai ''[[Ramakien]]'', mention that Hanuman had relationships with multiple women, including Svayamprabha, [[Trijata|Benjakaya]] (Vibhisana's daughter), [[Suvannamaccha]] and even Ravana's wife [[Mandodari]].&lt;ref name="CamillePrasada2010"/&gt; According to these [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of the Ramayana]], [[Macchanu]] is the son of Hanuman borne by Suvannamaccha, daughter of [[Ravana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ramayana and the Malay shadow-play by Amin Sweeney, Vālmīki|year=1972|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,|pages=238, 246, 440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGrYAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain text ''Paumacariya'' mentions that Hanuman married Lankasundari, the daughter of Lanka's chief defender Bajramukha.&lt;ref name="Truman2006"&gt;{{cite book | author=Truman Simanjuntak | title=Archaeology: Indonesian Perspective : R.P.

Another legend says that a demigod named Matsyaraja (also known as [[Makardhwaja]] or Matsyagarbha) claimed to be his son. Matsyaraja's birth is explained as follows: a fish (''matsya'') was impregnated by the drops of Hanuman's sweat, while he was bathing in the ocean.&lt;ref name="CamillePrasada2010"/&gt; According to ''Parasara Samhita'', Hanuman married Suvarchala, the daughter of [[Surya]] (the Sun God).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wedding-bells-toll-for-lord-hanuman/article3234859.ece |title=Wedding bells toll for Lord Hanuman |newspaper=The Hindu |date=2006-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hanuman in southeast Asian texts differs from the north Indian Hindu version in various ways in the Burmese Ramayana, such as ''Rama Yagan'', ''Alaung Rama Thagyin'' (in the Arakanese dialect), ''Rama Vatthu'' and ''Rama Thagyin'', the Malay Ramayana, such as ''Hikayat Sri Rama'' and ''Hikayat Maharaja Ravana'', and the Thai Ramayana, such as ''Ramakien''. However, in some cases, the aspects of the story are similar to Hindu versions and Jaina or Buddhist versions of Ramayana found elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Uta Gärtner|title=Tradition and Modernity in Myanmar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksqJOnY7sC |year=1994|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-2186-9|pages=305–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Philip Lutgendorf, devotionalism to Hanuman and his theological significance emerged long after the composition of the ''Ramayana'', in the 2nd millennium CE. His prominence grew after the arrival of Islamic rule in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Paula Richman 2010"/&gt; He is viewed as the ideal combination of shakti ("strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence") and bhakti ("loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama").&lt;ref name="lutgendorf26"/&gt; Beyond wrestlers, he has been the patron god of other martial arts. He is stated to be a gifted grammarian, meditating yogi and diligent scholar. He exemplifies the human excellences of temperance, faith and service to a cause.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p177"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lutgendorf 1997 311–332"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ludvik2/&gt;

In 17th-century north and western regions of India, Hanuman emerged as an expression of resistance and dedication against Islamic persecution. For example, the bhakti poet-saint [[Samarth Ramdas|Ramdas]] presented Hanuman as a symbol of Marathi nationalism and resistance to Mughal Empire.&lt;ref name=lele114&gt;{{cite book|author=Jayant Lele|title=Tradition and Modernity in Bhakti Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLs3AAAAIAAJ |year=1981|publisher=Brill Academic|isbn=978-90-04-06370-9|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanuman in the colonial and post-colonial era has been a cultural icon, as a symbolic ideal combination of [[shakti]] and [[bhakti]], as a right of Hindu people to express and pursue their forms of spirituality and religious beliefs ([[dharma]]).&lt;ref name=lutgendorf26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Lutgendorf (2002), Evolving a monkey: Hanuman, poster art and postcolonial anxiety, Contributions to Indian Sociology, Vol 36, Issue 1-2, pages 71-110&lt;/ref&gt; Political and religious organizations have named themselves after him or his synonyms such as ''Bajrang''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=Religion, Caste, and Politics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAO3i_gS61wC |year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=978-93-80607-04-7|page=183 note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinch1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarvepalli Gopal 1993 41–46, 135–137"/&gt; Political parades or religious processions have featured men dressed up as Hanuman, along with women dressed up as ''[[gopi]]s'' (milkmaids) of god Krishna, as an expression of their pride and right to their heritage, culture and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=Religion, Caste, and Politics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAO3i_gS61wC |year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=978-93-80607-04-7|pages=332, 389–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daromir Rudnyckyj|author2=Filippo Osella|title=Religion and the Morality of the Market|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MV5EDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-18605-7|pages=75–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, the Hanuman-linked youth organizations have tended to have a paramilitary wing and have opposed other religions, with a mission of resisting the "evil eyes of Islam, Christianity and Communism", or as a symbol of Hindu nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pathik Pathak|title=Future of Multicultural Britain: Confronting the Progressive Dilemma: Confronting the Progressive Dilemma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QarBgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3546-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chetan Bhatt|title=Hindu nationalism: origins, ideologies and modern myths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2PXAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-343-1|pages=180–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanuman's iconography shows him either with other central characters of the ''Ramayana'' or by himself. If with Rama and Sita, he is shown to the right of Rama, as a devotee bowing or kneeling before them with a [[Namaste]] (Anjali Hasta) posture. If alone, he carries weapons such as a big [[Gada (mace)]] and thunderbolt (''vajra''), sometimes in a scene reminiscent of a scene from his life.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p146"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

In the modern era, his iconography and temples have been common. He is typically shown with Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, near or in Vaishnavism temples, as well as by himself usually opening his chest to symbolically show images of Rama and Sita near his heart. He is also popular among the followers of [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p177"/&gt;

===Festivals and celebrations===
Hanuman is a central character in the annual [[Ramlila]] celebrations in India, and seasonal dramatic arts in southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand; and Bali and Java, Indonesia. Ramlila is a dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' or secondary literature based on it such as the ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=James G.

The Ramlila festivities were declared by UNESCO as one of the "Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity" in 2008. Ramlila is particularly notable in the historically important Hindu cities of [[Ayodhya]], [[Varanasi]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Almora]], [[Satna]] and [[Madhubani district|Madhubani]] – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt;

Hanuman's birthday is observed by some Hindus as Hanuman Jayanti. It falls in much of India in the traditional month of Chaitra in the [[lunisolar]] [[Hindu calendar]], which overlaps with March and April. However, in parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Hanuman Jayanthi is observed in the regional Hindu month of Margazhi, which overlaps with December and January. The festive day is observed with devotees gathering at Hanuman temples before sunrise, and day long spiritual recitations and story reading about the victory of good over evil.&lt;ref name="Melton2010p1310"/&gt;

These performance arts can be traced to at least the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margarete Merkle|title=Bali: Magical Dances|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgQcmPUrO_wC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2012|publisher=epubli|isbn=978-3-8442-3298-1|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been popular, along with the local versions of ''Ramayana'' in other islands of Indonesia such as Java.&lt;ref&gt;J.

=== Thailand ===
Hanuman has been a historic and popular character of [[Ramakien]] in Thai culture. He appears wearing a crown on his head and [[armor]]. He is depicted as an albino white, strong character with open mouth in action, sometimes shown carrying a trident. In ''Ramkien'', Hanuman is a devoted soldier of [[Rama]]. Unlike in Indian adaptations, he is not celibate, and he is presented as a ladies man, according to Paula Richman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paula Richman|title=Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkifYfljHP4C |year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07589-4|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He meets the [[mermaid]] [[Suvannamaccha]] and the couple have a son.

As in the Indian tradition, Hanuman is the patron of martial arts and an example of courage, fortitude and excellence in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Moore|author2=Tim Mousel|title=Muay Thai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IDf4dW99QYC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2008|publisher=New Holland|isbn=978-1-84773-151-7|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In non-religious pop culture==
Hanuman was mentioned in the 2018 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film, [[Black Panther (film)|''Black Panther'']], where he is shown to be the central deity of a complex Indo-African religion followed by the Jabari tribe from the fictional African nation of Wakanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Neil|first1=Tyler|title='Where Is Your God Now?' 3 Religious Objects of Worship in 'Black Panther'|url=https://pjmedia.com/faith/where-is-your-god-now-3-religious-objects-of-worship-in-black-panther |website=PJ Media News|publisher=PJ|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “Hanuman” reference was removed in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/03/12/what-india-can-learn-from-black-panther |title=What India can learn from ‘Black Panther’ |author=Amish Tripathi |date=March 12, 2018 |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher= |access-date=May 17, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/02/21/black-panther-censored-in-india |title='Black Panther' Movie Had a Word Censored in India |author=Nicole Drum |date=February 20, 2018 |website=comicbook.com |publisher= |access-date=May 17, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry FitzRoy''' (born c. 1100-1104, died 1158) was an illegitimate son of [[Henry I of England]] by [[Nest ferch Rhys|Nest]], daughter of [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], last king of Deheubarth (d. 1093), and his wife, Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Turvey, ''The Welsh Princes 1063-1283&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry FitzRoy held lands from his royal father in [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narberth]] and Pebidiog. Upon his death in battle against the Welsh Prince in 1158, his lands passed to his oldest son, [[Meiler FitzHenry|Meilyr]], later [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]] for his cousin, [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]. Amabilis, daughter of Henry FitzRoy, married [[Walter de Riddlesford]]. Her husband Walter, along with Amabilis's uncles, her nephews and the Geralds were active in Irish affairs as well as holding large grants of land there.&lt;ref&gt;"An Hitherto Unnoted Descent from King Henry I", ''NEHGR'', Vol. 116, Oct. 1962, p. 278-279&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1158 Henry FitzRoy led a naval expedition in an attempt to 'assault' the Welsh under [[Owain Gwynedd]], [[List of rulers of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]] 'on both land and sea', on behalf of his Norman cousin, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://meysyddbrwydro.cbhc.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Coleshill-1157-Border-Archaeology-2009.pdf ''Welsh Battlefields, Historical Research: Coleshill (1157)'']; Border Archaeology.&lt;/ref&gt; When FitzRoy's army landed at [[Anglesey|Ynys Môn]], he torched the churches of [[Llanbedrgoch]] and [[Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf]]. During Owain's men gathered together and the next morning fought and defeated the Norman army and killed Henry FitzRoy by a "shower of lances".

Their lifespans would be "[[Wikt:indefinite|indefinite]]" (that is, they would not be "[[Wikt:immortal|immortal]]"), because protection from the effects of aging on health does not guarantee survival. Such individuals would still be susceptible to [[death]] by disease, [[starvation]], accidents, or deliberate killing, but not death from aging.  Semantically, "indefinite lifespan" is more accurate than "[[immortality]]" which, especially in religious contexts, implies an inability to die.

{{main|Longevity escape velocity}}

[[Longevity escape velocity]] is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement.  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being increased faster than time is being expended.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than that year took away by passing by.

==Not immortality==
The terms "[[immortality]]" and "[[eternal youth]]" are often used as synonyms for "indefinite lifespan", but they carry connotations from their other contexts which science has deemed to be impossible. That is, ''immortal'' means "incapable of dying". ''Eternal'' implies guaranteed existence for [[eternity]], and in this context is also implausible because of [[entropy]]. Even if cures were found for all the degenerative diseases, and effective treatments were developed for all the processes of aging, so that bodies could be maintained as easily as cars can be repaired, people would still be killed in [[accident]]s, slain in [[war]]s, [[suicide|choose]] to die, etc.

The term indefinite lifespan represents a more achievable state of affairs, because it merely implies freedom from death by aging or infirmity.

The use of the term is also sometimes favored for reasons of linguistic aesthetics, in the same way that the term [[birth control]] is preferred to "''birth prevention''" or "''birth elimination''" which both imply, as does 'immortality', that the choice is one-time only and has permanent consequences.  Whereas the point of 'indefinite lifespan', like the point of 'birth control', is to gain the opportunity to lead one's life in a more conscious and deliberate manner.

==Probability==
This question is twofold. On the one hand it can be interpreted to mean, "Will a cure (or program of effective treatments) for aging ever be developed?" while on the other hand it could mean "Will the effective treatment of aging become available soon enough for those alive today to take advantage of it?" The answer to the first question is conditional on medical advancement: if medical science continues to advance in the fields of [[biogerontology]] and [[bioengineering]], then some people hope the answer is "yes, that it will happen eventually, except if some event or series of events were to prevent the further advance of biological science" (''see'' [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] ''and the'' [[Doomsday Clock]]). Many scientists researching this area at the moment do not agree. They see a problem in not just individual diseases but in failure of repair mechanisms alluded to above in the discussion of thermodynamic considerations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While science is constantly advancing and technology is becoming ever more sophisticated, the human body and mind are only evolving very slowly, and the aging process has not, in that time, become any more damaging (''which, in short, is why we live three times as long on average in the twenty-first century as we did ten thousand years before'').&lt;ref&gt;Cairns J (1997). “Matters of Life and Death” Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. (see pages 8-13) {{ISBN|9780691002507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer to the second question depends on two factors: the first being ''how fast'' medical science advances, and the second being ''how well'' each person takes care of themself (such as utilizing the best available [[life extension]] technology or not, and generally eating and behaving in a healthful and non-degrading way), both of which may affect whether or not a given person is still alive when the cure (or set of treatments) becomes available. This strategy is captured in the subtitle "Live Long Enough to Live Forever" of the life extension book ''Fantastic Voyage'', by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Terry Grossman]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The second factor to the second question hinges on the first factor - no amount of healthy living will enable somebody alive today to reach the point of indefinite lifespan if medical science is curtailed significantly, or if aging turns out to be massively more complex than currently believed. However, if biomedical gerontology continues to improve, if somatic [[Genetic engineering#Gene therapy|genetic engineering]] becomes safe and effective (and is not banned by opponents) within the relatively near future, it may be conceivable for some of those now alive to attain indefinite lifespans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On the theory that the primary cause of aging is DNA damage [see [[DNA damage theory of aging]] and [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]], there are, in principle, two ways of reducing DNA damage in cells, and thus allowing indefinite extension of lifespan. These are:
# Preventing the occurrence of DNA damage, and
# Repairing the DNA damage after it has occurred.

There is a large body of literature on antioxidant phytochemicals that reduce the occurrence of oxidative DNA damage. However, when intervention trials were carried out using these antioxidants as dietary supplements and cancer as the endpoint, the results generally proved disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Andrew R. |title=Antioxidant intervention as a route to cancer prevention |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=41 |issue=13 |pages=1923–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16111883 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Christina D. |title=Antioxidants and prevention of gastrointestinal cancers |journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=195–200 |year=2013 |pmid=23274317 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835c9d1b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there seems to be evidence that certain dietary components stimulate repair of DNA damage, and protect against cancer as an endpoint. One of these is [[chlorogenic acid]], a major component of, and absorbable from, coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Del Rio |first1=Daniele |last2=Stalmach |first2=Angelique |last3=Calani |first3=Luca |last4=Crozier |first4=Alan |title=Bioavailability of Coffee Chlorogenic Acids and Green Tea Flavan-3-ols |journal=Nutrients |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=820–33 |year=2010 |pmid=22254058 |pmc=3257704 |doi=10.3390/nu2080820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee is protective against colorectal cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Guowei |last2=Ma |first2=Defu |last3=Zhang |first3=Yumei |last4=Zheng |first4=Wei |last5=Wang |first5=Peiyu |title=Coffee consumption and risk of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies |journal=Public Health Nutrition |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=346–57 |year=2013 |pmid=22694939 |doi=10.1017/S1368980012002601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and chlorogenic acid and its metabolites increase the protein expression levels of two DNA repair enzymes: Pms2 and PARP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Harris |last1=Bernstein |first2=Cheray |last2=Crowley-Skillicorn |first3=Carol |last3=Bernstein |first4=Katerina |last4=Dvorak |first5=Harinder |last5=Garewal |chapter=Dietary Compounds that Enhance DNA Repair and their Relevance to Cancer and Aging |pages=99–113 |chapterurl={{Google books|KxzvDlS90tUC|page=99|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Breehn R. |editor1-last=Landseer |year=2007 |title=New Research on DNA Repair |isbn=978-1-60021-385-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another compound that protects against the early stages of cancer is [[naringenin]], a citrus [[flavonoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leonardi |first1=T. |last2=Vanamala |first2=J. |last3=Taddeo |first3=S.

'''Joseph Réginald Topize''' (10 August 1960 – 21 February 1999) professionally known by his stage name '''Kaya''' was a [[Mauritian]] musician and the creator of "[[seggae]]". "Seggae" is a fusion of Mauritian [[Sega music|sega]] and reggae; two of the most popular music genres in Mauritius.

==Musical career==

Topize was born in Roche-Bois in [[Port Louis]] on August 10, 1960, from a family of five children. He was left under the supervision of an uncle as his father, a fisherman, was unable to support his education. Topize did not have a very happy childhood. Being a [[Mauritian of African origin|Mauritian Creole person]] , he was a young victim of racism and found himself left on his own to find odd jobs at the age of 8 years. At 16, he began to learn the guitar. He played hits from artists such as Mike Brant, Santana, Deep Purple, etc., and hosted dances and weddings with his first band, "Wind and Fire".

Topize adopted the name 'Kaya' soon after discovering Bob Marley and reggae music in homage to Marley's album of the same name. Kaya revered Marley and was heavily influenced by him both musically and politically.

Kaya decided to move away from his former music style covering pop-rock groups and became dedicated to both interpret and imitate the music of Bob Marley. Spotted for his talents as a guitarist, he joined the group 'Lélou Menwar'. It was with them that Kaya performed in his first real concert and recorded his first studio album 'Letan lenfer'.

After touring with Lélou Menwar, Kaya gather some friends from his hometown, Roche-Bois, to create the group 'Racinetatan'; named after a Malagasy prince exiled in Mauritius. Kaya and Racinetatan incorporated many of Marley's hits into their performances along with heavily influenced reggae compositions of their own. However, over time Kaya began to question this with the concept of "roots &amp; culture" in mind. Kaya began to see that though he loved reggae and Jamaican culture, this did not fit his reality in Mauritius. In 1986, fueled by his new thought process, Kaya began to mix reggae music in with the local music, Sega.

==Political action==

Kaya also campaigned for the rights of the [[Mauritian Creole people]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On February 16, 1999, the Republican movement organised a free concert for the decriminalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] along Edward VII Street at Rose Hill. Five groups were playing, including Kaya.

Rama Valayden, a Republican later to become Minister of Justice, opened the festivities with a speech in favor of the decriminalization of soft drugs, saying: "mo pou amène dépénalisation, sinon mo pas pou dans gouvernement" as reported by the local press. Valayden then asked the crowd for a show of hands in support of resolutions calling for the decriminalization and appealed to Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam for those imprisoned for possession of marijuana to be amnestied. At the time, about 2000 people or 75% of the prison population were imprisoned for soft drugs offences, with sentences ranging from several months to two years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The crowd was composed of roughly 2000 participants and had a playful and peaceful atmosphere. However, many young people became overexcited and began to smoke marijuana openly. At the time there was no police intervention.{{confusing|date=July 2014}}

Two days after the event, police forces identified five people for smoking or encouraging the smoking of marijuana during the concert and had them reprimanded for questioning. Kaya was among those arrested and admitted to smoking the night of the concert. He was immediately imprisoned in a part of the Barracks Line prison named "Alcatraz", a detention center in Port-Louis usually reserved for the large quantity load drug dealers.

The police issued a request of 10,000 rupees (a considerable amount for the average Mauritian) for the release of the artist. Kaya's wife, aided by his fellow musicians and members of the MR (not Valayden), managed to raise the sum. However, due to various blunders of the lawyers involved and especially a lack of political support for the MR, Kaya was not released on the expected date, February 20. Since this then led on to a weekend, his release date would be postponed until the Monday. This was too late for Kaya and he was found dead in his cell on the morning of Sunday, February 21, 1999.

The official records state that Kaya, suffering from drug withdrawal, threw himself against the walls of his own cell and broke his skull in the process. A coroner from the neighbouring island of Reunion, Dr. Ramstein, contradicted this statement with his examination which claimed Kaya had been beaten to death.

Riots followed soon after causing a major social upheaval in Mauritius resulting in the [[1999 Mauritian riots]].&lt;ref&gt;Vellien, Clifford: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/25/7 Rioting in Mauritius set off by jail death of singer], ''The Guardian'', 25 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of victims of Nazism''' who were noted for their achievements. Many on the lists below were of [[Jewish]] and [[Poles|Polish]] origin, although [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet POWs]], [[Serbs]], [[Catholics]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and dissidents were also murdered. This list includes people from public life who, owing to their [[Ancestry|origins]], their political or religious convictions, or their [[sexual orientation]], lost their lives as victims of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime. It includes those whose deaths were part of [[the Holocaust]] as well as individuals who died in other ways at the hands of the Nazis during World War II. Those who died in [[concentration camp]]s are listed alongside those who were murdered by the [[Nazi Party]] or those who chose [[suicide]] for political motives or to avoid being murdered.

The list is sorted by occupation and by nationality.

George serves as an important symbol for conservation efforts in the [[Galápagos Islands]] and throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nicholls |first=Henry |year=2006 |title=Lonesome George: The Life and Loves of a Conservation Icon |publisher=Macmillan Science |location=London |isbn=1-4039-4576-4}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

George was first seen on the island of [[Pinta_Island|Pinta]] on November 1, 1971, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[malacologist]] József Vágvölgyi. The island's vegetation had been devastated by [[Introduced species|introduced]] [[feral]] goats, and the indigenous ''C. abingdonii'' population had been reduced to a single individual. It is thought that he was named after a character played by [[United States|American]] actor [[George Gobel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sheltered Life: The Unexpected History of the Giant Tortoise|first=Paul|last=Chambers|isbn=978-0719565298|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was relocated for his safety to the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] on [[Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos)|Santa Cruz Island]], where he spent his life under the care of Fausto Llerena, whom the tortoise breeding center is named after.

It was hoped that more Pinta tortoises would be found, either on Pinta or in one of the world’s zoos, similar to the discovery of the Española male in San Diego. George was then penned with two females of a different subspecies. Although eggs were produced, none hatched. Unfortunately, no other Pinta tortoises were found. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] as George was in captivity.

==Mating attempts==
[[File:Giant Tortoise, Galapagos.jpg|thumb|left|Lonesome George walking. October 2008]]
Over the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George had been unsuccessful. This prompted researchers at the Darwin Station to offer a $10,000 reward for a suitable mate.&lt;ref name="planetark"/&gt;

Until January 2011, George was penned with two females of the species ''[[Volcán Wolf giant tortoise|Chelonoidis becki]]'' (from the [[Wolf Volcano]] region of Isabela Island), in the hope his [[genotype]] would be retained in any resulting [[Offspring|progeny]]. This species was then thought to be genetically closest to George's; however, any potential offspring would have been [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, not purebreds of the Pinta subspecies.&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy at giant tortoise eggs|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7522573.stm|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, George mated with one of his female companions. Thirteen eggs were collected and placed in incubators.&lt;ref name="dwindling"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/newsroom/news-releases/2008-11-11_george_eg_fcd|title=Dwindling Hopes of Offspring from Lonesome|publisher=Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Islands|date=November 11, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208171406/http://www.darwinfoundation.org/en/newsroom/news-releases/2008-11-11_george_eg_fcd|archivedate=2008-12-08|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2008, the [[Charles Darwin Foundation]] reported 80% of the eggs showed weight loss characteristic of being inviable.&lt;ref name="dwindling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On July 23, 2009, exactly one year after announcing George had mated, the [[Galápagos National Park]] announced one of George's female companions had laid a second clutch of five eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/breaking-news-world/new-eggs-spark-galapagos-tortoise-hopes-20090722-dt0f.html|title=New eggs spark Galapagos tortoise hopes|date=July 23, 2009|work=WA Today|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park authority expressed its hope for the second clutch of eggs, which it said were in perfect condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/22/lonesome-george-galapagos-tortoise-father|title=Lonesome George, the last Galápagos giant tortoise, may become a dad|date=22 July 2009|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Mark|last=Tran|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs were moved to an incubator, but on December 16, it was announced the incubation period had ended and the eggs were inviable (as was a third batch of six eggs laid by the other female).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Eggs from Lonesome George's Companion are Infertile, Once Again |publisher=Galapagos Conservancy |date=December 16, 2009 |url=http://www.galapagos.org/2008/index.php?id=234 |accessdate=January 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108133342/http://www.galapagos.org/2008/index.php?id=234 |archivedate=November 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, scientists reported Lonesome George was "very closely related to tortoises" from [[Española Island]] (''[[List of species of Galápagos tortoise|C. hoodensis]]'') and [[San Cristóbal Island]] (''[[List of species of Galápagos tortoise|C. chathamensis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Adalgisa |last1=Caccone |first2=James P. |last2=Gibbs |first3=Valerio |last3=Ketmaier |first4=Elizabeth |last4=Suatoni |first5=Jeffrey R. |last5=Powell |title=Origin and evolutionary relationships of giant Galápagos tortoises |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.23.13223 |bibcode=1999PNAS...9613223C |jstor=49147 |pmid=10557302 |year=1999 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=96 |issue=23 |pages=13223–8 |pmc=23929}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2011, two individual ''C. hoodensis'' female partners were imported to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where George lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/8274521/Will-Lonesome-George-finally-find-a-mate.html|title=Will Lonesome George finally find a mate?|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 21, 2011|accessdate=2012-01-11|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Lonesome George taxidermy.jpg|thumb|Taxidermied Lonesome George exhibited at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]]] 
On June 24, 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Galápagos National Park director Edwin Naula announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by Fausto Llerana, who looked after him for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/25/world/americas/lonesome-george-giant-tortoise-dies/index.html|title=Lonesome George, last of the Pinta Island tortoises, dies|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/25/giant-tortoise-lonesome-georges-death-leaves-the-world-one-subspecies-poorer/|title=Giant tortoise Lonesome George’s death leaves the world one subspecies poorer|publisher=nationalpost.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naula suspected that the cause of death was [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="murio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcomercio.com/sociedad/Murio-solitario-George_0_724727540.html|title=El solitario George murió esta madrugada|date=24 June 2012|publisher=[[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=24 June 2012|quote=Naula estima que el fallecimiento se debió a un paro del corazón, propio de que la tortuga ya habría cumplido su ciclo de vida.

|date=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lonesome George.jpg|thumb|Taxidermied Lonesome George on display at the Charles Darwin Research Station.]]
After a short display at the museum, it was expected that Lonesome George would be returned to the Galápagos and displayed at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island for future generations to see.&lt;ref name="UPI 20120628"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tortoise Lonesome George to be embalmed|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/06/28/Tortoise-Lonesome-George-to-be-embalmed/UPI-50671340914410/|publisher=UPI|accessdate=2012-09-16|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a dispute broke out between an Ecuadorean ministry and the Galápagos Islands over where the preserved body of a Galapagos giant tortoise should be housed. The Ecuadorean government wanted him to be shown in the capital, Quito, but the Galápagos local mayor said Lonesome George was a symbol of the islands and should return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-29319048|title=Galapagos tortoise Lonesome George: Dispute over body|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2017, Lonesome George flew back to the Galápagos Islands and is currently on display in an exhibit completely dedicated to him at the Charles Darwin Research Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholls|first1=Henry|title=Welcome home, Lonesome George: giant tortoise returns to Galapagos|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/animal-magic/2017/feb/17/welcome-home-lonesome-george-giant-tortoise-returns-to-galapagos|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources state Lonesome George was more than 100 years old,&lt;ref name="NGC Ingber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GC LG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Bryony|title=Lonesome George, last of the Pinta Island tortoises, dies|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/world/americas/lonesome-george-giant-tortoise-dies/index.html|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others such as [[David Attenborough]] said he was probably in his 80s or possibly even younger.&lt;ref name="planetark" /&gt;&lt;ref name=attenborough&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attenborough|first1=David|title=Galapagos with David Attenborough - part 3|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnugLfyt0FE&amp;t=34m30s|website=YouTube|publisher=Sky Television|accessdate=4 June 2014|quote=...he was given a name to reflect his state: Lonesome George.

== Biological conservation ==
In November 2012, in the journal ''Biological Conservation'', researchers reported identifying 17 tortoises that are partially descended from the same subspecies as Lonesome George, leading them to speculate that related purebred individuals of that subspecies may still be alive.&lt;ref name="NG 20121116"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingber|first=Sasha|title=Lonesome George Not the Last of His Kind, After All?|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/11/121116-lonesome-george-not-extinct-galapagos-tortoise-science/|publisher=National Geographic News|accessdate=2012-11-22|date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, it was reported that the discovery of another species, ''[[Chelonoidis donfaustoi]]'', by Yale researchers had a 90% DNA match to that of the Pinta tortoise and that scientists believe this could possibly be used to resurrect the subspecies. This could mean that he is not the last of his kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hathaway|first=Bill|title=Resurrecting Lonesome George: Relatives of extinct species of tortoise studied in the Galapagos|url=http://news.yale.edu/2015/12/14/resurrecting-lonesome-george-relatives-extinct-species-tortoise-studied-galapagos|date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lloyd-Jones|first=Celia|title=Scientists Are Attempting To Genetically Resurrect The Extinct Galapagos Tortoise|url=https://mpora.com/articles/scientists-attempting-genetically-resurrect-extinct-galapagos-tortoise#mhB4SAvpqFCtuU1u.97|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Management of acute coronary syndrome''' is targeted against the effects of reduced blood flow to the afflicted area of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]], usually because of a [[thrombus|blood clot]] in one of the [[coronary arteries]], the vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the myocardium. This is achieved with urgent hospitalization and medical therapy, including drugs that relieve [[angina|chest pain]] and reduce the size of the infarct, and drugs that inhibit clot formation; for a subset of patients invasive measures are also employed ([[coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]). Basic principles of management are the same for all types of [[acute coronary syndrome]]. However, some important aspects of treatment depend on the presence or absence of [[ST segment elevation|elevation of the ST segment]] on the [[electrocardiogram]], which classifies cases upon presentation to either [[ST segment]] elevation [[myocardial infarction]] (STEMI) or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NST-ACS); the latter includes [[unstable angina]] and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Treatment is generally more aggressive for STEMI patients, and [[reperfusion therapy]] is more often reserved for them. Long term therapy is necessary for prevention of [[relapse|recurrent events]] and [[complication (medicine)|complications]].&lt;ref name="general"&gt;Current management of acute coronary syndrome is based on [[medical guideline|guidelines]], produced by national and international medical societies according to the principles of [[evidence-based medicine]]. Examples are the guidelines of the [[American Heart Association]] and [[American College of Cardiology]] ({{harvnb|O'Gara|2013}}, {{harvnb|Amsterdam|2014}}) and those of the [[European Society of Cardiology]] ({{harvnb|Steg|2012}}, {{harvnb|Hamm|2011}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

== General principles ==
[[File:Heart attack-NIH.gif|thumbnail|400px|Acute coronary syndromes are commonly caused by a [[blood clot]] forming on an [[atherosclerotic plaque]] in a [[coronary artery]]. Oxygen delivery to a part of [[myocardium|heart muscle]] is blocked, eventually causing cell death. ]]
Acute coronary syndromes are caused by sudden and critical reduction of blood flow in one of the coronary arteries, the vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the myocardium (heart muscle), typically by a blood clot. The principal symptom is typically chest pain, known as angina pectoris; people who present with angina must prompt evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome.{{sfn|Hamm|2011|p=3004}}

Acute coronary syndromes are classified to two major categories, according to the patient's electrocardiogram, and specifically the presence or absence of persistent (&gt;20 min) [[ST segment elevation]] (or [[left bundle branch block]]).{{sfn|Hamm|2011|p=3004}} Patients with acute coronary syndrome and ST elevation are said to suffer from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and they tend to have one of their coronary arteries totally blocked.&lt;ref name="Antman 2012a"&gt;{{cite book |last=Antman|first= EM|chapter=Chapter 54.

Patients without ST segment elevation are said to suffer from non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and tend not to have full occlusion of a coronary artery. If there is evidence of myocardial cell death (especially elevated [[cardiac marker|cardiac biomarkers]]) they are considered to have a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); otherwise they are classified as suffering from unstable angina.{{sfn|Cannon|2012|p=1178}} Their management is based on the estimation of their risk for adverse events. Patients at low risk can be adequately treated with medical therapy, in many ways similar to the one used for STEMI (but excluding thrombolytics). Those at moderate to high risk benefit from an early invasive strategy, which includes [[coronary angiography]] and, if necessary, [[revascularization]] with percutaneous coronary intervention or [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].{{sfn|Cannon|2012|p=1194}}

Medical therapy for acute coronary syndromes is based on drugs that act against ischemia and resultant angina and limit the infarct size (i.e., the area of myocardium that is affected), as well as drugs that inhibit clot formation. The latter include [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet agents]], which block the activation and aggregation of [[platelet]]s (cellular blood components that contribute to clot formation), and [[anticoagulant|anticoagulant agents]] (which attenuate the [[coagulation#coagulation cascade|coagulation cascade]]). Long-term therapy in acute coronary syndrome survivors is targeted against recurrence and long term complications ([[preventive healthcare#Secondary prevention|secondary prevention]]).&lt;ref name="general" /&gt;

== Initial diagnostic approach ==

[[Image:12 Lead EKG ST Elevation tracing color coded.jpg|thumb|Typical [[electrocardiogram]] of an [[ST segment]] elevation myocardial infarction. ST elevation in [[electrocardiography#leads|leads]] I, aVL and V1-V5 indicates an anterior wall myocardial infarction and is shown in orange; reciprocal ST depression in leads II, III and aVF is shown in blue.]]In patients with symptoms typical of myocardial ischemia an electrocardiogram must be immediately obtained - e.g., within 10 minutes from first contact with medical or paramedical personnel, including [[Emergency medical services|prehospital]] setting; the [[Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction|electrocardiographic findings]] will guide the subsequent management. Patients with [[ST elevation|elevation of the ST segment]] (or presumed new [[LBBB|left bundle branch block]]) are treated based on guidelines for [[ST elevation myocardial infarction]] (STEMI) and must undergo reperfusion therapy as soon as possible. Serum [[Cardiac marker|cardiac biomarkers]] are routinely obtained and their elevation is necessary for confirming diagnosis of myocardial infarction;&lt;ref name="Thygesen 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thygesen|first1=K; Alpert, JS; Jaffe, AS; Simoons, ML; Chaitman, BR; White, HD|title=Third universal definition of myocardial infarction|journal=European Heart Journal|date=2012|volume=33|pages=2551–2567 |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehs184|pmid=22922414|url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/20/2551.full.pdf|issue=20}}p. 2553&lt;/ref&gt; however, reperfusion must not be delayed by waiting for the results. Patients without the above findings are initially classified as suffering from non ST elevation [[acute coronary syndrome]], and subsequent cardiac biomarker results will differentiate between true [[non ST elevation myocardial infarction]] (NSTEMI) and [[unstable angina]].{{sfn|Steg|2012|p=2574}}{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=14}}{{sfn|O'Gara|2013|p=e370}}

== Relief of angina ==

Relief of the pain of angina is of paramount importance, not only for humane reasons but because the pain is associated with [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]] that causes [[vasoconstriction]] and increases the workload of the heart.{{sfn|Steg|2012|p=2574}} The pain of myocardial ischemia is likely to respond to any intervention that improves the relationship between oxygen demand and supply, like [[nitrates]], [[beta blockers]] and [[oxygen therapy|oxygen]].{{sfn|Antman|2012b|p=1116}}

=== Nitrates ===

Nitrates, like [[Medical use of nitroglycerin|nitroglycerin]], dilate blood vessels, which is beneficial against myocardial ischemia in two ways: By increasing blood flow in the coronary arteries and the amount of oxygen that arrives to heart muscle; and by relaxing all blood vessels in the body, thereby reducing the workload that heart needs to produce against them and the oxygen it consumes. The preferred mode of administration is [[sublingually]]. By relaxing blood vessels nitrates also reduce blood pressure, which must be carefully [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitored]]; they must not be used if [[hypotension]] is present. They must also be avoided in patients who have taken [[sildenafil]] or other [[PDE5 inhibitor|phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors]] (used for [[erectile dysfunction]]) within the previous 24–48 hours, as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure. {{sfn|Antman|2012b|p=1116}}{{sfn|Cannon|2012|p=1185}}&lt;ref name="Cheitlin 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheitlin|first1=MD; Hutter, AM, Jr, Brindis; RG|title=Use of Sildenafil (Viagra) in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease|journal=Circulation|date=1999|volume=99|page=|pages=168–177|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.99.1.168|pmid=9884398|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/99/1/168.full|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]] nitrates are useful in patients with hypertension or [[pulmonary edema]].{{sfn|Steg|2012|p=2598}}

=== Beta blockers ===

By reducing [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] stimulation of the heart, [[beta blockers]] decrease heart rate, blood pressure and [[cardiac output]], and hence heart oxygen consumption. Beta-blockers alleviate ischemic pain, and have also been proved to reduce the size of infarcted heart muscle, the risk of [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]], and the proportion of patients with acute coronary syndrome who actually evolve STEMI. However, they have also been shown to increase the risk of [[Acute decompensated heart failure|acute heart failure]]. Their early use is contraindicated if there are signs of [[congestive heart failure]] (e.g., [[Killip class]] II or above) or hypotension, along with other [[Beta blocker#Contraindications|contraindications to beta blockers]] ([[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], [[atrioventricular block]]); in the absence of contraindications beta blocker therapy should begin in the first 24 hours. It may be prudent to prefer oral rather than intravenous forms.&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Oxygen therapy ===

Initial administration of oxygen to all patients with acute coronary syndrome is common practice; however, there is no evidence to support or refute that supplemental oxygen might be harmful or beneficial for cardiac patients who do not need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabello|first=Juan B.|last2=Burls|first2=Amanda|last3=Emparanza|first3=José I.|last4=Bayliss|first4=Susan E.|last5=Quinn|first5=Tom|date=2016|title=Oxygen therapy for acute myocardial infarction|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD007160|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007160.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27991651|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently recommended to give oxygen only to breathless patients or when [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|blood oxygen saturation]] is low, e.g. &lt;90%.{{sfn|Antman|2012b|p=1116}}{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=30}}

=== Analgesics ===

Analgesic agents that are most commonly used are [[opioids]], and especially [[morphine]], which is considered the analgesic of choice in patients with ST elevation. Along with its pain-controlling properties, morphine also reduces the work of breathing, alleviates breathlessness, reduces anxiety and has favorable action on [[hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] parameters and cardiac oxygen consumption.{{sfn|Antman|2012b|p=1116}}{{sfn|Steg|2012|p=2576}}&lt;ref name="Hilal-Dandan 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilal-Dandan|first1=R|last2=Brunton|first2=L|title=Goodman and Gilman Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0071769174|page=291|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in patients presenting without ST elevation, morphine has been shown to have adverse events potential, and its use is considered acceptable only after inadequate pain relief by medication specific against [[angina]].{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=31}} [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s are contraindicated for both categories of patients.{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=31}}{{sfn|O'Gara|2013|p=e391}}

== Antiplatelet drugs==
All patients with acute coronary syndrome must immediately receive [[antiplatelet|antiplatelet therapy]], including aspirin and generally a second oral antiplatelet agent.&lt;ref name="Opie 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=LH; Garsh BJ|title=Drugs for the heart|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=9781455733224|pages=471–472|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleeding is the most important side-effect of antiplatelets.

=== Aspirin ===
Aspirin inhibits [[platelet]] aggregation and formation of blood clots. It is effective across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes, and it actually has been shown to reduce the [[mortality rate|rate of death]] in patients with STEMI and in patients presenting without ST elevation.  Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with documented allergy or known platelet disorder. Patients who have had gastrointestinal symptoms while on long-term aspirin therapy are usually able to tolerate aspirin in the short term. For patients with true intolerance to aspirin [[clopidogrel]] is recommended. Lower doses need days to achieve full antiplatelet effect, therefore a [[loading dose]] is necessary for patients who are not already on aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Antman|2012b|p=1115}}  
* {{harvnb|Amsterdam|2014|p=39}}

* {{harvnb|Hamm|2011|p=3013}} 
* {{harvnb|Cannon|2012|p=1186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== P2Y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors ===
Aside of aspirin, three antiplatelet agents taken by mouth have been approved for use in acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel, [[ticagrelor]] and [[prasugrel]]; all reduce platelet aggregation by inhibiting the [[P2Y12|P2Y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], a type of [[adenosine phosphate]] receptor, on the surface of platelets. Not all three of them are equally indicated in all types of acute coronary syndromes. In patients with ST elevation the choice of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor depends on reperfusion strategy; for patients undergoing primary [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] ticagrelor and prasugrel are considered superior to clopidogrel, as they are more potent and have more rapid onset of action, at the cost of some increase in bleeding risk; for STEMI patients who are treated with [[fibrinolysis]] and those who do not undergo reperfusion treatment only clopidogrel is indicated. Prasugrel must not be given to patients with a history of [[Stroke#ischemic|ischemic stroke]] or aged 75 years or older. In patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome current guidelines also recommend immediate administration of dual antiplatelet therapy upon diagnosis; clopidogrel and ticagrelor are indicated in this setting, with ticagrelor considered superior for patients undergoing early invasive strategy (see later). However, emerging evidence questions this strategy.&lt;ref name="Bellemain-Appaix 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellemain-Appaix|first1=A; Kerneis, M; O'Connor, SA|title=Reappraisal of thienopyridine pretreatment in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMJ|date=2014|volume=349|page=g6269|doi=10.1136/bmj.g6269|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6269|accessdate=2 November 2014|display-authors=etal|pmid=25954988|pmc=4208629}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with aspirin, it is necessary to administer a loading dose.{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=37-40}}{{sfn|Steg|2012|p=2583-2584, 2587-2588, 2591}}

=== Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors ===
[[Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors]] are a class of intravenous antiplatelet agents used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, consisting of [[abciximab]], [[eptifibatide]] and [[tirofiban]]. Patients presenting with ST elevation that will be reperfused with percutaneous coronary intervention may receive one of the above agents at the time of [[cardiac catheterization|catheterization]], or perhaps before. Administering eptifibatide or tirofiban may also be reasonable in patients presenting with NST-ACS who are considered of intermediate or high risk and are treated with early invasive strategy.{{sfn|O'Gara|2012|p=377-378}}{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=38}}&lt;!--PREVIOUS SECTION ON ANTIPLATELETS

==Anticoagulants==

Anticoagulants in acute coronary syndrome are targeted against the coronary blood clot, as well as towards prevention of thrombotic complications, like formation of blood clots in the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s, [[stroke]], [[pulmonary embolism]] or [[deep vein thrombosis]].{{sfn|Antman|2012b|p=1029}} Patients undergoing PCI also need an anticoagulant to prevent [[catheter]] thrombosis. Options include [[unfractionated heparin]], [[enoxaparin]] (a [[low molecular weight heparin]]), [[fondaparinux]] (a [[Oligosaccharide|pentasaccharide]] antagonist of [[factor Xa]]) and [[bivalirudin]] (a [[direct thrombin inhibitor]]); all the above agents are given [[Route of administration#Parenteral|parenterally]] (subcutaneously or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]). Unfractionated heparin has the disadvantage of requiring dose adjustment based on a laboratory exam, [[activated partial thromboplastin time]] (APTT). In STEMI patients choice depends on the reperfusion strategy used (see below); bivalirudin is used when PCI is employed only, while in the same case fondaparinux is not preferred.{{sfn|Steg|2012|p=2584-5, 2587-91}} Similarly, in Non-STE ACS bivalirudin too is only used when an early invasive strategy is chosen.{{sfn|Amsterdam|2014|p=41-43}}

They are therefore candidates for immediate reperfusion, either with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic therapy]], [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) or when these therapies are unsuccessful, [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

Individuals without ST segment elevation are presumed to be experiencing either unstable angina (UA) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). They receive many of the same initial therapies and are often stabilized with [[antiplatelet drug]]s and [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulated]]. If their condition remains ([[Hemodynamics|hemodynamically]]) stable, they can be offered either late [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] with subsequent restoration of blood flow (revascularization), or [[Minimally invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]] to determine if there is significant ischemia that would benefit from revascularization.  If hemodynamic instability develops in individuals with NSTEMIs, they may undergo urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization. The use of thrombolytic agents is contraindicated in this patient subset, however.&lt;ref name="FTT_Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7905143 | title = Indications for fibrinolytic therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction: collaborative overview of early mortality and major morbidity results from all randomised trials of more than 1000 patients.

The basis for this distinction in treatment regimens is that ST segment elevations on an ECG are typically due to complete occlusion of a coronary artery. On the other hand, in NSTEMIs there is typically a sudden narrowing of a coronary artery with preserved (but diminished) flow to the distal myocardium. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are given to prevent the narrowed artery from occluding.

At least 10% of patients with STEMI do not develop myocardial necrosis (as evidenced by a rise in cardiac markers) and subsequent Q waves on EKG after reperfusion therapy. Such a successful restoration of flow to the infarct-related artery during an acute myocardial infarction is known as "aborting" the myocardial infarction. If treated within the hour, about 25% of STEMIs can be aborted.&lt;ref name=Verheught2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verheugt FW, Gersh BJ, Armstrong PW | year = 2006 | title = Aborted myocardial infarction: a new target for reperfusion therapy | url = | journal = Eur Heart J | volume = 27 | issue = 8| pages = 901–4 | pmid = 16543251 | doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation==
Additional objectives are to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias or conduction disturbances. This requires monitoring in a [[coronary care unit]] and protocolized administration of [[antiarrhythmic agent]]s.  Antiarrhythmic agents are typically only given to individuals with life-threatening arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction and not to suppress the [[premature ventricular contraction|ventricular ectopy]] that is often seen after a myocardial infarction.&lt;ref name="Echt-1991"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1056/NEJM199103213241201 |vauthors=Echt DS, Liebson PR, Mitchell LB, Peters RW, Obias-Manno D, Barker AH, Arensberg D, Baker A, Friedman L, Greene HL | title= Mortality and morbidity in patients receiving encainide, flecainide, or placebo.

==Special cases==

===Cocaine===
[[Cocaine]] associated myocardial infarction should be managed in a manner similar to other patients with acute coronary syndrome, except that [[beta blocker]]s should not be used and [[benzodiazepines]] should be administered early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=McCord J, Jneid H, Hollander JE, etal |title=Management of cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Acute Cardiac Care Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology |journal=Circulation |volume=117 |issue=14 |pages=1897–907 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18347214 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.188950 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The treatment itself may have complications. If attempts to restore the blood flow are initiated after a critical period of only a few hours, the result may be a [[reperfusion injury]] instead of amelioration.&lt;ref name=Faxon2005&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16450811 | volume=28 | issue=11 Suppl 1 | journal = Clinical Cardiology |date=November 2005 | title = Coronary interventions and their impact on post myocardial infarction survival.  | pages=I38–44 | author=Faxon DP | doi=10.1002/clc.4960281307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness setting===
In [[wilderness first aid]], a possible heart attack justifies [[patient evacuation|evacuation]] by the fastest available means, often meaning the initiation of a [[MEDEVAC]]. The suspicion or provisional diagnosis of an MI means that it is inappropriate for the patient to walk out of the wilderness setting and will require them to be carried or conveyed in a vehicle.  Aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen can all be given with relative ease in a wilderness setting and should be administered as soon as possible in suspected cases of MI.  Wilderness management of [[Cardiac Arrest|cardiac arrest]] differs slightly from that carried out in an urban setting in that it is generally considered acceptable to terminate a resuscitation attempt after 30 minutes if there has been no change in the patient's condition.

===Air travel===
Certified personnel traveling by commercial aircraft may be able to assist an MI patient by using the on-board [[first aid kit]], which may contain some cardiac drugs (such as [[glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] spray, [[aspirin]], or [[opioid]] painkillers), an [[Automated external defibrillator|AED]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngwith|first=Janice|title=Saving hearts in the air|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/special/americanheartmonth/2008/index.asp?id=11|publisher=Dailyherald.com|date=2008-02-06|accessdate=2008-06-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oxygen]].

==Nitroglycerin==

Nitroglycerin is used in the treatment of ACS/IHD to relieve anginal symptoms. It is associated with the decrease in myocardial stress due to peripheral vasodilation. The decrease of stress also decreases oxygen demand of the heart. The first line treatment for symptomatic relief of angina is sub-lingual nitroglycerin. Other formulations such as spray and IV can also be used.&lt;ref name=AHA2007&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Anderson JL, Adams CD, Antman EM, etal |title=ACC/AHA 2007 guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 2002 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina/Non ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction): developed in collaboration with the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons: endorsed by the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation and the [[Society for Academic Emergency Medicine]] |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=e148–304 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17679616 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.181940 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the body nitroglycerin donates three nitric oxide molecules, which activate a second messenger system leading to release of calcium ions. The release of calcium ions leads to a relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and vasodilation. Nitroglycerin should not be given if any phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as Viagra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheitlin|first=Melvin|title=Use of Sildenafil (Viagra) in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/99/1/168.full|accessdate=9/6/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cialis, Stondra, and Levitra have been taken by the casualty within the previous 24–48 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheitlin|first=Melvin|title=Use of Sildenafil (Viagra) in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/99/1/168.full|publisher=AHA|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure.  It should not be given to patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90mmHg or 30mmHg or more below baseline.

==Beta Blockers==
In theory β-blockers decrease the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart. Since it is known that the sympathetic nervous system increases the heart rate and blood pressure in order to increase the cardiac output. Hence its blockage spares the heart the extra work load. So, the immediate intravenous administration of beta blockers reduces [[cardiac index]], [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bates ER | year = 2007 | title = Role of intravenous beta-blockers in the treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Of mice and men | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 2904–2906 | doi=10.1161/circulationaha.107.707968 | pmid=17562966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Favorable effects are reduction in [[chest pain]], in the proportion of patients with threatened infarction who actually evolve STEMI and in the development of [[ventricular arrhythmias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Freemantle N, etal | year = 1999 | title = Beta blockade after myocardial infarction: Systematic review and meta regression analysis | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 318 | issue = 7200| pages = 1730–7 | doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7200.1730 | pmid=10381708 | pmc=31101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reasonable to administer iv beta blockers promptly to STEMI patients, especially if a [[tachyarrhythmia]] or [[hypertension]] is present, in the absence of signs of [[heart failure]] or low output, increased risk of developing [[shock]] or other relative [[contraindication]]s to beta blockers.&lt;ref&gt;Braunwald, E.

'''Maria Brizzi Giorgi''' (7 August 1775{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1812 in Bologna) was an [[Italians|Italian]] organist, composer and pianist noted for her improvisational ability. She was born in [[Bologna]] into a musical family, and began to perform in public at an early age. She served as organist and choral director from 1787–89 with the Sisters of St. Bartholomew in [[Ancona]], and then returned to Bologna where she continued her studies in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA87 |title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brizzi married Luigi Giorgi in 1793 and opened a salon, continuing to perform as a pianist in Europe. She was admired as a performer, and [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi]] and [[Leopold Kozeluch]] dedicated works to her. A military march composed by Brizzi was performed for [[Napoleon]] when he passed through Bologna in 1807. She taught music and was member of the [[Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intreccifemminili.com/Eng/Brizzi_E.html|title=Brizzi Giorgi, Maria|author=Barandoni, Stefano|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Bologna after childbirth at the age of 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Killed the Great and Not So Great Composers?|first=Joseph W.|last=Lewis, Jr. M.d.|first2=Joseph W.|last2=Lewis, Jr., M.D.|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marian "Clover" Hooper Adams''' (September 13, 1843 &amp;ndash; December 6, 1885) was an [[Americans|American]] [[socialite]], active society hostess, and arbiter of [[Washington, DC]], and an accomplished amateur [[photographer]].

Clover, who has been cited as the inspiration for writer [[Henry James]]'s ''[[Daisy Miller]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881), was married to writer [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]]. After her suicide, he commissioned the famous [[Adams Memorial (grave marker)|Adams Memorial]], which features an enigmatic [[androgyny|androgynous]] bronze sculpture by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], to stand at the site of her, and his, grave.

After Clover's death, Adams destroyed all the letters that she had ever written to him and rarely, if ever, spoke of her in public. She was also omitted from his ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]]''. However, in letters to her friend Anne Palmer Fell, he opened up about his 12 years of happiness with Clover and his difficulty in dealing with her loss.&lt;ref name=letters&gt;[http://www.masshist.org/features/clover-adams/selected-letters "Marian Hooper Adams: Selected Letters"], Massachusetts Historical Society. Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the third and youngest child &lt;ref&gt;1850 Suffolk Co., MA, U.S. Federal Census, Boston Ward 9, September 13, sht. 242, p. 294 B, line 32&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Robert William Hooper]] (1810 - April 15, 1885) and [[Ellen Sturgis Hooper|Ellen H. Sturgis]] (1812-November 3, 1848). Her siblings were Ellen Sturgis "Nella" Hooper (1838–1887), who married professor Ephraim Whitman Gurney (1829–1886);&lt;ref&gt;1870 Middlesex Co., MA, U.S. Federal Census, Cambridge Ward 1, July 5, sht. 29, p. 252 A, line 40&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward William "Ned" Hooper (1839–1901). The Hooper family was wealthy and prominent. Clover's birthplace and childhood home in Boston, was at 114 Beacon Street, [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]].&lt;ref name=cox-marylee.tripod.com&gt;{{cite web |title=A Walking Tour in Boston's Back Bay - #5 |first=Mary Lee |last=Cox |work=Cox-Marylee.tripod.com |url=http://cox-marylee.tripod.com/backbaywalk.htm |year=1999 |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was five years old, her mother, a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] poet,&lt;ref name=vcu.edu&gt;{{cite web |title=American Transcendentalism Web - Selected Poems of Ellen Sturgis Hooper |first= |last= |work=VCU.edu |url=http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/hooperpoems.html |date= |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; died and she became very close to her physician father. She was [[private school|privately]] educated at a [[single-sex education|girls school]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], which was run by [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz|Elizabeth]] and [[Louis Agassiz]].

Clover Hooper volunteered for the [[United States Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. She defied convention by insisting on watching the [[Grand Review of the Armies|review]] of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s armies in 1865. In 1866, she traveled abroad, where she is said to have met fellow Bostonian Henry Adams in [[London]]. Her father and she were living at their home in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], in July 1870.&lt;ref&gt;1870 Essex Co., MA, U.S. Federal Census, Beverly, July 14, sht. 159, p. 224 A, line 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 1872, Adams and she were married in Boston, and spent their honeymoon in Europe. Upon their return, he taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and their home at 91 Marlborough Street, Boston,&lt;ref name="cox-marylee.tripod.com"/&gt; became a gathering place for a lively circle of [[intellectual]]s. In 1877, they moved to Washington, DC, where their home on [[President's Park#Lafayette Park|Lafayette Square]], across from the [[White House]], became a popular place for socializing.

Clover remained close to her father, writing him regularly. In June 1880, Dr. Hooper was living at his household on Beacon Street in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;1880 Suffolk Co., MA, U.S. Federal Census, Boston, 114 Beacon St., Enumeration Dist. 658, June 10, sht. 34, p. 31 B, line 40&lt;/ref&gt; Her gossipy letters to her father, other family members, and friends, reveal her to be a gifted reporter and provide an insightful view of the Washington and politics of the day, while the ones she wrote from Europe are not ordinary travel letters, but shrewd reflections on character and society, revealing a critical and sprightly mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', December 6, 1936, "Revealing Letters of Henry Adams's Wife. Woman of Mystery Shown as Gay, Observant Reporter of Notable Events in a Care-free World," p. C67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', December 13, 1936, "The Lively Correspondence of Mrs. Henry Adams; The Husband Airily Sketched Here Is Not Much Like the Misanthrope of the ''Education''," p. BR3&lt;/ref&gt;

From her reports written in letters, it was widely speculated that actually Clover Hooper Adams  was the "anonymous" author of ''[[Democracy: An American Novel]]'' (1880), which was not credited to her husband until 43 years later.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost.com&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earlier D.C. "Anonymous" |first=Sarah Booth |last=Conroy |work=WashingtonPost.com |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/tours/scandal/clvradam.htm |date=1996-02-05 |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
[[File:Clover Adams.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Clover Adams]]
In 1883, Clover became active in photography and was one of the earliest [[portrait photography|portrait]] photographers. Familiarizing herself with the chemicals, she did all her own [[photographic processing|developing]].

Her photographs, which reveal an extraordinary eye, consist of formal and informal portraits of politicians, family friends, various members of the Adams and Hooper families, family pets, and still lifes of interior and exterior locales, including photographs of Washington, [[Bladensburg, Maryland]], [[Sweet Springs, West Virginia|Old Sweet Springs]], and the Adams family homes in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Beverly Farms, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=masshist.org&gt;{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Historical Society - Guide to the Photograph Collection of Marian Hooper Adams |first= |last= |work=MassHist.org |url=http://www.masshist.org/findingaids/doc.cfm?fa=fap007 |date= |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These images provide insights into 19th-century America and a woman's place in it.&lt;ref name=hope.edu&gt;{{cite web |title=Hope College Press Releases - NEH Awards Fellowships to Two Professors |first=Natalie |last=Dykstra |work=Hope.edu |url=http://www.hope.edu/pr/pressreleases/content/view/full/3165 |date=2005-02-10 |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the images, Clover also left behind a great deal of information about her photography, including meticulous chronological notes she kept while working in her [[darkroom]], listing photographs and commenting on [[Exposure (photography)|exposures]], [[light]]ing, etc., and the references in her letters.

Her work was widely admired, although her husband apparently would not allow her to become professional and discouraged any publication of her photographs.

==Final years==
[[File:Marian Hooper Adams Monument.jpg|thumb|Adams' monument in Rock Creek Cemetery]]
The Adams' letters reveal their household to be a normal and happy one. In the beginning, he confessed himself "absurdly in love," and she spoke again and again of Henry's "utter devotion."

Clover and her husband hired architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H.H. Richardson]] and were in the process of having a new home built on Lafayette Square, which was adjacent to the Richardson-designed house being built for [[John Hay]], when her adored father died on April 13, 1885. After Dr. Hooper's death, she sank into bouts of overwhelming [[clinical depression|depression]].

While awaiting the completion of the house, they rented one nearby on [[H Street (Washington, D.C.)|H Street]]. Clover documented the construction of the houses with her camera.

While alone in her bedroom on a Sunday in early December, 1885, she swallowed [[potassium cyanide]], which she used in developing her photographs.

Clover Hooper Adams died at age 42 at her temporary home on H Street in Washington, DC, and was found by her husband lying on the rug before her bedroom fire. The evening newspaper reported that she had suddenly dropped dead from paralysis of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', December 7, 1885, "Mrs. Henry Adams's Sudden Death," p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband commissioned sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and architect [[Stanford White]] to create a memorial to mark her grave in [[Rock Creek Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=nga.gov&gt;{{cite web|title=The Adams Memorial|first=|last=|work=NGA.gov|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/shaw/s2110.shtm|date=|accessdate=2007-11-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509100606/http://www.nga.gov/feature/shaw/s2110.shtm|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The haunting [[Adams Memorial (grave marker)|Adams Memorial]] is probably the most famous of all monuments in the cemetery and is generally considered to be Saint-Gaudens' most famous sculpture.

In a letter of December 5, 1886, to Clover's friend Anne Palmer Fell, Henry Adams wrote: "During the last eighteen months I have not had the good luck to attend my own funeral, but with that exception I have buried pretty nearly everything I lived for."&lt;ref name=letters/&gt;

In a letter to Henry Adams, John Hay wrote, "Is it any consolation to remember her as she was? That bright, intrepid spirit, that keen, fine intellect, that lofty scorn for all that was mean, that social charm which made your house such a one as Washington never knew before and made hundreds of people love her as much as they admired her." In a letter to a friend [[Henry James]] wrote, "poor Mrs. Adams found, the other day, the solution of the knottiness of existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Henry|title=Henry James Letters: 1883-1895|year=1980|origyear=1886|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-674-38782-1|pages=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLMS967ykasC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9638">[[Image:Logosnks.gif|thumb|This logo, created by [[Glenn D. Paige]], explains the concept of nonkilling combining the ancient Asian [[yin-yang]] symbol with the recent brain research finding that stimulation of the pathways between systems of the brain controlling emotions and movement can assist change from violent to nonviolent human behavior. Analogously Creative Transformational Initiatives (blue), drawing upon Nonkilling Human Capabilities (white), can bring an end to Human Killing (red).]]

'''Nonkilling''' refers to the absence of killing, threats to kill, and conditions conducive to killing in human society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18 Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the use of the term in the academic world refers mostly to the killing of human beings, it is sometimes extended to include the killing of animals and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Kool and Rita Agrawal, "The Psychology of Nonkilling", in ''Toward a Nonkilling Paradigm'', edited by Joám Evans Pim. Honolulu: Center for Global Nonkilling, 2009 .&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case for the traditional use of the term "nonkilling" (or "non-killing") as part of [[Buddhist ethics]], as expressed in the first precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]],&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 187. Buddhist Scriptures in Pali language have explicit reference to nonviolence and nonkilling: monks should not only themselves abstain from killing but should also refrain from encouraging other people to kill themselves (Vinayapitaka III: .71-74)&lt;/ref&gt; and in similar terms throughout world spiritual traditions. (See [[:en:wikiversity:School:Nonkilling studies#Program on Nonkilling Spiritual Traditions|Nonkilling studies]]). Significantly, "nonkilling" has also been used recently in the "Charter for a World without Violence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/CHARTER/charter.htm 8th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, ''Charter for a World without Violence.'' Rome, December 15, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510024109/http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/CHARTER/charter.htm |date=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the 8th World Summit of [[Nobel Peace Laureate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"To address all forms of violence we encourage scientific research in the fields of human interaction and dialogue and we invite participation from the academic, scientific and religious communities to aid us in the transition to nonviolent, and nonkilling societies".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
In analysis of its causes, nonkilling encompasses the concepts of [[peace]] (absence of war and conditions conducive to war), [[nonviolence]] (psychological, physical, and structural), and [[ahimsa]] (noninjury in thought, word and deed).&lt;ref name="eolss.net"&gt;"Nonkilling Global Society", in Peace Building, edited by [[Ada Aharoni]], in ''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)'', Developed under the auspices of the [[UNESCO]], 2005, [http://www.eolss.net Eolss Publishers, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt; Not excluding any of the latter, nonkilling provides a distinct approach characterized by the measurability of its goals and the open-ended nature of its realization. While the usage of terms such as "nonviolence" and "peace" often follow the classical form of argument through abstract ideas leading to passivity, killing (and its opposite, nonkilling),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author1=Joám Evans Pim |author2=Stephen M. Younger |author3=Leslie E. Sponsel |author4=Olivier Urbain |author5=Piero P.

MacNair |author20=Vinod K. Kool |author21=Rita Agrawal | title = Toward a Nonkilling Paradigm | publisher = Center for Global Nonkilling | volume = "Nonkilling Science" | date = September 1, 2009 | location = Honolulu | pages = 388 | isbn = 978-0982298312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be quantified and related to specific causes by following a public health perspective (prevention, intervention and post-traumatic transformation toward the progressive eradication of killing).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
On the other hand, nonkilling does not set any predetermined path for the achievement of a killing-free society in the same way as some ideologies and spiritual traditions that foster the restraint from the taking of life do. As an open-ended approach it appeals to infinite human creativity and variability, encouraging continuous explorations in the fields of education, research, social action and policy making, by developing a broad range of scientific, institutional, educational, political, economic and spiritual alternatives to human killing. Also, in spite of its specific focus, nonkilling also tackles broader social issues.&lt;ref name="nonkilling.org"&gt;http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to psychological aggression, physical assault, and torture intended to terrorize by manifest or latent threat to life, nonkilling implies removal of their psychosocial causes. In relation to killing of humans by socioeconomic structural conditions that are the product of direct lethal reinforcement as well as the result of diversion of resources for purposes of killing, nonkilling implies removal of lethality-linked deprivations. In relation to threats to the viability of the biosphere, nonkilling implies absence of direct attacks upon life-sustaining resources as well as cessation of indirect degradation associated with lethality. In relation to forms of accidental killing, nonkilling implies creation of social and technological conditions conducive to their elimination.&lt;ref name="eolss.net"/&gt;

In a broad conception, nonkilling opposes [[aggression]], [[assassination]], [[autogenocide]], [[contract killing]], [[corporate manslaughter]], [[cultural genocide]], [[capital punishment]], [[democide]], [[Domestic violence|domestic killings]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[ethnocide]], [[femicide]], [[feticide]], [[gendercide]], [[genocide]], [[honor killing]], [[Human sacrifice|ritual killings]], [[infanticide]], [[language death|linguicide]], [[mass murder]], [[murder–suicide]], [[Human extinction#Omnicide|omnicide]], [[policide]], [[politicide]], [[regicide]], [[school shooting]]s, [[structural violence]], [[suicide]], [[terrorism]], [[thrill killing]], [[tyrannicide]], [[violence]], [[war]], and other forms of killing, direct, indirect or structural.

==Data==
In his book ''[[Nonkilling Global Political Science]]'', [[Glenn D. Paige]] estimated that less than 0.5 percent of all humans that ever existed actually killed other humans.&lt;ref name="nonkilling.org"/&gt; Also, anthropological evidence points out that in certain societies and cultures killing is down to statistically insignificant levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacefulsocieties.org/ peacefulsocieties.org]&lt;/ref&gt; As humans lived exclusively as hunter-gatherers — a form of existence that epitomizes the attributes of a nonkilling society — for 99 percent of their existence, it is also apparent that levels of violence and killing have also been very low during most of the history of ''Homo sapiens sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Philip of Burgundy''' (November 10, 1323 – August 10, 1346) was [[Count of Auvergne]] and [[Count of Boulogne|Boulogne]] (as '''Philip I''') in right of his wife and was the only son and heir of [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]], and of [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy]]. His mother was the daughter of King [[Philip V of France]] and of [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy]].{{sfn|Cox|1967|p=60}}

He married [[Joan I, Countess of Auvergne|Joan I, Countess of Auvergne and Boulogne]], in c. 1338.

In 1340, he fought with his father who defended the city of Saint-Omer against the assaults of [[Robert III of Artois]]. In 1346, he participated in the siege of Aiguillon, led by John, Duke of Normandy (the future [[John II of France]]). It was during this siege that he died, after falling from his horse.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Le Bel, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

His widow Joan remarried in 1349, her second husband being King [[John II of France]]. Since Philip had no other sons from his marriage to Joan, the future of the House of Burgundy was then placed in the hands of his young son [[Philip I, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]] (1346–61), who died childless.&lt;ref name="Ormrod417"&gt;W. Mark Ormrod, ''Edward III'', (Yale University Press, 2011), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the younger Philip, the dukedom of Burgundy became a part of the French crown,&lt;ref name="Ormrod417"/&gt; and was granted by John II of France to his youngest son (and the previous Duke’s stepbrother), [[Philip the Bold]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vaughan, ''Philip the Bold: The Formation of the Burgundian State'', Vol. 1, (The Boydell Press, 2005), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter, Joan (1344{{spaced ndash}}11 September 1360), was betrothed to [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy]] from 1347 to 1355, and was raised at his court.  When she was released from the engagement at age 10, she entered a convent at Poissy, where she remained for her final years.{{sfn|Cox|1967|p=60-61,105}}

{{Nihongo foot|'''''Pokémon Crystal Version'''''|ポケットモンスター クリスタルバージョン|Poketto Monsutā Kurisutaru Bājon|"Pocket Monsters: Crystal Version"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Game Freak]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Color]]. It is an enhanced version of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], and is part of the second generation of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video game series]]. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, North America on July 29, 2001 and Europe on November 2, 2001.&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165402p1.html|title=Pokemon Crystal Version Review|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2001-07-30|accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On January 26, 2018, ''Pokémon Crystal'' was released worldwide for the [[Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-crystal-virtual-console/|title=Pokémon Crystal (Virtual Console|work=www.pokemon.com|accessdate=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay of ''Pokémon Crystal'' is largely the same as in ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', although it holds new features. Along with ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', it is one of the first Pokémon games to allow players to choose the &lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS--&gt;sex&lt;!--[[GENDER]]IS NOT THE SAME AS [[SEX]]--&gt; of their character, while previously the character was always male. Pokémon have animated sprites; for example, when a [[Cyndaquil]] enters battle, the flames on its back flicker. This feature was absent in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], but has appeared in all subsequent games starting with ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]''. In addition, a couple of subplots were added, one involving the [[legendary Pokémon]] [[Suicune]], featured on the front cover of the game,&lt;ref name="GameSpot Crystal2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemoncrystal/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Breview&amp;page=2 |title=Pokemon Crystal for Game Boy Color Review |publisher=GameSpot |first=Frank |last=Povo |date=2001-07-30 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512190746/http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/pokemoncrystal/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Breview&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other involving the [[Unown]]. The game's biggest addition was the Battle Tower, a new building which allows players to participate in ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]''-like fights.&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"/&gt; The Japanese edition of the game was exclusively bundled with the {{nihongo4|Mobile Adapter GB|モバイルアダプタGB|Mobairu Adaputa Jī Bī}}, a device that allowed for connecting with other players via [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/135/135402p1.html|title=Pokemon Crystal Version Preview|publisher=IGN|first=Marc|last=Nix|date=2000-12-11|accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting and plot ==
The setting and plot remains largely the same as [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']].

== Reception ==
{{Video game reviews
| GSpot = 8.8/10&lt;ref name="GameSpot Crystal2"/&gt;
| IGN = 9/10&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"/&gt;
}}
''Pokémon Crystal'' was received well by critics, although many commented that there were just not enough new additions and features to significantly set it apart from ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver''. Craig Harris of [[IGN]] gave the game an "outstanding" 9 out of 10 stating, "The final (hopefully) Game Boy Color edition is definitely the version to get if you aren't already one of the upteenth{{sic}} billion owners of the previous games, with ''Crystal''{{'}}s slight updates to the design and graphics. But there's not much in this edition that makes it a "must buy" for folks who already own a copy or two of the previous editions".&lt;ref name="IGNCrystal"/&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the game a 34 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|script-title=ja:ゲームボーイ – ポケットモンスター クリスタルバージョン|language=Japanese|work=[[Weekly Famitsu]]|issue= 915 Pt.2 |page=109 |date=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the second best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 1,871,307 copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201810/21165560.html |title=【GBC20周年企画(2)】いちばん売れたゲームボーイカラー専用ソフトは『遊☆戯☆王DM4』！ では2位は？ GBC専用ソフト販売ランキングTOP10！ |language=Japanese |page=1 |date=2018-10-21 |website=[[Famitsu]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie of Baden''' (''Marie Elisabeth Wilhelmine''; 7 September 1782 – 20 April 1808) was a Duchess consort of [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] and Brunswick-[[Oels]]. She was married to [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], and was the daughter of [[Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden]], and [[Landgravine Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt]].

== Biography ==
Marie was born in [[Karlsruhe]].  At the time of the war against France, she stayed at [[Prenzlau]]. In 1806, her father-in-law fled from the troops of [[Napoleon]] to [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], where he died of the wounds he sustained in the war against France. Marie and her mother-in-law, [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain]], came to see him at his sick-bed, but when the French army headed toward Hamburg, they were advised by the British ambassador to flee, and left shortly before his death. They were both invited to Sweden by Marie's brother-in-law king [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]]. Augusta preferred to stay with her niece, [[Louise Augusta of Denmark]] in [[Augustenborg, Denmark|Augustenburg]], but Marie accepted the offer and joined the king and queen of Sweden with her children at [[Malmö]], were the royal family stayed without the royal court at the time to be close to the war during the difficult situation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Her spouse was granted permission by the emperor to stay in Altona.

Her brother, the Hereditary Prince of Baden, was married to [[Stephanie de Beauharnais]], and an ally of Napoleon, and joined the emperor in Berlin at the same time. Napoleon refused to see Marie's consort but said that he would like to see her, and Marie's brother wrote to her and asked her to come to Napoleon in Berlin as the ambassador of Brunswick to speak on behalf of her husband. She accepted the suggestion and travelled alone toward Berlin, but was stopped in [[Stralsund]] on the order of her husband,&lt;ref&gt;

During her stay in Sweden Marie lived with the royal family in Malmö, where they stayed informally during her stay, rather than in state in Stockholm. She was reportedly used to an informal interaction with her ladies-in-waiting and felt restricted in the household of her strict and temperamental brother-in-law the king, whom she found it difficult to get along with.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1807, her sister, [[Frederica of Baden|Queen Frederica]], was leaving Malmö and returning to the court at Stockholm to give birth, and asked Marie to come with her, but her husband demanded her to return to Germany,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6947">The combination of '''quality control and genetic algorithms''' led to novel solutions of complex [[quality control]] design and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. [[Quality control]] is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. Quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils a need or expectation that is stated, general implied or obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle D. ISO 9000 quality systems handbook. Butterworth-Heineman 2001;p.654&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithms]] are search algorithms, based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg DE. Genetic algorithms in search, optimization and machine learning. Addison-Wesley 1989; p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Quality control==
Alternative [[quality control]]&lt;ref&gt;Duncan AJ. Quality control and industrial statistics. Irwin 1986;pp.1-1123.&lt;/ref&gt; (QC) procedures can be applied on a process to [[Statistical hypothesis testing|test]] statistically the [[null hypothesis]], that the process conforms to the quality requirements, therefore that the process is in control, against the alternative, that the process is out of control. When a true [[null hypothesis]] is rejected, a statistical type I error is committed. We have then a false rejection of a run of the process. The probability of a type I error is called probability of false rejection. When a false null hypothesis is accepted, a statistical type II error is committed. We fail then to detect a significant change in the process. The probability of rejection of a false [[null hypothesis]] equals the probability of detection of the nonconformity of the process to the quality requirements.

The QC procedure to be designed or optimized can be formulated as:

''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,'''''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''')# ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,'''''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''') #...# ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;,'''''X''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;''')  (1)

where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,'''''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''') denotes a statistical decision rule, ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the size of the sample '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, that is the number of the samples the rule is applied upon, and '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the vector of the rule specific parameters, including the decision limits. Each symbol ''#'' denotes either the [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] operator AND or the operator OR. Obviously, for ''#'' denoting AND, and for ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;...&lt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, that is for '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; ....&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, the (1) denotes a ''q''-sampling QC procedure.

Each statistical decision rule is evaluated by calculating the respective statistic of a monitored variable of samples taken from the process. Then, if the statistic is out of the interval between the decision limits, the decision rule is considered to be true. Many statistics can be used, including the following: a single value of the variable of a sample, the [[range (statistics)|range]], the [[mean]], and the [[standard deviation]] of the values of the variable of the samples, the cumulative sum, the smoothed mean, and the smoothed standard deviation. Finally, the QC procedure is evaluated as a Boolean proposition. If it is true, then the [[null hypothesis]] is considered to be false, the process is considered to be out of control, and the run is rejected.

A [[quality control]] procedure is considered to be optimum when it minimizes (or maximizes) a context specific objective function. The objective function depends on the probabilities of detection of the nonconformity of the process and of false rejection. These probabilities depend on the parameters of the [[quality control]] procedure (1) and on the probability density functions (see [[probability density function]]) of the monitored variables of the process.

==Genetic algorithms==
[[Genetic algorithms]]&lt;ref&gt;Holland, JH. Adaptation in natural and artificial systems. The University of Michigan Press 1975;pp.1-228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg DE. Genetic algorithms in search, optimization and machine learning. Addison-Wesley 1989; pp.1-412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell M. An Introduction to genetic algorithms. The MIT Press 1998;pp.1-221.&lt;/ref&gt; are robust search [[algorithms]], that do not require [[knowledge]] of the objective function to be optimized and search through large spaces quickly. [[Genetic algorithms]] have been derived from the processes of the [[molecular biology]] of the [[gene]] and the [[evolution]] of life. Their operators, cross-over, [[mutation]], and [[reproduction]], are [[isomorphic]] with the synonymous biological processes. [[Genetic algorithms]] have been used to solve a variety of complex [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. Additionally the classifier systems and the [[genetic programming]] [[paradigm]] have shown us that [[genetic algorithms]] can be used for tasks as complex as the program induction.

==Quality control and genetic algorithms==
In general, we can not use algebraic methods to optimize the [[quality control]] procedures. Usage of [[enumerative]] methods would be very tedious, especially with multi-rule procedures, as the number of the points of the parameter space to be searched grows exponentially with the number of the parameters to be optimized. [[Optimization (mathematics)|Optimization]] methods based on the [[genetic algorithms]] offer an appealing alternative. 

Furthermore, the complexity of the design process of novel [[quality control]] procedures is obviously greater than the complexity of the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] of predefined ones.  

In fact, since 1993, [[genetic algorithms]] have been used successfully to optimize and to design novel [[quality control]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt; Hatjimihail AT.

'''Raymond Kurzweil''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɜr|z|w|aɪ|l}} {{respell|KURZ|wyle}}; born February 12, 1948) is an American [[inventor]], and [[futurist]]. He is involved in fields such as [[optical character recognition]] (OCR), [[speech synthesis|text-to-speech synthesis]], [[speech recognition]] technology, and electronic keyboard instruments. He has written books on health, [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), [[transhumanism]], the [[technological singularity]], and [[futures studies|futurism]]. Kurzweil is a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements, and gives public talks to share his optimistic outlook on [[life extension]] technologies and the future of [[nanotechnology]], [[robotics]], and [[biotechnology]].

Kurzweil received the 1999 [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]], the United States' highest honor in technology, from President Clinton in a White House ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/ip-programs-and-awards/national-medal-technology-and-innovation/recipients/1999|title=1999 Laureates- National Medal of Technology and Innovation|last=Officer|first=Office of the Chief Communications|website=www.uspto.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was the recipient of the $500,000 [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] for 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raymond Kurzweil 2001 Lemelson-MIT Prize Winner |url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/a-winners/a-kurzweil.html |publisher=MIT |accessdate=10 February 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102115911/http://web.mit.edu/invent/a-winners/a-kurzweil.html |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df= }} via  the Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; the world's largest for innovation.{{cn|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- perhaps, at that time; definitely not today:  Turing Award is $1M, and the Nobel prize in physics, chemistry, medicine might be larger as well; needs a source in any case. --&gt; And in 2002 he was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]], established by the U.S. Patent Office. He has received 21 honorary doctorates, and honors from three U.S. presidents. [[PBS]] included Kurzweil as one of 16 "revolutionaries who made America"&lt;ref name="Who Made America"&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Made America? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/innovators_hi.html |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other inventors of the past two centuries. ''[[Inc.

Kurzweil has written seven books, five of which have been national bestsellers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-biography|title=Ray Kurzweil biography {{!}} KurzweilAI|last=http://helldesign.net|website=www.kurzweilai.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' has been translated into 9 languages and was the #1 best-selling book on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in science. Kurzweil's book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestseller, and has been the #1 book on Amazon in both science and philosophy. Kurzweil speaks widely to audiences both public and private and regularly delivers keynote speeches at [[economic sector|industry]] conferences like [[DEMO conference|DEMO]], [[SXSW]], and [[TED (conference)|TED]]. He maintains the news website KurzweilAI.net, which has over three million readers annually.&lt;ref name="KurzweilAIbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-bio |title=Ray Kurzweil biography |publisher=KurzweilAINetwork |date= |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil has been employed by [[Google]] since 2012, where he is a "director of engineering".

==Life, inventions, and business career==

===Early life===

Ray Kurzweil grew up in the New York City borough of [[Queens]]. He attended NYC Public Education Kingsbury Elementary School PS188. He was born to [[secular Jew]]ish parents who had emigrated from [[Austria]] just before the onset of World War II. He was exposed via [[Unitarian Universalism]] to a diversity of religious faiths during his upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Dvb0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT106&amp;lpg=PT106&amp;dq=He+was+exposed+via+Unitarian+Universalism+to+a+diversity+of+religious+faiths+during+his+upbringing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hz1Q4fm5nl&amp;sig=WkSMBMZkVfdcNtEJYxEq6W2QTqU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjr9Gi6onXAhWFPxoKHe1cAeQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20was%20exposed%20via%20Unitarian%20Universalism%20to%20a%20diversity%20of%20religious%20faiths%20during%20his%20upbringing&amp;f=false|title=The Universal Mind: The Evolution of Machine Intelligence and Human Psychology|last=Press|first=Xiphias|date=2016-09-01|publisher=Xiphias Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/reinvent-yourself-the-playboy-interview-with-ray-kurzweil|title=featured {{!}} Reinvent Yourself: the Playboy interview with Ray Kurzweil {{!}} Kurzweil|last=http://helldesign.net|website=www.kurzweilai.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Unitarian church had the philosophy of many paths to the truth – the religious education consisted of studying a single religion for six months before moving on to the next.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} His father, Fredric was a concert pianist, a noted conductor, and a music educator. His mother, Hannah was a [[visual arts|visual artist]]. He has one sibling, his sister Enid.

Kurzweil decided he wanted to be an inventor at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;Interview:Ray Kurzweil. {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfztUIpZm7UC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=sonya+kurzweil |title=Computerworld – Google Books |publisher= |date=18 March 1991|accessdate=15 September 2014|author=Glen Rifken}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young boy, Kurzweil had an inventory of parts from various construction toys he’d been given and old electronic gadgets he’d collected from neighbors. In his youth, Kurzweil was an avid reader of science fiction literature. At the age of eight, nine, and ten, he read the entire [[Tom Swift Jr]]. series. At the age of seven or eight, he built a robotic puppet theater and robotic game. He was involved with computers by the age of 12 (in 1960), when only a dozen computers existed in all of New York City, and built computing devices and statistical programs for the predecessor of Head Start.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/streams-of-consciousness/on-tv-ray-kurzweil-tells-me-how-to-build-a-brain/&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fourteen, Kurzweil wrote a paper detailing his theory of the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-11-27/ray-kurzweil-how-create-mind-secret-human-thought-revealed/transcript |title=Ray Kurzweil: "How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed" - The Diane Rehm Show from WAMU and NPR |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were involved with the arts, and he is quoted in the documentary ''[[Transcendent Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transcendentman.com/mind-boggling-technological-singularity-defined/ |title=Answering all your questions about The Technological Singularity |publisher= |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as saying that the household always produced discussions about the future and technology.

Kurzweil attended [[Martin Van Buren High School]]. During class, he often held onto his class textbooks to seemingly participate, but instead, focused on his own projects which were hidden behind the book. His uncle, an engineer at [[Bell Labs]], taught young Kurzweil the basics of [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/kurzweil.html |title=Inventor of the Week |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102111050/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/kurzweil.html |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, at age 15, he wrote his first computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=%2Farticles%2Fart0467.html |title=KurzweilAI.net |publisher=KurzweilAI.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222180825/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=%2Farticles%2Fart0467.html |archivedate=2005-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He created pattern-recognition software that analyzed the works of classical composers, and then synthesized its own songs in similar styles. In 1965, he was invited to appear on the [[CBS]] television program ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', where he performed a piano piece that was composed by a computer he also had built.&lt;ref name=booktv&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?194500-1/depth-ray-kurzweil |title=In Depth with Ray Kurzweil |publisher=[[Book TV]] |date=2006-11-05 |accessdate=2015-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he won first prize in the International Science Fair for the invention;&lt;ref name=ssp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.societyforscience.org/Page.aspx?pid=261 |title=Alumni Honors |publisher=Society for Science and the Public |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729231138/http://www.societyforscience.org/page.aspx?pid=261 |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil's submission to [[Intel Science Talent Search|Westinghouse Talent Search]] of his first computer program alongside several other projects resulted in him being one of its national winners, which allowed him to be personally congratulated by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during a [[White House]] ceremony. These activities collectively impressed upon Kurzweil the belief that nearly any problem could be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techland.time.com/2010/04/02/an-interview-with-ray-kurzweil/ |title=An Interview With Ray Kurzweil |author=Doug Aamoth |publisher=Time Inc. |work=Time |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-life===

While in high school, Kurzweil had corresponded with [[Marvin Minsky]] and was invited to visit him at MIT, which he did. Kurzweil also visited [[Frank Rosenblatt]] at Cornell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/nerd-of-the-week-ray-kurzweil |title=Nerd of the Week: Ray Kurzweil – KurzweilAI |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained a B.S. in computer science and literature in 1970 at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He went to MIT to study with [[Marvin Minsky]]. He took all of the computer programming courses (eight or nine) offered at MIT in the first year and a half.

In 1968, during his sophomore year at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], Kurzweil started a company that used a computer program to match high school students with colleges. The program, called the Select College Consulting Program, was designed by him and compared thousands of different criteria about each college with questionnaire answers submitted by each student applicant. Around this time, he sold the company to [[Harcourt (publisher)#Harcourt, Brace &amp; World (1960) and successors|Harcourt, Brace &amp; World]] for $100,000 (roughly $670,000 in 2013 dollars) plus royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweiltech.com/raybio.html |title=Biography of Ray Kurzweil |publisher=Kurzweiltech.com |date=1976-01-13 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Kurzweil founded Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and led development of the first omni-font [[optical character recognition]] system, a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font. Before that time, scanners had only been able to read text written in a few fonts. He decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine, which would allow blind people to understand written text by having a computer read it to them aloud. However, this device required the invention of two enabling technologies—the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[flatbed scanner]] and the [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] synthesizer. Development of these technologies was completed at other institutions such as Bell Labs, and on January 13, 1976, the finished product was unveiled during a news conference headed by him and the leaders of the [[National Federation of the Blind]]. Called the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the device covered an entire tabletop.

Kurzweil's next major business venture began in 1978, when Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. [[LexisNexis]] was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload paper legal and news documents onto its nascent online databases.

Kurzweil sold his Kurzweil Computer Products to [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]]. Following the legal and bankruptcy problems of the latter, the system became a subsidiary of Xerox later known as [[Scansoft]] and now as [[Nuance Communications]], and he functioned as a consultant for the former until 1995.

Kurzweil's next business venture was in the realm of electronic music technology. After a 1982 meeting with [[Stevie Wonder]], in which the latter lamented the divide in capabilities and qualities between electronic synthesizers and traditional musical instruments, Kurzweil was inspired to create a new generation of music synthesizers capable of accurately duplicating the sounds of real instruments. [[Kurzweil Music Systems]] was founded in the same year, and in 1984, the [[Kurzweil K250]] was unveiled. The machine was capable of imitating a number of instruments, and in tests musicians were unable to discern the difference between the [[Kurzweil K250]] on piano mode from a normal grand piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3680298 |title=The Kurzweil 250 Digital Synthesizer |author=Donald Byrd and Christopher Yavelow |journal=Computer Music Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=1986 |page=64 |doi=10.2307/3680298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording and mixing abilities of the machine, coupled with its abilities to imitate different instruments, made it possible for a single user to compose and play an entire orchestral piece.

Kurzweil Music Systems was sold to [[South Korea]]n musical instrument manufacturer [[Young Chang]] in 1990. As with [[Xerox]], Kurzweil remained as a consultant for several years. [[Hyundai]] acquired Young Chang in 2006 and in January 2007 appointed Raymond Kurzweil as Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html%3Fid%3D6360 |title=Hyundai names Kurzweil Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems |publisher=Kurzweilai.net |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513021858/http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html%3Fid%3D6360 |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===

Concurrent with Kurzweil Music Systems, Kurzweil created the company Kurzweil Applied Intelligence (KAI) to develop computer [[speech recognition]] systems for commercial use. The first product, which debuted in 1987, was an early [[speech recognition]] program.

Kurzweil started [[Kurzweil Educational Systems]] in 1996 to develop new pattern-recognition-based computer technologies to help people with disabilities such as blindness, [[dyslexia]] and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) in school. Products include the Kurzweil 1000 text-to-speech converter software program, which enables a computer to read electronic and scanned text aloud to blind or visually impaired users, and the Kurzweil 3000 program, which is a multifaceted electronic learning system that helps with reading, writing, and [[study skills]].

[[File:Raymond Kurzweil, Stanford 2006 (square crop).jpg|thumb|left|Raymond Kurzweil at the [[Singularity Summit]] at [[Stanford University]] in 2006]]

During the 1990s, Kurzweil founded the Medical Learning Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=542059 |title=List of Private Companies Worldwide, ''BusinessWeek'' |work=Businessweek.com |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's products included an interactive computer education program for doctors and a computer-simulated patient. Around the same time, Kurzweil started KurzweilCyberArt.com—a website featuring computer programs to assist the creative art process. The site used to offer free downloads of a program called AARON—a visual art synthesizer developed by Harold Cohen—and of "Kurzweil's Cybernetic Poet", which automatically creates poetry. During this period he also started KurzweilAI.net, a website devoted towards showcasing news of scientific developments, publicizing the ideas of high-tech thinkers and critics alike, and promoting futurist-related discussion among the general population through the Mind-X forum.

In 1999, Kurzweil created a [[hedge fund]] called "FatKat" (Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies), which began trading in 2006. He has stated that the ultimate aim is to improve the performance of FatKat's A.I. investment software program, enhancing its ability to recognize patterns in "currency fluctuations and stock-ownership trends."&lt;ref name=okeefe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/14/100008848/index.htm |work=CNN |title=The smartest (or the nuttiest) futurist on Earth |date=May 2, 2007 |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |first1=Brian |last1=O'Keefe}}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted in his 1999 book, ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]],'' that computers will one day prove superior to the best human financial minds at making profitable investment decisions.
In June 2005, Kurzweil introduced the [[K-NFB Reader|"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)]]—a pocket-sized device consisting of a digital camera and computer unit. Like the Kurzweil Reading Machine of almost 30 years before, the [[K-NFB Reader]] is designed to aid blind people by reading written text aloud. The newer machine is portable and scans text through digital camera images, while the older machine is large and scans text through flatbed scanning.

In December 2012, Kurzweil was hired by Google in a full-time position to "work on new projects involving machine learning and language processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Letzing |first=John |title=Google Hires Famed Futurist Ray Kurzweil |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/12/14/google-hires-famed-futurist-ray-kurzweil/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;source=email_rt_mc_body&amp;ifp=0 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was personally hired by Google co-founder [[Larry Page]].&lt;ref&gt;http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/19/exclusive-interview-ray-kurzweil-discusses-his-first-two-months-at-google/&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Page and Kurzweil agreed on a one-sentence job description: "to bring natural language understanding to Google".&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

He received a Technical Grammy on February 8, 2015, recognizing his diverse technical and creative accomplishments. For purposes of the Grammy, perhaps most notable was the aforementioned Kurzweil K250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/the-bee-gees-pierre-boulez-buddy-guy-george-harrison-flaco-jimenez |title=The Bee Gees, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, George Harrison, Flaco Jimenez, Louvin Brothers and Wayne Shorter honored with the Recording Academy® Lifetime Achievement Award |publisher=grammy.org |date=2014-12-18 |accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil has joined the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]], a [[cryonics]] company. In the event of his declared death, Kurzweil plans to be perfused with [[cryoprotectant]]s, [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrified]] in [[liquid nitrogen]], and stored at an Alcor facility in the hope that future medical technology will be able to repair his tissues and revive him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Philipkoski |first=Kirsten |title=Ray Kurzweil's Plan: Never Die |journal=Wired |date=2002-11-18 |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/11/56448 |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Kurzweil is [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] about the existence of a [[soul]].&lt;ref name="CNN-2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/30/gb.01.html |work=CNN |title=CNN Transcript|date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the possibility of divine intelligence, Kurzweil has said, "Does God exist? I would say, 'Not yet.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-immortal-ambitions-of-ray-kurzweil/ The Immortal Ambitions of Ray Kurzweil: A Review of Transcendent Man]; ''[[Scientific American]]''; John Rennie; February 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil married Sonya Rosenwald Kurzweil in 1975 and has two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/174907129/ray-kurzweil-founder-chairman-ceo-kurzweil-technologies.htm;jsessionid=NL5Tvlov5t9uG2oJX2Tohg**.ecappj02 |title=Ray Kurzweil, Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO, Kurzweil Technologies – CRN.com |work=CRN |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonya Kurzweil is a psychologist in private practice in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], working with women, children, parents and families. She holds faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School and William James College for Graduate Education in Psychology. Her research interests and publications are in the area of psychotherapy practice. Kurzweil also serves as an active Overseer at Boston Children's Museum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/ask-ray-article-on-integrating-digital-media-into-childrens-lives-by-my-wife-sonya-kurzweil-phd |title=Ask Ray – Article on integrating digital media into children’s lives by my wife Sonya Kurzweil, PhD – KurzweilAI |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a son, Ethan Kurzweil, who is a venture capitalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324178904578340240851065014 |title=Father and Son Peer Into the Future of Tech |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, Amy Kurzweil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afb.org/info/living-with-vision-loss/using-technology/ray-kurzweil/part-1-of-4/1245 |title=An Oral History Interview with Ray Kurzweil, Part 1 of 4 |work=[[American Foundation for the Blind]] |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a writer and cartoonist. Kurzweil is a cousin of writer [[Allen Kurzweil]].

===Creative approach===

Kurzweil said "I realize that most inventions fail not because the R&amp;D department can’t get them to work, but because the timing is wrong{{nsmdns}}not all of the enabling factors are at play where they are needed. Inventing is a lot like surfing: you have to anticipate and catch the wave at just the right moment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011924/https://www.uakron.edu/president/speeches_statements/?id=c6856afc-067b-40d5-bfc1-ac93f118e3f5 The University of Akron – Speeches &amp; Statements]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crnano.org/interview.kurzweil.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Ray Kurzweil Interviewed by Sander Olson|publisher= Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past several decades, Kurzweil's most effective and common approach to doing creative work has been conducted during his lucid dreamlike state which immediately precedes his awakening state. He claims to have constructed inventions, solved difficult problems, such as algorithmic, business strategy, organizational, and interpersonal problems, and written speeches in this state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Books==

Kurzweil's first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', was published in 1990. The nonfiction work discusses the history of computer artificial intelligence (AI) and forecasts future developments. Other experts in the field of AI contribute heavily to the work in the form of essays. The [[Association of American Publishers]]' awarded it the status of ''Most Outstanding Computer Science Book'' of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colin |first=Johnson |title=Era of Smart People is Dawning |journal=Electronic Engineering Times |date=1998-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Kurzweil published a book on nutrition called ''[[The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life]]''. The book's main idea is that high levels of fat intake are the cause of many health disorders common in the U.S., and thus that cutting fat consumption down to 10% of the total calories consumed would be optimal for most people.

In 1999, Kurzweil published ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', which further elucidates his theories regarding the future of technology, which themselves stem from his analysis of long-term trends in biological and technological evolution. Much emphasis is on the likely course of AI development, along with the future of computer architecture.

Kurzweil's next book, published in 2004, returned to human health and nutrition. ''[[Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever]]'' was co-authored by [[Terry Grossman]], a medical doctor and specialist in alternative medicine.

''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', published in 2005, was made into a movie starring [[Pauley Perrette]] from [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]. In February 2007, Ptolemaic Productions acquired the rights to ''The Singularity is Near'', ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'' and ''Fantastic Voyage'' including the rights to film Kurzweil's life and ideas for the documentary film ''[[Transcendent Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transcendentman.com/mind-boggling-technological-singularity-defined/ |title=Answering all your questions about The Technological Singularity |publisher= |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was directed by Barry Ptolemy.

''Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rayandterry.com/transcend/ |title=Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever |publisher=Rayandterry.com |accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a follow-up to ''Fantastic Voyage'', was released on April 28, 2009.

Kurzweil's book, ''[[How to Create a Mind]]: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed,'' was released on Nov. 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweils-how-to-create-a-mind-published |title=Ray Kurzweil’s How to Create a Mind published |date=November 17, 2012 |publisher=KurzweilAInet |accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Kurzweil describes his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind, the theory that the [[neocortex]] is a hierarchical system of pattern recognizers, and argues that emulating this architecture in machines could lead to an artificial superintelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kurzweil |first=Ray |title=How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed |year=2012 |publisher=Viking Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-670-02529-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil's latest book and first fiction novel, ''Danielle: Chronicles of a Superheroine'', follows a young girl who uses her intelligence and the help of her friends to tackle real-world problems. The book comes with companion materials, ''A Chronicle of Ideas'', and ''How You Can Be a Danielle'' that provide real-world context. The book is set to release in January 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.danielleworld.com/ |title=Ready to change the world |publisher= |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movies==

Kurzweil wrote and co-produced a movie directed by Anthony Waller, called ''The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future'', in 2010 based, in part, on his 2005 book ''The Singularity Is Near''. Part fiction, part non-fiction, he interviews 20 big thinkers like [[Marvin Minsky]], plus there is a B-line narrative story that illustrates some of the ideas, where a computer avatar (Ramona) saves the world from self-replicating microscopic robots. In addition to his movie, an independent, feature-length documentary was made about Kurzweil, his life, and his ideas, called ''[[Transcendent Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transcendentman.com/mind-boggling-technological-singularity-defined/ |title=Answering all your questions about The Technological Singularity |publisher= |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Filmmakers [[Barry Ptolemy]] and Felicia Ptolemy followed Kurzweil, documenting his global speaking-tour. Premiered in 2009 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], ''Transcendent Man'' documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal mankind's ultimate destiny and explores many of the ideas found in his New York Times bestselling book, ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', including his concept exponential growth, radical life expansion, and how we will transcend our biology. The Ptolemys documented Kurzweil's stated goal of bringing back his late father using AI. The film also features critics who argue against Kurzweil's predictions.

In 2010, an independent documentary film called ''[[Plug &amp; Pray]]'' premiered at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], in which Kurzweil and one of his major critics, the late [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], argue about the benefits of eternal life.

The feature-length documentary film ''[[The Singularity (film)|The Singularity]]'' by independent filmmaker Doug Wolens (released at the end of 2012), showcasing Kurzweil, has been acclaimed as "a large-scale achievement in its documentation of futurist and counter-futurist ideas” and “the best documentary on the Singularity to date."&lt;ref name="ieet" /&gt;

Kurzweil frequently comments on the application of cell-size nanotechnology to the workings of the human brain and how this could be applied to building AI. While being interviewed for a February 2009 issue of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Kurzweil expressed a desire to construct a genetic copy of his late father, Fredric Kurzweil, from DNA within his grave site. This feat would be achieved by exhumation and extraction of DNA, constructing a clone of Fredric and retrieving memories and recollections—from Ray's mind—of his father. Kurzweil kept all of his father's records, notes, and pictures in order to maintain as much of his father as he could. Ray is known for taking over 200 pills a day, meant to reprogram his biochemistry. This, according to Ray, is only a precursor to the devices at the nano scale that will eventually replace a blood-cell, self updating of specific pathogens to improve the immune system.

==Views==

===The Law of Accelerating Returns===
{{Main article|Accelerating change}}

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', Kurzweil proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', [[Viking Press|Viking]], 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns", which proposed an extension of [[Moore's law]] to a wide variety of technologies, and used this to argue in favor of [[Vernor Vinge]]'s concept of a [[technological singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns |title=The Law of Accelerating Returns |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil suggests that this exponential technological growth is counter-intuitive to the way our brains perceive the world—since our brains were biologically inherited from humans living in a world that was linear and local—and, as a consequence, he claims it has encouraged great skepticism in his future projections.

===Stance on the future of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics===

Kurzweil was working with the [[Army Science Board]] in 2006 to develop a rapid response system to deal with the possible abuse of biotechnology. He suggested that the same technologies that are empowering us to reprogram biology away from cancer and heart disease could be used by a bioterrorist to reprogram a biological virus to be more deadly, communicable, and stealthy. However, he suggests that we have the scientific tools to successfully defend against these attacks, similar to the way we defend against computer software viruses. He has testified before Congress on the subject of [[nanotechnology]], advocating that nanotechnology has the potential to solve serious global problems such as poverty, disease, and climate change. "Nanotech Could Give Global Warming a Big Chill".&lt;ref name="Global_warming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qsinano.com/pdf/ForbesWolfe_NanotechReport_July2006.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nanotech Could Give Global Warming a Big Chill |date=July 2006 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023163838/http://www.qsinano.com/pdf/ForbesWolfe_NanotechReport_July2006.pdf |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In media appearances, Kurzweil has stressed the extreme potential dangers of nanotechnology&lt;ref name=booktv /&gt;&lt;!-- at 85, 147, 167 and 173 minutes into 3 hour interview--&gt; but argues that in practice, progress cannot be stopped because that would require a totalitarian system, and any attempt to do so would drive dangerous technologies underground and deprive responsible scientists of the tools needed for defense. He suggests that the proper place of regulation is to ensure that technological progress proceeds safely and quickly, but does not deprive the world of profound benefits. He stated, "To avoid dangers such as unrestrained nanobot replication, we need relinquishment at the right level and to place our highest priority on the continuing advance of defensive technologies, staying ahead of destructive technologies. An overall strategy should include a streamlined regulatory process, a global program of monitoring for unknown or evolving biological pathogens, temporary moratoriums, raising public awareness, international cooperation, software reconnaissance, and fostering values of liberty, tolerance, and respect for knowledge and diversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/nanotechnology-dangers-and-defenses |title=Nanotechnology Dangers and Defenses |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and aging===

Kurzweil admits that he cared little for his health until age 35, when he was found to suffer from a [[glucose intolerance]], an early form of [[type II diabetes]] (a major risk factor for [[heart disease]]). Kurzweil then found a doctor ([[Terry Grossman]], M.D.) who shares his somewhat unconventional beliefs to develop an extreme regimen involving hundreds of pills, [[Intravenous therapy|chemical intravenous]] treatments, [[red wine]], and various other methods to attempt to live longer. Kurzweil was ingesting "250 supplements, eight to 10 glasses of [[alkaline water]] and 10 cups of [[green tea]]" every day and drinking several glasses of red wine a week in an effort to "reprogram" his biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0%2C1286%2C66585%2C00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3 |title=Never Say Die: Live Forever |work=WIRED |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224022313/http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,66585,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3 |archivedate=24 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, he had reduced the number of supplement pills to 150.&lt;ref name="CNN-2008" /&gt;

Kurzweil has made a number of bold claims for his health regimen. In his book The Singularity Is Near, he claimed that he brought his cholesterol level down from the high 200s to 130, raised his HDL (high-density lipoprotein) from below 30 to 55, and lowered his homocysteine from an unhealthy 11 to a much safer 6.2. He also claimed that his C-reactive protein "and all of my other indexes (for heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions) are at ideal levels." He further claimed that his health regimen, including dramatically reducing his fat intake, successfully "reversed" his type 2 diabetes. (The Singularity Is Near, p.&amp;nbsp;211)

He has written three books on the subjects of nutrition, health, and immortality: ''[[The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life]]'', ''[[Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever]]'' and ''Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever''. In all, he recommends that other people emulate his health practices to the best of their abilities. Kurzweil and his current "anti-aging" doctor, [[Terry Grossman]], now have two websites promoting their first and second book.

Kurzweil asserts that in the future, everyone will live forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/immortal_07-10.html |title=As Humans and Computers Merge … Immortality? &amp;#124; PBS NewsHour &amp;#124; July 10, 2012 |publisher=PBS |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122011827/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec12/immortal_07-10.html |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, he said that in 15 years, medical technology could add more than a year to one's remaining life expectancy for each year that passes, and we could then "outrun our own deaths". Among other things, he has supported the [[SENS Research Foundation]]'s approach to finding a way to repair aging damage, and has encouraged the general public to hasten their research by donating.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324504704578412581386515510 |title=Will Google's Ray Kurzweil Live Forever? |date=12 April 2013 |work=WSJ |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exponentialtimes.net/videos/ray-kurzweil-sens-3 |title=Ray Kurzweil At SENS 3 &amp;#124; Video |publisher=Exponential Times |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kurzweil's view of the human neocortex ===

According to Kurzweil, technologists will be creating synthetic neocortexes based on the operating principles of the human [[neocortex]] with the primary purpose of extending our own neocortexes. He claims to believe that the neocortex of an adult human consists of approximately 300 million pattern recognizers. He draws on the commonly accepted belief that the primary anatomical difference between humans and other primates that allowed for superior intellectual abilities was the evolution of a larger neocortex. He claims that the six-layered neocortex deals with increasing abstraction from one layer to the next. He says that at the low levels, the neocortex may seem cold and mechanical because it can only make simple decisions, but at the higher levels of the hierarchy, the neocortex is likely to be dealing with concepts like being funny, being sexy, expressing a loving sentiment, creating a poem or understanding a poem, etc. He claims to believe that these higher levels of the human neocortex were the enabling factors to permit the human development of language, technology, art, and science. He stated, "If the quantitative improvement from primates to humans with the big forehead was the enabling factor to allow for language, technology, art, and science, what kind of qualitative leap can we make with another quantitative increase? Why not go from 300 million pattern recognizers to a billion?”

===Encouraging futurism and transhumanism===

Kurzweil's standing as a [[Futures studies|futurist]] and [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] has led to his involvement in several singularity-themed organizations. In December 2004, Kurzweil joined the advisory board of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.singinst.org/aboutus/board |title=Board – Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence |work=Singularity University |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, Kurzweil joined the scientific advisory board of the [[Lifeboat Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/boards#robotics |title=Lifeboat Foundation Advisory Boards |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2006, Kurzweil was the first speaker at the [[Singularity Summit]] at [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/12/BUG9IIMG1V197.DTL&amp;type=printable |title=Printable version: Smarter than thou? / Stanford conference ponders a brave new world with machines more powerful than their creators |date=12 May 2006 |work=SFGate |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Kurzweil was the keynote speaker at the 2013 proceeding of the Research, Innovation, Start-up and Employment (RISE) international conference in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea|Korea Republic]].

In February 2009, Kurzweil, in collaboration with [[Google]] and the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in [[Mountain View, California]], announced the creation of the [[Singularity University]] training center for corporate executives and government officials. The University's self-described mission is to "assemble, educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies and apply, focus and guide these tools to address humanity's grand challenges". Using [[Vernor Vinge|Vernor Vinge's]] Singularity concept as a foundation, the university offered its first nine-week graduate program to 40 students in June, 2009.

==Predictions==
{{Main article|Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil}}

===Past predictions===

Kurzweil's first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', presented his ideas about the future. It was written from 1986 to 1989 and published in 1990. Building on [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]]'s "Technologies of Freedom" (1983), Kurzweil claims to have forecast the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kurzweil |first=Ray |title=The Age of Intelligent Machines |year=1990 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-11121-7 |page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Kurzweil also extrapolated preexisting trends in the improvement of computer chess software performance to predict that computers would beat the best human players "by the year 2000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kurzweil |first=Ray |title=The Age of Intelligent Machines |year=1990 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-11121-7 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1997, chess World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] was defeated by IBM's [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] computer in a well-publicized chess match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Bruce |title=Swift and Slashing, Computer Topples Kasparav |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/12/nyregion/swift-and-slashing-computer-topples-kasparov.html |accessdate=2013-02-13 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1997-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. At the time of the publication of ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2001_Feb/ai_70910777/pg_3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629012339/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2001_Feb/ai_70910777/pg_3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 June 2012 |title=Fleeing the dot.com era: decline in Internet usage |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was unreliable, difficult to use, and deficient in content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services". Additionally, Kurzweil claims to have correctly foreseen that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.

In October 2010, Kurzweil released his report, "How My Predictions Are Faring" in PDF format,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzes the predictions he made in his book ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' (1990), ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'' (1999) and ''The Singularity is Near'' (2005). Of the 147 total predictions, Kurzweil claims that 115 were "entirely correct", 12 were "essentially correct", and 17 were "partially correct", and only 3 were "wrong". Adding together the "entirely" and "essentially" correct, Kurzweil's claimed accuracy rate comes to 86%.

[[Daniel Lyons]], writing in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, criticized Kurzweil for some of his predictions that turned out to be wrong, such as the economy continuing to boom from the 1998 [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]] through 2009, a US company having a [[market capitalization]] of more than $1 trillion, a supercomputer achieving 20 [[FLOPS|petaflops]], speech recognition being in widespread use and cars that would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways; all by 2009.&lt;ref name="Newsweek May 2009 page 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/197812/page/2 |title=I, Robot |accessdate=2009-05-22 |last=Lyons |first=Daniel |date=May 2009 |work=Newsweek}} via [https://web.archive.org/web/20100413081045/http://www.newsweek.com/id/197812 the Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; To the charge that a 20 petaflop supercomputer was not produced in the time he predicted, Kurzweil responded that he considers [[Google]] a giant supercomputer, and that it is indeed capable of 20 petaflops.&lt;ref name="Newsweek May 2009 page 2" /&gt;

Kurzweil's predictions for 2009 were mostly inaccurate, claims ''Forbes'' magazine. For example, Kurzweil predicted, "The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition." This is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/03/20/ray-kurzweils-predictions-for-2009-were-mostly-inaccurate/ |last=Kurzweil |first=Ray |title=Ray Kurzweil's Predictions For 2009 Were Mostly Inaccurate |year=2012 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future predictions===

In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final part of the book is devoted to predictions over the coming century, from 2009 through 2099. In ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' he makes fewer concrete short-term predictions, but includes many longer-term visions.

He states that with radical life extension will come radical life enhancement. He says he is confident that within 10 years we will have the option to spend some of our time in 3D virtual environments that appear just as real as real reality, but these will not yet be made possible via direct interaction with our nervous system. "If you look at video games and how we went from pong to the virtual reality we have available today, it is highly likely that immortality in essence will be possible." He believes that 20 to 25 years from now, we will have millions of blood-cell sized devices, known as [[nanobots]], inside our bodies fighting against diseases, improving our memory, and cognitive abilities. Kurzweil says that a machine will pass the [[Turing test]] by 2029, and that around 2045, "the pace of change will be so astonishingly quick that we won't be able to keep up, unless we enhance our own intelligence by merging with the intelligent machines we are creating". Kurzweil states that humans will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological intelligence that becomes increasingly dominated by its non-biological component. He stresses that "AI is not an intelligent invasion from Mars. These are brain extenders that we have created to expand our own mental reach. They are part of our civilization. They are part of who we are. So over the next few decades our human-machine civilization will become increasingly dominated by its non-biological component. In ''[[Transcendent Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transcendentman.com/mind-boggling-technological-singularity-defined/ |title=Answering all your questions about The Technological Singularity |publisher= |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil states "We humans are going to start linking with each other and become a metaconnection we will all be connected and all be omnipresent, plugged into this global network that is connected to billions of people, and filled with data."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/ray-kurzweil-the-ultimate-thinking-machine |title=Ray Kurzweil: the ultimate thinking machine |publisher= |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil states in a press conference that we are the only species that goes beyond our limitations- "we didn't stay in the caves, we didn't stay on the planet, and we're not going to stay with the limitations of our biology". In his singularity based documentary he is quoted saying "I think people are fooling themselves when they say they have accepted death".

In 2008, Kurzweil said in an expert panel in the [[National Academy of Engineering]] that [[solar power]] will scale up to produce all the energy needs of Earth's people in 20 years. According to Kurzweil, we only need to capture 1 part in 10,000 of the energy from the Sun that hits Earth's surface to meet all of humanity's energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080219-kurzweil-solar.html |title=Solar Power to Rule in 20 Years, Futurists Say |publisher=LiveScience |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===

====Praise====

Kurzweil was referred to as "the ultimate thinking machine" by ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;ref name=pfeiffer&gt;Pfeiffer, Eric (1998-04-06) [https://www.forbes.com/asap/1998/0406/017.html "Start Up"]. [[Forbes]].

PBS included Kurzweil as one of 16 "revolutionaries who made America"&lt;ref name="Who Made America" /&gt; along with other inventors of the past two centuries. ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' magazine ranked him #8 among the "most fascinating" entrepreneurs in the United States and called him "Edison's rightful heir".&lt;ref name="26 Most Fascinating Entrepreneurs" /&gt;

====Criticism====

Although the idea of a technological singularity is a popular concept in science fiction, some authors such as [[Neal Stephenson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/20/1518217 |title=Neal Stephenson Responds With Wit and Humor |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2008-08-28 |last=Miller |first=Robin |publisher=[[Slashdot]] |quote=My thoughts are more in line with those of Jaron Lanier, who points out that while hardware might be getting faster all the time, software is shit (I am paraphrasing his argument). And without software to do something useful with all that hardware, the hardware's nothing more than a really complicated space heater.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruce Sterling]] have voiced skepticism about its real-world plausibility. Sterling expressed his views on the singularity scenario in a talk at the [[Long Now Foundation]] entitled ''The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.longnow.org/2004/06/14/bruce-sterling-the-singularity-your-future-as-a-black-hole/ |title=Bruce Sterling – "The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole" |date=2004-06-14 |accessdate=2009-06-08 |last=Brand |first=Stewart |publisher=The Long Now Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.longnow.org/seminars/salt-0200406-sterling/salt-0200406-sterling.mp3 |title=The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole |last=Sterling |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |format=MP3 |quote=It's an end-of-history notion, and like most end-of-history notions, it is showing its age. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004120035/http://media.longnow.org/seminars/salt-0200406-sterling/salt-0200406-sterling.mp3 |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent AI thinkers and computer scientists such as [[Daniel Dennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/jaron_manifesto.html#dennett |title=The Reality Club: One Half Of A Manifesto |last=Dennett |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |publisher=[[Edge.org]] |quote="I'm glad that Lanier entertains the hunch that Dawkins and I (and Hofstadter and others) 'see some flaw in logic that insulates [our] thinking from the eschatalogical implications' drawn by Kurzweil and Moravec. He's right.

They are assertions about how past rates of scientific and technical progress can predict the future rate. Therefore, like other attempts to forecast the future from the past, these "laws" will work until they don't.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also criticized Kurzweil's projections.

In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] criticizes Kurzweil for several predictions that failed to become manifest by the originally predicted date. "Therein lie the frustrations of Kurzweil's brand of tech punditry. On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Rennie |title=Ray Kurzweil's Slippery Futurism |date=December 2010 |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism/ |work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Joy]], cofounder of [[Sun Microsystems]], agrees with Kurzweil's timeline of future progress, but thinks that technologies such as AI, nanotechnology and advanced biotechnology will create a [[dystopia]]n world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html |title=Why the future doesn't need us |accessdate=2008-09-21 |last=Joy |first=Bill |date=April 2000 |work=Wired |quote=...it was only in the autumn of 1998 that I became anxiously aware of how great are the dangers facing us in the 21st century. I can date the onset of my unease to the day I met Ray Kurzweil...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitch Kapor]], the founder of [[Lotus Development Corporation]], has called the notion of a technological singularity "[[intelligent design]] for the [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] 140 people...This proposition that we're heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably different—it's fundamentally, in my view, driven by a religious impulse. And all of the frantic arm-waving can't obscure that fact for me."&lt;ref name=okeefe /&gt;

Some critics have argued more strongly against Kurzweil and his ideas. Cognitive scientist [[Douglas Hofstadter]] has said of Kurzweil's and [[Hans Moravec]]'s books: "It's an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas, and it's very hard to disentangle the two, because these are smart people; they're not stupid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/douglas-r-hofstadter |title=An interview with Douglas R. Hofstadter |accessdate=2008-08-28 |last=Ross |first=Greg |work=[[American Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[P.Z. Myers|P. Z. Myers]] has criticized Kurzweil's predictions as being based on "[[New Age]] spiritualism" rather than science and says that Kurzweil does not understand basic [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/197812 |title=I, Robot |accessdate=2009-07-24 |last=Lyons |first=Daniel |date=May 2009 |work=Newsweek |quote=Still, a lot of people think Kurzweil is completely bonkers and/or full of a certain messy byproduct of ordinary biological functions. They include P. Z. Myers, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, Morris, who has used his blog to poke fun at Kurzweil and other armchair futurists who, according to Myers, rely on junk science and don't understand basic biology. "I am completely baffled by Kurzweil's popularity, and in particular the respect he gets in some circles, since his claims simply do not hold up to even casually critical examination," writes Myers. He says Kurzweil's Singularity theories are closer to a deluded religious movement than they are to science. "It's a New Age spiritualism—that's all it is," Myers says. "Even geeks want to find God somewhere, and Kurzweil provides it for them." |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413081045/http://www.newsweek.com/id/197812 |archivedate=2010-04-13 |df= }} via &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singularitarianism&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers |first=PZ |title=Singularitarianism? |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/02/singularitarianism.php |work=Pharyngula blog |accessdate=14 February 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508173648/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/02/singularitarianism.php |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; VR pioneer [[Jaron Lanier]] has even described Kurzweil's ideas as "cybernetic totalism" and has outlined his views on the culture surrounding Kurzweil's predictions in an essay for [[Edge.org]] entitled ''One Half of a Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="ieet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/olson20130301 |title=The Singularity: A Documentary by Doug Wolens |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier/lanier_p1.html |title=One Half of a Manifesto |accessdate=2008-08-28 |last=Lanier |first=Jaron |publisher=[[Edge.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] argues that contemporary science is what magic was for ancient civilizations. It gives a sense of hope for those who are willing to do almost anything in order to achieve eternal life. He quotes Kurzweil's Singularity as another example of a trend which has almost always been present in the history of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first=John |title=The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest to Cheat Death |year=2011 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0374175061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Brain Makers'', a history of artificial intelligence written in 1994 by [[HP Newquist]], noted that "Born with the same gift for self-promotion that was a character trait of people like [[P.T. Barnum]] and [[Edward Feigenbaum|Ed Feigenbaum]], Kurzweil had no problems talking up his technical prowess . . . Ray Kurzweil was not noted for his understatement." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newquist|first=HP|title=The Brain Makers|date=1994|publisher=Macmillan/SAMS Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-672-30412-0|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 paper, [[William Nordhaus|William D. Nordhaus]] of Yale University, takes an economic look at the impacts of an impending technological singularity. He comments: "There is remarkably little writing on Singularity in the modern macroeconomic literature." &lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, William D. "Are We Approaching an Economic Singularity? Information Technology and the Future of Economic Growth", Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 2021, Yale University, September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Nordhaus supposes that the Singularity could arise from either the demand or supply side of a market economy, but for information technology to proceed at the kind of pace Kurzweil suggests, there would have to be significant productivity trade-offs. Namely, in order to devote more resources to producing super computers we must decrease our production of non-information technology goods. Using a variety of econometric methods, Nordhaus runs six supply side tests and one demand side test to track the macroeconomic viability of such steep rises in information technology output. Of the seven tests only two indicated that a Singularity was economically possible and both of those two predicted, at minimum, 100 years before it would occur.

'''Kayla Rolland''' (May 12, 1993 – February 29, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] 6-year-old girl from [[Mount Morris Township, Michigan|Mount Morris Township]], [[Michigan]], who was [[murdered]] on February 29, 2000. Rolland was shot and killed by her classmate Dedrick Owens, also 6-years-old, at Buell Elementary School in the [[Beecher Community School District]]. The murder drew worldwide attention due to the particularly young ages of the victim and the perpetrator: Rolland was the youngest [[school shooting]] victim in the United States until the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in 2012, and Owens remains the youngest school shooting perpetrator to-date. Owens could not be legally charged for murder because of his age. Buell Elementary School closed in 2002.&lt;ref name="Five years"&gt;Five years after school shooting, Michigan community still in pain  [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050228-0059-schoolshootinganniversary.html Sign on San Diego] Retrieved on November 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Dedrick Darnell Owens (born on May 5, 1993) was a 6-year-old [[first grade]]r at Buell Elementary School in the [[Beecher Community School District]], located in [[Mount Morris Township, Michigan|Mount Morris Township]] near [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]]. Owens' father was in jail for violating [[parole]], having previously been convicted for possession of [[cocaine]] "with intent to deliver," and had been living with his mother Tamarla, a [[drug addict]], and his eight-year-old brother. His mother was [[evicted]] from her home, and the two boys then moved into their uncle's house, where they shared a single [[sofa]] as a bed. The home was a [[crack house]] operated by his uncle and a 19-year-old man where [[guns]] were frequently traded for drugs, and at some point Owens had found a loaded [[Davis Industries]] P-32 [[.32 ACP|.32-caliber]] [[handgun]] under some blankets.&lt;ref&gt;Major U.S. school shootings in the last 10 years [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,266371,00.html Fox News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Killing of Kayla [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,40342-1,00.html Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens was known to have behavioral problems, and was made to stay after school nearly every day for saying "the F word," [[The finger|flipping people off]], [[Pinch (action)|pinching]] and hitting. Some weeks before the shooting he had stabbed a girl with a [[pencil]]. Chris Boaz, a seven-year-old classmate, claimed Owens once punched him because he would not give him a [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]]. Owens had attacked Kayla Rolland before and, on the day prior to the killing, tried to [[kiss]] her and was rebuffed. Early on the morning of the shooting, Owens and his brother got into a fight with Boaz's 10-year-old uncle, who punched Owens, and according to Boaz's grandmother said "Do you want me to take my gap [sic] out and shoot you?"

==Murder==
On February 29, 2000, Owens had brought the firearm, along with a [[knife]], with him to school. Further in the day, during a change of classes, Owens fatally shot 6-year-old Kayla Rolland in the presence of a teacher and 22 students while they were moving up a floor on the stairs, saying to her: "I don't like you", before pulling the trigger. The bullets entered her right arm and travelled through a vital [[artery]]. At 10:29 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]], Rolland was pronounced dead at [[Hurley Medical Center]] while in [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;Student killed in Michigan elementary school shooting {{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/29/school.shooting.04/ |title=CNN |accessdate=July 8, 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103013335/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/29/school.shooting.04/ |archivedate=January 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens then threw the handgun into a trash basket and fled to a nearby restroom. He was found there, in the corner, by a teacher and was taken into police custody soon after. He was held in custody until the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] [[Child Protective Services|Family Independence Agency]] could determine his placement.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan first-grader fatally shot by classmate [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/29/school.shooting.04/ CNN]&lt;/ref&gt; He and his two younger siblings have since been placed with an aunt.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;More Indictments In School Shooting [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/02/29/national/main166184.shtml CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
At six years of age, Kayla Rolland is believed to have been the youngest [[school shooting]] victim in United States history, which was not surpassed until the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip Delves |last=Broughton |title=Shocked pupils tell of shooting by six-year-old |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/01/wshot01.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 1, 2000 |accessdate=August 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedrick Owens became the youngest school shooter in the United States, and the legal claim that at that age he would lack the ability to form [[intent (law)|intent]], he was not charged with the [[murder]]. In most U.S. states, six-year-olds are not liable for crimes they commit, and the Genesee County Prosecutor Arthur Busch called on the citizens to collectively hug the boy presumably out of pity and sympathy. In an 1893 ruling, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that "children under the age of 7 years could not be guilty of felony, or punished for any capital offense, for within that age the child is conclusively presumed incapable of committing a crime." This is followed in many U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Kevin and Fiorillo, Juré. ''True Stories of Law &amp; Order: SVU''. 2007: Berkley/Penguin, page 15. {{ISBN|0-425-21735-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamelle James, Owens' uncle who owned the .32-caliber pistol used in the murder, eventually pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter and spent two years and five months in prison before he was released on probation. The other adults involved would be in and out of court systems in the years to follow.&lt;ref name="Five years"/&gt; A search of James' house produced a loaded [[pump-action shotgun]] and a rock of [[crack cocaine]].

Buell Elementary closed in 2002 due to dwindling enrollment and stressed finances. The campus was heavily damaged by [[arson]] in 2005, and was demolished in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roneisha D. |last=Mullen |title=Site of Beecher 2000 school shooting reduced to rubble |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/04/site_of_beecher_2000_school_sh.html |publisher=MLive |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidney Leslie Goodwin''' (9 September 1910 – 15 April 1912) was a 19-month-old [[English people|English]] boy who died during the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. His [[unidentified decedent|unidentified body]] was recovered by the [[CS Mackay-Bennett|''Mackay-Bennett'']] after the sinking, and for decades was referred to as '''The Unknown Child'''. His headstone read "Erected to the memory of an unknown child whose remains were recovered after the disaster to the Titanic April 15th 1912". In 2008, mitochondrial DNA testing by the Armed Forces lab revealed his identity. Baby Goodwin is the only member of his family whose body has been recovered and subsequently identified.

==Early life==
[[File:goodwinfamily.jpg|left|thumb|The Goodwin family. From left to right: William, Frederick, Charles, Lillian, Augusta, Jessie. At the centre is Harold. Sidney is not present. All of the Goodwins perished in the sinking.]]
Sidney was born on 9 September 1910 in [[Melksham]], Wiltshire, England. He was the youngest child born to Frederick Joseph and Augusta (née Tyler) Goodwin. Sidney had five older siblings - Lillian, Charles, William, Jessie, and Harold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/biography/839/|title=Master Sidney Leslie Goodwin|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]]|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SS ''New York'' and RMS ''Titanic''==
Frederick's brother, Thomas, had already left England and was living in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. Thomas wrote to Frederick, telling him about the opening of a power station there. It has been speculated that the famed [[Schoellkopf Power Station|Schoellkopf Hydroelectric Power Station]] (Station A), due to open in 1912, would have been his employer had he lived. Frederick, a compositor, packed up his wife and six children to prepare for the move. They booked third-class passage on the S.S. ''New York'' out of [[Southampton]], but due to a coal strike that year the vessel's passage was delayed, and they were transferred to the RMS ''Titanic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/biography/832/|title=Mr Frederick Joseph Goodwin|publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica|accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They boarded the ''Titanic'' in Southampton as third-class passengers.

Not much is known about the Goodwins' activities during the voyage, except that they may have been separated by sex in opposite ends of the ship, Frederick and his older sons in the bow, and Augusta with Sidney and the girls in the stern. Harold also met and spent some time with [[Frank John William Goldsmith|Frank Goldsmith]], who survived.

By the time the Goodwins received a warning about the collision with the iceberg, all the lifeboats had been launched. The entire family perished in the sinking.

In his book, ''The Night Lives On'', historian [[Walter Lord]] devoted a chapter ("What Happened to the Goodwins?") to the family, using the fact that they were English to challenge the [[White Star Line]]'s implication that such high numbers of third-class passengers perished because they could not understand the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lord, Walter|title=The Night Lives On|edition= New |publisher= Avon Books|date= March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The unknown child==
[[File:Unknown Titanic Child.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The grave of Sidney Goodwin in Fairview Cemetery, in the winter.]]
The body of a fair-haired toddler was the fourth pulled from the ocean by the recovery ship [[CS Mackay-Bennett|CS ''Mackay-Bennett'']], on 17 April 1912. The description read:

{{quote|
'''NO. 4 - MALE - ESTIMATED AGE, 2 - HAIR, FAIR.'''
 
'''CLOTHING''' - Grey coat with fur on collar and cuffs; brown serge frock; petticoat; flannel garment; pink woolen singlet; brown shoes and stockings.
 
'''No marks whatever.'''

The sailors aboard the ''Mackay-Bennett'', who were very shocked by the discovery of the unknown boy's body, paid for a monument, and he was buried on 4 May 1912 with a copper pendant placed in his coffin by recovery sailors that read "Our Babe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/5510/ |title=RMS ''Titanic'': The Funerals, Memorials and Legacy of the Lost Passengers and Her Crew |publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica |first=Brandon C. |last=Holm |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2002 (when he was first, though mistakenly, identified through DNA testing), he was known simply as "The Unknown Child". His body, identified as that of a child around two years old, was initially believed to be that of either a two-year-old [[Swedish people|Swedish]] boy, Gösta Pålsson; or a two-year-old [[Irish people|Irish]] boy, Eugene Rice, two other fair-haired toddlers who perished in the sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/1516/ |title=The Last of the Lost |publisher=Encyclopedia Titanica |first1=Alan |last1=Ruffman |first2=Ryan |last2=Parr |date=3 August 2002 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification and re-identification==
The American [[PBS]] television series ''[[Secrets of the Dead]]'' initially identified the body as [[Eino Viljami Panula]], a 13-month-old Finnish baby, based on DNA testing of three teeth and a small, weathered bone.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Thompson |title=Revealed by DNA after 95 years: The British baby who died on the Titanic |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-472436/Revealed-DNA-95-years-The-British-baby-died-Titanic.html |publisher=The Daily Mail |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with improved DNA testing available in 2007, Canadian researchers at [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]] tested the child's HVS1, a type of [[mitochondrial DNA]] molecule, and it did not match the Panula family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Titanic baby given new identity |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6925640.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA extracted from the exhumed remains and DNA provided by a surviving maternal relative helped positively match the remains to Sidney, and the re-identification was announced on 30 July 2007.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/Atlantic/070731/t073131A.html|work=CBC|location=Canada|title= Researchers properly identify unknown child who died aboard ''Titanic''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the bodies of two other children, both older boys, were recovered, it was Sidney who came to be a symbol of all the children lost in the sinking. He is buried in [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia]], and a marker was recently added to the memorial with his name and dates of birth and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2012-04/15/c_131527344.htm |title=People remember 'Unknown Child' that died from ''Titanic'' sinking|work=xinhauanet.com|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of his shoes were donated to Halifax's [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in 2002 by the descendants of a Halifax police officer who guarded the bodies and clothing of ''Titanic'' victims.

'''Susan Schneider''' is an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.  She is a Distinguished Scholar at the U.S. Library of Congress, a professor at The University of Connecticut, a faculty member in the Ethics and Technology Group at the [[Yale]] Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, and a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. She is also a recipient of the National Endowment for the Humanities Public Scholar Award.

Schneider contends that the most intelligent alien beings we encounter will be "[[postbiological]] in nature", being forms of [[artificial intelligence]], that they would be superintelligent, and that we can predict the shape of some of these superintelligences would be like.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sifter/2014/12/if-we-ever-meet-aliens-they-ll-probably-be-robots|title=If we ever meet aliens, they’ll probably be robots|website=news.sciencemag.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224204632/http://news.sciencemag.org/sifter/2014/12/if-we-ever-meet-aliens-they-ll-probably-be-robots#|archive-date=2015-12-24|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her reason for the claim that the most intelligent aliens will be "postbiological" is called the "short window observation.” This holds that by the time any society learns to transmit radio signals, they're likely just a few hundred years from upgrading their own biology.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Maddie|title=The Dominant Life Form in the Cosmos Is Probably Superintelligent Robots|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-dominant-life-form-in-the-cosmos-is-probably-superintelligent-robots|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider defends a view of the nature of the mental symbols (where such are the basic vocabulary items in the language of thought). She then used this conception of symbols, together with certain work on the nature of meaning, to construct a theory of the nature of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Frege’s puzzle and Frege cases: Defending a quasi-syntactic solution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041707000319|journal = Cognitive Systems Research|date = 2008-03-01|pages = 76–91|volume = 9|series = Perspectives on Social Cognition|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/j.cogsys.2007.07.003|first = Robert D.|last = Rupert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic theory of concepts is intended to be ecumenical, having a version that applying in the case of connectionism, as well as versions that apply to both the prototype theory and definitions view of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Susan Schneider, "The Language of Thought: A New Philosophical Direction" (MIT Press, 2011)|url = http://newbooksinphilosophy.com/2011/08/15/susan-schneider-the-language-of-thought-a-new-philosophical-direction-mit-press-2011/|accessdate = 2015-10-26|first = Carrie|last = Figdor|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150920091233/http://newbooksinphilosophy.com/2011/08/15/susan-schneider-the-language-of-thought-a-new-philosophical-direction-mit-press-2011/#|archive-date = 2015-09-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tales from the Crypt''''' is a 1972 British [[horror film]] directed by [[Freddie Francis]]. It is an [[anthology film]] consisting of five separate segments, based on stories from [[EC Comics]]. It was produced by [[Amicus Productions]] and filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], and is one of several Amicus horror anthologies made during the 1970s.

In the film, five strangers ([[Joan Collins]], [[Ian Hendry]], [[Robin Phillips]], [[Richard Greene]] and [[Nigel Patrick]]) encounter the mysterious [[Crypt Keeper]] ([[Ralph Richardson]]) in a [[crypt]], and he tells each in turn the manner of their death.

==Plot==
===Intro===
Five strangers go with a tourist group to view old [[catacomb]]s. Separated from the main group, they find themselves in a room with the mysterious Crypt Keeper ([[Ralph Richardson]]), who details how each of the strangers may die.

===...And All Through the House===
* Taken from ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'' #35

Joanne Clayton ([[Joan Collins]]) kills her husband ([[Martin Boddey]]) on [[Christmas Eve]]. She prepares to hide his body, but hears a radio announcement stating that a homicidal maniac ([[Oliver MacGreevy]]) is on the loose. She sees the killer (who is dressed in a [[Santa Claus]] costume) outside her house, but cannot call the police without exposing her own crimes.

After cleaning up her crime, Joanne finally attempts to call the police. However, her young daughter ([[Chloe Franks]]) - believing the maniac to be Santa - unlocks the door and lets him into the house, whereupon he starts to strangle Joanne to death.

===Reflection of Death===
* Taken from ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' #23

Carl Maitland ([[Ian Hendry]]) abandons his family to be with Susan Blake ([[Angela Grant]]). After they drive off together, they are involved in a car accident. He wakes up in the wrecked car and attempts to hitch-hike home, but everyone he meets reacts with horror upon seeing him. Arriving at his house, he sees his wife (Susan Denny) with another man.

He knocks on the door, but she screams and slams the door. He then goes to see Susan to find out that she is blind from the accident. She says that Carl died two years ago in the crash. Glancing at a reflective tabletop, he sees he has the face of a rotted, hideous corpse and screams in horror. Carl then wakes up and finds out that it was a dream, but the moment he does, the crash occurs as previously seen.

===Poetic Justice===
* Taken from ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'' No. 12, (March–April 1952)

Edward Elliott ([[David Markham]]) and his son James ([[Robin Phillips]]) are a snobbish pair who resent their neighbour, dustman Arthur Grimsdyke ([[Peter Cushing]]), who owns a number of dogs and entertains children in his house; James, in particular, strongly detests the old man. To get rid of what they see as a blight on the neighbourhood, they push Grimsdyke into a frenzy by conducting a [[smear campaign]] against him, first resulting in the removal of his beloved dogs (one of them returns to him), then persuading a member of the council to have him removed from his job, and later exploiting parents' paranoid fears about [[child molestation]].

On Valentine's Day, James sends Grimsdyke a number of poison-pen Valentines, supposedly from the neighbours, driving the old man to suicide. One year later, Grimsdyke comes back from the dead and takes revenge on James. The following morning, Edward finds his son dead with a note that said, "HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY--YOU WERE MEAN AND CRUEL-RIGHT FROM THE START-NOW YOU REALLY HAVE NO--!"Edward opens up the folded end of the note and realizes that the final word of that note is "HEART," represented by James's heart, which has been torn from his body while still beating.

===Wish You Were Here===
* ''Wish You Were Here'' (''The Haunt of Fear'' #22, November–December 1953), a variation on [[W. W. Jacobs]]'s famed short story "[[The Monkey's Paw]]".

Ineffective businessman Ralph Jason ([[Richard Greene]]) is close to financial ruin. His wife Enid ([[Barbara Murray]]) discovers a Chinese [[figurine]] that says it will grant three wishes to whoever possesses it; Enid decides to wish for a fortune; surprisingly, it comes true. However, Ralph is killed, seemingly in a car crash, on the way to his lawyer's office to collect it. The lawyer ([[Roy Dotrice]]) then advises Enid she will inherit a fortune from her deceased husband's life insurance plan. She uses her second wish to bring him back to the way he was just before the accident, but learns that his death was due to a heart attack immediately before the crash (caused by fright when he sees the figure of "death" following him on a motorcycle).

As she uses her final wish to bring him back alive and to live forever, she discovers too late that he was embalmed. She tries to kill him to end his pain but because she wished him to live forever, he cannot be killed. She has now trapped him in eternal pain.

===Blind Alleys===
* Taken from ''Tales from the Crypt'' No. 46 (February–March 1955)

Major William Rogers ([[Nigel Patrick]]), the mean new director of a home for the blind made up mostly of elderly and middle-aged men, makes drastic financial cuts, reducing heat and rationing food for the residents while he lives in luxury with his [[German Shepherd]], Shane. When Rogers ignores the pleas of resident George Carter ([[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]) for help, another resident dies from the cold and a stone-faced Carter leads the others in exacting revenge. Carter and his group subdue the staff, then lock Rogers and Shane in separate rooms in the basement as they construct a small maze of narrow corridors between the two rooms. Rogers and Shane are starved, leading to the dog becoming ravenous.

After two days, Rogers' door is unlocked and he must find his way through with the lights off. He yells out in pain as Carter turns the lights on, discovering one corridor is lined with razor blades. Rogers makes it past, but finds Shane being let out from the room in front of him. He flees back towards the razors, but Carter turns the lights off and Rogers is heard screaming as the hungry dog catches up with him.

===Finale===
After completing the final tale, the Crypt Keeper reveals that he was not warning them of what would happen, but telling them what has already happened: they have all "died without repentance". Clues to this twist can be spotted throughout the film, including Joanna wearing the brooch her husband had given her for Christmas just before she killed him. The door to [[Hell]] opens and Joanna, Carl, James, Ralph, and Major Rogers all enter. "And now, who's next?" asks the Crypt Keeper, turning to face the camera as he says "Perhaps...YOU?" The scene pulls away as the entrance to the Crypt Keeper's lair is in flames.

== Production ==
[[Milton Subotsky]] of [[Amicus Productions]] had long been a fan of [[EC Comics]]' ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' and eventually persuaded his partner [[Max Rosenberg]] to buy the rights. The copyright owner, [[William Gaines]], insisted on script approval. The budget of £170,000 was higher than usual for an Amicus production, and was partly funded by [[American International Pictures]]. Peter Cushing was originally offered the part played by Richard Greene, but wanted to try something different and played the elderly Grimsdyke instead. Filming started on 13 September 1971 and finished in 1972.

== Critical reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 88% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1020820-tales_from_the_crypt/|title=Tales from the Crypt (1972)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720315/REVIEWS/203150301/1023 |title=Tales from the Crypt |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=6 July 2012 |date=15 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllRovi|Allmovie]]'s review of the film was generally favourable, writing, "It has a certain magnetism about it that is hard to resist and which accounts for its enduring popularity.

== Points of interest ==
* Only two of the stories are from EC's ''Tales from the Crypt'' comic book. The reason for this, according to ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' founding editor [[Russ Jones]], is that producer Milton Subotsky did not own a run of the original EC comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by Jones. The story ''Wish You Were Here'' was reprinted in the paperback collection ''[[The Vault of Horror (book)|The Vault of Horror]]'' (Ballantine, 1965). The other four stories in the movie were among the eight stories reprinted in ''[[Tales from the Crypt (book)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (Ballantine, 1964).
* Richardson's hooded Crypt Keeper, more sombre than the EC original (as illustrated by [[Al Feldstein]] and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]]), has a monk-like appearance and resembles EC's GhouLunatics. In the EC horror comics, the other horror hosts (the [[The Haunt of Fear#The Old Witch|Old Witch]] and the [[Vault-Keeper (comics)|Vault Keeper]]) wore hoods, while the Crypt Keeper did not.
* The earlier Amicus anthology film ''[[Torture Garden (film)|Torture Garden]]'' features a similar ending breaking the [[fourth wall]].
* The screenplay was adapted into a tie-in novel by [[Jack Oleck]], ''Tales from the Crypt'' (Bantam, 1972). Oleck, who wrote the novel ''Messalina'' (1950), also scripted for EC's Picto-Fiction titles, ''Crime Illustrated'', ''Shock Illustrated'' and ''Terror Illustrated''. A tie-in was also written by Oleck for the later Amicus anthology film ''The Vault of Horror'', released in 1973.

== Connections to the TV series ==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}
''...And All Through the House'', ''Blind Alleys'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were all somewhat remade into episodes for the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales From the Crypt]]'' television show. ''Blind Alleys'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were both changed.

* ''...And All Through the House'' had the woman killing her husband so that she can take her daughter and live with her boyfriend. The episode ended with her daughter letting the axe-wielding maniac into the house as he quotes "Naughty or Nice" with the episode ending with the woman screaming. The Crypt Keeper stated that the daughter was not harmed because the escaped maniac liked older women....in pieces.

* ''Blind Alleys'' was now ''Revenge is the Nuts'' and was about a beautiful blind girl (portrayed by [[Teri Polo]]) who comes to live at a house for the blind where the sadistic director (played by ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'''s [[Anthony Zerbe]]) tries to sexually assault her. In the end, she and the other residents take their revenge on the director in the same fashion as in the original story.

* ''Wish You Were Here'' is similar to the TV series' 7th-season episode ''Last Respects'' in that both borrow plot elements from W. W. Jacobs's classic story "The Monkey's Paw", and both are directed by the original film's director [[Freddie Francis]]. Like many of the show's episodes, "Last Respects" uses the title of an existing story from the comics (''Tales From The Crypt'' #23), but does not use the story itself. The statue from the film is reverted to the original monkey's paw in the TV episode, and the story now deals with three sisters who come into possession of it. One wishes for a million pounds, and she and the second sister are in a car crash where she dies, and her life insurance policy is for one million pounds. When the third sister wishes that the dead sister was the way she was just before the crash, she learns that she was actually killed by the second sister. In a form of revenge, the third sister gives her last wish to her sister, but she did not say ''which'' sister she wanted to give it to, beating the monkey's paw at its own game. The wish is transferred to the dead sister who comes back to kill the second sister.

[[File:Walter James Redfern Turner bust by Lady Ottoline Morrell.jpg|right|thumb|A 1926 photo of Walter J. Turner by [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]]]
'''Walter James Redfern Turner''' (13 October 1889&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36589?docPos=1&lt;/ref&gt; – 18 November 1946) was an Australian-born, English-domiciled writer and critic.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;McKenna, C. W. F., (1990). [online]: '[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/turner-walter-james-redfern-8890/text15615 Turner, Walter James Redfern (1884–1946)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 12, National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]]: [[Melbourne University Press]], accessed 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], the son of a church musician – organist at [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]] – and [[warehouseman]], Walter James Turner, and Alice May (née Watson), he was educated at Carlton State School, [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] and the [[Working Men's College of Melbourne|Working Men's College]].&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeathNotice"/&gt; In 1907 he left for England to pursue a career in writing.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt; There he met and befriended a number of literary intellectual figures, including [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], and [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] (the caricature of her in his book ''The Aesthetes'' ended their friendship). On 5 April 1918, in Chelsea, he married Delphine Marguerite Dubuis (died 1951).&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt; During the period from the First World War until the mid-1930s, he was known primarily as a poet.  His 1916 ''Romance'' ("Chimborazo, Cotopaxi....") is probably the best remembered of his poems.

[[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] had the highest praise for Turner's poetry, saying that it left him "lost in admiration and astonishment",{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and included some of it in his ''Oxford Book of Modern Poetry'' (while omitting several authors very much better known today for their verse, such as [[Wilfred Owen]]). But today, although Turner produced several novels and plays, as well as books of poems, his reputation rests on his musical biographies of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. He was musically untrained, and in the words of the music critic Charles Reid, "unhampered by any excess of technical knowledge" to restrain his "racy dogmatism."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Mozart'' in has been reprinted many times in the 70 years since it was first published. Some of his musical articles for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and other journals were reprinted in ''Music and Life'', ''Facing the Music'', ''Musical Meanderings'', and ''Variations on the theme of Music''.

Turner was a close friend of the pianist [[Artur Schnabel]], about whom he frequently wrote, and with whom he frequently went hiking.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} He was a champion of [[Arturo Toscanini]]'s conducting, which was for him a revelation in structure and expression. [[Siegfried Sassoon]] was another close friend of Turner, at least for a while. Turner, his wife, and Sassoon all cohabited a house on Tufton Street before Sassoon moved out in 1925. After this he fell out with Turner so badly that he made no mention whatsoever of him in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} During the Second World War, he edited a number of volumes about English culture. On 18 November 1946 he died at Hammersmith of a [[thrombus|cerebral thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeathNotice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35767906 |title=Cable News in Brief. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]] (AAP) |location=Adelaide |date=21 November 1946 |accessdate=28 October 2012 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia | quote = '''Literary Editor Dies''' The death has occurred of Mr. Walter James ("Redfern") Turner, literary editor of "The Spectator." at the age of 57.

He became a le ading dramatic and music critic in London and had a number of stories, essays and poems published }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9214">In the [[United States]], the '''War on Gangs''' is a national movement to reduce [[gang]]-related activity, [[gang violence]], and gang drug involvement on the local, state, and federal level. The War on Gangs is a multi-lateral approach, as federal agencies seek to disrupt the cycle of violence through intervention with state police and [[social worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kingsbury|first=Alex|title=Inside the Feds' War on Gang Violence|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/national/articles/2008/12/10/inside-the-feds-war-on-gang-violence?page=3|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historically, gangs surfaced in the United States as early as the 1820s, mainly in New York.  Gang activity was still considered criminal, however, when drugs were made illegal in 1912 with the [[International Opium Convention]], gang activity and drug trafficking increased. The United States saw a major increase in gangs during the 1970s and 1980s, due to population growth and the demand for drugs. In 1991, it was estimated that there were 774,000 active gang members in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Musto|first=David F.|title=Opium, Cocaine and Marijuana in American History|journal=Scientific American |year=1991|volume=265|issue=1| pages=40–47|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0791-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal level ==

Although many gang enforcement and policing tactics are carried out on a state-by-state basis, there are federal programs that aim to address the War on Gangs. National agencies, like the [[FBI]], [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[United States Marshals Service]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]], have enacted programs that target gangs and gang related activities at the federal level.

At the federal level, the “[[Gangbusters Bill]]” of 2005, authorized increased federal spending to support federal, state and local law enforcement efforts against gang violence and shared intelligence and joint investigation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papachristos|first=Andrew|title=Interpreting Inkblots: Deciphering and Doing Something about Modern Street Gangs Gangs &amp; Gang-Related Crime: Reaction Essay|journal=Criminology and Public Policy|year=2005|volume=4|issue=3|pages=643–652|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9133.2005.00301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State level ==
The criminalization of those associated with such terminology falls solely upon the state magistrate, while the policing involves a cohesive effort by local, state, and federal authorities. The policing tactics implemented and aimed to disrupt, deter, and eliminate criminal street gang activity naturally varies from city to city and state to state depending on the size of the problem as well as legislation.  However, the advancement of [[counterinsurgency]] technologies and strategies proven effective in militarized zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan has provided authorities with new ways to fight the “war on gangs” in America.  Statistical analysis in conjunction with advanced [[military software]] can now provide lawmaking authorities with the type of information that maps connections between gang activities, individual suspects, their [[social circle]]s, family ties, and neighborhood connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Symons|first=Glady L.|title=Racialization of the Street Gang Issue in Montreal: a police perspective|journal=Canadian Ethnic Studies|year=1999|volume=3|issue=1|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authorities now have the tools to deconstruct the culture of ‘criminal street gangs’ by not only identifying their territorial boundaries but criminal industries, politics affiliates both in and out of the penitentiary, [[gang code]] and ethics, as well as illegal activities.

Beyond the push for a national model providing a tactical framework outlining the methodologies behind the [[policing strategies]] of: prevention, intervention, intelligence, and suppression of criminal street gang activity, there is yet another arena where the “War on Gangs” continues to be fought, the political arena.  Organized criminal street gangs such as 18th Street are boasting over 65,000 members and are believed to be operating in over 120 U.S. cities, 37 states, in addition to being considered an international crime organization linked to corrupt political insurgency. The [[Gangster Disciples]] is an organization with over 30,000 members in 35 states, employing themselves not only in drug trade but sponsoring political candidates, infiltrating police and private security agencies, and sponsoring protest marches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=M. L.|title=Maybe We Shouldn't Study "Gangs": Does Reification Obscure Youth Violence?|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|volume=21|issue=2|pages=170–190|doi=10.1177/1043986204272912|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Local and community level ==
Researchers have attempted to understand the theoretical implications for participation in gang activity. Many of them looked into the reasons why people join gangs. The most common reasons examined among gang researchers include factors such as socioeconomic status, peer-to-peer and parent-to-child relationships, and discrimination. For example, in 2007, California State University-Northridge professor [[Kay Kei-Ho Pih]] and three other university professors conducted a study examining the purpose of capital (drug trafficking) among Latino and Taiwanese gangs. Their findings showed that the Latino gang members were raised in poor neighborhoods, wanted to make quick and easy money from selling drugs, and did not receive support from their parents about their academic endeavors which led them to drop out of school or complete a [[GED]]. The Taiwanese triad members, on the other hand, came from higher socioeconomic statuses, prioritized their education getting undergrad and graduate degrees, and sold drugs for recreation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pih|first=Kay Kei-Ho|title=Different Strokes for Different Gangs: An Analysis of Capital Among Latino and Asian Gang Members|journal=Sociological Perspectives|year=2008|pages=473–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hua-Lun Huang argues that gangs such as the Chinese [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]]s and the [[Mexican Mafia]] could also form because of extremist ideology and political connections to government outside of the United States. In 2002, the [[Routine activity theory]] was used by California State University, Long Beach criminal justice professor, John Z. Wang in his case study about eight bank robberies in Houston, Texas, which states that crimes committed by gangs are influenced by three factors: 
*Motivated offenders
*The availability of suitable targets
*The absence of capable guardians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=J|title=Bank Robberies by an Asian Gang: An Assessment of the Routine Activities Theory|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|volume=46|issue=5|year=2002|pages=555–68|doi=10.1177/030662402236740|pmid=12365143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative approaches===
Several scholars suggest that alternative methods should be implemented in order to fight against the war on gangs including the development of community-based outreach programs instead of continuing to arrest potential gang members. For example, in 1998, [[Westminster Police Department]] director Douglas Kent and Claremont University professor, [[George Felkenes]] conducted a cross-sectional study on the cultural reasons why Vietnamese youth in Southern California join and participate in gang activity by interviewing over 250 Vietnamese youth and parents. Felkenes and Kent concluded their study with recommendations on how to initiate gang prevention programs: 
*They are necessary and should be carefully planned.
*They must focus on minority youth rather than the general public.
*They should make the youth population view gangs in a negative light.
*They should teach them how to cope with gangs in residential areas by avoiding their influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=D.R.|author2=Felkenes, G.T. |title=Cultural Explanations for Vietnamese Youth Involvement in Street Gangs|journal=US Department of Justic|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign criminologist, Jun Sung Hong in his 2010 study about the [[Bronfenbrenner]] ecological approach to understanding Vietnamese gangs in America states that “after-school programs and activities for youths, such as sports or job training opportunities might enhance pro-social behavior and reduce motivation to join a gang.” He also argues that professional organizations and practitioners should also educate government officials about the correlation between social conditions and the negative outcomes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong|first=Jun Sung|title=Understanding Vietnamese Youth Gangs in America: An Ecological Systems Analysis|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|year=2010|pages=253–60|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2010.01.003|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wollemia''''' {{need IPA}}is a genus of [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] in the family [[Araucariaceae]]. ''Wollemia'' was only known through fossil records until the [[Australia]]n species ''Wollemia nobilis'' was discovered in 1994 in a temperate [[rainforest]] wilderness area of the [[Wollemi National Park]] in [[New South Wales]], in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided sandstone [[gorge]]s 150&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Sydney]]. The genus is named for the National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/annan/the_garden/Plant_of_the_Month/wollemia_nobilis |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019130835/https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/annan/the_garden/Plant_of_the_Month/wollemia_nobilis |archive-date=2015-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both botanical and popular literature the tree has been almost universally referred to as the '''Wollemi pine''', although it is not a true pine (genus ''[[Pinus]]'') nor a member of the pine family ([[Pinaceae]]), but, rather, is related to ''[[Agathis]]'' and ''[[Araucaria]]'' in the family [[Araucariaceae]]. The oldest fossil of the Wollemi tree has been dated to 200 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s1471653.htm|title=Gardening Australia - Fact Sheet: Wollemi Pine|work=abc.net.au|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wollemi pine is classified as [[critically endangered]] (CR) on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]'s [[IUCN Red List|Red List]],&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; and is legally protected in Australia.&lt;ref name="NPWS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Home |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222042928/http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Home |archive-date=2008-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Recovery Plan has been drawn up, outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long term.&lt;ref name="NPWS" /&gt;

==Description==
[[image:Wollemia bark.JPG|thumb|left|''Wollemia nobilis'' - bark]]
''Wollemia nobilis'' is an [[evergreen]] [[tree]] reaching {{convert|25|-|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. The [[bark (botany)|bark]] is very distinctive, dark brown and knobbly, quoted as resembling [[Coco Pops]] breakfast cereal.&lt;ref name="woodford2002"&gt;James Woodford, ''The Wollemi Pine: The incredible discovery of a living fossil from the age of the dinosaurs'', (Revised Edition), The Text Publishing Company, 2002, {{ISBN|1-876485-74-4}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree [[coppice]]s readily, and most specimens are multiple-trunked or appear as clumps of trunks thought to derive from old coppice growth, with some consisting of up to 100 stems of differing sizes.&lt;ref name="NPWS" /&gt; The branching is unusual in that nearly all the side branches never have further branching. After a few years, each branch either terminates in a [[conifer cone|cone]] (either male or female) or ceases growth. After this, or when the cone becomes mature, the [[branch]] dies. New branches then arise from dormant buds on the main trunk. Rarely, a side branch will turn erect and develop into a secondary trunk, which then bears a new set of side branches.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are flat linear, 3–8&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm broad. They are arranged spirally on the shoot but twisted at the base to appear in two or four flattened ranks. As the leaves mature, they develop from bright lime-green to a more yellowish-green.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbgsyd.gov.au/information_about_plants/wollemi_pine/facts_&amp;_figures|title=wollemi pine/facts &amp; figures|date=April 2003|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney}} - via [[ARKive]]&lt;/ref&gt; The seed cones are green, 6–12&amp;nbsp;cm long and 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, and mature about 18–20 months after [[wind pollination]]. They disintegrate at maturity to release the [[seed]]s which are small and brown, thin and papery with a wing around the edge to aid wind-dispersal.&lt;ref name="NPWS" /&gt; The male ([[pollen]]) cones are slender conic, 5–11&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm broad and reddish-brown in colour and are lower on the tree than the seed cones.&lt;ref name="NPWS" /&gt; Seedlings appear to be slow-growing&lt;ref name="NPWS" /&gt; and mature trees are extremely long-lived; some of the older individuals today are estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 years old.&lt;ref name="FF" /&gt;

==Discovery==
[[image:Wollemia cones.JPG|thumb|right|''Wollemia nobilis'' male and female cones]]
[[image:Wollemia nobilis cone.jpg|thumb|right|''Wollemia nobilis'' - young pollen cone]]
The discovery, on or about 10 September 1994, by [[David Noble (canyoner)|David Noble]], Michael Casteleyn and Tony Zimmerman, only occurred because the group had been systematically exploring the area looking for new canyons. Noble had good botanical knowledge, and quickly recognised the trees as unusual because of the unique bark  and worthy of further investigation. Dave took specimens to work for identification, expecting someone to be able to identify the plants. National Parks then went under a  veil of secrecy, with the discoverers not learning the full magnitude of their discovery  for about six months. National Parks came close to damaging the stand when a helicopter beeing used to collect cones inadvertently pruned one the pines with it rotor.

The other members of the discovery  party questioned the naming but were informed that ''nobilis'' referred to the trees being noble in structure and not to David Noble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Andrew |last=Thornhill |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2004/wollemia-nobilis.html |title=Growing Native Plants: Wollemia nobilis |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first illustrations of the Wollemi Pine were done by David Mackay, a botanical artist and scientific illustrator who was working at the [[Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in Sydney when the species was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newengland.focusmag.com.au/david-mackay/|title=David Mackay|date=2009-02-08|work=New England Focus|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further study would be needed to establish its relationship to other conifers. The initial suspicion was that it had certain characteristics of the 200-million-year-old family [[Araucariaceae]], but was not similar to any living species in the family. Comparison with living and [[fossil]]ised Araucariaceae proved that it was a member of that family, and it has been placed into a new genus with ''[[Agathis]]'' and ''[[Araucaria]]''.

Fossils closely resembling ''Wollemia'' that are thought to be related to it are widespread in Australia, [[New Zealand]] and [[Antarctica]] from [[Cretaceous]] era sediments, but ''Wollemia nobilis'' is the sole living member of its genus. These trees remained common throughout eastern Australia until around 40 million years ago but then gradually declined in range and abundance. Before the [[relict]] population was discovered in Wollemi National Park, the most recent known fossils of the genus date from approximately 2 million years ago in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Fewer than a hundred trees are known to be growing wild, in three localities not far apart. It is very difficult to count individuals, as most trees are multistemmed and may have a connected root system. Genetic testing has revealed that all the specimens are genetically indistinguishable, suggesting that the species has been through a [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]] in which its population became so low (possibly just one or two individuals) that all genetic variability was lost.&lt;ref name="Molecular_Ecology_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01926.x |title=Comparative genetic study confirms exceptionally low genetic variation in the ancient and endangered relictual conifer, ''Wollemia nobilis'' (Araucariaceae) |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=2331–2343 |year=2003 |last1=Peakall |first1=Rob |last2=Ebert |first2=Daniel |last3=Scott |first3=Leon J. |last4=Meagher |first4=Patricia F. |last5=Offord |first5=Cathy A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A propagation programme made Wollemi pine specimens available to botanical gardens, first in Australia in 2006 and subsequently throughout the world. It may prove to be a valuable tree for ornament, either planted in open ground or for tubs and planters. In Australia, potted native Wollemi pines have been promoted as a Christmas tree.&lt;ref name="acf"&gt;[http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=3256 ACF - Tips for treading lightly this festive season].

The [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in Sydney have published information on how to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/Science-Conservation/Our-Work-Discoveries/Science-News/Wollemi-Pine-Seed-Production |title=How to grow your Wollemi Pine |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]] |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeny==
The genus ''Wollemia'' shares morphological characteristics with the genera ''[[Araucaria]]'' and ''[[Agathis]]''. ''Wollemia'' and ''Araucaria'' both have closely crowned sessile and amphistomatic leaves, and aristate bract scales, while ''Wollemia'' and ''Agathis'' both have fully fused bracts, ovuliferous scales, and winged seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=W.G. |last2=Hill |first2=K.D. |last3=Allen |first3=J.M. |year=1995 |title=Wollemia nobilis, a new living Australian genus and species in the Araucariaceae |journal=Telopea |volume=6 |issue=2–3 |pages=173–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrutiny of the fossil record likewise does not clarify ''Wollemia''’s relationship to ''Araucaria'' or ''Agathis'', since the former has similarly disparate leaf characters in its adult and juvenile forms, and the latter has similar cone characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=T.
