{{Pakistan terrorist attacks}}
The '''2009 attack on the [[Sri Lanka national cricket team]]''' occurred on 3 March 2009, when a bus carrying [[Sri Lanka]]n [[cricket]]ers, part of a larger convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near [[Gaddafi Stadium]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="samaylive" /&gt; The cricketers were on their way to play the third day of the second [[Test cricket|Test]] against the [[Pakistani cricket team]]. Six members of the Sri Lanka national cricket team were wounded. Six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7920260.stm|title= Gunmen shoot Sri Lanka cricketers|date=3 March 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090304020128/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7920260.stm| archivedate= 4 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was believed to have been carried out by [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]]. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the attack were killed during a police raid in Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1171349/terrorists-involved-sri-lankan-cricket-team-attack-killed-lahore-raid/ Terrorists involved in Sri Lankan cricket team attack killed in Lahore raid]&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the attack's mastermind was killed in eastern [[Afghanistan]] during a military operation, while hiding there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1196066/sri-lanka-cricket-team-attack-mastermind-killed-afghanistan/ ri Lanka cricket team attack mastermind 'killed' in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the tour==
The safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been an issue.  In May 2002, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a [[2002 Karachi bus bombing|suicide bomb attack]] outside their hotel. However, they returned in the 2003/2004 season to fulfill their commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/newzealand/engine/series/61139.html |title=New Zealand in Pakistan ODI Series, 2003/04 |publisher=Cricinfo |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] had recently refused to tour on safety grounds.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s644978.htm|title=Australian cricket team cancel Pakistan tour|last=Knight|first=Ben |date=9 August 2002|work=ABC News|accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 2008–09|The Sri Lankan cricket team was in Pakistan]] as a replacement for the [[India national cricket team|Indian team]], who had pulled out after the [[Mumbai attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html|title=Sri Lanka have confirmed tour – Pakistan board|date=10 December 2008|work=Cricinfo Pakistan|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208034909/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html| archivedate=8 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to give them presidential-style security.&lt;ref name="NYT_Mar03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html|title=For Pakistan, Attack Exposes Security Flaws |last=Perlez|first=Jane|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-04| date=3 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402020739/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html| archivedate=2 April 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/298999.html |title=Cricinfo – South Africa in Pakistan Test Series, 2007/08 |publisher=Content-www.cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
[[File:Location of 2009 Liberty chowk attack.png|thumb|left|250px|Black/grey depicts the route for team convoy. The escape route for attackers is shown in blue.]]

According to the officials, 12 gunmen were hiding near Liberty Square, in the centre of Lahore, waiting for the Sri Lankan team to pass on their way to the Gaddafi stadium. They started firing at the bus when it crossed the road. The [[Pakistan police]] escorting the team returned fire; in the ensuing fighting, six policemen and two civilians died. After about 20 minutes, the militants fled, leaving behind rocket launchers and grenades.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The gunmen first shot at the wheels of the bus, and then fired at the bus itself and its occupants.&lt;ref name="safe and out of danger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4931223/Sri-Lankans-safe-and-out-of-danger-after-Pakistan-terror-attack.html|title=Sri Lankans 'safe and out of danger' after Pakistan terror attack|date=3 March 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 March 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307084008/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4931223/Sri-Lankans-safe-and-out-of-danger-after-Pakistan-terror-attack.html| archivedate= 7 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had fired a rocket at the bus, which missed and hit a nearby electric pole. The driver of the bus, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, had then kept on driving a distance of about {{Convert|500|m|ft}} until they reached the stadium. Khalil was hailed as a hero for his bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903181732.htm|title=Pakistan honours bus driver Khalil for his brave act |date=18 March 2009|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2009-03-29|location=Chennai, India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090322124217/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903181732.htm| archivedate= 22 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/man-who-saved-sri-lankan-team-in-2009-lahore-attack-still-traumatised-995354.html | title=Man who saved Sri Lankan team in 2009 Lahore attack still traumatised | work=[[Network18]] | date=August 17, 2015 | accessdate=May 27, 2017 | agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had also thrown a grenade under the bus, which exploded after the bus had passed over it.&lt;ref name="lucky to survive" /&gt;

A minivan following the team bus carrying the match referee and umpires was also fired upon and the driver was killed.&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;  [[Simon Taufel]], [[Steve Davis (umpire)|Steve Davis]], [[Nadeem Ghauri]], [[Ahsan Raza]], umpires performance manager Peter Manuel, liaison officer Abdul Sami and ICC match referee [[Chris Broad]] were in this minivan.  The minivan was subsequently allegedly abandoned by security personnel and no bullets were fired by the security forces for twenty minutes. [[Chris Broad]] threw himself over and kept his hand on the chest of [[Ahsan Raza]] to slow down the profuse bleeding from a bullet injury.  A police officer who climbed into the minivan to seek cover drove the minivan to safety.

Security cameras captured footage of several gunmen carrying automatic weapons and backpacks, firing on the convoy from the Liberty Square roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/02/pakistan.srilanka.attack/ |title=6 dead in attack on Sri Lankan cricketers |date=3 March 2009 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2009-03-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306212512/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/02/pakistan.srilanka.attack/ |archivedate= 6 March 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later seen jogging up the street and escaping on motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/04/pakistan.srilanka.attack/|title=Pakistan hunts for cricket attack gunmen|date=4 March 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was broadcast around the world presenting pictures of the attacks.&lt;ref name="NYT_Mar03"/&gt;

Security officials in [[Pakistan]] told [[The Times]] that most of the two dozen people arrested in connection with the attacks belonged to [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]],  [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], outlawed militant groups with close links to [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5854505.ece Gunmen who attacked cricketers in Lahore 'had links to al-Qaeda'], [[The Times]], 2009-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Aqeel, who is  an activist of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, escaped a police raid on his home in [[Kahuta]] on 9 March 2009.&lt;ref name=lontimes&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5875297.ece Lahore attack 'mastermind' escapes police raid in Punjab], [[The Times]], 2009-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Also another gunman Zubair, aka Naik Mohammad, of Zubair, was arrested from Madina Colony, Walton Road in Lahore. He was a waiter at a hotel in Rawalpindi, when he was recruited by Sifullah. He went to [[Miram Shah]] and was trained in the use of different weapons.

Other accused including Samiullah, alias Ejaz of [[Nankana Sahib District|Nankana district]], Adnan, alias Sajjad, Ajmal alias Ahsaan, Farooq, Ameer of Punjab [[Taliban]], and Umer, alias Abdul Wahab of [[D. I. Khan]], were still at large.

The attack was planned at Tauheed Hotel, and a house rented for this purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The [[auto rickshaws]] used in the attack were purchased by Samiullah.

A secret investigative report has surfaced later prepared by the Additional Inspector General of the Crime Investigation Division, Punjab on 22 January 2009 outlining the potential threat to the Sri Lankan team.&lt;ref name="Sri Lankan team attack suspect held"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-police-track-mastermind-of-attack-on-lankan-cricket-team--il--04|title=Sri Lankan team attack suspect held|last=Dawn Staff Reporter |date=17 June 2009|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=2009-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090620151639/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-police-track-mastermind-of-attack-on-lankan-cricket-team--il--04| archivedate= 20 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2012 Veracruz murder of journalists''' is about the disappearance, murder and dismemberment of three journalists and a woman who worked in public relations whose bodies were discovered in [[Boca del Río, Veracruz|Boca del Río]], [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17945766 |title=BBC News - Mexico violence: Two journalists killed in Veracruz |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rsf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.rsf.org/mexico-la-revista-proceso-esta-de-duelo-30-04-2012,42405.html |title=Asesinan a otros dos periodistas en Veracruz, una semana después del homicidio de Regina Martínez |publisher=Reporteros sin fronteras |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their bodies were recovered from a canal on [[World Press Freedom Day]], or 3 May 2012, and showed signs of torture and mutilation, which prompted calls for investigations into links with organized crime. The gruesome murder followed other murders of members of the press in the Veracruz area and during the [[Mexican Drug War]],  and highlighted the danger for working journalists.&lt;ref name=vanguardia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/asesinanaunreporteroydosfotografosenveracruz-1278955.html |title=Asesinan a un reportero y dos fotógrafos en Veracruz |publisher=Vanguardia |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
El Programa de Agravios a Periodistas y Defensores Civiles reported 580 incidents affecting the media from 2005 to May 2012, including 79 homicides, 14 missing journalists, and 26 recorded threats.&lt;ref name=elu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/85690.html |title=Los Estados - Matan en Veracruz a tres fotorreporteros |publisher=El Universal |date=2012-05-04 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reported incidents in Mexico has steadily increased over past years, reaching number eight in the [[Committee to Protect Journalists|Committee to Protect Journalists']](CPJ) impunity index.&lt;ref name=cpjimpunity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/impunity-index-2012.php |title=Getting Away With Murder|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Veracruz is well known for the Sinaloa and Zetas drug cartels.  These two cartels fight for control of Boca del Río, Veracruz, making it one of the most dangerous Mexican states for the press.  In a year and a half, six journalists were reported dead from this area.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite news|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_alarmed_by_wave_of_journalist_assassinations_in_mexico_and_calls_for_urgent_investigation/ |title=Director-General alarmed by wave of journalist assassinations in Mexico and calls for urgent investigation &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The murders of Luna, Huge, Rodríguez, and Becerra brought the total to ten reported deaths.

}}On World Press Freedom Day, the bodies of Guillermo Luna Varela, Gabriel Huge Córdova, and Esteban Rodríguez, three photojournalists, were recovered from La Zamorana canal in Boca del Río.  After not returning from covering a road incident, the families of Guillermo Luna and Gabriel Huge reported them missing.&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/mexico/2012/05/04/photographers_killed/ |title=Three photojournalists found dead in Veracruz |publisher=IFEX |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police found the dismembered bodies of Luna and Huge in a black plastic bag.  They also recovered the bodies of Rodríguez and Irasema Becerra.  Becerra and Luna were in a relationship, and she worked for a local newspaper firm.

== Journalists involved ==

===Guillermo Luna Varela===

Luna was a photographer who worked for ''Notiver'' and covered police-related stories.  Six months prior to his death, he worked for the website ''Veracruznews'', Voz del Sureste, and El Díario de Cardel. His police beat was in [[Xalapa]] and Boca del Río in Veracruz.  His body was found in Boca del Río alongside his uncle, Huge, and also showed signs of torture.  Luna was reported missing a day earlier by his family after not returning from covering a road accident.&lt;ref name=luna&gt;{{cite web|author=Guillermo Luna Varela |url=http://cpj.org/killed/2012/guillermo-luna-varela.php |title=Guillermo Luna Varela - Journalists Killed - Committee to Protect Journalists |publisher=Cpj.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabriel Huge Córdoba===

Huge's body displayed signs of torture and was found in a black bag with Luna, his nephew.  He worked at ''Notiver'' as a photographer and he also worked for a radio station in Poza Rica.  After three journalists of ''The Notiver'' were murdered the previous year, Huge fled from the city.  When he returned, he worked as a freelancer.  He disappeared on a Wednesday with Luna while covering a traffic incident.&lt;ref name=cpjhuge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/2012/gabriel-huge-cordova.php |title=Gabriel Huge Córdova - Journalists Killed |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=2012-05-04 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esteban Rodríguez Rodríguez===

Rodríguez was a retired photojournalist and reporter who worked for the ''Diario AZ''.  He became a welder after his retirement. After the murder of fellow journalists at ''The Notiver'', Rodríguez temporarily fled the state and retired, returning to Veracruz to work as a welder.&lt;ref name="elu" /&gt;

===Ana Irasema Becerra Jiménez===

A fourth body was later identified as Becerra, Luna's companion. While she was not a journalist, she worked for a local paper in public relations.

== Investigation ==
On Monday, 13 August, the [[Mexican Navy]] began to crack the case. "The Mexican Navy announced Monday that a man suspected of being a member of a drug gang had been captured while carrying the identification cards of a recently slain newspaper employee in the state of Veracruz. The authorities link the suspect, Juan Carlos Hernández Pulido, whom they captured Friday, to the killing of the newspaper employee, Irasema Becerra. Her dismembered remains were found in May along with those of three photojournalists."&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19250974 |title=BBC News - Mexico navy arrests suspect over killing of journalists |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Zabludovsky |first=Karla |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/world/americas/suspected-drug-gang-member-linked-to-veracruz-killings.html |title=Suspected Drug Gang Member Linked to Veracruz Killings |location=Veracruz (Mexico) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities searched the vehicle of Hernández, also known as "Bertha", when a suspicious individual was reported in a parking lot. In his vehicle, they found more than 150 bags of cocaine and marijuana, which he sold alongside illegal firearms.  They also found documents and an ID belonging to Becerra, linking him to the Boca Del Rio homicide. He is accused of working for the Jalisco drug cartel as a hired murderer.&lt;ref name=bbc2 /&gt;  Hernández was not working alone.

Veracruz authorities closed the case 15 August and claimed members of a drug gang confessed to the murders.  Some uncertainty about the finality of the case was presented. "But as soon as the arrests were announced on Wednesday, questions began to surface, beginning with the most obvious one. Why would the seven suspects, picked up on drug and weapons charges, spontaneously admit to far more serious crimes, in this case four brutal killings?"&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite web|last=Malkin |first=Elisabeth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/world/americas/skepticism-greets-arrests-in-murders-of-mexican-journalists.html |title=Skepticism Greets Arrests in Murders of Mexican Journalists |location=Mexico;Veracruz (Mexico) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Wilkinson|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-journalists-20120817,0,3054999.story |title=Mexico journalists' killings solved?

Further investigation, along with coincidence, linked several other cases of homicide among journalists and their families.  These linked cases are not linked to the Veracruz murder by perpetrator, but by similarities in the brutality of the homicides.  The following are related homicide cases:

* [[Regina Martínez Pérez]], journalist found strangled in her home in Xalapa, Veracruz on 28 April, Saturday.  She was considered a muckraker on drug cartels and worked as a correspondent for the magazine Proceso.
* [[Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz]], partner reporter to Córdova, found decapitated after her abduction by armed men outside her house.  A note was found on her body, further linking her to Miguel Ángel López Velasco.&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|author=Journalist found decapitated in Mexico |url=http://cpj.org/2011/07/journalist-found-decapitated-in-mexico.php |title=Journalist found decapitated in Mexico - Committee to Protect Journalists |publisher=Cpj.org |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Miguel Ángel López Velasco]], a columnist, was murdered alongside his wife and son, a photographer, and found on 20 June.  A traffic cop, Juan Carlos Carranza Saavedra, was a suspect in their deaths.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

== Impact ==
The murders of Luna, Huge, Rodríguez and Becerra heightened awareness of the dangers for journalists in the Veracruz area. Officials and organizations recognize the need to combat the violence of growing drug cartels. Efforts are made to further increase awareness, especially with outrage from UNESCO, Article 19, and other groups focused on the rights and [[safety of journalists]].

== Reactions ==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]],  expressed her concerned about the deaths of journalists in the Veracruz area. "News of the murders of Gabriel Huge and Guillermo Luna Varela – tortured and killed less than one week after the assassination of Regina Martínez Pérez – is deeply disturbing, and reflects an alarming state of affairs in the state of Veracruz," she said.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

The bodies of the Boca Del Rio journalists were found nearing World Press Freedom Day.  Bokova said, “That these gruesome crimes have been committed on the eve of World Press Freedom Day – a day on which we honour the vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values, protecting citizens’ rights to be informed and calling those in power to account – makes the situation all the more intolerable."&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

Bokova continued in the statement to say,  “I condemn these three murders in the strongest possible terms and urge the Mexican authorities to act quickly and decisively to find those responsible. Impunity is not an option."

[[Article 19]], a group focused on the freedom of expression and information, expressed their outrage of the Boca del Rio incident, "--the Mexican authorities have consistently failed to fulfill their international obligations to guarantee the free exercise of freedom of expression and the mechanisms currently in place do not address the central problem, which is the impunity that follows these crimes."&lt;ref name="ifex" /&gt;  They also said the authorities of Veracruz did not take the necessary steps in resolving the case.

In medicine, an '''agonal heart rhythm''' is a variant of [[asystole]]. Agonal heart rhythm is usually ventricular in origin.  Occasional [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P waves]] and [[QRS complexes]] can be seen on the [[electrocardiogram]]. The complexes tend to be wide and bizarre in morphological appearance.&lt;ref&gt; Garcia T, Miller B. Arrhythmia Recognition: The Art of Interpretation. Jones and Bartlett, Sudbury MA: 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically, an agonal rhythm is regarded as asystole and should be treated equivalently, with [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and administration of [[intravenous]] [[adrenaline]].&lt;ref name=resus&gt;[https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/alsalgo.pdf UK Resuscitation Council. Adult advanced life support algorithm. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; As in asystole, the prognosis for a patient presenting with this rhythm is very poor. Sometimes this appears after asystole or after a failed resurrection attempt.

[[Haim Arlosoroff]] was assassinated on the night of Friday, June 16, 1933, as the left-wing [[Zionist]] leader was walking with his wife on the beach in [[Tel Aviv]]. Initially believed to be carried out by his right-wing political enemies, the subsequent court case ended in acquittal for the two accused of the crime. A third man was acquitted early on of advising the two to commit the act. The case has never been definitively solved.

==Political background==
At the time of the murder, the two primary opposing [[Zionist]] political parties in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were the mainstream [[Mapai]], the left-wing Socialist party, and the opposing [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]], the right-wing nationalist party. The rift between the two sects evolved with the end of World War I and the ensuing British colonization of Palestine. Globally represented by the [[World Zionist Organization]] and by the Jewish [[Yishuv]] within domestic Palestine, Mapai, led by [[David Ben-Gurion]], encouraged mass Jewish immigration and continuous settling of the land. Its leadership found it essential to cooperate with the ruling [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. Adhering to a code of practical Zionism, the official position of the Zionist leadership found it vital to develop the physical land in order to stake a claim over it. The Revisionists, led by [[Vladimir (Ze’ev) Jabotinsky]], relied on the principles of political Zionism. They saw it imperative to gain total control over the country before devoting power toward its material improvement. It promoted procurement of independence from the British Mandate as the sole means for reestablishing a Jewish homeland.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Eran|last=Kaplan|title=The Jewish radical right: Revisionist Zionism and its ideological legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4GLP8cDo0S8C|accessdate=June 26, 2011|year=2005|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-20380-1}} p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Charging Mapai leaders with prejudices against non-adherents, the dissonance between the two groups sounded louder and more pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 2005, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The rift reached a climax when Mapai showed interest in negotiations with the Nazi government over German Jews' expedited immigration to Palestine. These negotiations were spearheaded by Arlosoroff, and he was in Germany regarding this matter the week before his murder. The Revisionists, especially its secret radical branch, [[Brit Habiryonim]], expressed extreme criticism in Mapai's willingness to confer with the Nazi government over German Jews' expedited emigration to Palestine.&lt;ref name="Maoz 2000"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Maoz|first=Asher|year=2000|title=Historical Adjudication: Courts of Law, Commissions of Inquiry, and "Historical Truth"|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/18.3/maoz.html|publisher=Law and History Review|volume=18|issue=3|accessdate=May 31, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913063847/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/18.3/maoz.html|archive-date=September 13, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of characters==
===Haim Arlosoroff===
Zionist ideologue and activist. Born in 1899 in [[Romny]], Ukraine, he felt a deep Jewish identification at an early age, despite his family's assimilated views. A Socialist Zionist, he was a leader in the German branch of [[Hapoel Hatzair]], and edited its print periodical. In 1924, he moved to Palestine; two years later, he was a Jewish Palestinian representative at the [[League of Nations]] conference. In 1930, he helped merge his own Hapoel Hatzair party with the [[Poale Zion]] party, thus forming a new Labor party called Mapai. At the time of his murder, he was the head of the political department of the [[Jewish Agency]] in Palestine. Throughout his lifetime, he wrote several treatises and essays on the topics of socialist Zionism and Jewish presence in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Avineri1989"&gt;{{cite book|first=Shlomo|last=Avineri|authorlink=Shlomo Avineri|title=Arlosoroff|year=1989|publisher=Peter Halban Publishers, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-870015-23-3}} pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Avraham Stavsky]]===
Suspect number 1, he was believed to have shined a flashlight into the eyes of Arlosoroff seconds before suspect number 2 fatally shot him. Born in [[Brest, Belarus|Brisk]], Poland in 1906, in 1927 he joined [[Beitar]], the youth branch of the political Zionist Revisionist movement. In the fall of 1932, he heard [[Abba Ahimeir]], one of the leaders of the violent faction Brit Habiryonim, speak in Warsaw. When he moved to Palestine in March 1933, Ahimeir took him under his wing.&lt;ref name="טבתה1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teveth|authorlink=Shabtai Teveth|first=Shabtai|script-title=he:רצח ארלוזורוב|trans-title=The Arlosoroff Murder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toMNAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=June 26, 2011|year=1982|publisher=Schoken|language=Hebrew}} pp. 10–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Ze'ev Rosenblatt]]===
Suspect number 2, he was believed to have fatally shot Arlosoroff. Born in [[Chernivtsi]], [[Bukovina]] in 1911, he was the local Beitar officer. When he moved to Palestine in the 1920s, he became a member of the secretariat of the [[Kfar Saba]] branch of Beitar.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth 1982, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Abba Ahimeir]]===
Suspected with aiding and abetting the murder. Born in 1897 in [[Belorussia|White Russia]], he emigrated to Palestine in 1912. He was first a member of HaPoel Hatzair, Arlosoroff's own Labor Zionist movement. He later became disillusioned, and in 1928 co-formed the rival Fascia-nationalist Revisionist faction with [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]] and [[Dr. Yehoshua Heschel Yaivin]]. He was the editor-in-chief of the party's newspaper, [[Hazit HaAm]]. In 1932, he co-founded Brit Habiryonim, a secret Revisionist branch devoted to taking more violent methods against the British.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth 1982, pp. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sima Arlosoroff===
Wife of Arlosoroff. Was walking on the beach with him when he was killed. She was the only witness to his murder, and it was on her testimony that the case was built.

===[[Abdul Majud el Buhri]]===
An Arab mechanic from Jaffa. In January 1934, while incarcerated in the Jerusalem Municipal jail on a murder charge, he admitted to the killing of Arlosoroff, with an accomplice. He later confessed that his first admission was a ruse, and that Stavsky and Rosenblatt had offered him money for assuming responsibility.&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;Bechor, David; Berkowitz, Eliezer; Keneth, Max. (1985). "State Investigative Committee of the Murder of Dr. Haim Arlosoroff" ("ועדת החקירה לחקירת רצח ד"ר חיים ארלוזורוב הי"ד"). Jerusalem: State of Israel. pp. 95–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
On June 14, 1933, two days before his murder, Arlosoroff returned home from a weeks-long work-related trip to Europe. The most important part was his meeting with [[Nazi]] officials in an effort to negotiate details of German Jews' property transfer to Palestine. While viewed by Mapai as a valuable measure to insure the assets of these Jews, this negotiation was hotly contested by the Revisionists, who believed that under no circumstances should deals be made with the Nazis.

On the morning of the day of his murder, June 16, Arlosoroff was in [[Jerusalem]] on business. He spent the morning at the offices of the Jewish Agency. Sima was meant to meet him there in the early afternoon, upon which they would return home to [[Tel Aviv]]. Sima was supposed to make plans as to their weekend activity; the couple wanted to get away from the city for a few days. When she arrived at the Agency, Arlosoroff told her that he would return home by himself later in the afternoon.

When Arlosoroff came home at 5:15&amp;nbsp;pm, the couple decided to stay in Tel Aviv for that night. At 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm they ate dinner at the beachfront Kaete Dan hotel. At 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm they finished dinner and went for a walk on the beach.

They walked North, towards the [[Yarkon River]]. According to Sima, at a certain point she felt that they were being followed by two men. Arlosoroff brushed off her worry, and they continued walking. When they got to the end of the shoreline, they turned back. They saw the two men whom Sima had been afraid of earlier, and let them pass by in front of them. Sima was closer to the sea; Arlosoroff was closer to the city.

At 10&amp;nbsp;pm, the couple approached the two men. The bigger of the two suddenly shone a flashlight in Arlosoroff's face, and asked him for the time. Arlosoroff responded that they had no right to bother them; the man asked again. In the meantime, the smaller man made what was later described by Sima as an "Oriental gesture" and took out a gun. The larger man turned off his flashlight. The smaller man aimed the gun at Arlosoroff, and fired. He fell to the ground. The two men ran from the scene as Sima called for help.

Three bystanders who heard her cries rushed Arlosoroff to the hospital. After drifting in and out of consciousness for three hours, he died at 12:45&amp;nbsp;am on Saturday morning, June 17.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police blotter==
The official suspect police blotter appeared in newspapers around the country on Saturday afternoon. It was based on Sima's eyewitness account:&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The one who held the flashlight: ''Suspect Number 1:'' Male, taller than average, large build, age 30–40, clean-shaven, full face, light-skinned, tough expression, brownish-reddish hair, stands with legs apart, has a duck-like walk. Wearing a dark suit in a European style – black or dark blue – and the stitching may be in a 'double-breasted' style. Collar or long tie. Wearing shoes, speaks without accent.

The one who shot the gun: ''Suspect Number 2:'' Male, short, thin, fit body, age 30, dark Oriental type, long nose, unshaven, tough expression, dark hair, wearing a dark suit in a European style with irregular stripes. We think that he is wearing a gray hat and shoes. He makes Oriental movements with his hands.

The police offered 500 liras, and the Jewish Agency offered 1000, to anyone with information on the suspects.

==Police proceedings==
===Stavsky===
As Suspect Number 1:&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in the early morning of Monday, June 19 at his home in Tel Aviv. He denied all charges, claiming that he was in Jerusalem at the night of the murder.

He was suspected by Yitzchak Halutz, a clerk in the Immigration Department in Jerusalem. The week before, Stavsky had applied for an exit visa to return to Poland and recruit more people for the Revisionist party. His petition was denied. On the morning of June 16, he went to the immigration offices in Jerusalem, and spoke with Halutz to ask for his application fee back. The next day, June 17, Halutz saw the police blotter with the description of the two men. Number 1 reminded him of Stavsky, and he immediately contacted the police. He gave them Stavsky's photo which was attached to the exit visa petition. A warrant was put out for Stavsky's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth 1982, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosenblatt===
As Suspect Number 2:&lt;ref&gt;Teveth 1982, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested 37 days after the murder, on July 23, at the Beitar camp in Kfar Saba. He denied all charges, claiming that he was at a party meeting in Kfar Saba the night of the murder.

He was suspected by Rivka Feigin, a member of the Rosenblatt's Beitar group. She told Mapai authorities that she had heard an editor at Hazit Ha'am say with certainty that Number 2 was Rosenblatt. The Mapai leadership went to the police.

===Achimeir===
As aiding and abetting the murder suspects:&lt;ref&gt;Teveth 1982, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested during the week following the assassination. He was linked to the murder primarily because of his association with Brit Habiryonim. He was eventually acquitted because there was not enough evidence to take him with which to try him.

==Political reaction==
===Mapai===
Immediately after the murder, Mapai created its own inquiry committee, to help the police in the official investigation. The three primary suspected groups were the Revisionists, the Communists and Arabs. However, many within Mapai – including Ben-Gurion – believed that members of the Revisionists had committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisionists===
At first, the Revisionists fully denied any involvement. When Stavsky was arrested, instead of defending him, they actually believed his guilt. They tried to distance Stavsky's relationship to them, claiming that he was a Communist at heart, and had committed the murder of his own accord. Their official position changed when Jabotinsky defended Stavsky in a party newspaper on July 22. He further denounced Mapai as creating a blood libel against the Revisionists. He said that the party was using the murder as a political stepping stool. Some Revisionists later said that Mapai committed the murder itself, in order to blame the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth 1982, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdul Majud==
In January 1934, an Arab prisoner from Jaffa, who was being held in the Jerusalem jail for a revenge murder, confessed to the Arlosoroff murder. He claimed that he was Number 1 and that a man named Issa Ibn Darwish was Number 2. He explained that on the night of the murder, he and Issa had gone for a walk on the beach. He had no intention of killing anyone; he did not even know who Arlosoroff was. The third time they passed by the couple Abdul Majud approached Arlosoroff and asked him for the time. When Arlosoroff responded that it was too dark for him to tell, Abdul Majud replied that he had a flashlight, and turned it on. He saw that Arlosoroff was suddenly looking straight ahead; when he turned around, he saw Issa aiming a gun at Arlosoroff. Issa shot Arlosoroff and ran away. Abdul Majud was surprised, and not knowing what to do, ran after him. He asked Issa why he shot the man; he replied that he wanted to scare him so that he would leave and Issa would be able to assault his wife. At the last second, he grew afraid, and shot Arlosoroff.

Issa denied all involvement.

Soon after his confession, Sima came to another suspect line-up. She did not recognize either Abdul Majud or Issa.

In February 1934, Abdul Majud recanted his original confession, saying that he had met Stavsky and Rosenblatt in the Jaffa prison before he was transferred to Jerusalem. They had bribed him to take responsibility for the murder, saying that because he had confessed to the first murder, he could confess to another, and would receive the same punishment. With the help of a Hebrew-speaking Arab prisoner, they taught Abdul Majud exactly what happened and what he should tell the police.

This twist in the trial was inconsequential. Abdul Majud never testified in court. The prosecution used the story as another piece of evidence against Stavsky and Rosenblatt, especially in that Sima only recognized them. The defense dismissed it as a way for Abdul Majud to seek a personal revenge on Issa.&lt;ref name="Assize1934"&gt;{{cite book|author=Palestine; Court of Criminal Assize|title=The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents|year=1934|publisher=Hassolel Partnership (S. White &amp; Co.)}} pp. 134–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The Arlosoroff murder trial began in May 1934, and ended a week before the first anniversary of his assassination.

===Prosecution===

Mostly dependent on Sima's eyewitness testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. V.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence and faulty alibis===

===Stavsky===
Photo Identification: the day that the police got Stavsky's photo from Halutz, the police brought it and a number of other photographs to Sima for identification. She identified Stavsky as Number 1.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspect Line-up: Sima walked with a police officer down a line of suspects the day that Stavsky was arrested. She stopped when she reached Stavsky. She physically identified him as Number 1.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, pp. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stavsky claimed that he was at the Sharon Restaurant in Jerusalem at 10&amp;nbsp;pm, the time of the murder. This was not proven. Witnesses testified that he was in Jerusalem before and after, but no one said that he was there at the exact window of time. The reliability of the witnesses was under question. Two policemen who were in the restaurant between 7:30–8:30 testified that they did not see Stavsky. Also, Stavsky's landlords testified for the prosecution that he was home in Tel Aviv in the early evening.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. XV-XIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stavsky also said that he slept in a Jerusalem hotel that night. Just because Stavsky slept in Jerusalem that Friday night does not mean that he could not have been in Tel Aviv earlier. There was no testimony as to when he arrived at the Jerusalem hotel and went to bed.

Also, Stavsky had planned to leave the country the following week – this fit in with his need to escape after his crime.

===Rosenblatt===
Sima didn't recognize Rosenblatt from a photograph, but she did recognize him in a line-up, a more reliable identification.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacket Identification: Sima was given nine jackets to identify, one of which belonged to Rosenblatt. She picked out Rosenblatt's jacket as the one worn by Number 2, explaining that she recognized it from its zig-zag pattern and red color.

Rosenblatt originally said that he was at a party. He later recanted and said he was at a Beitar meeting in Kfar Saba. Witnesses who were at the meeting were called and their stories did not always match. Also, the minutes of the meeting were presented, but it just so happened that night that a temporary secretary was taking notes, in a different fashion than what was normally done. Their authenticity was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. XXII-XXIII&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenblatt's girlfriend was in their tent when he came in that night. Only she would have known his exact whereabouts then, but she was not called to give testimony.

===Defense===
The defense insisted there was no premeditated motive for the crime, political or otherwise. The political parties act within the social confines of the Palestinian Jewish community and their functions do not warrant a murder, it said.

The defense attorneys said Arlosoroff had been in Europe until June 14, and his return was unexpected. If his own wife did not know when he would be returning, his political opponents certainly did not. Even if they began to plot after he returned, they had no way of knowing that he would be on the beach on Friday night. Until Friday afternoon, the Arlosoroffs themselves had assumed that they wouldn't be in Tel Aviv for the weekend. There is no way that a pre-meditated murder could be planned out in five hours, taking into consideration that Stavsky was in Jerusalem and Rosenblatt was in Kfar Saba all day Friday.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, the defense contended that the crime was actually an 'impromptu sexual attack' by two other men. The men did not cover their faces and the shooter did not shoot right away. The murder was not his goal. The goal was to sexually attack Sima. They walked by the couple a few times, trying to draw attention to themselves. At one point, Number 1 urinated into the sea – 'display of exhibitionism'. In fact, Number 2's 'Oriental gesture' before he fired the gun was a sexual one.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence and strong alibis===

===Stavsky===
Photo Identification: the police procedure was irregular. It was done after a warrant was put out for Stavsky's arrest, but before he was apprehended. Stavsky's profile looked distinct from the rest of the nine, in both his physical appearance and his clothing, thereby drawing more attention to him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', 43–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspect Line-up: it was done a day after Sima had identified Stavsky in the photo – his image was still in her memory. According to a police officer on duty, his arm was around her back – he could have unconsciously stopped her when they reached Stavsky. Also, as opposed to the rest of the men in the line-up, Stavsky was unshaven, hatless and hefty, thus making him stand out more.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four people testified that they saw Stavsky in the Sharon Restaurant in Jerusalem that night, and that he was still there by 8:45&amp;nbsp;pm. This would not have given him enough time to get to Tel Aviv by the time of the murder. The Arlosoroffs only decided to go to the beach at 9:30 – there is no way that Stavsky could have known that in time to commit the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Bechor, Berkowitz &amp; Keneth 1985, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosenblatt===
Jacket Identification: The zig-zag pattern is a common design. Even more so, there is no way that Sima would have been able to see the color red at that time of night. Therefore, the color is inconsequential.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly improbable that the minutes were counterfeited just for the defense of the accused. The point is that Rosenblatt was at the meeting for its entirety (until 10&amp;nbsp;pm), as can be shown by both the witnesses and the fact that his words were recorded twice in the minutes. There would have been no way for him to get to Tel Aviv to commit the murder by then. Also, the minutes were taken by a temporary secretary because the permanent secretary was religious and didn't write from Friday night until Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcome===
The presiding judges declared the following majority ruling:&lt;ref&gt;''The Arlosoroff murder trial: speeches and relevant documents'', pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Court, by majority, finds that at Tel Aviv, on the night of the June 16/17, 1933, with premeditated intent to kill, the accused Abraham Stavsky, did take part in the premeditated killing of Dr. Haim Arlosoroff by following him, waiting for him, stopping him and directing the light of an electric torch upon him and being close by during the commission of the offense." Stavsky was sentenced to punishment by death.

"As regards the accused, Zvi Rosenblatt, the Court does not find the other material evidence required by Section 5 of the Law of Evidence Amendment Ordinance, 1924, to corroborate his identification by Mrs. Arlosoroff. The accused, Zvi Rosenblatt, is therefore acquitted of the offense of which he stands charged."

The single dissenting judge ruled the following:

"That the crime was committed at such time and such a place when and where persons are known to and in fact do resort for immoral purposes...That the alibi of the accused is insufficiently established...The crime was not a political one but was most probably a common attack for sexual purposes...That none of the accused had any connection with the murder...I therefore find them not guilty of the charge and acquit them."

==Stavsky's appeal and acquittal==
Stavsky was acquitted at the Court of Criminal Appeal because there not enough material evidence, as required by law.&lt;ref name="Maoz 2000"/&gt; "The Appeal Court even went so far as to state that had the case been heard in England itself, or in most of the territories of the British Empire, the conviction would rightly have been upheld."

==Aftermath==
The perpetrators were never convicted.

In 1982, Israeli historian Shabtai Teveth re-introduced the event to the Israeli population with an investigative account of the murder and the trial proceedings. In response to the newly piqued public interest, the government, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], himself a member of the right-wing party, commissioned a state-administered investigative committee. In 1985, the Bechor Committee published its results: fifty years after the murder, it had found no new evidence, and maintained the accepted ruling that Stavsky and Rosenblatt were not guilty.&lt;ref name="Maoz 2000"/&gt;

==Importance==
The trial proceedings of the murder of Arlosoroff highlighted the external and internal dynamics between the ruling British Mandate, the dominant Mapai party, and the opposing Revisionist party. This event was an important climax point in the internal relations of the Jews in Palestine, and its resonance continued even after the State of Israel was established in 1948.

'''''Atlas''''' was a 501-ton sailing ship that was built at [[Whitby]] and launched in 1811. In 1814 she successfully defended herself in a [[single-ship action]] with an American privateer. In 1816 she transported [[convicts]] to [[New South Wales]], and afterwards disappeared off the coast of India in 1817.

''Atlas'' entered ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' in 1812 with W. Parker, master, changing to Fairclough, T. Barrick, owner, and trade London transport.&lt;ref name=LR1812/&gt;

On 9 January 1813 ''Atlas'' was at Lisbon when she lost an anchor in a gale. A number of other transports were either lost or seriously damaged in the same gale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735026?urlappend=%3Bseq=27 ''Lloyd's List]]'' №4742.]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of transports involved suggests that they were their in connection with the [[Peninsular War]].

The transport ''Atlas'', Fairclough, master, arrived at [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on 19 August 1814. She had on 17 August repelled an attack by the American privateer ''York'', of 14 guns and 150 men. ''Atlas'' had only 10 guns and 27 men and boys on board, including three passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735026?urlappend=%3Bseq=375 ''Lloyd's List'' 26 August 1814.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Convict voyage (1816):''' Under the command of Walter Meriton, she sailed from [[Portsmouth]], England on 23 January 1816, and arrived at [[Port Jackson]] on 22 July.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson (1959), pp.290-1.&lt;/ref&gt; She embarked 194 male convicts, seven of whom died on the voyage.{{refn|The numbers in Bateson clearly exhibit some typographical errors.

''Atlas'' left Port Jackson on 12 September bound for Batavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71247621 |title=Arrival of Vessels at Port Jackson, and their Departure |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=Australian Town and Country Journal, Saturday 3 January 1891, p.16. |publisher= |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss==
On 29 July 1817, ''Atlas'' dropped the pilot at Sandheads, at the mouth of the River Ganges, as she sailed from [[Kolkatta|Calcutta]] to London.{{refn|Hackman confuses the fate of this ''Atlas'' with that of a different {{ship||Atlas|1801 ship|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman (2001), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} She was not heard from again.{{refn|''[[Lloyd's List]]'' gives the master's name as Moncur,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005778173?urlappend=%3Bseq=387 ''Lloyd's List'', 31 July 1818, n° 5302.]&lt;/ref&gt; but all other sources give it as Meriton.|group=Note}}

''Lloyd's Register'' continued to carry ''Atlas'', with Meriton, master, and trade London—Botany Bay, to the 1821 volume. The ''Register of Shipping'' carried the same information to the 1822 volume.

'''''Beware! The Blob''''' (a.k.a. '''''Beware the Blob''''', '''''Son of Blob''''', '''''Son of the Blob''''' or '''''The Blob Returns''''') is a 1972 American [[independent film|independent]] [[comedy]] [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[horror film]]. It is a sequel to [[The Blob]]. The film was directed by [[Larry Hagman]]. The screenplay was penned by Anthony Harris and Jack Woods III, based on a story by [[Jack H. Harris]] and Richard Clair. The film originally earned a GP rating from the [[MPAA]], though it is now unrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68552/Beware-the-Blob/trivia.html "Tivia: 'Beware! The Blob'."] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Picking up fifteen years after the events of the first movie ''[[The Blob]]'', an oil pipeline lawyer named Chester ([[Godfrey Cambridge]]) returns to his suburban [[Los Angeles]] home from the [[North Pole]], bringing with him a small sample of a mysterious frozen substance uncovered by a bulldozer on a job site. Prior to taking the substance to a lab to be analyzed, he places the storage container with the substance in his freezer, but he and his wife ([[Marlene Clark]]) accidentally let it thaw, creating a second Blob. It starts by eating a fly, then a kitten, then Chester's wife, and then Chester himself (while, in an intentional [[anachronism]] by the film makers, he is watching a television broadcast of the film ''[[The Blob]]'').

Lisa ([[Gwynne Gilford]]), a friend, walks in to see Chester being consumed by the Blob. She escapes, but cannot get anyone to believe her, not even her boyfriend Bobby ([[Robert Walker (actor, born 1940)|Robert Walker Jr.]]). Meanwhile, the rapidly growing creature quietly preys upon the town. Some of its victims include a police officer and two hippies ([[Cindy Williams]] and [[Randy Stonehill]]) in a storm drain, a barber ([[Shelley Berman]]) and his client, transients (played by director Hagman, [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Del Close]]), a [[Scout leader|Scoutmaster]] ([[Dick Van Patten]]), a farm full of chickens and horses, people in a gas station, and various townspeople who turn up "missing".

At one point, Lisa and Bobby find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. While panicking, the truck's air conditioning is accidentally switched on and the Blob retreats because of its vulnerability to cold.

The now-massive Blob then invades a bowling alley and a skating rink (consuming dozens more people in the process). It is finally stopped when Bobby activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing it. While the frozen Blob is being filmed by a television crew, one of the crew's bright lights is positioned on the ground, melting a small portion of it, which oozes toward the sheriff and envelops his feet as he is speaking on camera to a nationwide television audience.

==Production==
[[Larry Hagman]] previously directed episodes of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[The Good Life (1971 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' and went on to do the same for several episodes of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (the only series he directed for that he never acted on). This would be his only feature film as a director. To cast the film, Hagman recruited friends from the motion picture industry, (some of whom were literally neighbors of his in [[Malibu, California]], including [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Carol Lynley]]) who were asked if they would like to be "blobbed". [[Gwynne Gilford]] was cast as the lead via the traditional auditioning process, while [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1940)|Robert Walker Jr.]] was an early hire by Jack H. Harris himself.

Budgeted at slightly more than the 1958 version at $150,000, filming began in the spring of 1971, primarily on the property of a horse stable and ranch home in [[Diamond Bar, California]], as well as in [[Pomona, California]], both 30 miles east of [[Los Angeles]]. The climactic finale at the [[bowling alley]] and ice skating rink was filmed at two separate locations.  The former Grand Central Bowl in [[Glendale, California]] stood in for the bowling alley (the building still stands as part of the [[Disney Imagineering]] complex), while the ice skating rink scenes were filmed at the former Rollerdrome in [[Culver City, California]] (immediately prior to the building being torn down in August, 1971 to make way for Tellefson Park). The party scene was filmed in a loft in [[Venice, California]]. In an interview in ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine, screenwriter and first time producer Anthony Harris stated that a good portion of the filmed material was improvised on the set, and that his script was ignored. While in production, Harris was also in the process of preparing a second sequel, ''Curse of the Blob,'' but these plans were never implemented.

Contrary to the original 1958 film, in which the Blob was largely portrayed by gallons of dyed red silicone (which repeatedly needed to be stirred to maintain the consistent red color), the Blob in ''Beware! the Blob'' was mostly created from a red-dyed powder blended with water to form the desired consistency. The Blob was alternately created from other materials as well, including a large red plastic balloon, semi-transparent red plastic sheeting illuminated with a backlight, and a large rotating red drum of hard red silicone placed in front of the camera lens.  

Renowned cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]], who would later go on to be a cinematographer on such films as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' series]] and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', worked on ''Beware! The Blob'' as one of the three special effects technicians (alongside supervisor Tim Baar and Conrad Rothmann) responsible for creating the Blob effects. Cundey was also the camera operator on second unit shots of the Blob eating the fly, the kitten, etc.

''Beware! The Blob'' was intended as a December, 1971 release, but was held off until June, 1972 to capitalize on the lucrative summer movie and [[drive in]] audience. An exceptional film marketer, Harris later paired the movie with other films he held the rights to (notably ''[[Equinox (film)|Equinox]]''), and renamed the film ''Son of Blob'' in some markets as a test title. The film premiered on television in 1974.

==Release==
In 1982, the film was re-issued with the tagline "The film that J.R. shot!" in an attempt to capitalize on the success of Hagman's television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', using a twist on the show's popular meme, "Who shot J.R.?"

==Home media==
As ''Son of Blob'' together with ''[[The Blob]]'', the film was released on DVD by [[Umbrella Entertainment]] in September 2011. The DVD is compatible with all region codes.&lt;ref name="Umbrella Entertainment"&gt;[http://www.umbrellaent.com.au/p-3020-the-blob-son-of-blob.aspx "Son of Blob"]. Umbrella Entertainment. Retrieved: May 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Beware! The Blob'' was transferred to HD in its correct 1.85 ratio and released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber on September 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="Beware! The Blob Blu-ray"&gt;[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Beware-The-Blob-Blu-ray/149147/ "Beware! The Blob"]. Kino Lorber. Retrieved: October 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Film historians Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester considered the film was: "Now viewed as a relic of mid- to late-hippiedom ... overall, there's some tension, and some nods to the predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;Holston and Winchester 1997, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames, raised in [[New York City]], is a graduate of the [[Bronx High School of Science]]. His undergraduate studies were at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], and his graduate studies were completed at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ames BN |title=An enthusiasm for metabolism |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=278 |issue=7 |pages=4369–80 |date=February 2003 |doi=10.1074/jbc.X200010200 |pmid=12496254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a recipient of the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Bolton S. Corson Medal]] in 1980, [[Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement]] in 1985, the [[Japan Prize]] in 1997, the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1998 and the [[Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Gerald R|author2=Johnston Mark|date=February 2004|title=The 2004 Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal|journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]|volume=166|issue=2|pages=645–6|issn=0016-6731|pmid=15020453|doi=10.1534/genetics.166.2.645|pmc=1470756}}&lt;/ref&gt; among many others.

His research focuses on cancer and aging and he has authored over 550 scientific publications. He is among the few hundred most-cited scientists in all fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruceames.org |title=About Dr. Ames|work=Bruce Ames official website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ames' current research includes identifying agents that delay the mitochondrial decay of aging, understanding the role of mitochondrial decay in aging, particularly in the brain, optimizing micronutrient intakes in the population to prevent disease, malnutrition, and obesity. He is also interested in mutagens as they relate to cancer prevention and aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcb.berkeley.edu/faculty/BMB/amesb.html Bruce N. Ames]. University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Ames received more than $650,000 in support from the [[National Foundation for Cancer Research]] between 1998 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1505022|year=2001|title=National Foundation for Cancer Research|journal=Neoplasia|volume=3|issue=1|pages=88–90|doi=10.1038/sj.neo.7900130|last1=Salisbury|first1=Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ames on synthetic carcinogens==
In the 1970s, Bruce Ames developed the [[Ames test]] which is a cheap and convenient assay for [[mutagen]]s and therefore potential [[carcinogen]]s.  Previous carcinogenic testing used live animals, and the procedures are expensive and time-consuming. This made animal testing impractical for use in screening on a wide scale, and reduced the number of compounds that could be tested.  The Ames test on the other hand uses the bacteria ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' to test for mutagens, and is considerably cheaper and faster. The Ames test became widely used as an initial screen for possible carcinogens and has been used to identify potential carcinogens previously used in commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The ease with which Ames test allows widely used chemicals to be identified as possible carcinogens made him an early hero of environmentalism.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Subsequent work in Ames' lab involved looking at an overview of what was mutagenic or carcinogenic, and to what degree. Previously, scientists tended to only look for positive or negative results without considering the magnitude of the effect, which meant that as more and more items were shown to be potentially mutagenic, there was no system for evaluating the relative dangers. He also continued to test various natural and man-made compounds,  and discovered that, despite what he and others had assumed, naturally occurring compounds were not turning out to be benign as compared to man-made ones. His continued work eventually led to his falling out of favor with many environmentalists.  As natural chemicals turned out to also be frequently mutagenic, he argued that environmental exposure to manufactured chemicals may be of limited relevance to human cancer, even when such chemicals are mutagenic in an Ames test and carcinogenic in rodent assays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He contended that most human genetic damage arises from essential micronutrients lacking in poor diets and the oxidation of DNA during normal metabolism, and that the most important environmental carcinogens may include some whose chief effect is to cause the chronic division of stem cells whereby the normal protective mechanisms of a cell become less effective.

He argued against the banning of synthetic pesticides and other chemicals such as [[Daminozide|Alar]] which have been shown to be carcinogenic. Ames published results showing that many ordinary food products would be found carcinogenic according to the same criteria.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/synthetic-v-natural-pesticides/ Synthetic v. Natural Pesticides]. ''New York Times'' (June 6, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, L.S., Slone, T.H., Ames, B.N., and Manley, N.B., Pesticide Residues in Food and Cancer Risk: A Critical Analysis. In: Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology, Second Edition (R. Krieger, ed.), San Diego, CA: Academic Press, pp. 799-843 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was concerned that overzealous attention to the relatively minor health effects of trace quantities of carcinogens may divert scarce financial resources away from major health risks, and cause public confusion about the relative importance of different hazards. Ames considered himself a leading “contrarian in the hysteria over tiny traces of chemicals that may or may not cause cancer", and said that "if you have thousands of hypothetical risks that you are supposed to pay attention to, that completely drives out the major risks you should be aware of."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Burton Kendall Wheeler''' (February 27, 1882{{spaced ndash}}January 6, 1975) was an attorney and an [[Americans|American]] politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in [[Montana]]; he served as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from 1923 until 1947. He returned to his law practice and lived in Washington, D.C. for his remaining years.

Wheeler was an independent Democrat who initially represented the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] of the party, receiving support from Montana's [[Trade union|labor unions]]. He ran for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]] on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] ticket headed by Wisconsin [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert La Follette, Sr.]]. An ardent [[New Deal]] liberal until 1937, he broke with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on the issue of [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|packing]] the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. In foreign policy from 1938&amp;ndash;41 he became a leader of the non-interventionist wing of the party, fighting against entry into [[World War II]] until the attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Early life and education==
Wheeler was born in [[Hudson, Massachusetts]], to Mary Elizabeth Rice (née Tyler) and Asa Leonard Wheeler.&lt;ref name="Auto"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/tankeefromthewes000420mbp/tankeefromthewes000420mbp_djvu.txt Burton K.

He first worked as a stenographer in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

He traveled west to attend [[University of Michigan Law School]], where he graduated in 1905. He initially intended to settle in [[Seattle]], but after getting off the train in [[Butte, Montana]], he lost his belongings in a [[poker]] game. The new attorney settled there and began practicing law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunther|first=John|authorlink=John Gunther|title=Inside U.S.A|page=176|location=[[New York City|New York]], [[London]]|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]]|year=1947|title-link=Inside U.S.A.

Wheeler|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers4/wheeler.html|website=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune Staff|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Wheeler married Lulu M. White. They had six children: John, Elizabeth, Edward, Frances, Richard and Marion.  Frances helped her father with his research for his autobiography, ''Yankee from the West: The Candid, Turbulent Life Story of the Yankee-born U. S. Senator from Montana'', which he published in 1962 and dedicated to her and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Yankee from the West: The Candid, Turbulent Life Story of the Yankee-born U. S. Senator from Montana'', by Burton K. Wheeler and Paul F. Healy,  Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc., 1962, full text online at Internet Archive Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Wheeler was elected as a [[Montana Legislature|Montana state legislator]] in 1910, and in that position, he gained a reputation as a champion of labor against the [[Anaconda Copper Mining Company]], which dominated the state's economy and politics. He was appointed as a [[United States Attorney]]. During his tenure, he was notable for not issuing a single [[sedition]] indictment during [[World War I]], especially significant as Montana was a large stronghold of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. In other parts of the country, IWW membership was suppressed under the new sedition law. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==1920s==
In [[Montana gubernatorial election, 1920|1920]], Wheeler ran for [[Governor of Montana]], easily winning the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary, and he won the support of the [[Non-Partisan League]] in the general election. The ticket included a multi-racial set of candidates, unusual for 1920, including an [[African American]] and a [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indian]].&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1940,'' p. 858&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheeler was defeated by [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former U.S. Senator [[Joseph M. Dixon]].&lt;ref name=wheeler2/&gt;

Wheeler ran as a Democrat for the Senate in [[United States Senate election in Montana, 1922|1922]], and was elected over Congressman [[Carl W. Riddick]], the Republican nominee, with 55% of the vote. He broke with the Democratic Party in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]] to run for [[Vice President of the United States]] on the [[Progressive Party 1924 (United States)|Progressive Party]] ticket led by La Follette. They carried one state—La Follette's Wisconsin—and ran well in union areas and railroad towns. He returned to the Democratic Party after the election, which Republican [[Calvin Coolidge]] won in an Electoral College landslide.  He served a total of four terms and was re-elected in [[United States Senate election in Montana, 1928|1928]], [[United States Senate election in Montana, 1934|1934]], and [[United States Senate election in Montana, 1940|1940]].

==1930s==
In 1930, Wheeler gained national attention when he successfully campaigned for the reelection to the U.S. Senate of his friend and Democratic colleague [[Thomas Gore]], the colorful "Blind Cowboy" of [[Oklahoma]]. Wheeler supported President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s election, and many of his [[New Deal]] policies. He broke with Roosevelt over his opposition to the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]], and also opposed much of Roosevelt's foreign policy before [[World War II]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]], there was a large movement to "Draft Wheeler" into the presidential race, possibly as a [[Third party (politics)|third party]] candidate, led primarily by [[John L. Lewis]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1938, Wheeler introduced Senate Resolution 294, a "sense of the senate" statement that, in order to insure fair competition, AM radio stations in the United States should be limited to a transmitter power of 50,000 watts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015087659424;view=1up;seq=511 "Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations"] (Senate Resolution 294), ''Journal of the Senate of the United States of America'' (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 9, 1938, page 507.&lt;/ref&gt;
Now commonly known as the [[Wheeler resolution]], it was approved on June 13, 1938&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015087659424;view=1up;seq=543 "Radio Stations Broadcasting in Standard Band"], ''Journal of the Senate of the United States of America'' (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 13, 1938, page 539.&lt;/ref&gt; and the next year the [[Federal Communications Commission]] implemented a 50,000 watt cap, which still remains in force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting16unse#page/n184/mode/1up/ "Proposed New FCC Rules Well Received"], ''Broadcasting'', February 1, 1939, pages 16-17, 70-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to World War II intervention==
Wheeler, an outspoken [[non-interventionist]], opposed the U.S. entry into [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pastdaily.com/2017/05/04/may-4-1941-burton-k-wheeler/|title=May 4, 1941 - Burton K. Wheeler Makes The Case Against Intervention|last=gordonskene|date=4 May 2017|website=pastdaily.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As tensions mounted in Europe, he supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]]. As chair of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee, Wheeler announced in August 1941 he would investigate “interventionists” in the motion picture industry. He questioned why so many foreign-born men were allowed to shape American opinion. "Critics charged that the Committee was motivated by animus to Jewish studio heads."&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon.[http://bobrowen.com/nymas/americafirst.html ''America First: the Anti-War Movement, Charles Lindbergh and the Second World War, 1940-1941'']&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the studios was 1940 Republican Presidential candidate [[Wendell Willkie]] who charged that Wheeler and other critics sought to impose the same kind of censorship that [[Nazi Germany]] was enacting all over Europe. Wheeler also led the attack on Roosevelt's [[Lend-Lease|Lend Lease Bill]] charging that if passed "it would plow under every fourth American boy".&lt;ref&gt;''Inside U.S.A.'' (Gunther), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt in response charged that Wheeler's statement was "the damnedest thing said in a generation".

After the start of World War II in Europe, Wheeler opposed aid to Britain or the other [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]], already fighting in the war. On October 17, 1941, Wheeler said: "I can't conceive of [[Japan]] being crazy enough to want to go to war with us." One month later, he added: "If we go to war with Japan, the only reason will be to help England." The United States Army secret [[Victory Program]] was leaked on 4 December 1941 to Wheeler, who passed this information on to three newspapers.&lt;ref name=wheeler2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-Victory/USA-Victory-4.html Charles E. Kirkpatrick, ''Writing the Victory Plan of 1941,'' Ch. 4, "Detailed Planning"], [[United States Army Center of Military History]], CMH Pub 93-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Wheeler supported a declaration of war saying, "The only thing now is to do our best to lick hell out of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Dunn|title=1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler-the Election Amid the Storm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nluuyZI68YIC&amp;pg=PA310|year=2013|publisher=Yale UP|page=310|isbn=9780300190861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Wheeler sought renomination in 1946 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by [[Leif Erickson (politician)|Leif Erickson]], who attacked Wheeler as insufficiently liberal and for his "pre-war isolationist" views. Erickson in turn was defeated by Republican state representative [[Zales Ecton]].

On September 15, 1950, Wheeler served as counsel to fellow Democrat from Minnesota [[Max Lowenthal]] during the latter's testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].&lt;ref name=huac1950&gt;

Wheeler did not return to politics, nor full-time to Montana, but took up his law practice in [[Washington, D.C.]] Aided by research by his daughter, Frances (died 1957), Wheeler wrote his autobiography, with Paul F. Healy, ''Yankee from the West'', published in 1962 by Doubleday &amp; Company. He dedicated the book to his wife and daughter. He died in Washington, D.C., aged 92, and is interred in the District of Columbia's [[Rock Creek Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/wheeler.html#R9M0JH46X Burton K.

In 2004, journalist [[Bill Kauffman]] described Wheeler as having been notable as an "anti-[[conscription|draft]], anti-war, anti-[[big business]] defender of [[civil liberties]]".&lt;ref name="Kauffman"&gt;[http://www.amconmag.com/2004/2004_09_27/review.html Bill Kauffman, "Heil to the Chief"], ''The American Conservative'', September 27, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*During the 1946 campaign, David George Kin wrote and published ''The Plot Against America: Senator Wheeler and the Forces Behind Him'', a political pamphlet against Wheeler by supporters of the [[Communist Party USA]]. It accused Wheeler and [[Harry S. Truman]] of being part of a [[fascism|fascist]] conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j090501.html "Wheeler's Progress: The Evolution of a Progressive"], antiwar.com, May 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Philip Roth]]'s [[alternate history]] novel, ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' (2004), Wheeler serves as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] during the [[fictional Presidents of the United States|fictional Presidency]] of [[Charles Lindbergh]]. Roth depicted [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] Wheeler as a political opportunist who imposes [[martial law]] in Lindbergh's absence. (However, Wheeler had historically been known as a leading opponent of the martial law imposed by the [[Governor of Montana]] during [[World War I]].)&lt;ref name="Kauffman"/&gt; 
*  In an earlier, lesser-known alternate history novel, ''[[The Divide (novel)|The Divide]]'' (1980) by author and cartoonist [[William Overgard]], Wheeler becomes President in 1940, campaigning on a platform of isolationism despite huge victories by the Axis in that year (far larger than those which actually occurred). As a result, when the U.S. belatedly finally enters the war, it is defeated in 1946 and partitioned as spoils between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan; Wheeler along with most of the government and military are ultimately executed as [[war criminal]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">'''Charles Dryden''' (1666–1704), was chamberlain to [[Pope Innocent XII]], He was the eldest son of [[John Dryden]] the poet. He was educated at Westminster and Trinity College, Oxford: translated Juvenal's seventh satire for his father's version, 1692. He drowned in the [[Thames]].{{sfn|Lee|1903|p=366}}

==Biography==
Charles Dryden, born at Charlton in 1666, was the first son of John Dryden the poet, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire]]. He was educated at Westminster, elected to Trinity College, Cambridge.{{sfn|Stephen|1888|pp=73–74}}

In 1683, Dryden wrote some poems, one of which, in Latin, appeared in the second ''Miscellany''. He executed the seventh satire for his father's translation of [[Juvenal]] in 1692. About that time he went to Italy and was appointed chamberlain to Pope Innocent XII. Here he wrote an English poem which appeared in the fourth ''Miscellany''. He returned to England about 1697 or 1698; administered to his father's effects; was drowned in the Thames near [[Datchet]], and buried at Windsor 20 August 1704.{{sfn|Stephen|1888|p=74}}  It should be noted that Sir Walter Scott records in his ''Life of John Dryden'' (1834) that Charles was attempting to swim across the Thames on August 20.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a3tXaqjgnYIC&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=charles+dryden+windsor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bzaxk51dIR&amp;sig=zlPKp3VN4FiYbGcSnAmB914U94o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GtwBVcrjM87z8gWwj4H4Cw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20dryden%20windsor&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryden, who was a believer in astrology, calculated his son's horoscope, and on the strength of it prophesied in 1697 that he will soon recover his health, injured by a fall at Rome. Corinna constructed an elaborate fiction upon this basis, showing that Dryden had foretold three periods of danger to his son; at one of which Charles fell from a (non-existent) tower of the Vatican five stories high and was "mashed to a mummy" for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stephen|1888|p=74}} cites Wilson, ''Life of Congreve''.&lt;/ref&gt; Malone reprints this narrative,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stephen|1888|p=74}} cites Malone ''Life of Dryden'' vol. ?, pp. 404–420.&lt;/ref&gt; which is only worth notice from the use made of it in Sir [[Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] ''[[Guy Mannering]]''.{{sfn|Stephen|1888|p=74}}

'''Chorea gravidarum''' is a rare&lt;ref name="pmid5742087"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=5742087 |year=1968 |author1=Zegart |first1=K. N. |title=Chorea gravidarum |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=24–7 |last2=Schwarz |first2=R. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; type of [[chorea (disease)|chorea]] which presents with involuntary abnormal movement, characterized by abrupt, brief, nonrhythmic, nonrepetitive movement of any limb, often associated with nonpatterned facial grimaces. It is a complication of [[pregnancy]] which can be associated with [[eclampsia]] and its effects upon the [[basal ganglia]]. It is not an causal or pathologically distinct entity but a generic term for chorea of any cause starting during pregnancy. It is associated with history of [[Sydenham's chorea]]. It mostly occurs in young patients; the average age is 22 years.&lt;ref name="Willson Preece 471"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.1932.00150100128011 |title=Chorea Gravidarum |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=471–533 |year=1932 |last1=Willson |first1=Prentiss }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willson Preece 671"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.1932.00150110134008 |title=Chorea Gravidarum |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=671–97 |year=1932 |last1=Willson |first1=Prentiss }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there has been a decline in incidence which is probably the result of a decline in [[rheumatic fever]] ([[rheumatic fever|RF]]), which was a major cause of chorea gravidarum before the use of [[antibiotics]] for [[streptococcal pharyngitis]].

==Pathophysiology==
Several pathogenetic mechanisms for chorea gravidarum have been offered, but none have been proven.
History of either [[rheumatic fever]] or chorea is suspected:&lt;ref name="Willson Preece 471"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willson Preece 671"/&gt; the suggestion is that [[estrogens]] and [[progesterone]] may sensitize [[dopamine]] receptors (presumably at a [[Striatum|striatal level]]) and induce chorea in individuals who are vulnerable to this complication by virtue of preexisting [[pathology]] in the [[basal ganglia]].
The relation to rheumatic fever was strengthened by many studies that showed that women with normal pregnancies before rheumatic fever developed chorea in subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=M |title=Two cases of chorea in pregnancy |journal=Glasgow Medical Journal |year=1900 |pages=441–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=AA |title=Chorea complicating pregnancy |journal=Northwest Med |year=1911 |volume=15 |pages=372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 35% of patients have a definite history of acute rheumatic fever and [[Sydenham chorea]]; 4% of those with chorea gravidarum had [[acute rheumatic fever]].&lt;ref name="Willson Preece 471"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willson Preece 671"/&gt;

It has been suggested that use of oral contraceptives is an infrequent cause of chorea. A patient developed this chorea with no definite evidence of previous Sydenham's chorea or recent streptoccocal infections, but had anti-basal ganglia [[antibodies]], suggesting [[Autoimmune disease|immunological]] basis for the pathophysiology of this chorea.&lt;ref name="pmid14742621"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14742621 |pmc=1738905 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.019851 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14742621 |year=2004 |author1=Miranda |first1=M |title=Oral contraceptive induced chorea: Another condition associated with anti-basal ganglia antibodies |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=327–8 |last2=Cardoso |first2=F |last3=Giovannoni |first3=G |last4=Church |first4=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10856942"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01575-7 |pmid=10856942 |title=Pathogenetic role of autoantibodies in neurological diseases |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=317–27 |year=2000 |last1=Archelos |first1=Juan J. |last2=Hartung |first2=Hans-Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chorea can also be a manifestation of drug toxicity (for example, [[anticonvulsants]], [[antiparkinson drug|antiparkinson agents]], [[neuroleptics]], [[steroids]], and [[estrogen]]), or a result of an infectious disease such as [[meningovascular syphilis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[viral encephalitis]], and many others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Treatment==
Drug treatment is indicated for patients with severe disabling chorea. It is treated with [[haloperidol]],&lt;ref name="pmid4643046"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(72)80272-5 |pmid=4643046 |title=Rheumatic chorea controlled with haloperidol |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=1216–7 |year=1972 |last1=Axley |first1=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid472859"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00007611-197909000-00044 |pmid=472859 |title=Treatment of Chorea Gravidarum with Haloperidol |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=72 |issue=9 |pages=1220–1 |year=1979 |last1=Patterson |first1=John F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7078886"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7078886 |url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/1982/03000/control_of_chorea_gravidarum_with_haloperidol.23.aspx |year=1982 |author1=Donaldson |first1=J.

'''David Christopher Bird''' (c. 1959&amp;ndash;2014) was an American journalist who covered [[energy market]]s for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and was deputy [[managing editor]] for [[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] Energy Service. He was known for his ability to detect emerging market trends, particularly the [[Price of oil#2014–2015 global oversupply|decline in oil prices]] that began in 2014, before they otherwise became apparent, through close analysis of data. Before working at the ''Journal'' he had worked for Dow Jones overseas, based in its London office.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;Melanie Grayce West, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/body-of-missing-reporter-found-in-new-jersey-1426789646 Body of Missing Wall Street Journal Reporter Found in New Jersey: David Bird disappeared after going for a walk near his home in 2014], ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 19, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014 he left his [[Millington, New Jersey]], home for a short walk and never returned. Local search efforts, hampered by [[Early 2014 North American cold wave|that year's severe winter weather]], failed to find any trace of him. [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] surfaced, especially after an erroneous report that his credit card had been used overseas, suggesting his disappearance was part of a pattern of suspicious deaths in the financial sector. However, when his body was finally found in a nearby river 14 months later, the coroner ruled his death an accidental drowning and said there were no signs of foul play.

A native of the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] area, Bird was a graduate of [[Rider University]]. In addition to his journalistic work he was an outdoor enthusiast who led [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] hiking trips and ran marathons. He did the latter to raise awareness for [[organ donation]], since his life had been saved by a [[liver transplant]] following a [[hepatitis]] infection he suffered in the early 2000s.

==Early life and education==
Bird was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and was the youngest of six children.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; After attending a [[Catholic school|Catholic]] [[elementary school]] in [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton Township]], south of Trenton, where the family lived, he went to [[Notre Dame High School (New Jersey)|Notre Dame High School]] in nearby [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey|Lawrenceville]]. He graduated from [[Rider College]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Website obituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funeral Announcement and Obituary|url=http://www.finddavidbird.info/Jan2014/obituary/|publisher=finddavidbird.info|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bird worked at the ''[[The News-Press|News-Press]]'' of [[Fort Myers, Florida]] before joining Dow Jones Newswires, and subsequently transferring to Dow Jones's London office.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; Five years into his career, Bird traveled extensively through Europe and the [[Middle East]], returning to the U.S. in 1988.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

Bird worked for [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] (the publisher of the ''Wall Street Journal''), for more than twenty years, rising to become deputy managing editor of the Dow Jones Energy Service.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; He was a key reporter on energy markets.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

After his death, ''Journal'' editor-in-chief [[Gerard Baker]] praised Bird's reportorial zeal. "His ability to navigate the vast troves of public oil data was unmatched," Baker wrote in a memo to staff. "At 10:30 a.m. on Wednesdays, he could often be seen hunched over his computer, sifting through spreadsheets and crunching numbers just released by the [[Energy Information Administration]]. He was often the first to gain insight into important energy-market trends."&lt;ref name="Baker memo at Romenesko"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Gerard|authorlink=Gerard Baker|title=''Wall Street Journal'' editor on David Bird: 'Devoted to his beat and generous with his colleagues'|url=http://jimromenesko.com/2015/03/19/wall-street-journal-editor-recalls-david-bird-devoted-to-his-beat-and-generous-with-his-colleagues/|publisher=[[Jim Romenesko]]|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Late in the afternoon of January 11, 2014, Bird, who was recovering from a brief stomach illness,&lt;ref name="NYT initial disappearance story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schweber|first1=Nate|last2=Schwirtz|first2=Michael|title=Authorities Comb New Jersey Woodland in Hunt for Missing Reporter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/nyregion/hundreds-search-for-a-missing-wall-street-journal-reporter.html?_r=0|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; left his home in the [[Millington, New Jersey|Millington]] section of [[Long Hill Township, New Jersey]]. He told his wife that he planned to go for a brief walk around nearby wooded trails, clad in a distinctive red raincoat with yellow zippers, jeans and sneakers.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;Al Baker, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/nyregion/body-of-missing-reporter-david-bird-is-pulled-from-passaic-river.html Body of David Bird, Missing Wall Street Journal Reporter, Is Found], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 19, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; After his return, he said, he intended to take down the family's [[Christmas lights]]. He left his [[cell phone]] to recharge in his absence.&lt;ref name="One-year anniversary story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hochman|first=Louis C.|title=Missing for a year: Reporter David Bird left his home and vanished|url=http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/01/david_bird_one-year_anniversary.html|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Morristown)|The Daily Record]]|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the evening, however, he had not returned. His wife called the police and reported him missing. Finding him alive was of great importance to the family, since he was required to take anti-[[Transplant rejection|rejection]] drugs due to his liver transplant. Those had been left at the house as well.&lt;ref name="NYT initial disappearance story" /&gt;

"This wasn't right," his wife said later. "Something was wrong." A fellow [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] leader noted that Bird "was stuck somewhere, he knows how to shelter himself enough out of the elements. He knows how to signal if he can."&lt;ref name="NBC Mexico report"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanders|first1=Kerry|last2=Connor|first2=Tracy|title=Missing WSJ reporter's credit card used in Mexico: source|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/16/22326127-missing-wsj-reporters-credit-card-used-in-mexico-source|newspaper=[[NBC News]]|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search==

A few days after Bird disappeared, [[NBC News]] reported that his credit card had been used in [[Mexico]]. His family, the network claimed, believed his disappearance was not an accident and somehow related to his work.&lt;ref name="NBC Mexico report" /&gt; The family, through a friend, said those were not serious investigative leads, just theories being floated by those looking for answers.&lt;ref name="Star=Ledger theories story"&gt;{{cite news|first=Hoochman|last=Louis|title='A lot of theories going around' about missing Wall Street Journal reporter, friend says|url=http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2014/01/a_lot_of_theories_going_around_about_missing_wall_street_journal_reporter_friend_says.html|newspaper=[[Newark Star-Ledger]]|date=January 16, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they learned that the card had not, in fact, been used in Mexico after he disappeared; it had instead just been hacked.&lt;ref name="People discovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=Tara|title=Missing Wall Street Journal Reporter's Body Found in New Jersey River

Early efforts to search included helicopter patrols by [[New Jersey State Police]], with [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]] park police following up on [[mounted police|horseback]] and [[all-terrain vehicle]] while divers searched the nearby [[Passaic River]].&lt;ref name="Six-month story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaremba|first=Justin|title=Six months after disappearance, family of David Bird says 'words can't describe the anguish'|url=http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2014/07/family_of_david_bird_six_months_after_disappearance_words_cant_describe_the_anguish.html|newspaper=[[Newark Star-Ledger]]|date=July 12, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searchers suffered a setback when the winter weather [[Early 2014 North American cold wave|turned colder than usual]] two weeks later followed by heavy snow throughout the region throughout the next two months;&lt;ref name="Fox News story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search to resume for missing Wall Street Journal reporter David Bird|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/05/01/search-to-renew-for-missing-wall-street-journal-reporter-david-bird.html|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they continued their efforts by retracing their steps along the sides of local roadways, looking for signs of an unreported [[motor vehicle accident]] or personal items.&lt;ref name="Echoes-Sentinel story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Denis|title=Fellow Scout leader says Millington's David Bird a strong hiker, camper, Scout leader|url=http://www.newjerseyhills.com/echoes-sentinel/news/fellow-scout-leader-says-millington-s-david-bird-a-strong/article_b38c5676-8e84-11e3-a18a-001a4bcf887a.html|newspaper=Echoes-Sentinel|date=February 7, 2014|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, when the snow melted, the search resumed, focusing on areas nearby where Bird had been known to hike and retracing earlier routes. In May local police said their goal was to have the entire area within a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of the Bird home thoroughly searched.&lt;ref name="Fox News story" /&gt;

Dow Jones offered a $10,000 reward for information on Bird's whereabouts, and colleagues and others raised $35,000 in contributions for Bird's family.&lt;ref name="Milo"&gt;Paul Milo, [http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/06/authorities_say_david_bird_died_in_accidental_drow.html Authorities say David Bird died in accidental drowning, report says], NJ Advance Media for [[NJ.com]] (June 10, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Redmond, [http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/03/wall_street_journal_plans_to_make_10k_donation_to.html Wall Street Journal donating $10k to David Bird's family], NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (March 25, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Milo &amp; Justin Zaremba, [http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/03/colleagues_missing_reporter_david_bird_found_in_ri.html Reporter David Bird, found dead in river, was 'a mentor, a friend, and a model of integrity' ], NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (March 20, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Dow Jones also kept paying Bird's salary through the end of July 2014, changing his status to unpaid leave of absence after that point.&lt;ref name="Hochman"&gt;Louis C. Hochman, [http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2014/12/union_donates_10000_after_wall_street_journal_stops_paying_missing_nj_mans_salary.html Union donates $10,000 after Wall Street Journal stops paying missing NJ man's salary], NJ Advance Media for NJ.com (December 18, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; After Bird was taken off the payroll, the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees 1096, the [[trade union]] representing ''Journal'' reporters, donated $10,000 to the family and matched members' contributions up to another $10,000.&lt;ref name="Hochman"/&gt; Although no new leads had surfaced, on the first anniversary of Bird's disappearance his family and friends led a candlelight vigil and walk through a nearby park where he had often walked, ending in a [[bonfire]], to keep attention on the case.&lt;ref name="One-year anniversary story" /&gt;

===Discovery of body===

On March 18, 2015, a family website asking for assistance in the search went online. That day, two canoeists on the Passaic, its waters high after [[2014–15 North American winter#Late January blizzard|another winter of heavy snow and bitter cold]],&lt;ref name="Daily Record discovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Peggy|title=Questions remain in death of David Bird, Long Hill Twp. father of 2|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/local/2015/03/20/questions-remain-death-long-hill-twp-father/25075741/|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Daily Record]]|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; found Bird's red jacket entangled in branches on the Morris County side of a stretch of the river near King George Road in neighboring [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]]'s [[Warren Township, New Jersey|Warren Township]],&lt;ref name="Daily Record identification story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Peggy|title=Death of David Bird in Long Hill ruled a drowning|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/local/2015/06/09/death-david-bird-long-hill-ruled-drowning/28756505/|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Daily Record]]|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from Bird's home.&lt;ref name="NY Daily News body discovery story" /&gt; They notified authorities, who found the body about {{convert|20|ft}} off the shoreline,&lt;ref name="Zaremba"&gt;Justin Zaremba, [http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/03/14_months_after_disappearance_mourners_gather_for.html Funeral of David Bird brings closure 14 months after he disappeared, friends say], NJ Advance Media for [[NJ.com]] (March 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; under {{convert|7|ft}} of water,&lt;ref name="Daily Record identification story" /&gt; an area that had been searched before several times.&lt;ref name="NY Daily News body discovery story" /&gt; The remains were identified through [[dental record]]s.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaremba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; A subsequent investigation&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; determined that the [[cause of death]] was accidental drowning.&lt;ref name="Milo"/&gt; His wife believed it was possible that Bird "slipped and fell into the water while hurrying home ahead of an incoming storm."&lt;ref name="NY Daily News body discovery story" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Bird met Nancy Fleming around 1988, and they wed in 1991.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; The couple had two children, a son born in 1998 and a daughter born in 2001.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

Bird contracted a rare form of [[hepatitis]] about nine years before his disappearance and death and received a lifesaving [[liver transplant]] in 2004,&lt;ref name="Zaremba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milo"/&gt; which Bird discussed on his blog and which was reported in local newspapers.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;  Bird was an advocate for [[organ donation]].&lt;ref name="Zaremba"/&gt;

Bird was described in his ''Wall Street Journal'' obituary as "an avid hiker, lover of [[reggae]] music, a [[Boston Red Sox]] fan, cyclist, camper, marathoner and a scout-troop leader" who had traveled to more than 35 countries.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

In the last years of his life he had started running [[marathon]]s. In 2012 he finished the [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] Marathon, followed by the [[New York City Marathon]] the next year. He also competed in the New York City [[Triathlon]] twice and was a member of Team Liberty at the National Transplant Games.&lt;ref name="Website obituary" /&gt; Through his athletic activities he hoped to draw support for organ donation and be an example for other transplant recipients.&lt;ref name="USA Today story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=Missing reporter set example for transplant recipients|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/17/david-bird-missing-liver-transplant-marathon/4612219/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running the marathon had particular significance for Bird since he had first learned he would need a transplant to live on the day of the 2004 marathon. He ran the race with a note thanking his donor pinned to him. "I met my goal of hitting the finish line in less time than I was in surgery," he said later.&lt;ref name="Miles of Smiles"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bird|first=David|title=Miles of Smiles|url=http://www.finddavidbird.info/Jan2014/about/|publisher=finddavidbird.info|date=November 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative theories==

Although no signs of foul play were reported in his death, Bird's fate inspired theories that what happened was somehow the result of a conspiracy of some nature that had also claimed other lives in the financial industry during the same period.&lt;ref name="The Wrap"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burchette|first=Jordan|title=Wall Street Journal Reporter’s Body Found a Year After His Disappearance|url=http://www.thewrap.com/wall-street-journal-reporter-david-bird-body-found/|newspaper=[[TheWrap]]|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, his disappearance and death were related to a string of suicides and other untimely deaths of present and former [[JPMorganChase]] employees in late 2013 and early 2014, supposedly after two of them had uncovered evidence of major wrongdoing on the company's part. In his final column for ''[[Bloomberg View]]'', several months after Bird was reported missing, [[William D. Cohan]], a former Chase employee himself who had some admitted disputes with the company, looked into the rumors and found that Chase had indeed experienced an unusual number of deaths of employees in their 30s during that period, especially when compared to similarly-sized [[investment bank]]s. But, since several of those deaths were indisputably suicides, he concluded that it was just as likely that those deaths were simply the result of working in an already stressful industry during a stressful period.&lt;ref name="Cohan BV piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohan|first=William D.|title=Is Wall Street Killing Its Bankers?|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-09/is-wall-street-killing-its-bankers|newspaper=[[Bloomberg View]]|date=May 9, 2014|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date was set by various youth groups to coincide with the annual Egyptian "police day" as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last  few years of Mubarak's presidency. It consisted of demonstrations, marches, occupations of plazas, non-violent [[civil resistance]], acts of [[civil disobedience]] and strikes. Millions of protesters from a range of [[socio-economic]] and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of [[Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]]. The revolution started by calls for protests from online youth groups. Initially these included liberal, anti-capitalist, nationalist, and feminist elements, but they finally included Islamist elements as well. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/385140 |title=شيحة: مكاتب الصحة وثقت سقوط 840 شهيداً خلال ثورة 25 يناير |publisher=Almasry-alyoum.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429125656/http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/385140|archivedate= 29 April 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14075493 |title=Egypt: Cairo's Tahrir Square fills with protesters |publisher=BBC |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709112514/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14075493|archivedate= 9 July 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/was-egyptian-revolution-really-non-violent |title=Was the Egyptian revolution really non-violent? |newspaper=Egypt Independent |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests took place in [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], and in all major cities across the nation.

Protesters defied a government-imposed [[curfew]], which was impossible to enforce by the police and military. Egypt's [[Central Security Forces]], loyal to Mubarak, were gradually replaced by military troops. In the chaos, there was some [[looting]] by gangs which was instigated (according to opposition sources) by plainclothes police officers. In response, watch groups were organized by civilians to protect neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleishman|first=Jeffrey and Edmund Sanders (Los Angeles Times)|title=Unease in Egypt as police replaced by army, neighbors band against looters|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014078461_egypt30.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201071852/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014078461_egypt30.html|archivedate= 1 February 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looting spreads in Egyptian cities|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129175926266521.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110131072424/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129175926266521.html|archivedate= 31 January 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hauslohner|first=Abigail|title=The Army's OK with the Protesters, for now|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2045124,00.html#ixzz1CfroWYuj |newspaper=Time |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110131222033/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2045124,00.html|archivedate= 31 January 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mubarak plays last card, the army; Police vanish|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_egypt0078_01_31.asp |newspaper=World Tribune (online) |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201231440/http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_egypt0078_01_31.asp|archivedate= 1 February 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stirewalt|first=Chris|title=Egypt: From Police State to Military Rule|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/31/egypt-police-state-military-rule/ |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201053106/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/31/egypt-police-state-military-rule/|archivedate= 1 February 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International reaction has varied, with most Western nations condoning peaceful protests but concerned about the stability of Egypt and the region. The Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions have influenced demonstrations in other Arab countries, including [[Yemen]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and [[Libya]].

Mubarak dissolved his government, appointing former head of the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate]] [[Omar Suleiman]] vice-president in an attempt to quell dissent. Mubarak asked aviation minister and former chief of Egypt's air force [[Ahmed Shafik]] (who ran for presidency later) to form a new government. [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] became a major opposition figure, with all major opposition groups supporting his role as negotiator for a transitional unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shadid|first1=Anthony|last2=Kirkpatrick|first2=David D.|title=Opposition Rallies to ElBaradei as Military Reinforces in Cairo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/world/middleeast/31-egypt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=31 January 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110131071532/http://www.nytimes.com//2011//01//31//world//middleeast//31-egypt.html|archivedate= 31 January 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to mounting pressure, Mubarak, in another attempt to contain the crisis, announced he did not intend to seek re-election in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=El Deeb, Sarah |author2=Al-Shalchi, Hadeel |title=Egypt Crowds Unmoved by Mubarak's Vow Not To Run|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-crowds-unmoved-mubaraks-vow-not-run-20110201-211722-054.html|agency=Associated Press|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inheritance of power ===
[[File:Gamal Mubarak.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Man talking into a microphone at the World Economic Forum|[[Gamal Mubarak]] in 2006]]

Mubarak's younger son, was expected to succeed his father as the next president of Egypt in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Aziz, Muhammad Abdul and Hussein, Youssef (2002) "The President, the Son, and the Military: Succession in Egypt" ''Arab Studies Journal'' 9/10:&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;73–88&lt;/ref&gt; Gamal began receiving attention from the Egyptian media, since there were apparently no other heirs to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Bee, Jason (2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110513071650/https://webspace.utexas.edu/jmb334/www/documents/article.ASJ.2008.pdf "The Heir Apparency of Gamal Mubarak"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404150833/https://webspace.utexas.edu/jmb334/www/documents/article.ASJ.2008.pdf |date=4 April 2012 }} ''Arab Studies Journal''&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;36–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s rise to power in [[Syria]] in June 2000, hours after [[Hafez al-Assad]]'s death, sparked debate in the Egyptian press about the prospects for a similar scenario in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Sobelman, Daniel (2001) [http://www.meforum.org/27/gamal-mubarak-president-of-egypt "Gamal Mubarak, President of Egypt?"] ''Middle East Quarterly'' 8(2):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;31–40&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years after [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|Mubarak's 2005 re-election]], several left- and right-wing (primarily unofficial) political groups expressed opposition to the inheritance of power, demanded reforms and asked for a multi-candidate election. In 2006, with opposition increasing, ''[[Daily News Egypt]]'' reported an online campaign initiative (the National Initiative against Power Inheritance) demanding that Gamal reduce his power. The campaign said, "President Mubarak and his son constantly denied even the possibility of [succession]. However, in reality they did the opposite, including amending the constitution to make sure that Gamal will be the only unchallenged candidate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/egyptians-abroad-speak-out-against-inheritance-of-power.html |title=Egyptians abroad speak out against inheritance of power |date=3 October 2006 |author=Al-A'sar, Marwa |accessdate=16 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513151746/http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/egyptians-abroad-speak-out-against-inheritance-of-power.html|archivedate=13 May 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the decade, public perception grew that Gamal would succeed his father. He wielded increasing power as NDP deputy secretary general and chair of the party's policy committee. Analysts described Mubarak's last decade in power as "the age of Gamal Mubarak". With his father's health declining and no appointed vice-president, Gamal was considered Egypt's ''de facto'' president by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9988/Egypt/Politics-/How-Gamal-brought-down-the-whole-Mubarak-house.aspx |title=How Gamal brought down the whole Mubarak house |publisher=Middle East Online |date=15 April 2011 |author=Gamal Essam El-Din |accessdate=16 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430024600/http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9988/Egypt/Politics-/How-Gamal-brought-down-the-whole-Mubarak-house.aspx|archivedate=30 April 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gamal and Hosni Mubarak denied an inheritance of power, Gamal could be elected; with Hosni Mubarak's presidential term set to expire in 2010, speculation existed that Gamal would run as the NDP candidate in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/20/world/africa/20egypt.html |title=Mubarak's Son Proposes Nuclear Program |work=The New York Times |date=20 September 2006 |author1=Michael Slackman |author2=Mona el-Naggar |accessdate=16 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501005025/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/20/world/africa/20egypt.html|archivedate=1 May 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the January–February 2011 protest Gamal Mubarak said that he would not run for president in the 2011 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=Egypt unrest: Anti-Mubarak protesters fight back|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12357891|newspaper=British Broadcasting Company|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights documented 30 cases of torture during the year 2009. In numerous trials defendants alleged that police tortured them during questioning. During the year activists and observers circulated some amateur cellphone videos documenting the alleged abuse of citizens by security officials. For example, on 8 February, a blogger posted a video of two police officers, identified by their first names and last initials, sodomizing a bound naked man named Ahmed Abdel Fattah Ali with a bottle. On 12 August, the same blogger posted two videos of alleged police torture of a man in a Port Said police station by the head of investigations, Mohammed Abu Ghazala.

According to the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] and other proponents of demographic structural approach ([[cliodynamics]]), a basic problem in Egypt is unemployment driven by a demographic [[youth bulge]]; with the number of new people entering the workforce at about four percent a year, unemployment in Egypt is almost 10 times as high for [[college graduate]]s as for those who finished elementary school (particularly educated urban youth—the people who were in the streets during the revolution).&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Zinkina J.

Egypt's economy was highly centralised during the presidency of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], becoming more [[Market economy|market-driven]] under Anwar Sadat and Mubarak. From 2004 to 2008 the Mubarak government pursued economic reform to attract foreign investment and increase GDP, later postponing further reforms because of the [[Great Recession]]. The international [[economic downturn]] slowed Egypt's GDP growth to 4.5 percent in 2009. In 2010, analysts said that the government of Prime Minister [[Ahmed Nazif]] would need to resume economic reform to attract foreign investment, increase growth and improve economic conditions. Despite recent high national economic growth, living conditions for the average Egyptian remained relatively poor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/egypt/egypt_economy.html|title=Egypt Economy 2011|work=[[CIA World Factbook]] |accessdate=3 March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110228075759/http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/egypt/egypt_economy.html|archivedate= 28 February 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (albeit better than other African nations&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"/&gt; with no significant social upheavals).

Most causes of the 2011 Egyptian revolution against Mubarak also existed in 1952, when the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]] ousted [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Hewie|first=Mohamed F.|title=Chain Reaction: Egypt's Revolt 2011 Illustrated |year=2011|publisher=Shaymaa |isbn=1461093953|pages=1–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; inherited power, corruption, under-development, unemployment, unfair distribution of wealth and the presence of Israel. A new cause of the Arab Spring is the increase in population, which increased unemployment. The first sign along the road to Mubarak was the 1967 [[Six-Day War|war between Egypt and Israel]].
[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s defeat brought Anwar Sadat to power after Nasser's death in 1970. Sadat undid Nasser's social reforms and dependence on the Soviet Union, predicting its [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] nearly two decades before it occurred.

Sadat neglected the modernization of Egypt, and his cronyism cost the country infrastructure industries which could generate new jobs. He was succeeded by Hosni Mubarak after Sadat's 1981 death. With no academic or governmental experience, Mubarak implemented emergency rule throughout his 30 years in office, not appointing a vice president until he was pressured to resign. Communications media such as the internet, cell phones and satellite TV channels augmented mosques and Friday prayers, traditional means of mass communications. The mosques brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power, and the Brotherhood has pressured all governments from 1928 through 2011 (as it also does in neighboring countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Hewie|first=Mohamed F.|title=A Matter of Faith: The Islamic Spring |year=2013|publisher=Shaymaa|isbn=1481997688|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{em|28 January 2011}}: The "Friday of Anger" protests began, with hundreds of thousands demonstrating in Cairo and other Egyptian cities after Friday prayers. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei arrived in Cairo amid reports of looting. Prisons were opened and burned down, allegedly on orders from Interior Minister Habib El Adly. Prison inmates escaped ''en masse'', in what was believed to be an attempt to terrorise protesters. Police were withdrawn from the streets, and the military was deployed. International fears of violence grew, but no major casualties were reported. Mubarak made his first address to the nation, pledging to form a new government. Later that night clashes broke out in Tahrir Square between revolutionaries and pro-Mubarak demonstrators, leading to casualties. No fatalities have been reported in Cairo, however, 11 people were killed in Suez and another 170 were injured.1,030 people were reported injured nationwide.

{{em|29 January 2011}}: The military presence in Cairo increased. A curfew was imposed, which was widely ignored as the flow of protesters into Tahrir Square continued through the night. The military reportedly refused to follow orders to fire live ammunition, exercising overall restraint; there were no reports of major casualties. On 31 January, Israeli media reported that the 9th, 2nd, and 7th Divisions of the [[Egyptian Army]] had been ordered into Cairo to help restore order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ehud Yaari |url=http://www.mako.co.il/news-specials/egypt/Article-64af2c4c648dd21004.htm |title=צפו: סיור וירטואלי במוקדי המהפכה |language=he |trans-title=Watch: Virtual Tour revolution centers |date=30 January 2011 |publisher=[[Israeli News Company]] |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{em|1 February 2011}}: Mubarak made another televised address, offering several concessions. He pledged political reforms and said he would not run in the elections planned for September, but would remain in office to oversee a peaceful transition. Small-but-violent clashes began that night between pro- and anti-Mubarak groups.

{{em|2 February 2011 (Camel Incident)}}: Violence escalated as waves of Mubarak supporters met anti-government protesters; some Mubarak supporters rode camels and horses into Tahrir Square, reportedly wielding sticks.

Violence toward journalists and reporters escalated, amid speculation that it was encouraged by Mubarak to bring the protests to an end. The camel and horse riders later claimed that they were "good men", and they opposed the protests because they wanted tourists to come back to keep their jobs and feed their animals. The horse and camel riders deny that they were paid by anyone, though they said that they were told about the protests from a ruling party MP. Three hundred people were reported dead by the Human Rights Watch the following day, since January 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This is what they tell US: The US Printing Press on the 2011 Revolution in Egypt|last=Witzel|first=Annika|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8306223/Egypt-protests-camel-and-horse-riders-who-invaded-Tahrir-Square-say-they-are-good-men.html|title=Egypt protests: camel and horse riders who invaded Tahrir Square say they are 'good men'|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wael Ghonim, Google executive and creator of the page ''We are all Khaled Said'', was reported missing and the company asked the public to help find him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/02/business/la-fi-google-missing-exec-20110202|title=Google's Wael Ghonim is missing in Egypt; company asks public for help finding him|last=Guynn|first=Jessica|date=2011-02-02|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{em|6 February 2011}}: An interfaith service was held with [[Copts|Egyptian Christians]] and [[Islam in Egypt|Muslims]] in Tahrir Square. Negotiations by Egyptian Vice President [[Omar Suleiman]] and opposition representatives began during continuing protests throughout the country. The Egyptian army assumed greater security responsibilities, maintaining order and guarding The [[Egyptian Museum|Egyptian Museum of Antiquity]]. Suleiman offered reforms, while others in Mubarak's regime accused foreign nations (including the U.S.) of interfering in Egypt's affairs.

{{em|10 February 2011}}: Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people amid speculation of a military coup. Instead of resigning (which was widely expected), he said he would delegate some powers to Vice President Suleiman while remaining Egypt's head of state. Mubarak's statement was met with anger, frustration and disappointment, and in a number of cities there was an escalation in the number and intensity of demonstrations.

{{em|11 February 2011 ("Friday of Departure")}}: Large protests continued in many cities, as Egyptians refused to accept Mubarak's concessions. At 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation, entrusting the Supreme Council of Egyptian Armed Forces with the leadership of the country.Right after Omar Suleiman had spoken, Mubarak had given an entire speech about his love to the country and his apologies for not being what the citizens expected. It was saddening to many, but at the end it was what the people wanted. Nationwide celebrations immediately followed.

{{em|13 February 2011}}: The [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Supreme Council]] dissolved Egypt's parliament and suspended the constitution in response to demands by demonstrators. The council declared that it would wield power for six months, or until elections could be held. Calls were made for the council to provide details and more-specific timetables and deadlines. Major protests subsided, but did not end. In a gesture to a new beginning, protesters cleaned up and renovated Tahrir Square (the epicenter of the demonstrations); however, many pledged to continue protesting until all demands had been met.

For a chronological summary of the major events which took place ''after'' the 2011–2012 Egyptian revolution under President Mohamed Morsi, see [[Timeline of the 2011–2012 Egyptian revolution (Post-revolution timeline)]].

==== November 2012 declaration ====
{{main article|2012–13 Egyptian protests}}
On 22 November 2012, Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and attempting to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting the new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20451208 |title=Egypt's President Mursi assumes sweeping powers |publisher=BBC News |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration required a retrial of those acquitted of killing protesters, and extended the constituent assembly's mandate by two months. The declaration also authorized Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution.  Liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamism, while the Muslim Brotherhood supported Morsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-11-22-11-27-48 |title=Rallies for, against Egypt president's new powers |work=Associated Press |date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Story of the Egyptian Revolution 2011-2013 |medium=Documentary |language=English, Arabic |url=https://archive.org/details/EgyptRevolution |date=15 November 2013 |minutes=10 |publisher=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morsi's declaration was criticized by Constitution Party leader [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] (who said that he had "usurped all state powers and appointed himself Egypt's new [[pharaoh]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ElBaradei/status/271656968341581824 |title = Twitter / ELBaradei |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypts-president-morsi-takes-sweeping-new-powers/2012/11/22/8d87d716-34cb-11e2-92f0-496af208bf23_story.html |title=Egypt's President Morsi takes sweeping new powers |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012 |first=Michael |last=Birnbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to violent protests throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9699801/Violence-breaks-out-across-Egypt-as-protesters-decry-Mohammed-Morsis-constitutional-coup.html|first=Richard|last=Spencer|date=23 November 2012|accessdate=23 November 2012|title=Violence breaks out across Egypt as protesters decry Mohamed Morsi's constitutional 'coup'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters again erected tents in [[Tahrir Square]], demanding a reversal of the declaration and the dissolving of the constituent assembly.

In April 2013 a youth group was created opposing Morsi and attempting to collect 22&amp;nbsp;million signatures by 30 June 2013 (the first anniversary of his presidency) on a petition demanding early presidential elections. This triggered the June 2013 protests.

On 30 June 2013, marking the one-year anniversary of  Morsi's inauguration as president, millions of Egyptians protested against him, demanding he step down from office. Morsi refused to resign. A 48-hour ultimatum was issued to him, demanding that he respond to the demands of the Egyptians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/201371231726346358.html |title=Egyptian army issues 48-hour ultimatum|publisher=Al-Jazeera English |date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 3 July 2013, the President of Egypt was overthrown. Unlike the imposition of [[martial law]] which followed the 2011 resignation of Hosni Mubarak, on 4 July 2013, a civilian senior jurist [[Adly Mansour]] was appointed interim president and was sworn in over the new government following Morsi's removal. Mansour had the right to issue constitutional declarations and vested executive power in the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt|Supreme Constitutional Court]], giving him executive, judicial and constitutional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/05/us-egypt-protests-downfall-specialreport-idUSBRE9640SP20130705|title=Special Report: Mursi's downfall|agency=Reuters|date=6 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsi refused to accept his removal from office, and many supporters vowed to reinstate him.

On 18 January 2014, the interim government institutionalised a [[Egyptian Constitution of 2014|new constitution]] following a referendum in which 98.2% of voters were supportive.

=== Alexandria ===

[[Alexandria]], home of [[Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed|Khaled Saeed]], experienced major protests and clashes with police. There were few confrontations between demonstrators, since there were few Mubarak supporters (except for a few police-escorted convoys). The breakdown of law and order, including the general absence of police from the streets, continued until the evening of 3 February. Alexandria's protests were notable for the joint presence of Christians and Muslims in the events following the [[2011 Alexandria bombing|church bombing]] on 1 January, which sparked protests against the Mubarak regime.

=== Mansoura ===

In the northern city of [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansoura]], there were daily protests against the Mubarak regime beginning on 25 January; two days later, the city was called a "war zone".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} On 28 January, 13 were reported dead in violent clashes; on 9 February, 18 more protesters died. One protest, on 1 February, had an estimated attendance of one million. The remote city of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] had been relatively calm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/03/egypt.protests.anxiety/|title=Across dusty Egypt, anxiety has filled the air|last=Sterling|first=Joe|date=4 February 2011|publisher=CNN|accessdate=5 February 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110205143940/http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/03/egypt.protests.anxiety/|archivedate= 5 February 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but local [[sheikhs]] reportedly in control put the community under [[lockdown]] after a nearby town was [[Arson|burned]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/news/8823127.Family__cut_off__amid_Egypt_riots/|title=Mother from St. Albans Speaks to the Review from Egypt|last=Mistry|first=Manisha|work=St. Albans Review (part of [[Newsquest]])|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suez ===

[[Suez]] also saw violent protests.

On 17 February, an Egyptian prosecutor ordered the detention of three former ministers (interior minister Habib el-Adli, tourism minister Zuhair Garana and housing minister Ahmed el-Maghrabi) and steel magnate Ahmed Ezz pending trial for wasting public funds. The public prosecutor froze the bank accounts of Adli and his family following accusations that over 4&amp;nbsp;million Egyptian pounds ($680,000) were transferred to his personal account by a businessman. The foreign minister was requested to contact European countries to freeze the other defendants' accounts.&lt;ref name="AJEgypt_Ministers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt detains ex-ministers |publisher=Al Jazeera|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011217221111216445.html |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110218053134/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011217221111216445.html|archivedate= 18 February 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That day, the United States announced that it would give Egypt $150&amp;nbsp;million in aid to help it transition towards democracy. U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] said that [[William Joseph Burns|William Burns]] (undersecretary of state for political affairs) and [[David Lipton]] (a senior White House adviser on international economics) would travel to Egypt the following week.&lt;ref name=AJEgypt_Ministers/&gt;

On 19 February a moderate Islamic party which had been banned for 15 years, [[Al-Wasat Party|Al-Wasat Al-Jadid]] ({{Lang-ar|حزب الوسط الجديد}}, New Center Party), was finally recognised by an Egyptian court. The party was founded in 1996 by activists who split from the Muslim Brotherhood and sought to create a tolerant, liberal Islamic movement, but its four attempts to register as an official party were rejected. That day, Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq also said that 222 political prisoners would be released. Shafiq said that only a few were detained during the uprising; he put the number of remaining political prisoners at 487, but did not say when they would be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt recognizes moderate Islamic party, promises to release political prisoners |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/crisis-in-egypt/egypt-recognizes-moderate-islamic-party-promises-to-release-political-prisoners/article1914290/ |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011 |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222062733/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/crisis-in-egypt/egypt-recognizes-moderate-islamic-party-promises-to-release-political-prisoners/article1914290/ |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February {{Interlanguage link multi|Yehia El Gamal|ar|3=يحيى الجمل|vertical-align=sup}}, an activist and law professor, accepted on television the position of deputy prime minister.

On 3 March, Prime Minister Shafiq submitted his resignation to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. The SCAF appointed [[Essam Sharaf]], a former transportation minister and a vocal critic of the regime following his resignation after the 2006 [[Qalyoub rail accident]], to replace Shafik and form a new government. Sharaf's appointment was seen as a concession to protesters, since he was actively involved in the events in Tahrir Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12634117|title=Egypt's Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq resigns|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=3 March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110303102725/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12634117|archivedate= 3 March 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fr.euronews.net/depeches/772863-egypte-demission-du-premier-ministre-ahmad-chafic/ |title=Egypte: le Premier ministre remplacé, satisfaction des opposants |publisher=Euronews |language=French |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110307143402/http://fr.euronews.net/depeches/772863-egypte-demission-du-premier-ministre-ahmad-chafic/|archivedate= 7 March 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/6892/Egypt/Politics-/Meet-Essam-Sharaf-Egypts-first-postrevolution-Prim.aspx |title=Meet Essam Sharaf: Egypt's first post-revolution Prime Minister |publisher=Ahram Online |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharaf appointed former [[International Court of Justice]] judge [[Nabil Elaraby]] foreign minister and Mansour El Essawi as interior minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Analysis ==

=== Regional instability ===
{{main article|Arab Spring}}
The Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions sparked a [[Revolutionary wave|wave of uprisings]], with demonstrations spreading across the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]]. [[2010–2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]], [[2011 Bahraini protests|Bahrain]], [[2011 Iranian protests|Iran]], [[2011 Jordanian protests|Jordan]], [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]], [[2011 Morocco protests|Morocco]], [[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]] and [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syria]] witnessed major protests, and minor demonstrations occurred in [[2011 Iraqi protests|Iraq]], Kuwait, [[Mauritania]], [[2011 Omani protests|Oman]], [[2011 Saudi Arabian protests|Saudi Arabia]], Somalia{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and [[2011 Sudanese protests|Sudan]].

The Egyptian protests in Egypt were not centred around religion-based politics, but nationalism and social consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palestinenote.com/blogs/blogs/archive/2011/02/28/secularism-is-what-the-arab-world-needs.aspx |title=Secularism is what the Arab world needs – Blog Post |publisher=Palestinenote.com |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307200155/http://palestinenote.com/blogs/blogs/archive/2011/02/28/secularism-is-what-the-arab-world-needs.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the uprising, the best-organised and most-prominent opposition movements in the Arab world usually came from Islamist organisations with members who were motivated and ready to sacrifice. However, secular forces emerged from the revolution espousing principles shared with religious groups: freedom, social justice and dignity. Islamist organisations  emerged with a greater freedom to operate. Although the cooperative, inter-faith revolution was no guarantee that partisan politics would not re-emerge in its wake, its success represented a change from the intellectual stagnation (created by decades of repression) which pitted modernity and Islamism against one another. Islamists and secularists are faced with new opportunities for dialogue on subjects such as the role of Islam and Sharia in society, freedom of speech and the impact of secularism on a predominantly-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite the optimism surrounding the revolution, commentators expressed concern about the risk of increased power and influence for Islamist forces in the country and region and the difficulty of integrating different groups, ideologies and visions for the country. Journalist [[Caroline Glick]] wrote that the Egyptian revolution foreshadowed a rise in religious radicalism and support for terrorism, citing a 2010 [[Pew]] Opinion poll which found that Egyptians supported Islamists over modernizers by an over two-to-one margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=206121|title=Our World: Clueless in Washington|author=Glick, Caroline|accessdate=10 April 2011|work=The Jerusalem Post|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427073738/http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=206121|archivedate= 27 April 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another journalist, [[Shlomo Ben-Ami]], said that Egypt's most formidable task was to refute the old paradigm of the Arab world which sees the only choices for regimes repressive, secular dictatorships or repressive theocracies. Ben-Ami noted that with Islam a central part of the society, any emergent regime was bound to be attuned to religion. In his view, a democracy which excluded all religion from public life (as in France) could succeed in Egypt but no genuine Arab democracy could disallow the participation of political Islam.&lt;ref name="Shlomo Ben Ari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami51/English7 |title=Saving the Egyptian Revolution |publisher=[[Project Syndicate]] |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430171001/http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami51/English7 |archivedate=30 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the revolution Islamist parties (such as the Muslim Brotherhood) have strengthened in the democratic landscape, leading constitutional change, voter mobilization and protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/world/middleeast/21egypt.htm|title=Egyptian Voters Approve Constitutional Changes|author=MacFarquhar, Neil|accessdate=10 April 2011|work=The New York Times|date=20 March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111128102754/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/world/middleeast/21egypt.htm|archivedate=28 November 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley |first=Matt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704587004576244922383434098 |title=Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood to Rejoin Protests |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110409104007/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704587004576244922383434098.html|archivedate= 9 April 2011|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a concern of the secular and youth movements, who wanted elections to be held later so they could catch up to the already-well-organized groups. Elections were held in September 2011, with Liberty and Justice (the Muslim Brotherhood party) winning 48.5 percent of the vote. In 2014 in Upper Egypt, several newspapers reported that [[Upper Egypt]] wanted to secede from the rest of the country to improve its standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.iar-gwu.org/content/egypt-breaking-apart | title=Is Egypt Breaking Apart? | work=International Affairs Review | date=17 February 2014 | author=Gratowski, J.

[[Women in Egypt|Egyptian women]]   have been participating actively in the revolution, in the same way that they played an active role in the strike movement in the few last years, in several cases pressurizing the men to join the strikes.&lt;ref name="marxist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/key-role-of-women-in-egyptian-revolution.htm|title=The key role of women in the Egyptian revolution|author=Niklas Albin Svensson|work=In Defence of Marxism|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier protests in Egypt, women only accounted for about 10 per cent of the protesters, but on Tahrir Square they accounted for about 40 to 50 per cent in the days leading up to the fall of Mubarak. Women, with and without veils, participated in the defence of the square, set up barricades, led debates, shouted slogans and, together with the men, risked their lives.&lt;ref name="marxist.com"/&gt; Some participated in the protests, were present in news clips and on Facebook forums and were part of the revolution's leadership during the Egyptian revolution. In Tahrir Square, female protesters (some with children) supported the protests. The diversity of the protesters in Tahrir Square was visible in the women who participated; many wore [[head scarves]] and other signs of religious conservatism, while others felt free to kiss a friend or smoke a cigarette in public. Women organised protests and reported events; female bloggers, such as Leil Zahra Mortada, risked abuse or imprisonment by keeping the world informed of events in Tahrir Square and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The Middle East's Feminist Revolution"&gt;{{cite news

The participation and contributions by Egyptian women to the protests were attributed to the fact that many (especially younger women) were better educated than previous generations and represent more than half of Egyptian university students. This is an empowering factor for women, who have become more present and active publicly. The advent of social media also provided a tool for women to become protest leaders.&lt;ref name="The Middle East's Feminist Revolution"/&gt;

The [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] initially enjoyed a better public reputation than the police did; the former was seen as a professional body protecting the country, and the latter was accused of [[systemic corruption]] and lawless violence. However, when the SCAF cracked down on protesters after becoming the ''de facto'' ruler of Egypt the military's popularity decreased.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} All four [[Egyptian president]]s since the 1950s have a military background.

As head of Egypt's armed forces, Tantawi has been described as "aged and change-resistant" and is attached to the old regime. He has used his position as defense minister to oppose economic and political reform he saw as weakening central authority. Other key figures ([[Sami Hafez Anan]] chief among them) are younger, with closer connections to the U.S. and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Wael Ghonim's memorial Facebook page to Said grew to over 400,000 followers, creating an online arena where protestors and those discontented with the government could gather and organise. The page called for protests on 25 January, later known as the "Day of Wrath". Hundreds of thousands of protestors flooded the streets to show their discontent with murder and corruption in their country. Ghonim was jailed on 28 January, and released 12 days later.

Egyptian activist and 6 April Youth Movement member Asmaa Mahfouz posted a video urging the Egyptian people to meet her at Tahrir Square, rise up against the government and demand democracy. In the video, she spoke about four protesters who had immolated themselves in protest of 30 years of poverty and degradation. On 24 January Mahfouz posted another video relating efforts made in support of the protest, from printing posters to creating flyers. The videos were posted on Facebook and then YouTube. The day after her last video post, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians poured into the streets in protest.

Since 25 January 2011, videos (including those of a badly-beaten Khaled Said, disproving police claims that he had choked to death), tweets and Facebook comments have kept the world abreast of the situation in Egypt. Amir Ali documents the ways in which social media was used by Egyptian activists, Egyptian celebrities and political figures abroad to fan the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amir |last=Ali |url=http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf |title=The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=185–189, 208–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some protesters discouraged the use of social media. A widely circulated pamphlet by an anonymous activist group titled "How to Protest Intelligently" (Arabic: كيف للاحتجاج بذكاء؟), asked readers "not to use Twitter or Facebook or other websites because they are all being monitored by the Ministry of the Interior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madrigal|first1=Alexis C.|title=Egyptian Activists' Action Plan: Translated|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/01/egyptian-activists-action-plan-translated/70388/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television, particularly live coverage by ''[[Al Jazeera English]]'' and [[BBC News]], was important to the revolution; the cameras provided exposure, preventing mass violence by the government in Tahir Square (in contrast to the lack of live coverage and more-widespread violence in Libya).&lt;ref&gt;Hearns-Branaman, Jesse Owen (2012), 'The Egyptian Revolution did not take place: On live television coverage by Al Jazeera English', ''[[International Journal of Baudrillard Studies]]'' Vol 9, no 1 {{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-9_1/v9-1-branaman.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094852/http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol-9_1/v9-1-branaman.html |archivedate=21 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use was important in order to portray the violence of the Egyptian government, as well as, building support for the revolution through several different mediums. On one front was social media giving minute by minute updates via YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, and in the other hand was the use of the mainstream media to report to a wider audience about the overall developments occurring in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Eltantawy 18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eltantawy|first=Nahed|last2=Wiest|first2=Julie B.|date=2011-09-02|title=The Arab Spring{{!}} Social Media in the Egyptian Revolution: Reconsidering Resource Mobilization Theory|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1242|journal=International Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=5|issue=0|pages=18|issn=1932-8036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of protesters to focus their demonstrations on a single area (with live coverage) was fundamental in Egypt but impossible in Libya, Bahrain and Syria, irrespective of social-media use. A social-media expert launched a network of messages with the hashtag #jan25 on 11 February 2011, when Mubarak's resignation was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Panisson |first=André |title=The Egyptian Revolution on Twitter |url=https://gephi.org/2011/the-egyptian-revolution-on-twitter/ |accessdate=26 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225095702/http://gephi.org/2011/the-egyptian-revolution-on-twitter/ |archivedate=25 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media helped secure solidarity for the revolutionaries from people outside of Egypt. This is evident through movements like the "March of Millions", "Voice of Egypt Abroad", "Egyptians Abroad in Support of Egypt" and "New United Arab States", who had their inception during the revolution inside the realms of Twitter and Facebook.&lt;ref name="Eltantawy 18"/&gt;

Journalism scholar [[Heather Ford]] studied the use of [[infoboxes]] and [[cleanup templates]] in the Wikipedia article regarding the revolution. Ford claims that infoboxes and cleanup tags were used as objects of "bespoken-code" by Wikipedia editors. By using these elements, editors shaped the news narrative in the first 18 days of the revolution. Ford used the discussion page and the history of edits to the page. She shows how political cartoons were removed, and how the number of casualties became a source of heated debate. Her research exemplifies how editors coordinated and prioritized work on the article, but also how political events are represented through collaborative journalism.&lt;ref&gt;'Ford, Heather.

=== Role of media disruption on 28 January 2011 ===
During the early morning hours of 28 January the Mubarak regime shut down internet and cell phone networks in the whole country. This media shutdown was likely one of the reasons why the numbers of protestors exploded on 28 January. 

While the regime disrupted the media, people needed to engage in face-to-face communication on a local level, which the regime could not monitor or control. In such a situation it is more likely that radicals will influence their neighbors, who are not able to see the public opinion displayed in social media, therefore these people are then more likely to also engage in civil unrest. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassanpour|first=Navid|date=2014|title=Media Disruption and Revolutionary Unrest:Evidence From Mubarak's Quasi-Experiment|url=|journal=Political Communication|volume=31|pages=1-24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vicious circle can be explained through a [[threshold model]] of collective behavior, which states that people are more likely to engage in risky actions if other people inside their networks (neighbors, friends, etc.) have taken action. Radicals have a small threshold and are more likely to form new networks during an information blackout, influencing the people.

Disrupting the media and communication had 2 main results: it increased the local mobilization of people and empowered radicals who influenced their surroundings, which resulted in an increase in protests. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassanpour|first=Navid|date=2014|title=Media Disruption and Revolutionary Unrest: Evidence From Mubarak’s Quasi-Experiment|url=|journal=Political Communication|volume=31|pages=5-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 28 January the increased local mobilization pushed a large amount of apolitical Egyptians into action, either to look after their friends and family in the absence of mobile communication or to complain about the shutdown, resulting in large protests not only in Cairo. Meanwhile the Mubarak regime was unable to communicate a possible threat to the protestors via social media and was therefore unable to dissuade the crowds through this mean, which spread the protests further.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Electron-hole.svg|thumb|When an electron leaves a [[helium]] atom, it leaves an electron hole in its place. This causes the helium atom to become positively charged.]]

In [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[electronic engineering]], an '''electron hole''' (often simply called a '''hole''') is the lack of an electron at a position where one could exist in an [[atom]] or [[crystal structure|atomic lattice]]. Since in a normal atom or crystal lattice the negative charge of the electrons is balanced by the positive charge of the [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], the absence of an electron leaves a net positive charge at the hole's location. Holes are not actually [[elementary particle|particles]], but rather [[quasiparticle]]s; they are different from the [[positron]], which is the [[antiparticle]] of the electron. (See also [[Dirac Sea]].) [[Werner Heisenberg]] developed the concept of a hole in 1931.

Holes in a metal&lt;ref name="ashcroftandmermin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|isbn=0030839939|pages=299–302|edition=1st|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[semiconductor]] [[crystal lattice]] can move through the lattice as electrons can, and act similarly to [[electric charge|positively-charged]] particles. They play an important role in the operation of [[semiconductor device]]s such as [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. If an electron is excited into a higher state it leaves a hole in its old state. This meaning is used in [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (and other [[x-ray]] techniques), in [[computational chemistry]], and to explain the low electron-electron scattering-rate in crystals ([[metal]]s, semiconductors).

In [[crystal]]s, [[electronic band structure]] calculations lead to an [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] for the electrons, which is typically negative at the top of a band. The [[negative mass]] is an unintuitive concept,&lt;ref&gt;For these negative mass electrons, [[crystal momentum|momentum]] is opposite to [[group velocity|velocity]], so forces acting on these electrons cause their velocity to change in the 'wrong' direction. As these electrons gain energy (moving towards the top of the band), they slow down.&lt;/ref&gt; and in these situations a more familiar picture is found by considering a positive charge with a positive mass.

== Solid-state physics ==

In [[solid-state physics]], an '''electron hole''' (usually referred to simply as a '''hole''') is the absence of an electron from a full [[valence band]]. A hole is essentially a way to conceptualize the interactions of the electrons within a nearly ''full'' valence band of a crystal lattice, which is ''missing'' just a few electrons. In some ways, the behavior of a hole within a semiconductor [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]] is comparable to that of the bubble in a full bottle of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weller|first=Paul F.|date=1967|title=An analogy for elementary band theory concepts in solids|journal=J. Chem. Educ.|volume=44|issue=7|pages=391|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed044p391|doi=10.1021/ed044p391|bibcode = 1967JChEd..44..391W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Simplified analogy: Empty seat in an auditorium ===
[[File:15-puzzle-02.jpg|thumb|A children's puzzle which illustrates the mobility of holes in an atomic lattice. The tiles are analogous to electrons, while the missing tile ''(lower right corner)'' is analogous to a hole.  Just as the position of the missing tile can be moved to different locations by moving the tiles, a hole in a crystal lattice can move to different positions in the lattice by the motion of the surrounding electrons.]]

Hole conduction in a [[valence band]] can be explained by the following analogy. Imagine a row of people seated in an auditorium, where there are no spare chairs. Someone in the middle of the row wants to leave, so he jumps over the back of the seat into an empty row, and walks out. The empty row is analogous to the [[conduction band]], and the person walking out is analogous to a free electron.

Now imagine someone else comes along and wants to sit down. The empty row has a poor view; so he does not want to sit there. Instead, a person in the crowded row moves into the empty seat the first person left behind. The empty seat moves one spot closer to the edge and the person waiting to sit down. The next person follows, and the next, et cetera. One could say that the empty seat moves towards the edge of the row. Once the empty seat reaches the edge, the new person can sit down.

In the process everyone in the row has moved along. If those people were negatively charged (like electrons), this movement would constitute [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]]. If the seats themselves were positively charged, then only the vacant seat would be positive. This is a very simple model of how hole conduction works.

Instead of analyzing the movement of an empty state in the valence band as the movement of many separate electrons, a single equivalent imaginary particle called a "hole" is considered. In an applied [[electric field]], the electrons move in one direction, corresponding to the hole moving in the other. If a hole associates itself with a neutral atom, that atom loses an electron and becomes positive. Therefore, the hole is taken to have positive [[electric charge|charge]] of +e, precisely the opposite of the electron charge.

In reality, due to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]], combined with the [[Bloch wave|energy levels available in the crystal]], the hole is not localizable to a single position as described in the previous example. Rather, the positive charge which represents the hole spans an area in the crystal lattice covering many hundreds of [[crystal structure|unit cells]]. This is equivalent to being unable to tell which broken bond corresponds to the "missing" electron.  Conduction band electrons are similarly delocalized.

=== Detailed picture: A hole is the absence of a negative-mass electron ===
[[File:BandDiagram-Semiconductors-E.PNG|thumb|right|A semiconductor [[electronic band structure]] (right) includes the dispersion relation of each band, i.e. the energy of an electron ''E'' as a function of the electron's [[Wave vector|wavevector]] ''k''. The "unfilled band" is the semiconductor's [[conduction band]]; it curves upward indicating positive [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]. The "filled band" is the semiconductor's [[valence band]]; it curves downward indicating negative effective mass.]]
The analogy above is quite simplified, and cannot explain why holes create an opposite effect to electrons in the [[Hall effect]] and [[Thermoelectric effect#Seebeck effect|Seebeck effect]]. A more precise and detailed explanation follows.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;Kittel, ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 8th edition, pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The [[dispersion relation]] determines how electrons respond to forces (via the concept of [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]).''&lt;ref name=Kittel /&gt;

A dispersion relation is the relationship between [[Wave vector|wavevector]] (k-vector) and energy in a band, part of the [[electronic band structure]]. In quantum mechanics, the electrons are waves, and energy is the wave frequency. A localized electron is a [[Wave packet|wavepacket]], and the motion of an electron is given by the formula for the [[group velocity|group velocity of a wave]]. An electric field affects an electron by gradually shifting all the wavevectors in the wavepacket, and the electron moves because its wave group velocity changes. Therefore, again, the way an electron responds to forces is entirely determined by its dispersion relation. An electron floating in space has the dispersion relation ''E''=ℏ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2''m''), where ''m'' is the (real) [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]] and ℏ is [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]. Near the bottom of the [[conduction band]] of a semiconductor, the dispersion relation is instead ''E''=ℏ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) (''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''[[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]''), so a conduction-band electron responds to forces ''as if'' it had the mass ''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

* ''Electrons near the top of the [[valence band]] behave as if they have [[negative mass]].''&lt;ref name=Kittel /&gt;

The dispersion relation near the top of the valence band is ''E''=ℏ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) with ''negative'' effective mass. So electrons near the top of the valence band behave like they have [[negative mass]]. When a force pulls the electrons to the right, these electrons actually move left. This is solely due to the shape of the valence band, and is unrelated to whether the band is full or empty. If you could somehow empty out the valence band and just put one electron near the valence band maximum (an unstable situation), this electron would move the "wrong way" in response to forces.

* ''Positively-charged holes as a shortcut for calculating the total current of an almost-full band.''&lt;ref name=Kittel /&gt;

A perfectly full band always has zero current. One way to think about this fact is that the electron states near the top of the band have negative effective mass, and those near the bottom of the band have positive effective mass, so the net motion is exactly zero. If an otherwise-almost-full valence band has a state ''without'' an electron in it, we say that this state is occupied by a hole. There is a mathematical shortcut for calculating the current due to every electron in the whole valence band: Start with zero current (the total if the band were full), and ''subtract'' the current due to the electrons that ''would'' be in each hole state if it wasn't a hole. Since ''subtracting'' the current caused by a ''negative'' charge in motion is the same as ''adding'' the current caused by a ''positive'' charge moving on the same path, the mathematical shortcut is to pretend that each hole state is carrying a positive charge, while ignoring every other electron state in the valence band.

* ''A hole near the top of the valence band moves the same way as an electron near the top of the valence band '''would''' move''&lt;ref name=Kittel /&gt; (which is in the opposite direction compared to conduction-band electrons experiencing the same force.)

This fact follows from the discussion and definition above. This is an example where the auditorium analogy above is misleading. When a person moves left in a full auditorium, an empty seat moves right. But in this section we are imagining how electrons move through k-space, not real space, and the effect of a force is to move all the electrons through k-space in the same direction at the same time. In this context, a better analogy is a bubble underwater in a river: The bubble moves the same direction as the water, not opposite.

Since force = mass × acceleration, a negative-effective-mass electron near the top of the valence band would move the opposite direction as a positive-effective-mass electron near the bottom of the conduction band, in response to a given electric or magnetic force. Therefore, a hole moves this way as well.

* ''Conclusion: Hole is a positive-charge, positive-mass [[quasiparticle]]''.

From the above, a hole (1) carries a positive charge, and (2) responds to electric and magnetic fields as if it had a positive charge and positive mass. (The latter is because a particle with positive charge and positive mass responds to electric and magnetic fields in the same way as a particle with negative charge and negative mass.) That explains why holes can be treated in all situations as ordinary positively charged [[quasiparticles]].

=== Role in semiconductor technology ===

In some semiconductors, such as silicon, the hole's effective mass is dependent on direction ([[Anisotropy|anisotropic]]), however a value averaged over all directions can be used for some macroscopic calculations.

In most semiconductors, the effective mass of a hole is much larger than that of an [[electron]]. This results in lower [[Electron mobility|mobility]] for holes under the influence of an [[electric field]] and this may slow down the speed of the electronic device made of that semiconductor. This is one major reason for adopting electrons as the primary charge carriers, whenever possible in semiconductor devices, rather than holes. Also, why [[NMOS logic]] is faster than [[PMOS logic]].

However, in many semiconductor devices, both electrons ''and'' holes play an essential role. Examples include [[p–n diode]]s, [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistors]], and [[CMOS logic]].

== Holes in quantum chemistry ==
An alternate meaning for the term '''electron hole''' is used in [[computational chemistry]]. In [[coupled cluster]] methods, the ground (or lowest energy) state of a molecule is interpreted as the "vacuum state"—conceptually, in this state there are no electrons. In this scheme, the absence of an electron from a normally filled state is called a "hole" and is treated as a particle, and the presence of an electron in a normally empty state is simply called an "electron". This terminology is almost identical to that used in solid-state physics.

'''Emma Livry''' (born as '''Jeanne Emma Emarot''' or '''Emma Marie Emarot'''; 24 September 1842 &amp;ndash; 26 July 1863) was one of the last [[ballerina]]s of the [[Romantic ballet]] era and a protégée of [[Marie Taglioni]]. She died from complications after burn injuries sustained when her costume caught fire during a rehearsal.

==Biography==
Livry was the illegitimate daughter of Célestine Emarot, a ballet dancer, and Baron [[Charles de Chassiron]], which prompted the following rhyming verse:

:Can so skinny a ''[[Corps de ballet|rat]]'' 
:Be the daughter of so round a cat?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ballet Annual &amp; Year Book|first=Ivor|last=Guest|page=55|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
She studied dancing under Madame Dominique and attended the Paris Opera School. Her career was promoted by her mother's lover at the time, Vicomte Ferdinand de Montguyon. On 19 October 1858,&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; at the age of sixteen, she made her debut with the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] at the [[Salle Le Peletier]] as the [[sylph]] in ''[[La Sylphide]]''. Her talent brought her fame and she became a widely respected ballerina.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;

Montguyon prevailed upon the director of the Opera to change the programme so that [[Marie Taglioni]] (who originated the role) would see Livry in ''La Sylphide'' when she visited. Taglioni decided to stay on in Paris to teach the girl, who reminded her of herself as a young woman. She choreographed for Livry the title-role of Farfalla (Butterfly) in ''[[Le Papillon (ballet)|Le Papillon]]'', the only full-length ballet composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]]. The sculptor [[Jean-Auguste Barre]] created a figurine of Livry in this role in bronze and [[Bisque (pottery)|bisque]] versions.

Paul Smith wrote in ''[[:fr:Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'':{{cquote|She was so ethereal, and diaphanous, an intangible artist imperative, an artist with ''ballon'' .... Mlle. Livry had a ''[[ballon (ballet)|ballon]]'' which has never been equalled – she bounds and leaps as no one else could do. She skims over the ground, the water and the flowers, apparently without touching them. Shims like feather and falls like a snowflake.}}

===Accidental death===
On 15 November 1862, Livry was rehearsing the title role of Fenella, a [[mime]] part and the title role in [[Daniel Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La muette de Portici]]''. Making her second-act entrance, she shook out her skirts, which caught fire on a gaslight. The accident was avoidable: a method of fire-proofing costumes was available in this period, but Livry and most female performers of the period were opposed to it because it discolored and stiffened fabrics.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;Roger L. Williams, ''Gaslight and Shadow: The World of Napoleon III'' (NY: Macmillan, 1957), 106. Fire-proofing was required by an imperial decree of 27 November 1859. In 1860 a dancer's costume had caught fire during rehearsals for Offenbach's ''Le Papillon'' which starred Livry.&lt;/ref&gt;

In flames, she ran across the stage three times before she was caught and the fire extinguished with the help of firemen and other dancers. Her burns were more extensive than deep. She had clasped the burning fabric to her torso out of modesty. Her face and breasts were undamaged. According to the doctor in attendance, her thighs, waist, back, shoulders and arms were burned, and her stays were burned on. She tried to pray. Taglioni, who was watching the rehearsal, rubbed make-up grease into her wounds in the mistaken belief that it would act as ointment. She suffered for months, yet remained opposed to fire-proofed skirts: "Yes, they are, as you say, less dangerous, but should I ever return to the stage, I would never think of wearing them – they are so ugly."&lt;ref name="ivorguest"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ballet Annual &amp; Year Book|first=Ivor|last=Guest|page=59|isbn=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, she was moved from her home in Paris to Neuilly-sur-Seine. 
However, her wounds re-opened and she succumbed to [[sepsis|septicæmia]]. Montguyon was with her when she died. She was only 20 years old. After a funeral at Notre Dame de Lorette in Paris, she was buried in the [[Montmartre Cemetery|Cimetière de Montmartre]]. The surviving scraps of her costume can be seen in the [[Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra National de Paris|Musée de l'Opéra]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="ivorguest"/&gt;

'''''Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''''' is a 2007 book written by [[Aubrey de Grey]], a biomedical gerontologist, with his research assistant Michael Rae. ''Ending Aging'' describes de Grey's proposal for eliminating aging as a cause of debilitation and death in humans, and restoring the body to an [[Indefinite lifespan|indefinitely]] youthful state, a project plan that he calls the "[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]]", or "SENS". De Grey argues that defeating aging is feasible, possibly within a few decades, and he outlines steps that can be taken to hasten the development of  [[regenerative medicine]] treatments that will save lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10941">An '''equivalence group''' is a set of unspecified cells that have the same developmental potential or ability to adopt various [[Cell fate determination|fates]]. Our{{Who|date=October 2012}} current understanding suggests that equivalence groups are limited to cells of the same ancestry, also known as sibling cells.&lt;ref name=satoh89&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishida and Satoh|title=Determination and regulation in the pigment cell lineage of the ascidian embryo|journal=Dev Biol|volume=132|issue=2 |pages=355–67|year=1989 |pmid=2494088 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(89)90232-7 |last2=Satoh |first2=N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, cells of an equivalence group adopt different fates from one another.&lt;ref name=greenwald&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwald and Rubin|title=Making a difference: the role of cell-cell interactions in establishing separate identities for equivalent cells|journal=Cell|volume=68|issue=2|pages=271–81|year=1992|pmid=1365402 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90470-W |last2=Rubin |first2=GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalence groups assume various potential fates in two general, non-mutually exclusive ways.  One mechanism, induction, occurs when a signal originating from outside of the equivalence group specifies a subset of the naïve cells.&lt;ref name=greenwald /&gt;  Another mode, known as [[lateral inhibition]], arises when a signal within an equivalence group causes one cell to adopt a dominant fate while others in the group are inhibited from doing so.&lt;ref name=Nishida97&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishida|title=Notch homologue from Halocynthia roretzi is preferentially expressed in the central nervous system during ascidian embryogenesis|journal=Dev Genes Evol|volume=207|pages=371–380|year=1997|doi=10.1007/s004270050126 |last2=Saitoh |first2=Takashi |last3=Matsumoto |first3=Midori |last4=Makabe |first4=Kazuhiro W. |last5=Nishida |first5=H. |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many examples of equivalence groups, both induction and lateral inhibition are used to define patterns of distinct cell types.  

Cells of an equivalence group that do not receive a signal adopt a default fate.  Alternatively, cells that receive a signal take on different fates.&lt;ref name=greenwald /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang and Weisblat|title=Cell fate determination in an annelid equivalence group|journal=Development|volume=122|issue=6|pages=1839–47|year=1996|pmid=8674423 |last2=Weisblat |first2=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a certain point, the fates of cells within an equivalence group become irreversibly determined, thus they lose their [[multipotent]] potential.  The following provides examples of equivalence groups studied in [[nematodes]] and [[ascidians]].

==Vulva Precursor Cell Equivalence Group==

An inductive signal from the anchor cell via LIN-3 determines P6.p to adopt the 1°. Then, the lateral signal LIN-12 causes P5.p and P5.7 to become 2°. The other VPCs do not receive an inductive signal and are fated as 3°. Anterior is to the left.]]

===Introduction===
A classic example of an equivalence group is the vulva precursor cells (VPCs) of nematodes.  In ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' self-fertilized eggs exit the body through the [[vulva]].  This organ develops from a subset of cell of an equivalence group consisting of six VPCs, P3.p-P8.p, which lie ventrally along the anterior-posterior axis.&lt;ref name=Kornfeld&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kornfeld|title=Vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans|journal=Trends Genet|volume=13|issue=2 |pages=55–61|year=1997|pmid=9055606 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(97)01005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example a single overlying somatic cells, the anchor cell, induces nearby VPCs to take on vulva fates 1° (P6.p) and 2° (P5.p and P7.p).  VPCs that are not induced form the 3° lineage (P3.p, P4.p and P8.p), which make epidermal cells that fuse to a large syncytial epidermis (see image).&lt;ref name=Sternberg86&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternberg and Horvitz|title=Pattern formation during vulval development in C. elegans|journal=Cell|volume=44|issue=5 |pages=761–72|year=1986|pmid=3753901 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(86)90842-1 |last2=Horvitz |first2=HR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six VPCs form an equivalence group because all of the six cells are competent to take on any of the available fates (1°, 2°, and 3°) dependent on their proximity to the anchor cell.  Ablation experiments indicate that all VPCs are able to adopt vulva fates.  For example, if the P6.p cell that normally becomes 1° is ablated then the VPC closest to the anchor cell, either P5.p or P7.p, assumes the 1° fate.  Furthermore, if all VPCs are destroyed except the most anterior P3.p cell then the anchor cell designates this cell the 1° fate.  However, if the anchor cell is killed, in the absence of an inductive signal, then all of the VPCs assume the default 3° lineage.&lt;ref name=wormbook&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternberg|title=Vulva Development|journal=Sternberg|volume=25|pages=1–28|year=2005|pmid=18050418|doi=10.1895/wormbook.1.6.1|pmc=4781130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular Mechanism===
The anchor cell directly induces the vulva fates by secreting the [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF)-like ligand LIN-3.  The P6.p cell receives the LIN-3 signal via the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] LET-23 (P5.p and P7.p also receive LIN-3 but to a lesser extent).  Activation of LET-23 in P6.p results in the activation of LIN-12 ([[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]]) in P5.p and P7.p.  Experimental evidence shows that LIN-12 is necessary and sufficient for the formation of the 2° fate.  Through lateral inhibition LIN-12 prevents the P5.p and P7.p cells from adopting the 1° lineage.&lt;ref name=wormbook /&gt;  Thus, in this example both inductive EGF signaling and lateral Notch activation patterns the VPC equivalence group.

==Ascidian Pigment Precursor Equivalence Group==

[[Image:Otolith Ocellus.png|thumb|400px|alt=Otolith and Ocellus|Two bilateral pigment precursor cells form an equivalence group that eventually interacts to seal mutually exclusive fates (otolith and ocellus). Shown is a timeline of the developing Halocythia roretzi embryo (anterior is to the left). Pigment precursor cells (gray circles) remain equivalent until they align after neurulation. At 21 hours post fertilization the ocellus (white circle) and otolith (black circle) are determined.]]

===Introduction===
The larvae of ascidians (sea squirts) contain a pair of sensory [[melanocyte|pigment cells]] known as the [[otolith]] and [[ocellus]].  The otolith is used to sense gravity, whereas the ocellus responds to light.  During embryogenesis the otolith and ocellus develop from two bilateral equivalent precursors.  Either the left or right pigment precursor cell has equal probability of developing into the otolith or ocellus.  The decision to adopt either fate is determined after neural tube closure during the early tailbud stage (see image), via a poorly defined mechanism of induction.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt;  

During normal development, after [[neural tube]] closure, the pigment precursors align dorsally along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube.  Whichever cell aligns anteriorly will become the otolith, while the posterior cell will form the ocellus.  In the absence of cell-cell interactions both cells develop into ocelli, which is the default fate.&lt;ref name=Nishida97 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Akanuma&gt;{{cite journal |author=Akanuma|title=Notch signaling is involved in nervous system formation in ascidian embryos|journal=Development Genes and Evolution|volume=212|issue=10|pages=459–72|year=2002|pmid=12424517|doi=10.1007/s00427-002-0264-x |display-authors=1 |last2=Hori |first2=Sawako |last3=Darras |first3=S&amp;#x000E9;Bastien |last4=Nishida |first4=Hiroki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental Methods for Studying Equivalence in ''Halocynthia roretzi''===
To elucidate whether the fates of the otolith and ocellus are determined in the early embryo or after the precursors align during neural tube closure, ablation and drug treatment techniques were used in the ascidian species ''[[Sea pineapple|Halocythia roretzi]]''. 

Cells that are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FDX) can be selectively photoablated by fluorescent excitation.&lt;ref name=Shankland&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shankland and Weisblat|title=Stepwise commitment of blast cell fates during the positional specification of the O and P cell lines in the leech embryo|journal=Dev Biol|volume=106|issue=2|pages=326–42|year=1984|pmid=6500176 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(84)90231-8 |last2=Weisblat |first2=DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When one FDX labeled pigment precursor cells is photoablated during the mid-neurula stage (15 hrs) the other will almost always develop into an ocellus.  However, if the ablations are performed during the late tailbud stage (22.5 hrs) then the remaining cell has an equal likelihood of becoming an otolith or ocellus.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt; 

Inhibiting cell division and [[morphogenesis]] with [[cytochalasin B]] is another method used to determine when the pigment precursor equivalence group is specified.  Cytochalasin treatment of early tailbud stage embryos (17 hrs), while the two bilateral cells are still separated, results in both cells becoming ocelli.  When the drug was used after the two cells aligned at the dorsal midline, the anterior cell developed into the otolith and the posterior cell became the ocellus without exception.&lt;ref name=satoh89 /&gt;  Both experiments suggest that fates of the pigment precursor cells are irreversibly determined by approximately the mid-tailbud stage (21 hrs).

==Other Equivalence Groups==

Equivalence groups have also been described in the [[ganglion]] mother cells in grasshopper and the O/P [[teloblasts]] in the [[leech]].&lt;ref name="Kuwada and Goodman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuwada and Goodman|title=Neuronal determination during embryonic development of the grasshopper nervous system|journal=Dev Biol|volume=110|issue=1|pages=114–26|year=1985|pmid=4007260 |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(85)90069-7 |last2=Goodman |first2=CS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuo and Shankland|title=Evolutionary diversification of specification mechanisms within the O/P equivalence group of the leech genus Helobdella|journal=Development|volume=131|issue=23|pages=5859–69|year=2004|pmid=15525668|doi=10.1242/dev.01452 |last2=Shankland |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other instances of equivalence groups, progeny cells are born equivalent and become specified through cell interactions.  Equivalence groups are a common theme in the development of many organisms from diverse [[Phylum|phyla]].

The concept predates this coinage, with [[Plato]] suggesting applying the principles of [[selective breeding]] to humans around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE.

[[Frederick Osborn]]'s 1937 journal article "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy"&lt;ref name="Osborn1937"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osborn |first=Frederick |author-link=Frederick Osborn |title=Development of a Eugenic Philosophy|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=2|issue=3 |pages=389–397|date=June 1937|doi=10.2307/2084871|jstor=2084871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; framed it as a [[social philosophy]]—that is, a philosophy with implications for [[social order]]. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of [[sexual reproduction]] among people with desired traits (positive eugenics), or reduced rates of sexual reproduction and [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people with less-desired or undesired traits (negative eugenics).

Alternatively, gene selection rather than "people selection" has recently been made possible through advances in [[genome editing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/feature-articles/crispr-cas9-and-targeted-genome-editing-a-new-era-in-molecular-biology |title=CRISPR/Cas9 and Targeted Genome Editing: A New Era in Molecular Biology |date=2014 |access-date=8 July 2015 |work=NEB Expressions |issue=I |first1=Alex |last1=Reis |first2=Breton |last2=Hornblower |first3=Brett |last3=Robb |first4=George |last4=Tzertzinis |publisher=New England Biolabs}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is sometimes called [[new eugenics]], also known as neo-eugenics, consumer eugenics, or liberal eugenics.

While eugenic principles have been practiced as far back in world history as [[ancient Greece]], the modern [[history of eugenics]] began in the early 20th century when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=25054146 |title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests and Policy Variance Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and U.S |date=1 January 2001 |journal=World Politics |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–263|last1=Hansen |first1=Randall |last2=King |first2=Desmond }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread to many countries including the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oBYvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6315,1778929 |title=Sterilization of Unfit Advocated – Feeble-minded Increasing at Disproportionate Rate in Canada – Case for Ungenics |work=The Montreal Gazette |volume=CLXII |issue=272 |date=14 November 1933 |via=News.Google.com |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[Europe]]an countries. In this period, eugenic ideas were espoused across the political spectrum. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies with the intent to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both "positive" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly "fit" to reproduce, and "negative" measures such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. People deemed unfit to reproduce often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges of different [[IQ]] tests, criminals and deviants, and members of disfavored minority groups. The eugenics movement became negatively associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]] when many of the [[defendants]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] attempted to justify their human rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States|U.S. eugenics]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |first1=Alison |last1=Bashford |first2=Philippa |last2=Levine |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials#v=onepage&amp;q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&amp;f=false |page=327|isbn=9780199706532 |date=2010-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades following [[World War II]], with the institution of [[human rights]], many countries gradually began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries, among them the United States and [[Sweden]], continued to carry out forced sterilizations.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, when new [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures became available such as [[gestational surrogacy]] (available since 1985), [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (available since 1989), and [[cytoplasmic transfer]] (first performed in 1996), fear has emerged about a possible revival of eugenics.

A major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether "negative" or "positive" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of [[genetic diversity]], resulting in [[inbreeding depression]] due to lower genetic variation.

{{Main article|History of eugenics}}
===Origin and development===

The concept of positive eugenics to produce better human beings has existed at least since [[Plato]] suggested [[Selective breeding|selective mating]] to produce a guardian class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eugenics/ |title=Eugenics |date=2 July 2014 |access-date=2 January 2015 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sparta]], every Spartan child was inspected by the council of elders, the [[Gerousia]], which determined if the child was fit to live or not. In the early years of [[ancient Rome]], a Roman father was [[Twelve Tables|obliged by law]] to immediately kill his child if they were [[Physical disability|physically disabled]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/12tables.html The Laws of the Twelve Tables, c.450 B.C.] "A dreadfully deformed child shall be quickly killed"
&lt;/ref&gt; Among the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, people who were cowardly, unwarlike or "stained with abominable [[vices]]" were put to death, usually by being drowned in swamps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]]. [[wikisource:Germania (Church &amp; Brodribb)#XII|Germania.XII]] "Traitors and deserters are hanged on trees; the coward, the unwarlike, the man stained with abominable vices, is plunged into the mire of the morass, with a hurdle put over him."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Karin |date=2009 |title=Bodies in the Bog and the Archaeological Imagination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FU4H-JKPbhkC&amp;pg=PA62 |location= |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=62 |isbn=0226734048 |author-link= |quote=Tacitus's Germania, read through this kind of filter, became a manual for racial and sexual eugenics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first formal negative eugenics, that is a legal provision against the birth of allegedly inferior human beings, was promulgated in Western European culture by the Christian [[Council of Agde]] in 506, which forbade marriage between cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Frances (2010) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5pXmkCf3LEIC&amp;pg=PR2-IA10&amp;dq=Eugenics+506+Agde&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX2pys46rYAhUhJsAKHXXKAeMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eugenics%20506%20Agde&amp;f=false''Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages''] New York: Harper Collins. p.ii {{isbn|9780062016737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Francis Galton]] was an early eugenicist, coining the term itself and popularizing the collocation of the words "[[nature and nurture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Francis |last=Galton |date=1874 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On men of science, their nature and their nurture |work=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain |volume=7 |pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The idea of a modern project of improving the human population through a statistical understanding of [[heredity]] used to encourage good breeding was originally developed by [[Francis Galton]] and, initially, was closely linked to Darwinism and his theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 309"&gt;Bowler, Peter J., ''Evolution: The History of an Idea,'' 3rd Ed., University of California Press, 2003, pp. 308–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Galton had read his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], which sought to explain the development of plant and animal species, and desired to apply it to humans. Based on his biographical studies, Galton believed that desirable human qualities were hereditary traits, though Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory.&lt;ref name="credoreference.com"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Eugenics |first=Randall |last=Hansen |title=Eugenics: Immigration and Asylum from 1990 to Present |editor-first1=Matthew J. |editor-last1=Gibney |editor-first2=Randall |editor-last2=Hansen |date=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/abcmigrate/eugenics |access-date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, one year after Darwin's death, Galton gave his research a name: ''eugenics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA: The Secret of Life |first1=Watson |last1=James D. |last2=Berry |first2=Andrew |date=2009 |publisher=Knopf |url= https://www.amazon.com/DNA-The-Secret-Life-ebook/dp/B001PSEQAG}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[genetics]], eugenics became associated with [[genetic determinism]], the belief that human character is entirely or in the majority caused by genes, unaffected by education or living conditions. Many of the early geneticists were not Darwinians, and evolution theory was not needed for eugenics policies based on genetic determinism.&lt;ref name="Bowler 309" /&gt; Throughout its recent history, eugenics has remained controversial.{{sfn|Blom|2008|p = 336}}

Eugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities and received funding from many sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Garland E. |title=Was Nazi eugenics created in the US? |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=451–452 |date=2004 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400158 |pmc=1299061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations were formed to win public support and sway opinion towards responsible eugenic values in parenthood, including the British [[Galton Institute|Eugenics Education Society]] of 1907 and the [[Society for Biodemography and Social Biology|American Eugenics Society]] of 1921.

Three [[International Eugenics Conference]]s presented a global venue for eugenists with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York City.

In addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=240}} Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=286}} the Cold Spring Harbour Carnegie Institution for [[Experimental Evolution]],{{sfn|Black|2003|p=40}} and the [[Eugenics Record Office]].{{sfn|Black|2003|p=45}} Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 6: The United States of Sterilization}} In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness.{{sfn|Black|2003|p=237}} Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure "[[Nordic race]]" or "[[Aryan]]" genetic pool and the eventual elimination of "unfit" races.{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 5: Legitimizing Raceology}}{{sfn|Black|2003|loc=Chapter 9: Mongrelization}}

Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joan |last=Ferrante |title=Sociology: A Global Perspective |url= https://books.google.com/?id=AwnIIXI6y38C&amp;pg=PA259 |date=1 January 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-8400-3204-1 |pages=259 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]], the German-American anthropologist [[Franz Boas]], who argued that advocates of eugenics greatly over-estimate the influence of biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turda |first=Marius |chapter=Race, Science and Eugenics in the Twentieth Century |editor1-last=Bashford |editor1-first=Alison |editor2-last=Levine |editor2-first=Philippa |title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |isbn=0-19-988829-9 |pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author [[Halliday Sutherland]]. Ward's 1913 article "[https://archive.org/details/jstor-2763324 Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics]", Chesterton's 1917 book ''[[s:Eugenics and other Evils|Eugenics and Other Evils]]'', and Boas' 1916 article "[[s:Eugenics|Eugenics]]" (published in ''[[The Scientific Monthly]]'') were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement. Sutherland identified eugenists as a major obstacle to the eradication and cure of tuberculosis in his 1917 address "Consumption: Its Cause and Cure",&lt;ref&gt;"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure" An Address by Dr Halliday Sutherland on 4 September 1917, published by the Red Triangle Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticism of eugenists and Neo-[[Malthusianism|Malthusian]]s in his 1921 book ''Birth Control'' led to a writ for libel from the eugenist [[Marie Stopes]]. Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including [[Lancelot Hogben]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lancelot Hogben, who developed his critique of eugenics and distaste for racism in the period...he spent as Professor of Zoology at the University of Cape Town".  Alison Bashford and Philippa Levine, ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics''. Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|0199706530}} (p.200)&lt;/ref&gt; Other biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Ronald Fisher|R. A. Fisher]] expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of "defectives" would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.&lt;ref&gt;"Whatever their disagreement on the numbers, Haldane, Fisher, and most geneticists could support Jennings's warning: To encourage the expectation that the sterilization of defectives will "solve the problem of hereditary defects, close up the asylums for feebleminded and insane, do away with prisons, is only to subject society to deception".

Among institutions, the [[Catholic Church]] was an opponent of state-enforced sterilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Congar |first=Yves M.-J. |date=1953 |title=The Catholic Church and the Race Question |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0000/000028/002893eo.pdf |format=pdf |location=Paris, France |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=3 July 2015 |quote=4.

As a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals.

{{Main article|Nazi eugenics}}

The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when [[Ernst Rüdin]] used eugenics as a justification for the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies of Nazi Germany]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of "defectives" that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power.{{sfn|Black|2003|pp=274–295}} Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, [[promiscuous women]], homosexuals, and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial groups]] (such as the [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Jews in Nazi Germany]]) as "degenerate" or "unfit", and therefore led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, [[euthanasia]], and even [[mass murder]].{{sfn|Black|2003}} The Nazi practice of euthanasia was carried out on hospital patients in the [[Aktion T4]] centers such as [[Hartheim Castle]].

By the end of [[World War II]], many discriminatory eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Black|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. p. 18 "By the middle decades of the twentieth century, eugenics had become widely accepted throughout the whole of the economically developed world, with the exception of the [[Soviet Union]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. G. Wells]], who had called for "the sterilization of failures" in 1904,&lt;ref name="jt"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacky |last=Turner |title=Animal Breeding, Welfare and Society |publisher=Routledge |date=2010 |isbn=1844075893 |page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in his 1940 book ''The Rights of Man: Or What are we fighting for?'' that among the [[human rights]], which he believed should be available to all people, was "a prohibition on [[mutilation]], sterilization, [[torture]], and any bodily punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Clapham |title=Human Rights: A Very Short Introduction' |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2007 |isbn=9780199205523 |pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the practice of "imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with [[Genocide#Genocide as a crime|the intent to destroy, in whole or in part]], a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such as:
* Killing members of the group;
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
See the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] also proclaims "the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union |title=Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union |at=Article 3, Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the decline in discriminatory eugenics laws, some government mandated sterilizations continued into the 21st century. During the ten years President [[Alberto Fujimori]] led Peru from 1990 to 2000, 2,000 persons were allegedly involuntarily sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/25/world/americas/peru-sterilization/ |title= Peru will not prosecute former President over sterilization campaign |first1=Pierre |last1= Meilhan |first2=Ben |last2= Brumfield |lastauthoramp=yes|date=January 25, 2014 |website= CNN.com |publisher= [[CNN]] |access-date= 19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]] maintained its [[one-child policy]] until 2015 as well as a suite of other eugenics based legislation to reduce population size and manage fertility rates of different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dikötter |first=F. |date=1998 |title=Imperfect Conceptions: Medical Knowledge, Birth Defects, and Eugenics in China |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Edge |first=Geoffrey |last=Miller |title=2013: What {{em|Should}} We Be Worried About?

===Modern resurgence of interest===
Developments in [[Genetic engineering|genetic]], [[Genetic testing|genomic]], and [[Human cloning|reproductive technologies]] at the end of the 20th century have raised numerous questions regarding the ethical status of eugenics, effectively creating a [[History of eugenics#Modern eugenics, genetic engineering, and ethical re-evaluation|resurgence of interest]] in the subject.
Some, such as [[UC Berkeley]] sociologist [[Troy Duster]], claim that modern genetics is a back door to eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Charles J. |title=Is modern genetics the new eugenics? |journal=Genetics in Medicine |date=1 November 2003 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=469–475 |doi=10.1097/01.GIM.0000093978.77435.17 |url= http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v5/n6/full/gim2003376a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is shared by White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, [[Tania Simoncelli]], who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at [[Hampshire College]] that advances in [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) are moving society to a "new era of eugenics", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, "where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tania |last=Simoncelli |author-link=Tania Simoncelli |title=Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis and Selection: From disease prevention to customised conception |journal=Different Takes |volume=24 |date=2003 |url=http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=18 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018034037/http://genetics.live.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/200303_difftakes_simoncelli.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 newspaper article, [[Richard Dawkins]] said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From the Afterward |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |author-link=Richard Dawkins |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=2006 |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/from-the-afterword-1.836155 |access-date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the [[Founding Father]] of [[Singapore]], started promoting eugenics as early as 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blynkt.com/issue-1/eugenics-in-postcolonial-singapore |title=Eugenics in Postcolonial Singapore |first=Ying-kit |last=Chan |date=4 October 2016 |website=Blynkt.com |location=Berlin |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mustsharenews.com/lee-kuan-yew-controversies/ |title=13 Controversies of Lee Kuan Yew |date=10 March 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no specific by-line.--&gt; |website=MustShareNews.com |location=Singapore |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the United Nations' [[International Bioethics Committee]] wrote that the ethical problems of [[human genetic engineering]] should not be confused with the ethical problems of the [[History of eugenics|20th century eugenics movements]]. However, it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want, or cannot afford, the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=International Bioethics Committee |title=Report of the IBC on Updating Its Reflection on the Human Genome and Human Rights |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233258E.pdf |date=2 October 2015 |access-date=22 October 2015 |page=27 |quote=The goal of enhancing individuals and the human species by engineering the genes related to some characteristics and traits is not to be confused with the barbarous projects of eugenics that planned the simple elimination of human beings considered as ‘imperfect’ on an ideological basis. However, it impinges upon the principle of respect for human dignity in several ways. It weakens the idea that the differences among human beings, regardless of the measure of their endowment, are exactly what the recognition of their equality presupposes and therefore protects. It introduces the risk of new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who cannot afford such enhancement or simply do not want to resort to it. The arguments that have been produced in favour of the so-called liberal eugenics do not trump the indication to apply the limit of medical reasons also in this case.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanism]] is often associated with eugenics, although most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term "eugenics" (preferring "[[germinal choice]]" or "[[reprogenetics]]")&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silver |first=Lee M. |author-link=Lee M. Silver |title=Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=1998 |isbn=0-380-79243-5 |oclc=40094564}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.

[[Prenatal diagnosis|Prenatal screening]] can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics because it may lead to abortions of children with undesirable traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Gareth M. |last2=Rothman |first2=Barbara Katz |date=April 2016 |title=Keeping the Backdoor to Eugenics Ajar?: Disability and the Future of Prenatal Screening |url= http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2016/04/stas1-1604.html|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |publisher=American Medical Association |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=406–415 |doi= 10.1001/journalofethics.2016.18.4.stas1-1604|access-date=2 September 2016 |quote=We argue that prenatal screening (and specifically NIPT) for Down syndrome can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics, in that it effaces, devalues, and possibly prevents the births of people with the condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meanings and types==
[[File:Karl Pearson, 1912.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Pearson]] (1912)]]
The term eugenics and its modern field of study were first formulated by [[Francis Galton]] in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galton |first=Francis |author-link=Francis Galton |title=Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |date=1883 |location=London |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on the recent work of his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm |title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin |publisher=Galton.org |access-date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-17 |work=Darwin Correspondence Project |title=The Correspondence of Charles Darwin |volume=Volume 17: 1869 |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=28 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124215918/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-17 |archivedate=24 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton published his observations and conclusions in his book ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''.

The origins of the concept began with certain interpretations of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and the theories of [[August Weismann]].{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=335–336}} The word ''eugenics'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''eu'' ("good" or "well") and the suffix ''-genēs'' ("born"), and was coined by Galton in 1883 to replace the word "[[Oneida stirpiculture|stirpiculture]]", which he had used previously but which had come to be mocked due to its perceived sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lester Frank |last1=Ward |first2=Emily |last2=Palmer Cape |first3=Sarah Emma |last3=Simons |title=Glimpses of the Cosmos |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KDEZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 |access-date=11 April 2012 |date=1918 |publisher=G. P. Putnam's sons |pages=382 ''ff.'' |chapter=Eugenics, Euthenics and Eudemics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton defined eugenics as "the study of all agencies under human control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvnb|Black|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term eugenics has referred to everything from [[prenatal care]] for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Spektorowski"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spektorowski |first1=Alberto |last2=Ireni-Saban |first2=Liza |title=Politics of Eugenics: Productionism, Population, and National Welfare |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-203-74023-1 |page=24 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zdkdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Historically,+the+term+has+referred+to+everything+from+prenatal+care+for+mothers+to+forced+sterilization+and+euthanasia#v=onepage&amp;q=Historically%2C%20the%20term%20has%20referred%20to%20everything%20from%20prenatal%20care%20for%20mothers%20to%20forced%20sterilization%20and%20euthanasia&amp;f=false |access-date=16 January 2017 |quote=As an applied science, thus, the practice of eugenics referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia.  Galton divided the practice of eugenics into two types—positive and negative—both aimed at improving the human race through selective breeding.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Population genetics|population geneticists]], the term has included the avoidance of [[inbreeding]] without altering [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]]; for example, [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote that "the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J. |title=Lysenko and Genetics |journal=Science and Society |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=1940 |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/haldane/works/1940s/lysenko.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate as to what exactly counts as eugenics continues today.&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of the shifting meanings of the term can be found in {{cite book |last=Paul |first=Diane |title=Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the Present |publisher=Humanities Press |location=New Jersey |date=1995 |isbn=1-57392-343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Black]], journalist and author of ''War Against the Weak'', claims eugenics is often deemed a [[pseudoscience]] because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is often deemed a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=978-1-56858-321-1 |page=370 |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=War Against the Weak |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of "improvement" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect. Historically, this aspect of eugenics was tainted with [[scientific racism]] and pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |isbn=978-1-56858-321-1 |page=370 |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=War Against the Weak |date=2004

Early eugenists were mostly concerned with factors of perceived [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] that often correlated strongly with social class. Some of these early eugenists include [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Weldon]], who worked on this at the [[University College London]].&lt;ref name="credoreference.com"/&gt;

Eugenics also had a place in medicine. In his lecture "Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics", Karl Pearson said that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. He basically placed the two words as equivalents. He was supported in part by the fact that Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, also had medical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salgirli |first=S. G. |title=Eugenics for the doctors: Medicine and social control in 1930s Turkey |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=281–312 |date=July 2011 |pmid=20562206 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrq040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories.&lt;ref name="Spektorowski"/&gt; Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, ''in vitro'' fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning.&lt;ref name="glad2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Glad |author-link=John Glad |title=Future Human Evolution: Eugenics in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=Hermitage Publishers |date=2008 |isbn=1-55779-154-6 |url= http://www.whatwemaybe.org/txt/txt0000/Glad.John.2008.FHE.Meisenberg-abridgement.en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie [[Gattaca]] provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decided what you are capable of and your place in the world. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally "undesirable". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning.&lt;ref name = "glad2008"/&gt; Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pine |first=Lisa |title=Nazi Family Policy, 1933–1945 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=nW2aE5-rAMsC&amp;pg=PA19 |access-date=11 April 2012 |date=1997 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-1-85973-907-5 |pages=19 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Entine]] claims that eugenics simply means "good genes" and using it as synonym for genocide is an "all-too-common distortion of the social history of genetics policy in the United States." According to Entine, eugenics developed out of the [[Progressive Era]] and not "Hitler's twisted [[Final Solution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/lets-cautiously-celebrate_b_6070462.html |title=Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the 'New Eugenics' |first=John |last=Entine |date=30 December 2014 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation methods===
According to [[Richard Lynn]], eugenics may be divided into two main categories based on the ways in which the methods of eugenics can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. ''Part III. The Implementation of Classical Eugenics'' pp. 137–244 ''Part IV. The New Eugenics'' pp. 245–320&lt;/ref&gt;
* Classical eugenics
** Negative eugenics by provision of information and services, i.e. reduction of unplanned pregnancies and births.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 165–186&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Abstinence-only sex education|Advocacy for sexual abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Sex education| Sex education in schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 170–172&lt;/ref&gt;
*** School-based clinics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 172–174&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Promoting the use of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 174–176&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Emergency contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Research for better contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 179–181&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Voluntary [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 182–185&lt;/ref&gt;
** Negative eugenics by incentives, coercion and compulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 187–204&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Project Prevention|Incentives for sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;
*** The Denver Dollar-a-day program, i.e. paying teenage mothers for not becoming pregnant again.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Incentives for women on welfare to use contraceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Payments for sterilization in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Curtailment of benefits to welfare mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Compulsory sterilization]] of the "mentally retarded".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 196–199. Quote: "There is, nevertheless, a good case for reviving the sterilization of the mentally retarded and criminals. It is indisputable on both empirical and theorethical ground that many of these people transmit their characteristics to their children by both genetic and environmental processes."&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Compulsory sterilization of female criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 199–201. First quote: "The rationale for this sentencing policy was that the judges considered these women unfit to rear children and that they should therefore be prevented from having more, at least for a few years." Second quote: "In these and similar cases many people will no doubt accept that the judges were right in deciding that the women were unfit mothers and likely to cause harm to any future children and that it would be desirable to prevent further pregnancies. It is preferable for these women to be put on probation conditional on temporary sterilization than to send them to prison, which in most cases would serve little useful purpose. These judges' decisions were not made ostensibly on eugenic grounds, but they furthered the eugenic objective of preventing these women from having children, at least for a limited period. The eugenic objective should be to support these judicial sentences and to promote their use more often, together with the stipulation of longer periods of contraception and, preferably, permanent sterilization"&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Compulsory sterilization of male criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 201–203. Quote: "A better alternative, from the point of view of reducing future criminal offending and the promotion of eugenics, would be for judges to offer convicted male criminals the alternatives of imprisonment or castration accompanied by probation."&lt;/ref&gt;
** Licences for parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 205–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/14/time-to-restrict-human-breeding |title=It's time to consider restricting human breeding |first=Zoltan |last=Istvan |date=14 August 2014 |website=Wired.com |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 211–213. Richard Lynn argued that to have an effective licensing program, reversible sterilization methods should be used. Those who wish to have children would obtain the licence and have the sterilization reversed. Lynn stated that the proposals made by Francis Galton, Hugh LaFollette and John Westman would not be effective from the eugenicists' viewpoint, since those without licences could still have children. The proposal by David Lykken would be only slightly effective.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Positive eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 215–224&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Baby bonus|Financial incentives to have children]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Selective incentives for childbearing.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 217–219&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Taxation of the childless.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Ethical obligations of the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. pp. 220–221. Quote: "While it can be confidently expected that elites would respond to financial incentives to have children and to penalties for childlessness by increasing their fertility, they might not do this to the extent that would be desired. Ideally a program of positive eugenics would increase the fertility of the elite to perhaps around four children per couple; and at the same time a complementary program of negative eugenics would reduce the fertility of those with low intelligence and psychopathic personality to zero.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
===Efficacy===
The first major challenge to conventional eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. He demonstrated the event of [[Mutation|genetic mutation]] occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly (''Drosophila melanogaster'')]] with white eyes from a family with red eyes.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Morgan claimed that this demonstrated that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance and that the concept of eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was not completely scientifically accurate.{{sfn|Blom|2008|pp=336–7}} Additionally, Morgan criticized the view that subjective traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were caused by heredity because he believed that the definitions of these traits varied and that accurate work in genetics could only be done when the traits being studied were accurately defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay5text.html|title=Social Origins of Eugenics|website=Eugenicsarchive.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Morgan's public rejection of eugenics, much of his genetic research was absorbed by eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Origins of Eugenics |first=Elof Axel |last=Carlson |url= http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay2text.html |access-date=3 October 2013 |work=Image Archive on the American Eugenics Movement |publisher=Dolan DNA Learning Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |first=Thomas C. (Tim) |last=Leonard |format=pdf |work=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=19 |issue=4 |date=Fall 2005 |pages=207–224 |url= https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |access-date=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zygosity|heterozygote]] [[Carrier testing|test]] is used for the early detection of [[Recessive trait|recessive]] hereditary diseases, allowing for couples to determine if they are at risk of passing genetic defects to a future child.&lt;ref name = "drze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drze.de/in-focus/predictive-genetic-testing/modules/heterozygote-test-screening-programmes|title=Heterozygote test / Screening programmes — DRZE|website=Drze.de|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the test is to estimate the likelihood of passing the hereditary disease to future descendants.&lt;ref name = "drze"/&gt;

Recessive traits can be severely reduced, but never eliminated unless the complete genetic makeup of all members of the pool was known, as aforementioned. As only very few undesirable traits, such as Huntington's disease, are dominant, it could be argued{{by whom|date=November 2014}} from certain perspectives that the practicality of "eliminating" traits is quite low.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are examples of eugenic acts that managed to lower the prevalence of recessive diseases, although not influencing the prevalence of heterozygote carriers of those diseases. The elevated prevalence of certain genetically transmitted diseases among the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish population ([[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay–Sachs]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Canavan's disease]], and [[Gaucher's disease]]), has been decreased in current populations by the application of genetic screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html |title=Fatal Gift: Jewish Intelligence and Western Civilization |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090813162344/http://www.jewishpress.com/page.do/18624/The_Book_Shelf.html |archive-date=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pleiotropy]] occurs when one [[gene]] influences multiple, seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s, an example being [[phenylketonuria]], which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect.&lt;ref name="Stearns"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stearns |first=F. W. |date=2010 |title=One Hundred Years of Pleiotropy: A Retrospective |url= http://www.genetics.org/content/186/3/767.abstract |journal=Genetics |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=767–773 |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.122549 |pmid=21062962 |pmc=2975297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrzej Pękalski, from the [[University of Wrocław]], argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. Pekalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with [[myopia]] from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.&lt;ref name ="pekalski"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=A. |date=2000 |title=Effect of eugenics on the evolution of populations |url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100510070148 |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=329–332 |doi=10.1007/s100510070148 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..329P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of genetic diversity===
Eugenic policies could also lead to loss of [[genetic diversity]], in which case a culturally accepted "improvement" of the gene pool could very likely—as evidenced in numerous instances in isolated island populations —result in extinction due to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced ability to adapt to environmental change, and other factors both known and unknown. A long-term, species-wide eugenics plan might lead to a scenario similar to this because the elimination of traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity by definition.&lt;ref&gt;(Galton 2001, 48){{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward M. Miller]] claims that, in any one generation, any realistic program should make only minor changes in a fraction of the gene pool, giving plenty of time to reverse direction if [[unintended consequences]] emerge, reducing the likelihood of the elimination of desirable genes.&lt;ref name = "miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Edward M. |title=Eugenics: Economics for the Long Run |journal=Research in Biopolitics |volume=5 |pages=391–416 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that any appreciable reduction in diversity is so far in the future that little concern is needed for now.&lt;ref name = "miller"/&gt;

While the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some diseases such as [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[cystic fibrosis]] respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to [[cholera]] when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual. Reducing the instance of sickle-cell disease genes in Africa where malaria is a common and deadly disease could indeed have extremely negative net consequences.

However, some [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] cause people to consider some elements of eugenics.

===Ethics===
Societal and political consequences of eugenics call for a place in the discussion on the ethics behind the eugenics movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bentwich |first=M. |date=2013 |title=On the inseparability of gender eugenics, ethics, and public policy: An Israeli perspective |journal=American Journal of Bioethics |volume=13 |issue=10|pages=43–45 |doi=10.1080/15265161.2013.828128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical concerns regarding eugenics arise from its controversial past, prompting a discussion on what place, if any, it should have in the future. Advances in science have changed eugenics. In the past, eugenics had more to do with sterilization and enforced reproduction laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=B. A. |date=2012 |title=Maltreatment of people with serious mental illness in the early 20th century: A focus on Nazi Germany and eugenics in America |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=200 |issue=12 |pages=1096–1100 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318275d391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, in the age of a progressively mapped genome, embryos can be tested for susceptibility to disease, gender, and genetic defects, and alternative methods of reproduction such as in vitro fertilization are becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoge |first1=S. K. |last2=Appelbaum |first2=P. S. |date=2012 |title=Ethics and neuropsychiatric genetics: A review of major issues |journal=International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1547–1557 |doi=10.1017/S1461145711001982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, eugenics is no longer ''ex post facto'' regulation of the living but instead preemptive action on the unborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Witzany |first=G. |journal=EMBO Reports |title=No time to waste on the road to a liberal eugenics? |volume=17 |issue=3  |page=281 |date=2016 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/embr.201541855/abstract | doi=10.15252/embr.201541855 | pmid=26882552 | pmc=4772985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this change, however, there are ethical concerns which lack adequate attention, and which must be addressed before eugenic policies can be properly implemented in the future. Sterilized individuals, for example, could volunteer for the procedure, albeit under incentive or duress, or at least voice their opinion. The unborn fetus on which these new eugenic procedures are performed cannot speak out, as the fetus lacks the voice to consent or to express his or her opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baird |first=S. L. |date=2007 |title=Designer babies: Eugenics repackaged or consumer options? |url= |journal=Technology Teacher |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers disagree about the proper framework for reasoning about such actions, which change the very identity and existence of future persons.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=M. A. |title=The Nonidentity Problem |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition====

[[Image:Eugenics Quarterly to Social Biology.jpg|thumb|In the decades after [[World War II]], the term "eugenics" had taken on a negative connotation and became increasingly unpopular within academic science. Many organizations and journals that had their origins in the eugenics movement began to distance themselves from the philosophy, as when ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969.]]

A common criticism of eugenics is that "it inevitably leads to measures that are unethical".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2001. ''The Ethical Principles of Classical Eugenics – Conclusions'' P. 241 Quote: "A number of the opponents of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they could lead to further measures that would be unethical. This argument is unpersuasive because all sorts of measures that are acceptable might, if taken to extremes, lead to other measures that are unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear future "[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the [[euthanasia|killing of the institutionalized]] and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Edwin |author-link=Edwin Black |title=War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race |publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|date=2003 |isbn=1-56858-258-7||ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"&gt;{{cite web |last=Darnovsky |first=Marcy |title=Health and human rights leaders call for an international ban on species-altering procedures |date=2001 |url= http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=2809 |access-date=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=George Annas |last=Annas |first=George |author2-link=Lori Andrews |last2=Andrews |first2=Lori |author3-link=Rosario Isasi |last3=Isasi |first3=Rosario |title=Protecting the endangered human: Toward an international treaty prohibiting cloning and inheritable alterations |journal=American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine |volume=28 |page=151 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against [[germinal choice technology]] and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKibben |first=Bill |author-link=Bill McKibben |title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age |publisher=Times Books |date=2003 |isbn=0-8050-7096-6 |oclc=237794777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endorsement====
Some, for example [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]], claim that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making from the state to the patient and their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Eugenics Impulse|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |first=Nathaniel |last=Comfort |date=12 November 2012 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/The-Eugenic-Impulse/135612/|access-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort suggests that "the eugenic impulse drives us to eliminate disease, live longer and healthier, with greater intelligence, and a better adjustment to the conditions of society; and the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic bio-medicine are too great for us to do otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Comfort |first=Nathaniel |title=The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-16991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Bioethics|bioethicist]] Stephen Wilkinson of [[Keele University]] and Honorary Research Fellow Eve Garrard at the [[University of Manchester]], claim that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral. In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that "[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that PGD, and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they're wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eugenics and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction |first1=Stephen |last1=Wilkinson |first2=Eve |last2=Garrard |publisher=Keele University |orig-year=2013 |url= http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf |access-date=18 September 2013 |isbn=978-0-9576160-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book published in 2000, ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buchanan |first1=Allen |last2=Brock |first2=Dan W. |last3=Daniels |first3=Norman |last4=Wikler |first4=Daniel |title=From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-66977-4 |oclc=41211380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Original position]], a hypothetical situation developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]], has been used as an argument for ''negative eugenics''.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, p. 147. Quote: "What Rawls says is that "Over time a society is to take steps to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects." The key words here are "preserve" and "prevent". Rawls clearly envisages only the use of negative eugenics as a preventative measure to ensure a good basic level of genetic health for future generations. To jump from this to "make the later generations as genetically talented as possible," as Pence does, is a masterpiece of misinterpretation. This, then, is the sixth argument against positive eugenics: the Veil of Ignorance argument. Those behind the Veil in Rawls' Original Position would agree to permit negative, but not positive eugenics. This is a more complex variant of the Consent argument, as the Veil of Ignorance merely forces us to adopt a position of hypotethical consent to particular principles of justice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=John R. |date=1991 |title=Beyond Abortion: Human Genetics and the New Eugenics |url= http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&amp;context=plr |journal=Pepperdine Law Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=489–491 |access-date= 2016-06-02 |quote=Rawls arrives at the difference principle by considering how justice might be drawn from a hypothetical "original position.' A person in the original position operates behind a "veil of ignorance" that prevents her from knowing any information about herself such as social status, physical or mental capabilities, or even her belief system. Only from such a position of universal equality can principles of justice be drawn. In establishing how to distribute social primary goods, for example, "rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth" and self-respect, Rawls determines that a person operating from the original position would develop two principles. First, liberties ascribed to each individual should be as extensive as possible without infringing upon the liberties of others. Second, social primary goods should be distributed to the greatest advantage of everyone and by mechanisms that allow equal opportunity to all. ... Genetic engineering should not be permitted merely for the enhancement of physical attractiveness because that would not benefit the least advantaged. Arguably, resources should be concentrated on genetic therapy to address disease and genetic defects. However, such a result is not required under Rawls' theory. Genetic enhancement of those already intellectually gifted, for example, might result in even greater benefit to the least advantaged as a result of the gifted individual's improved productivity. Moreover, Rawls asserts that using genetic engineering to prevent the most serious genetic defects is a matter of intergenerational justice. Such actions are necessary in terms of what the present generation owes to later generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extreme learning machines''' are [[feedforward neural network]]s for [[statistical classification|classification]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Cluster analysis|clustering]], [[sparse approximation]], compression and [[feature learning]] with a single layer or multiple layers of hidden nodes, where the parameters of hidden nodes (not just the weights connecting inputs to hidden nodes) need not be tuned. These hidden nodes can be randomly assigned and never updated (i.e. they are [[random projection]] but with nonlinear transforms), or can be inherited from their ancestors without being changed. In most cases, the output weights of hidden nodes are usually learned in a single step, which essentially amounts to learning a linear model. The name "extreme learning machine" (ELM) was given to such models by its main inventor [http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=egbhuang Guang-Bin Huang].

According to their creators, these models are able to produce good generalization performance and learn thousands of times faster than networks trained using [[backpropagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Guang-Bin |first2=Qin-Yu |last2=Zhu |first3=Chee-Kheong |last3=Siew |title=Extreme learning machine: theory and applications |journal=Neurocomputing |volume=70 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.126 |citeseerx=10.1.1.217.3692}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In literature, it also shows that  these models can outperform [[Support vector machine|support vector machines]] (SVM) and SVM provides suboptimal solutions in both classification and regression applications.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang,|first=Guang-Bin; Hongming Zhou; Xiaojian Ding; and Rui Zhang|date=2012|title=Extreme Learning Machine for Regression and Multiclass Classification|url=http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/pdf/ELM-Unified-Learning.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics - Part B: Cybernetics|volume=42|pages=513–529|via=|doi=10.1109/tsmcb.2011.2168604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Guang-Bin|date=2014|title=An Insight into Extreme Learning Machines: Random Neurons, Random Features and Kernels|url=http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/pdf/ELM-Randomness-Kernel.pdf|journal=Cognitive Computation|volume=6|pages=376–390|via=|doi=10.1007/s12559-014-9255-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From 2001-2010, ELM research mainly focused on the unified learning framework for "generalized" single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), including but not limited to sigmoid networks, RBF networks, threshold networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Guang-Bin, Qin-Yu Zhu, K.

From 2010 to 2015, ELM research extended to the unified learning framework for kernel learning, SVM and a few typical feature learning methods such as [[Principal component analysis|Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) and [[Non-negative matrix factorization|Non-negative Matrix Factorization]] (NMF). It is shown that SVM actually provides suboptimal solutions compared to ELM, and ELM can provide the whitebox kernel mapping, which is implemented by ELM random feature mapping, instead of the blackbox kernel used in SVM. PCA and NMF can be considered as special cases where linear hidden nodes are used in ELM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Qing, Xin Jin, Changying Du, Fuzhen Zhuang, Zhongzhi Shi|date=2014|title=Clustering in Extreme Learning Machine Feature Space|url=http://www.intsci.ac.cn/users/jinxin/Mypapers/ELM-Neurocomputing-2013.pdf|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=128|pages=88–95|via=|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2012.12.063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasun|first=Liyanaarachchi Lekamalage Chamara, Yan Yang, Guang-Bin Huang, and Zhengyou Zhang|date=2016|title=Dimension Reduction With Extreme Learning Machine|url=http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/pdf/ELM-Dimensionality-Reduction.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing|volume=25|pages=3906–3918|via=|doi=10.1109/tip.2016.2570569}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In a recent announcement from [[Google Scholar]]: "[https://scholar.googleblog.com/2017/06/classic-papers-articles-that-have-stood.html Classic Papers: Articles That Have Stood The Test of Time]", two ELM papers have been listed in the "[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_classic_articles&amp;hl=en&amp;by=2006&amp;vq=eng_artificialintelligence Top 10 in Artificial Intelligence for 2006]," taking positions 2 and 7.

==Algorithms==
Given a single hidden layer of ELM, suppose that the output function of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th hidden node is &lt;math&gt;h_i(\mathbf{x})=G(\mathbf{a}_i,b_i,\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; are the parameters of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th hidden node. The output function of the ELM for SLFNs with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; hidden nodes is:

&lt;math&gt;f_L({\bf x})=\sum_{i=1}^L{\boldsymbol \beta}_ih_i({\bf x})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol \beta}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the output weight of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th hidden node.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x})=[G(h_i(\mathbf{x}),...,h_L(\mathbf{x}))]&lt;/math&gt; is the hidden layer output mapping of ELM. Given &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; training samples, the hidden layer output matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; of ELM is given as: &lt;math&gt;{\bf H}=\left[\begin{matrix}
{\bf h}({\bf x}_1)\\
\vdots\\
{\bf h}({\bf x}_N)
\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}
G({\bf a}_1, b_1, {\bf x}_1) &amp;\cdots &amp; G({\bf a}_L, b_L, {\bf x}_1)\\
\vdots &amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots\\
G({\bf a}_1, b_1, {\bf x}_N) &amp;\cdots &amp; G({\bf a}_L, b_L, {\bf x}_N)
\end{matrix}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the training data target matrix: &lt;math&gt;{\bf T}=\left[\begin{matrix}
{\bf t}_1\\
\vdots\\
{\bf t}_N
\end{matrix}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Generally speaking, ELM is a kind of regularization neural networks but with non-tuned hidden layer mappings (formed by either random hidden nodes, kernels or other implementations), its objective function is:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Minimize: } \|{\boldsymbol \beta}\|_p^{\sigma_1}+C\|{\bf H}{\boldsymbol \beta}-{\bf T}\|_q^{\sigma_2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&gt;0, \sigma_2&gt;0, p,q=0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, 2, \cdots, +\infty&lt;/math&gt;. 

Different combinations of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; can be used and result in different learning algorithms for regression, classification, sparse coding, compression, feature learning and clustering.

As a special case, a simplest ELM training algorithm learns a model of the form (for single hidden layer sigmoid neural networks):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{Y}} = \mathbf{W}_2 \sigma(\mathbf{W}_1 x)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''W'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the matrix of input-to-hidden-layer weights, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an activation function, and {{math|'''W'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the matrix of hidden-to-output-layer weights. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

# Fill {{math|'''W'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} with random values (e.g, [[Gaussian noise|Gaussian random noise]]);
# estimate {{math|'''W'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} by [[least-squares fit]] to a matrix of response variables {{math|'''Y'''}}, computed using the [[Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse|pseudoinverse]] {{math|⋅&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, given a [[design matrix]] {{math|'''X'''}}:
#:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}_2 = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{X})^+ \mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

== Architectures ==
In most cases, ELM is used as a single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) including but not limited to sigmoid networks, RBF networks, threshold networks, fuzzy inference networks, complex neural networks, wavelet networks, Fourier transform, Laplacian transform, etc. Due to its different learning algorithm implementations for regression, classification, spare coding, compression, feature learning and clustering, multi ELMs have been used to form multi hidden layer networks, [[deep learning]] or hierarchical networks&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

A hidden node in ELM is a computational elements, which need not be considered as classical neuron. A hidden node in ELM can be classical artificial neurons, basis functions, or a subnetwork formed by some hidden nodes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

== Theories ==
Both universal approximation and classification capabilities&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have been proved for ELM in literature. Especially, [http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=egbhuang Guang-Bin Huang] and his team spent almost seven years (2001-2008) on the rigorous proofs of ELM's  universal approximation capability&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. 

=== Universal approximation capability ===
In theory, any nonconstant piecewise continuous function can be used as activation function in ELM hidden nodes, such an activation function need not be differential. If tuning the parameters of hidden nodes could make SLFNs approximate any target function &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, then hidden node parameters can be randomly generated according to any continuous distribution probability, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{L\rightarrow \infty}\left\|\sum_{i=1}^L{\boldsymbol \beta}_ih_i({\bf x})-f({\bf x})\right\|=0&lt;/math&gt; holds with probability one with appropriate output weights &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Classification capability ===
Given any nonconstant piecewise continuous function as the activation function in SLFNs, if tuning the parameters of hidden nodes can make SLFNs approximate any target function &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, then SLFNs with random hidden layer mapping &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; can separate arbitrary disjoint regions of any shapes.

== Neurons ==
Wide type of nonlinear piecewise continuous functions &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; can be used in hidden neurons of ELM, for example:

===Real domain===
Sigmoid function: &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{x}+b))}&lt;/math&gt;

Fourier function: &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})=\sin(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{x}+b)&lt;/math&gt;

Hardlimit function: &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})=
\begin{cases}
1, &amp;\text{if }{\bf a}\cdot{\bf x}-b\geq 0\\
0, &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Gaussian function: &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})=\exp(-b\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a}\|^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Multiquadrics function: &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})=(\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a}\|^2+b^2)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

Wavelet: &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{a}, b, \mathbf{x})=\|a\|^{-1/2}\Psi\left(\frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a}}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is a single mother wavelet function.
===Complex domain===

Circular functions:

&lt;math&gt;\tan(z)= \frac{e^{iz}-e^{-iz}}{i(e^{iz}+e^{-iz})}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sin(z)= \frac{e^{iz}-e^{-iz}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

Inverse circular functions:

&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z)= \int_0^z\frac{dt}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\arccos(z)= \int_0^z\frac{dt}{(1-t^2)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hyperbolic functions:

&lt;math&gt;\tanh(z)= \frac{e^z-e^{-z}}{e^z+e^{-z}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sinh(z)= \frac{e^z-e^{-z}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Inverse hyperbolic functions:

&lt;math&gt;\text{arctanh}(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dt}{1-t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{arcsinh}(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dt}{(1+t^2)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[black-box]] character of neural networks in general and extreme learning machines (ELM) in particular is one of the major concerns that repels engineers from application in unsafe automation tasks. This particular issue was approached by means of several different techniques. One approach is to reduce the dependence on the random input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann|first=Klaus; Steil, Jochen J.|date=2011|title=Batch intrinsic plasticity for extreme learning machines|url=https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2141968/2904481|format=|journal=Proc. of International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks|volume=|pages=339-346|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann|first=Klaus; Steil, Jochen J.|date=2013|title=Optimizing extreme learning machines via ridge regression and batch intrinsic plasticity|url=https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2465823/2903542|format=|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=102|pages=23–30|via=|doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2012.01.041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach focuses on the incorporation of continuous constraints into the learning process of ELMs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann|first=Klaus; Rolf, Matthias; Steil, Jochen J.|date=2013|title=Reliable integration of continuous constraints into extreme learning machines|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021848851340014X|journal=International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=21|issue=supp02|pages=35–50|doi=10.1142/S021848851340014X|issn=0218-4885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2656403/2656405|title=Reliability|last=Neumann|first=Klaus|publisher=University Library Bielefeld|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=49–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are derived from prior knowledge about the specific task. This is reasonable, because machine learning solutions have to guarantee a safe operation in many application domains. The mentioned studies revealed that the special form of ELMs, with its functional separation and the linear read-out weights, is particularly well suited for the efficient incorporation of continuous constraints in predefined regions of the input space.

==Controversy==
There are two main complaints from academic community concerning this work, the first one is about "reinventing and ignoring previous ideas", the second one is about "improper naming", as shown in some debates in 2008 and 2015. In particular, it was pointed out in a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Lipo P.|last2=Wan|first2=Chunru R.|title=Comments on "The Extreme Learning Machine"|journal=IEEE Trans. Neural Networks|citeseerx=10.1.1.217.2330}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the editor of ''IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks'' that the idea of using a hidden layer connected to the inputs by random untrained weights was already suggested in the original papers on [[RBF network]]s in the late 1980s; Guang-Bin Huang replied by pointing out subtle differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Guang-Bin|date=2008|title=Reply to "comments on `the extreme learning machine' "|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=19|pages=1495–1496|via=|doi=10.1109/tnn.2008.2002275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 paper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, Huang responded to complaints about his invention of the name ELM for already-existing methods, complaining of "very negative and unhelpful comments on ELM in neither academic nor professional manner due to various reasons and intentions" and an "irresponsible anonymous attack which intends to destroy harmony research environment", arguing that his work "provides a unifying learning platform" for various types of neural nets,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=What are Extreme Learning Machines?

'''Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mikhailovna of Russia''' (Moscow, 26 May 1826 – [[Wiesbaden]], 28 January 1845) was the second child and daughter of [[Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia]] and [[Elena Pavlovna of Württemberg|Princess Charlotte of Württemberg]] who took the name ''Elena Pavlovna'' upon her conversion to the Orthodox faith. Through her father, Elizabeth was a granddaughter of Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]], and a niece of both Russian emperors [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

==Biography==
Elizabeth, nicknamed "Lili", was born in the [[Kremlin]] in Moscow and she was named after her aunt who had died earlier that month, the [[Louise of Baden|Empress Elizabeth]], wife of [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] and a close friend of her mother. She grew up with her other siblings in the [[Old Michael Palace|Mikhailovsky Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Elizabeth was said to be the prettiest among her sisters, and like her mother, Elena Pavlovna, she was graceful in manners and well-educated. By the end of 1843, [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolf, Duke of Nassau]] was visiting St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg and met Elizabeth for the first time. Adolf's stepmother was [[Princess Pauline of Württemberg]], Elizabeth's maternal aunt, and so he was related to the Russians in some way. Adolf and Elizabeth fell in love and they eventually got married on 31 January 1844 in St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg. Elizabeth was 17 years old and Adolf was 26.

After the wedding, the couple stayed in Russia for some time until they moved to Germany and took up residence in [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Castle Biebrich]] in Wiesbaden. Elizabeth, now Duchess of Nassau, was popular among the people.
[[File:Elizabeth Mikhailovna.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sculpture of Elizabeth Mikhailovna at the St. Elizabeth Church in Wiesbaden]]

She and Adolf were happily married and the news that she was already pregnant with their first child brought great happiness to the couple. After only a year, Elizabeth died giving birth to a daughter, who also did not survive. The grief-stricken Adolf ordered the construction of a Russian Orthodox church - the [[St. Elizabeth's Church, Wiesbaden|St. Elizabeth's Church]] in [[Neroberg Park]], Wiesbaden - to house her remains The location of the church on the hill was chosen by Adolf himself so that he could always have a view of the church from his residence. Elizabeth's sarcophagus can still be seen today inside the church.

On 10 November 1998, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the [[International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

Since 2001, some national NGOs coalitions promoting the Decade have been established in several countries, including Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands. 
These national coalitions along with international organizations decided to found the '''International Coalition for the Decade''' for the Culture of Peace and Nonviolence in June 2003.

Its office is based in [[Paris]] and its president is [[Christian Renoux]] ([[France]]).

'''Jane Maria Eliza Cazneau''' (née '''McManus''', widowed '''Storm'''; April 6, 1807 – December 12, 1878) was an American journalist, lobbyist, and publicist who advocated the annexation of all of [[Mexico]] during the [[Mexican-American War]].

==Education and early career==
She was born on April 6, 1807, in [[Brunswick, New York|Brunswick]], [[Rensselaer County, New York]], the daughter of Congressman [[William McManus]] and Catharine (Coons) McManus. She attended [[Emma Willard School|Troy Female Seminary]], one of the earliest colleges for women, but did not graduate. On August 22, 1825, she married Allen B. Storm. They separated in 1831, and Allen Storm died 1838 in New York City. Their son, William Mont Storm (b. August 2, 1826),&lt;ref&gt;Official name per US Passport Application, dated Aug. 3, 1860&lt;/ref&gt; became an inventor whose first invention was patented on Feb. 4, 1851 for an "Improved method of obtaining motive power".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US7922&lt;/ref&gt; He had at least 33 patents to his name, with most in firearms, but many other devices as well.

In 1832, Jane's father ventured into land speculation, and was one of the founders of the [[Galveston Bay]] and Texas Land Company, and Jane and her brother Robert traveled to Texas, which was then still part of [[Mexico]], to buy land. The next year, Jane, her father, her brother Robert and a company of German settlers set out to take possession of the land, but the scheme failed when the German settlers refused to go beyond [[Matagorda, Texas|Matagorda]]. She returned home with her father to Brunswick, NY. Her brother Robert remained in Texas and eventually became a wealthy planter.

Also at this time, [[Eliza Jumel]] named her as co-respondent in her divorce suit with [[Aaron Burr]], alleging an affair in addition to his ruinous attempt at land speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zq_1aj_sczoC|title=Mistress of Manifest Destiny: a biography of Jane McManus Storm Cazneau, 1807-1878|last=Hudson|first=Linda S.|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|isbn=9780876111796|language=en}}, pp. 18-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Then she turned to journalism, working for [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and [[Moses Yale Beach]]'s ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'' and the ''[[Democratic Review]]'', strongly advocating [[manifest destiny]]. Storm embraced this with enthusiasm, and was to go on to be a firm believer, northerner though she was, in the expansion of the South, and of slavery, its 'peculiar institution', into Central America and the [[Caribbean]]. In ''Mistress of Manifest Destiny'' (2001), Linda S. Hudson argued that it was Storm who actually wrote the "Annexation" editorial, and thus coined the phrase "Manifest Destiny". Since many editorials in [[John L. O'Sullivan]]'s publications were unsigned, Hudson used computer-aided "textual analysis" to support her argument. O'Sullivan biographer Robert D. Sampson disputes Hudson's claim for a variety of reasons.{{Citation needed|reason=Citations needed for statements made in this paragraph|date=February 2017}}

==Mexican-American War and Peace==
Cazneau was sent by President Polk on a secret peace mission to Mexico in 1845; she rode there on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthe Winegarten (ed.), Finder’s Guide to the "Texas Women: A Celebration of Texas History” Archives (Denton: Texas Woman’s University Library, 1984), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; With the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]], she went to the front, where she witnessed [[Winfield Scott]]'s capture of the fortress of [[Siege of Vera Cruz|Vera Cruz]] in March 1847, the first female war correspondent in American history, using the name of "Cora Montgomery."&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, p. 96,&lt;/ref&gt;  She helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] (1848), which included guarantees of property rights to both male and female nonresident landowners. While in Mexico, she worked on canal-building expeditions and banking projects.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthe Winegarten and Frieda Werden, “Women in Texas History,” Texas Almanac 1986-1987 (Dallas: The Dallas Morning News, 1985), 234&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Mexican-American War]] she turned her attention to [[Cuba]], and the potential it represented, advocating its annexation, and denouncing its Spanish colonial overlords.  She later settled at [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]], a frontier village three hundred miles up the [[Rio Grande]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], getting to know many of the local Indian chiefs.

==Caribbean==
In 1849, she married [[William Leslie Cazneau]]. They moved to the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1855. Despite her earlier sympathies for southern expansionism she disapproved of [[Confederate States of America|secession]], and was hired by [[William H. Seward]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s Secretary of State, to write denunciations of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].  It was a matter of simple principle for her: the war was a serious interruption to further prospects of American expansion in the Caribbean.

In 1878, she was drowned on her way to [[Santo Domingo]], after the steamer ''Emily B. Souder'' on which she was travelling was caught in a huge storm.

{{nihongo|'''''Agano''''' |阿賀野| }} was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Agano|cruiser}}s which served with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jentsura  | first = Hansgeorg  | year = 1976 | title = Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945  | publisher = Naval Institute Press  | isbn = 0-87021-893-X }} page 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;  She was named after the [[Agano River]] in [[Fukushima prefecture|Fukushima]] and [[Niigata prefecture]]s in [[Japan]].

== Background ==
''Agano'' was the first of the four vessels completed in the ''Agano'' class of [[light cruiser]]s, which were intended to replace increasingly obsolete light cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Funding was authorized in the [[4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme]] of 1939, although construction was delayed due to lack of capacity in Japanese shipyards. Like other vessels of her class, ''Agano'' was intended for use as the flagship of a [[destroyer]] flotilla.&lt;ref name=Stille&gt;Stille, '' Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 '', pages 34-39;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The design for the ''Agano'' class was based on technologies developed by the experimental cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Yūbari||2}}, resulting in a graceful and uncluttered deck line and single smokestack.&lt;ref name="Stille" /&gt;

''Agano'' was armed with six [[15 cm/50 41st Year Type|152 mm Type 41 guns]] in three [[gun turret]]s.&lt;ref name="Stille" /&gt; Secondary armament included four [[8 cm/60 98th Year Type|8 cm/60 Type 98 naval gun]]s designed specifically for the class, in two twin turrets amidships. Anti-aircraft weapons included two triple [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25 mm AA guns]] in front of the bridge, and two twin [[Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun|13 mm mounts]] near the mast.&lt;ref name="Stille" /&gt; ''Agano'' also had two quadruple torpedo launchers for [[Type 93 torpedo]]es located below the flight deck, with eight reserve torpedoes.&lt;ref name="Stille" /&gt; The [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted on the centerline, as was more common with destroyers, and had a rapid reload system with eight spare torpedoes. Being mounted on the centerline allowed the twin launchers to fire to either port or starboard, meaning that a full eight-torpedo broadside could be fired, whereas a ship with separate port and starboard launchers can only fire half of its torpedoes at a time. Two [[depth charge]] rails and 18 depth charges were also installed aft. ''Agano'' was also equipped with two [[Aichi E13A]] aircraft and had a flight deck with a 26-foot catapult.&lt;ref name="Stille" /&gt;

The engines were a quadruple-shaft geared turbine arrangement with six boilers in five boiler rooms, developing {{convert|100,000|shp|abbr=on}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|35|kn|km/h}}.

==Service career==

===Early career===
Built at [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]], ''Agano'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 18 June 1940, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 October 1941 and completed on 31 October 1942.&lt;ref name="Nishida"&gt;{{cite web|first = Hiroshi | last = Nishida |url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0336.htm |title= Agano-class light cruisers |year=2002 |work= Imperial Japanese Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On completion, she was assigned as flagship of Destroyer Squadron 10 of the [[IJN 3rd Fleet]]. On 16 December 1942, ''Agano'' began her first combat operation, joining the [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}} and other ships to escort troops to [[Wewak]] and [[Madang]] in [[New Guinea]], and later patrolling in the [[Bismarck Sea]] and covering landings of Japanese forces at [[Jayapura|Hollandia]]. ''Agano'' was next involved in the [[Operation Ke|evacuation of Japanese troops from Guadalcanal]], which was completed in February 1943, with about 12,000 Japanese soldiers evacuated.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet"&gt;{{cite web | last = Parshall | first = Jon |author2=Bob Hackett |author3=Sander Kingsepp |author4=Allyn Nevitt  | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/agano_c.htm |title = Combined Fleet.com Agano class| accessdate = 2006-06-14}} tabular record:  [http://www.combinedfleet.com/agano_t.htm   CombinedFleet.com: ‘‘Agano’’  history]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1943, ''Agano'' returned to [[Kure Naval District]] and was assigned to the powerful fleet intended to counterstrike against American forces which had landed on [[Attu Island]] in the [[Aleutians]]. However, by the time the force was assembled, the Americans had completed their capture of the island, and the strike was called off.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet" /&gt;
In June 1943, ''Agano'' put in at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] for refit, including the addition of air search [[radar]] Type 21 and an additional ten [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25 mm Type 96 antiaircraft guns]] in two twin and two triple mounts, adding to the original two triple mounts for a total of sixteen guns.&lt;ref name="Stille" /&gt;

===Operations in the Solomons===
After refitting and [[dry dock]], ''Agano'' departed for [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands]] with a large Japanese force.  Despite numerous sightings by American submarines and an attack on the aircraft carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2}}, ''Agano'' made it safely to Truk where she began ferrying troops and supplies to [[Rabaul]] from July to October 1943.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet" /&gt;

''Agano'' sortied with the fleet to attempt to intercept American raiding forces near [[Eniwetok]] in September 1943, but failed to make contact. Another attempt to intercept the Americans in October was a failure as well. However, on 2 November 1943, while part of the fleet supporting the defense of [[Rabaul]], ''Agano'' participated in a major action (the [[Battle of Empress Augusta Bay]]) against American units in which the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Sendai||2}} and destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsukaze||2}} were both sunk. Three days later, back in port at Rabaul, ''Agano'' was barely missed by an American air strike launched by the aircraft carriers {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|6}}, sustaining slight damage and with one crewman killed. The fleet put to sea to engage American forces but this was cancelled and the fleet returned to Rabaul by 7 November 1943.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet" /&gt;

In harbor at Rabaul on 11 November, a [[Mark 13 torpedo]] launched by a [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] aircraft hit ''Agano'' in the stern, bending one of her shafts and flooding four compartments. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Morikazu Osugi]] was also injured in the attack. The next day, ''Agano'' was taken under tow by her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Noshiro||2}} together with four destroyers, for repairs at Truk. However, a few hours after departure, the ships were sighted by the American submarine {{USS|Scamp|SS-277|6}}, which launched four torpedoes. ''Agano'' was struck again in the stern, damaging a second screw shaft and severely buckling several plates. Later that day, the accompanying destroyers fought off an attack by the submarine {{USS|Albacore|SS-218|6}} using a four-hour-long [[depth charge]] barrage. ''Agano'' finally reached Truk on 16 November.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet" /&gt;

===Sinking===
After three months of emergency field repairs, from November 1943 until mid-February 1944, ''Agano'' was finally able to leave Truk, albeit on only two of her four screws. In the course of repairs, 19 of her bulkheads had to be removed. She departed Truk on 15 February 1944, escorted by the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Oite|1924|2}} and submarine hunter ''CH-28'', for the [[Japanese home islands]] where she was to be properly repaired, but could make only {{convert|16|kn}}. On the afternoon of 16 February {{convert|170|nmi|km}} north of Truk the three vessels were spotted by the American submarine {{USS|Skate|SS-305|6}}, which launched four torpedoes. Two struck ''Agano'' on the starboard side, flooding boiler rooms 3 and 5, and setting the ship ablaze. She remained afloat until the early morning of 17 February, allowing ''Oite'' to rescue 523 survivors from her crew of 726 men.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet" /&gt; ''Agano'' sank at {{coord|10|11|N|151|42|E|display=inline, title}} at 05:17 on 17 February. ''Agano'' was removed from the [[navy list]] on 31 March 1944.&lt;ref name="Nishida" /&gt;

However, as ''Oite'' attempted to return to Truk that afternoon, the destroyer was sunk by torpedoes launched by [[Grumman TBF Avenger]]s in the course of [[Operation Hailstone]], and sank within minutes at the north entrance to the atoll, taking all but twenty of her own crew down with her.  All of the ''Agano'' crewmembers originally rescued were lost.&lt;ref name="combinedfleet" /&gt;

[[File:Sir William Crookes and Katie King.jpg|thumb|Katie King, Florence Cook and Sir William Crookes]]
'''Katie King''' was the name given by [[Spiritualists]] in the 1870s to what they believed to be a materialized [[spirit]]. The question of whether the spirit was real or a fraud was a notable public controversy of the mid-1870s.

The spirit was said to have appeared first between 1871 and 1874 in [[séance]]s conducted by [[Florence Cook]] in London, and later in 1874-1875 in New York in séances held by the [[Mediumship|medium]]s [[Jennie Holmes]] and her husband [[Nelson Holmes]].

Katie King was believed by Spiritualists to be the daughter of John King, a ''spirit control'' of the 1850s through the 1870s that appeared in many séances involving materialized spirits.

(A spirit control is a powerful and communicative spirit that organizes the appearance of other spirits at a séance. John King claimed to be the spirit of [[Henry Morgan]], the buccaneer (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 241, 277).)

==Florence Cook==
Florence Cook (ca 1856 – 1904) was a teenage girl who started to claim mediumistic abilities in 1870 and in 1871-2 she developed her abilities under the established mediums Frank Herne and Charles Williams.  Herne was associated with the spirit "John King", and Florence became associated with "Katie King", stated to be John King's daughter.  Herne was exposed as a fraud in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim (1985) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;  Katie King developed from appearing as a disembodied face to a fully physical materialisation.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1963) pp.1-32&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]] on 9 December 1873, lawyer William Volckman attended a séance held by Florence Cook, during which Katie King materialized and, as was customary, held the hands of participants.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1963) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  Suspicious of the spirit's similarity with Cook, Volckman seized the spirit's hand and waist, accusing it of being the medium masquerading as her ghost.  The spirit was wrestled from Volckman's grasp by other participants and returned to a cabinet from which Cook emerged some minutes later.  Volckman published his opinion that the spirit was a masquerade by Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1963) pp.28-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of Miss Cook denounced Volckman on the grounds that he had broken his agreement to proper etiquette required in the séance, thus negating his credibility as an investigator: Volckman was associated with another medium, Mrs Guppy, who might have wished to denigrate her rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=William Crookes (1832-1919) and the commercialization of science | series=Science, technology, and culture, 1700-1945 | author=William Hodson Brock | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=0-7546-6322-1 | page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Darkened Room: Women, Power, and Spiritualism in Late Victorian England | author=Alex Owen | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2004 | isbn=0-226-64205-4 | page=67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it was argued that since spirits borrowed energy and matter from their medium, it was not surprising that Katie King resembled Cook. Despite the defence of their position, Cook and her supporters were hurt by this incident — newspapers were referring to it as an "exposure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Altered States: Sex, Nation, Drugs, and Self-Transformation in Victorian Spiritualism | series=Studies in the Long Nineteenth Century | author=Marlene Tromp | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2007 | isbn=0-7914-6740-6 | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — and sought further support for their position. To this end, they turned to Crookes, who was a prominent and respected scientist (Noakes, 130-1).

Between 1871 and 1874, Sir [[William Crookes]] investigated the preternatural phenomena produced by Spiritualist mediums. He described the conditions he imposed on mediums as follows: "It must be at my own house, and my own selection of friends and spectators, under my own conditions, and I may do whatever I like as regards apparatus" (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 177).

A 15-year-old Cook, alone in Crookes' house with Crookes' friends and family as witnesses, was said to have materialized the spirit of Katie King, who walked about, talked, allowed herself to be weighed and measured, and even held the family's baby (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 241).  On one occasion, at a joint seance in Crookes's home in March 1874, Katie King was seen in company with "Florence Maple", a spirit materialised by the medium Mary Showers who was exposed as a fraud shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=hall39&gt;Hall (1963) p.39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The sorcerer of kings: the case of Daniel Dunglas Home and William Crookes | first=Gordon | last=Stein | publisher=Prometheus Books | year=1993 | isbn=0-87975-863-5 | pages=40–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Species, serpents, spirits, and skulls: science at the margins of the Victorian age | first=Sherrie Lynne | last=Lyons | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2009 | isbn=1-4384-2797-2 | page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sessions were held with the medium secluded in the dark, because Spiritualists believe that materialization requires very dim surroundings to succeed, though occasionally the spirits materialised in the light and some photographs were taken.&lt;ref name=hall39/&gt;  As is apparently typical of materialized spirits, Katie's exact height and weight varied, though Katie was always taller than Florence Cook, with a larger face, and different hair and skin. According to those present, the two were both visible at the same moments, so that Florence could not have assumed the role of the spirit (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 235-240).

The final appearances of Katie King in connection with Florence Cook took place in April and May 1874 at the Cook family home in Hackney.  The audiences were invited to sit in a parlour opening onto a bedroom, in which Florence would start her trance.  After some time Katie King would emerge.  At some point the audience would be shown a figure, apparently Florence, lying on the floor of the bedroom with her head covered by a shawl while Katie King was still visible in the parlour.  A number of the witnesses, such as [[William Edward Cox|Edward W. Cox]], recorded their doubts about the proceedings, while others claimed that they had seen the two clearly, such as Crookes and [[Florence Marryat]], who claimed that she had seen Katie naked in Florence's company.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1963) pp.54-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Crookes' report, published in 1874, contained his assertion that Florence Cook, as well as the mediums [[Fox sisters|Kate Fox]] and [[Daniel Dunglas Home]], were producing genuine preternatural phenomena (Crookes 1874). The publication caused an uproar, and his testimony about Katie King was considered the most outrageous and sensational part of the report.

Her story was told in season 21, episode 8 of ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel Channel Schedule|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/tv-schedule.2018.09.26.CST|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jennie and Nelson Holmes==
After news of Katie King had spread abroad, the American mediums Jennie and Nelson Holmes also claimed to have materialized her. [[Robert Dale Owen]], the politician and avowed Spiritualist, had experienced this materialization and wrote about it in an article for the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman (2009) p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the article was going to press, however, a woman named Eliza White stepped forward and claimed to have masqueraded as Katie.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman (2009) p.164&lt;/ref&gt;  White's face matched that of "Katie King" in photographs sold by the Holmeses and their agents. Both the ''Atlantic Monthly'' and Owen admitted in public to being duped.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman (2009) p.165&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] maintains that this "exposure" did more damage to Spiritualism than any other exposure of the period (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 269-277).

Investigations conducted by leading Spiritualist [[Henry Steel Olcott]] in 1875 re-established the credibility of the Holmeses in the eyes of many Spiritualists.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman (2009) p.166&lt;/ref&gt; The story eventually accepted by most Spiritualists was that Eliza White had been hired to pose as Katie King for a photograph to sell to the public. The Holmeses had not wanted to photograph the real Katie King, since bright light would have ruined the materialization. Once involved, Eliza White first extorted money from the Holmeses, and then sold the story to the press. (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 269-277).

'''King Kong''' is a [[Kaiju|giant movie monster]], resembling an enormous [[gorilla]], that has appeared in various media since 1933. The character first appeared in the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' from [[RKO Pictures]], which received universal acclaim upon its initial release and re-releases. A sequel quickly followed that same year with ''[[Son of Kong|The Son of Kong]]'', featuring Little Kong. In the 1960s, [[Toho]] produced ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (1962), pitting a larger Kong against Toho's own [[Godzilla]], and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' (1967), based on ''[[The King Kong Show]]'' (1966–1969) from [[Rankin/Bass Productions]]. In 1976, [[Dino De Laurentiis]] produced a [[King Kong (1976 film)|modern remake of the original film]] directed by [[John Guillermin]]. A sequel, ''[[King Kong Lives]]'', followed a decade later featuring a Lady Kong. [[King Kong (2005 film)|Another remake of the original]], this time set in 1933, was released in 2005 from filmmaker [[Peter Jackson]].

The most recent film, ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), set in 1973, is part of [[Legendary Entertainment]]'s [[MonsterVerse]], which began with Legendary's reboot of ''[[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]'' in 2014. A crossover sequel, ''[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]'', once again pitting the characters against one another, is currently planned for 2020.

The character King Kong has become one of the world's most famous movie icons, having inspired a number of sequels, remakes, spin-offs, imitators, parodies, cartoons, books, [[King Kong (comics)|comics]], video games, theme park rides, and a [[King Kong (2013 musical)|stage play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117999845.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=King-Kong |title=Global Creatures takes on "Kong" |work=Variety |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2010 | first=Michaela | last=Boland}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role in the different narratives varies, ranging from a rampaging monster to a tragic [[antihero]].

==Overview==
[[File:King Kong ESB.JPG|thumb|King Kong graphics at Empire State Building.]]
The King Kong character was conceived and created by American filmmaker [[Merian C. Cooper]]. In the original film, the character's name is Kong, a name given to him by the inhabitants of "[[Skull Island]]" in the [[Indian Ocean]], where Kong lives along with other oversized animals such as a [[plesiosaur]], [[pterosaur]]s and various [[dinosaur]]s. An American film crew, led by [[Carl Denham]], captures Kong and takes him to [[New York City]] to be exhibited as the "Eighth Wonder of the World".

Kong escapes and climbs the [[Empire State Building]], only to fall from the skyscraper after being attacked by airplanes with guns. Denham comments "it wasn't the airplanes, It was beauty killed the beast," for he climbs the building in the first place only in an attempt to protect Ann Darrow, an actress originally offered up to Kong on Skull Island as a sacrifice (in the 1976 remake, her character is named "Dwan").

A [[documentary]] about Skull Island that appears on the DVD for the 2005 remake (originally seen on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] at the time of its theatrical release) gives Kong's scientific name as "'''''Megaprimatus kong'''''"&lt;ref&gt;''The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=JtdI-BuTEhgC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210 p. 210]&lt;/ref&gt; ("Megaprimatus", deriving from the prefix "[[wikt:mega-|mega-]]" and the [[Latin]] words "[[wikt:primate|primate]]" and "[[wikt:primatus|primatus]]", means "big [[primate]]" or "big supreme being") and states that his species may be related to ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'', though that genus of giant ape is more closely related to [[orangutan]]s than to [[gorilla]]s.

==Conception and creation==
[[File:cooper-Kong.jpg|left|thumb|Merian C. Cooper glances up at his creation.]]

[[Merian C. Cooper]] became fascinated by gorillas at the age of 6.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=14–15}} In 1899, he was given a book from his uncle called ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/13/movies/MoviesFeatures/getting-that-monkey-off-his-creators-back.html|title=Getting That Monkey Off His Creator's Back|work=New York Times|date=August 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book (written in 1861), chronicled the adventures of [[Paul Du Chaillu]] in Africa and his various encounters with the natives and wildlife there.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=14–16}} Cooper became fascinated with the stories involving the gorillas, in particular, Du Chaillu's depiction of a particular gorilla known for its "extraordinary size",{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=10}} that the natives described as "invincible" and the "King of the African Forest".{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=16}} When Du Chaillu and some natives encountered a gorilla later in the book he described it as a "hellish dream creature" that was "half man, half beast".{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=16–17}}  These stories planted the seed of adventure in young Merian's mind.

Decades later in his adult years, Cooper became involved in the motion picture industry. While filming ''[[The Four Feathers (1929 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' in Africa, he came into contact with a family of baboons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2690/King-Kong/notes.html|title=King Kong (1933) Notes|work=TCM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gave him the idea to make a picture about primates.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=167}} A year later when he got to [[RKO]], Cooper wanted to film a "terror gorilla picture". As the story was being fleshed out, Cooper decided to make his gorilla giant sized. Cooper stated that the idea of Kong fighting warplanes on top of a building came from him seeing a plane flying over the [[New York Life Building|New York Insurance Building]], then the tallest building in the world.{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=38}} He came up with the ending before the rest of the story as he stated, "Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind's eye a giant gorilla on top of the building".{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=186}} Cooper also was influenced by Douglas Burden's accounts of the [[Komodo Dragon]],{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=194}} and wanted to pit his terror gorilla against dinosaur-sized versions of these reptiles, stating to Burden, "I also had firmly in mind to giantize both the gorilla and your dragons to make them really huge. However I always believed in personalizing and focusing attention on one main character and from the very beginning I intended to make it the gigantic gorilla, no matter what else I surrounded him with".{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=194}} Around this time, Cooper began to refer to his project as a "giant terror gorilla picture" featuring "a gigantic semi-humanoid gorilla pitted against modern civilization.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=187}}

Once the film got green-lit and it came time to design King Kong, Cooper wanted him to be a nightmarish gorilla monster. As he described him in a 1930 memo, "His hands and feet have the size and strength of steam shovels; his girth is that of a steam boiler. This is a monster with the strength of a hundred men. But more terrifying is the head—a nightmare head with bloodshot eyes and jagged teeth set under a thick mat of hair, a face half-beast half-human".{{sfn|Van Hise|1993|p=56}} [[Willis O'Brien]] created an oil painting depicting the giant gorilla menacing a jungle heroine and hunter for Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uOd7mzUwjqQ/UhvSqOCNS0I/AAAAAAAABi0/FHmvLh0-XIA/s1600/monster.jpg Willis O'Brien giant gorilla painting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis O'Brien-Creator of the Impossible by Don Shay. Cinefex #7 R.B Graphics. 1982. Pg.33&lt;/ref&gt; However, when it came time for O'Brien and [[Marcel Delgado]] to sculpt the animation model, Cooper decided to backpedal on the half-human look for the creature and became adamant that Kong be a gorilla. O'Brien on the other hand, wanted him to be almost human-like to gain audience empathy, and told Delgado to "make that ape almost human".{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=56}} Cooper laughed at the end result saying that it looked like a cross between a monkey and a man with very long hair.{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=56}} For the second model, O'Brien again asked Delgado to add human features but to tone it down somewhat. The end result (which was rejected) was described as looking like a missing link.{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=56}} Disappointed, Cooper stated, "I want Kong to be the fiercest, most brutal, monstrous damned thing that has ever been seen!"{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=56}} On December 22, 1931, Cooper got the dimensions of a bull gorilla from the [[American Museum of Natural History]] telling O'Brien, "Now that's what I want!"{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=56}} When the final model was created (one that Cooper ultimately approved of), it had the basic overall look of a gorilla but managed to retain some humanesque qualities, such as a streamlined body and a removed paunch and rump, distinctive aspects of the gorilla's anatomy that Delgado purposefully removed.{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=58}} O'Brien would incorporate some characteristics and nuances of an earlier creature he had created in 1915 for the silent short ''[[The Dinosaur and the Missing Link]]'' into the general look and personality of Kong, even going as far as to refer to the creature as "Kong's ancestor".&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Woods. King Kong Cometh!. Plexus Publishing Limited, 2005 Pg.27&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=44}} When it came time to film, Cooper agreed that Kong should walk upright at times (mostly in the New York sequences) in order to appear more intimidating.{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=54-55}}

===Origin of the name===
Merian C. Cooper was very fond of strong, hard-sounding words that started with the letter "K". Some of his favorite words were "[[Komodo (island)|Komodo]]", "[[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]" and "[[Kodak]]".{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=193–194}} When Cooper was envisioning his giant terror gorilla idea, he wanted to capture a real gorilla from the Congo and have it fight a real [[Komodo dragon]] on [[Komodo (island)|Komodo island]]. (This scenario would eventually evolve into Kong's battle with the [[tyrannosaur]] on Skull Island when the film was produced a few years later at RKO.) Cooper's friend Douglas Burden's trip to the island of Komodo and his encounter with the Komodo dragons was a big influence on the Kong story.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=190}} Cooper was fascinated by Burden's adventures as chronicled in his book ''Dragon Lizards of Komodo'' where he referred to the animal as the "King of Komodo".{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=193–194}} It was this phrase along with "Komodo" and "Kongo" {{sic}} (and his overall love for hard sounding "K"-words){{sfn|Morton|2005|p=25}} that gave him the idea to name the giant ape "Kong". He loved the name, as it had a "mystery sound" to it.

When Cooper got to RKO and wrote the first draft of the story, it was simply referred to as "'''The Beast'''". RKO executives were unimpressed with the bland title. [[David O. Selznick]] suggested ''Jungle Beast'' as the film's new title,{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=220}} but Cooper was unimpressed and wanted to name the film after the main character. He stated he liked the "mystery word" aspect of Kong's name and that the film should carry "the name of the leading mysterious, romantic, savage creature of the story" such as with Dracula and Frankenstein.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=220}} RKO sent a memo to Cooper suggesting the titles ''Kong: King of Beasts'', ''Kong: The Jungle King'', and ''Kong: The Jungle Beast'', which combined his and Selznick's proposed titles.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=220}} As time went on, Cooper would eventually name the story simply ''Kong'' while Ruth Rose was writing the final version of the screenplay. Because David O. Selznick thought that audiences would think that the film, with the one word title of ''Kong'', would be mistaken as a docudrama like ''[[Grass (1925 film)|Grass]]'' and ''[[Chang (film)|Chang]]'', which were one-word titled films that Cooper had earlier produced, he added the "King" to Kong's name to differentiate it.{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=185}}

{{Details|King Kong (2013 musical)}}

In mid-2012, it was announced that a musical adaptation of the story (endorsed by Merian C. Cooper's estate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/king-kong-musical-aiming-for-broadway-in-2013-creative-team-announced-com-171812|title=King Kong Musical Aiming for Broadway in 2013; Creative Team Announced|work=Playbill|date=September 16, 2010|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was going to be staged in [[Melbourne]] at the Regent Theatre. The show premiered on June 15, 2013, with music by Marius De Vries. The musical premiered on Broadway in November 8 of 2018 at the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theatre]]. The creative team included book writer Jack Thorne, director-choreographer Drew McOnie, and Australian songwriter Eddie Perfect, who replace the former creatives.&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, Andy.

The huge King Kong puppet was created by [[Global Creature Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kingkongliveonstage.com/ |title=King Kong Live on Stage at the Regent Theatre, Melbourne |website=Kingkongliveonstage.com |date=March 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puppet stands 20 feet tall and weighs 2,400 pounds. It was operated by 10 puppeteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/theater/2018/11/05/king-kong-musical-broadway-puppet//|title=The new King of Broadway: Meet the King Kong musical's 2,000-pound puppet|work=EntertainmentWeekly|date=November 5, 2018|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sonny Tilders, who designed the Fiberglas and steel puppet for Global Creatures Company, "It’s the most sophisticated marionette puppet ever made”. Tilders also stated that Kong is built in layers, and is “quite similar to genuine anatomy.” Over the steel skeleton, the body shell is a mixture of hard Fiberglas, enforced inflatables, high-pressure inflatables, and bags full of styrene beans that stretch and contort like muscles. “We really wanted to create the sense that he’s a moving sculpture,” stated Tilders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/theater/king-kong-broadway-1.22652511|title='King Kong': The beauty of the beast|work=Newsday|date=October 31, 2018|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print media==
[[File:Kingkong1932.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1932 novelization of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' written by [[Delos W. Lovelace]]. This novelization was released just over two months before the film premiered in New York City on March 7, 1933.]]

In December 1932, as the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was finishing production, [[Merian C. Cooper]] asked his friend [[Delos W. Lovelace]] to adapt the film's screenplay into a novelization. Published by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], the book was released later that month on December 27, 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fullyarticulated.com/page30/page36/page35/page24/ |title=KING KONG Published Fiction, Pre-2005. The Original Hardcover |website=www.fullyarticulated.com |accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few months before the film opened in the Spring of 1933. This was a part of the film's advance marketing campaign. The novelization was credited as being based on the "Screenplay by James A. Creelman and Ruth Rose. Novelized from the Radio Picture". The byline written under the title was "Conceived by Edgar Wallace and Merian C Cooper". However, despite the credit, Wallace had very little to do with the story or the character. In an interview, author-artist [[Joe DeVito]] explains:

:"From what I know, Edgar Wallace, a famous writer of the time, died very early in the process. Little if anything of his ever appeared in the final story, but his name was retained for its saleability ... King Kong was Cooper's creation, a [[fantasy]] manifestation of his real life adventures. As many have mentioned before, Cooper was [[Carl Denham]]. His actual exploits rival anything [[Indiana Jones]] ever did in the movies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Dec04/joedevito.htm |title=Joe DeVito (Creator/Illustrator of Kong: King of Skull Island) |website=Scifidimensions.com |date= |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302124248/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Dec04/joedevito.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conclusion about Wallace's contribution was verified in the book ''The Making of King Kong'', by Orville Goldner and George E. Turner (1975). Wallace died of [[pneumonia]] complicated by [[diabetes]] on February 10, 1932, and Cooper later said, "Actually, Edgar Wallace didn't write any of ''Kong'', not one bloody word...I'd promised him credit and so I gave it to him" (p.&amp;nbsp;59).

Cooper issued a reprint of the novelization in 1965 that was published by [[Bantam Books]]. Some time later the copyright expired and the publishing rights to the book fell into the public domain. Since then a myriad of publishers have reprinted the novelization numerous times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://king-kong.fansforum.info/t283-KING-KONG-1932.htm |title=Scans of various reprints of the original novelization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone Audio produced an audio recording of the book in 2005 narrated by Stefan Rudnicki, while StarWarp Concepts released an Ebook version complete with 6 new illustrations from pulp-comic artist Paul Tuma in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/02/king-kong-unleashed-by-starwarp-concepts/ |title=King Kong unleashed by StarWarp Concepts |website=flickeringmyth.com |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the novelization, the film was serialized in a pulp magazine. In 1933, ''Mystery'' magazine published a ''King Kong'' [[serial (literature)|serial]] under the byline of Edgar Wallace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=King Kong |url=http://www.tebeosfera.com/obras/series/king_kong_cooper_wallace_rko_1933.html |language=Spanish |website=tebeosfera.com |accessdate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written by Walter F. Ripperger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img101.xooimage.com/files/4/5/2/mystery-magazine-46165a2.jpg |title=Mystery Magazine scan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This serialization was published into two parts in the February and March issues of the magazine.

In the U.K, the film was serialized in 2 different pulps both on October 28, 1933. In the juvenile ''Boys Magazine'' (Vol 23. No. 608).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi59.tinypic.com/kbahcl.jpg Boy's Magazine Cover] (jpg image).tinypic.us&lt;/ref&gt; where the serialization was uncredited, and in that month's issue of ''Cinema Weekly'' where it was credited to Edgar Wallace and written by Draycott Montagu Dell (1888–1940). This short story adaptation would later appear in the [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]] book called ''Movie Monsters'' in 1988, published by Severn House in the UK.

In 1977, a novelization of [[King Kong (1976 film)|the 1976 remake]] of ''King Kong'' was published by [[Ace Books]]. This novelization was called ''The Dino De Laurentiis Production of King Kong'' and was simply the 1976 Lorenzo Semple Jr. script published in book form. The cover was done by [[Frank Frazetta]].

In 1994 [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]] wrote and illustrated a book called ''Anthony Browne's King Kong''. Credited as "From the Story Conceived by Edgar Wallace &amp; Merian C. Cooper", the book was published by the [[Turner Publishing Company]]. It was re-released as a paperback in the U.K in 2005 by [[Transworld Publishers|Picture Corgi]].

To coincide with the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] of ''King Kong'', various books were released to tie into the film. A novelization was written by [[Christopher Golden]] based on the screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and [[Peter Jackson]]. Matt Costello wrote an official prequel to the film called ''King Kong: The Island of the Skull''. These books were published by [[Pocket Books]]. Various illustrated juvenile books were published, as well, by [[HarperCollins|Harper Books]]: ''Kong's Kingdom'' was written by Julia Simon-Kerr; ''Meet Kong and Ann'' and ''Journey to Skull Island'' were written by Jennifer Franz; ''Escape from Skull Island'' and ''Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World—Junior Novel'' were written by Laura J. Burns; ''The Search for Kong'' was written by Catherine Hapka; and finally, a Deluxe Sound Storybook of ''Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World'' was written by Don Curry. [[Weta Workshop]] released a collection of concept art from the film entitled ''The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island'' that was published by Pocket Books. The book was written and designed to resemble and read like an actual nature guide and historical record.

In 2005, Ibooks, Inc., published an unofficial book featuring King Kong called ''Kong Reborn'' by [[Russell Blackford]].

Starting in 2004, artist/writer Joe Devito began working with the Merian C. Cooper estate to write and/or illustrate various books based on the King Kong character. The first of these was an origin story labeled as an authorized sequel/prequel to the 1932 novelization of ''King Kong'' called ''Kong: King of Skull Island''. This illustrated hardcover novel was published in 2004 by [[DH Press]] and featured a story Devito co-wrote with [[Brad Strickland]] and John Michlig. It also included an introduction by [[Ray Harryhausen]]. A large-paperback edition was then released in 2005, with extra pages at the end of the book. As well, a CD audiobook narrated by Joey D'Auria was released by RadioArchives, and an interactive two-part app was released in 2011 and 2013 respectively by Copyright 1957 LLC. In 2005, DeVito and Strickland co-wrote another book together called ''Merian C. Cooper's King Kong'' for the Merian C. Cooper Estate. This book was published by [[St. Martin's Press]]. It was a full rewrite of the original 1932 novelization, which updates the language and paleontology and adds five new chapters. Some additional elements and characters tie into ''Kong: King of Skull Island'' enabling the two separate books to form a continuous storyline.
In 2013, the first of two books featuring crossovers with pulp heroes was published. To coincide with the 80th anniversary of both King Kong and [[Doc Savage]], [[Altus Press]] published ''Doc Savage: Skull Island'' in both softcover and hardcover editions. This officially sanctioned book was written by [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] and based on concepts by DeVito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | first= Matthew | last= Moring | title= Press Release: Doc Savage and King Kong Coming in March | url= http://www.altuspress.com/2013/01/press-release-doc-savage-and-king-kong-coming-in-march/ | publisher= [[Altus Press]] | date= January 29, 2012 | accessdate= February 24, 2013 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130218100701/http://www.altuspress.com/2013/01/press-release-doc-savage-and-king-kong-coming-in-march/ | archivedate= February 18, 2013 | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Altus Press published the other crossover book, this time featuring a meeting between King Kong and [[Tarzan]]. The novel, called ''[[King Kong vs. Tarzan]]'', was once again written by Will Murray and featured artwork by Devito.&lt;ref name="Forces of Geek"&gt;{{cite web | title= THE ULTIMATE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE!: King Kong Vs.

In March 2017, to coincide with the release of ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', [[Titan Books]] released a novelization of the film written by Tim Lebbon and a hardcover book ''The Art and Making of Kong: Skull Island'' by Simon Ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Official Kong: Skull Island Art Book and Movie Novelization announced!| url= http://www.scified.com/news/official-kong-skull-island-art-book-and-movie-novelization-announced | work= Scified.com | date=September 1, 2016 | accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decades, there have been numerous comic books based on King Kong by various comic-book publishers. For details on this aspect of the character's print media appearances see [[King Kong (comics)]].

==Appearances and abilities==

In his first appearance in ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), Kong was a gigantic prehistoric ape, or as RKO's publicity materials described him, "''A prehistoric type of ape''."&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite web | title=1933 RKO Press Page Scan | url=http://oi64.tinypic.com/w8bbqg.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; While gorilla-like in appearance, he had a vaguely humanoid look and at times walked upright in an anthropomorphic manner. Indeed, Carl Denham describes him as being "''neither beast nor man''".

Like most simians, Kong possesses semi-human intelligence and great physical strength. Kong's size changes drastically throughout the course of the film. While creator [[Merian C. Cooper]] envisioned Kong as being "''{{convert|40|to|50|ft|m|1}} tall''",{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=37}} animator [[Willis O'Brien]] and his crew built the models and sets scaling Kong to be only {{convert|18|ft|m|1}} tall on Skull Island, and rescaled to be {{convert|24|ft|m|1}} tall in New York.{{sfn|Goldner|Turner|1975|p=159}}

This did not stop Cooper from playing around with Kong's size as he directed the special effect sequences; by manipulating the sizes of the miniatures and the camera angles, he made Kong appear a lot larger than O'Brien wanted, even as large as {{convert|60|ft|m|1}} in some scenes.

As Cooper stated in an interview:
:{{quote|I was a great believer in constantly changing Kong's height to fit the settings and the illusions. He's different in almost every shot; sometimes he's only 18 feet tall and sometimes 60 feet or larger. This broke every rule that O'Bie and his animators had ever worked with, but I felt confident that if the scenes moved with excitement and beauty, the audience would accept any height that fitted into the scene. For example, if Kong had only been 18 feet high on the top of the Empire State Building, he would have been lost, like a little bug; I constantly juggled the heights of trees and dozens of other things. The one essential thing was to make the audience enthralled with the character of Kong so that they wouldn't notice or care that he was 18 feet high or 40 feet, just as long as he fitted the mystery and excitement of the scenes and action''.{{sfn|Van Hise|1993|p=66}}}} Concurrently, the Kong bust made for the film was built in scale with a {{convert|40|ft|m|1|adj=on}} ape,{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=36}} while the full sized hand of Kong was built in scale with a {{convert|70|ft|m|1|adj=on}} ape.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Haber, ''Kong Unbound''. Pocket Books, 2005. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, RKO's promotional materials listed Kong's official height as {{convert|50|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Toho Studios]] from [[Japan]] licensed the character for the films ''[[King Kong vs Godzilla]]'' and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]''. For more details on these versions of the character [[King Kong (Toho)|see below]].

In 1975, Italian producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] paid RKO for the remake rights to ''King Kong''. This resulted in ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' (1976). This Kong was an upright walking anthropomorphic ape, appearing even more human-like than the original. Also like the original, this Kong had semi-human intelligence and vast strength. In the 1976 film, Kong was scaled to be {{convert|42|ft|m|1}} tall on Skull island and rescaled to be {{convert|55|ft|m|1}} tall in New York.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=205}} Ten years later, Dino De Laurentiis got the approval from Universal to do a sequel called ''[[King Kong Lives]]''. This Kong had more or less the same appearance and abilities, but tended to walk on his knuckles more often and was enlarged, scaled to {{convert|60|ft|m|1}}.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=264}}

[[Universal Studios]] had planned to do a King Kong remake as far back as 1976. They finally followed through almost 30 years later, with a [[King Kong (2005 film)|three-hour film]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. Jackson opted to make Kong a gigantic silverback gorilla without any anthropomorphic features. This Kong looked and behaved more like a real gorilla: he had a large herbivore's belly, walked on his knuckles without any upright posture, and even beat his chest with his palms as opposed to clenched fists. In order to ground his Kong in realism, Jackson and the [[Weta Digital]] crew gave a name to his fictitious species ''Megaprimatus kong'' and suggested it to have evolved from the ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. Kong was the last of his kind. He was portrayed in the film as being quite old, with graying fur and battle-worn with scars, wounds, and a crooked jaw from his many fights against rival creatures. He is the dominant being on the island, the king of his world. But, like his film predecessors, he possesses considerable intelligence and great physical strength; he also appears far more nimble and agile. This Kong was scaled to a consistent height of {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} tall on both Skull Island and in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Weta Workshop, ''The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island''. Pocket Books. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson describes his central character: {{quote|We assumed that Kong is the last surviving member of his species. He had a mother and a father and maybe brothers and sisters, but they’re dead. He's the last of the huge gorillas that live on Skull Island ... when he goes ... there will be no more. He's a very lonely creature, absolutely solitary. It must be one of the loneliest existences you could ever possibly imagine. Every day, he has to battle for his survival against very formidable dinosaurs on the island, and it's not easy for him. He's carrying the scars of many former encounters with dinosaurs. I’m imagining he's probably 100 to 120 years old by the time our story begins. And he has never felt a single bit of empathy for another living creature in his long life; it has been a brutal life that he's lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=King Kong- Building a Shrewder Ape | url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=11264&amp;s=Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 2017 film ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', Kong is scaled to be {{convert|104|ft|m|1}} tall, making it the biggest incarnation in the series.&lt;ref name="Kong-Sized"&gt;[http://kongsized.kongskullislandmovie.com/ Kong-Sized]&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]] stated in regards to Kong's immense stature: {{quote|The thing that most interested me was, how big do you need to make [Kong], so that when someone lands on this island and doesn’t believe in the idea of myth, the idea of wonder – when we live in a world of social and civil unrest, and everything is crumbling around us, and technology and facts are taking over – how big does this creature need to be, so that when you stand on the ground and you look up at it, the only thing that can go through your mind is: "That's a god!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/15/kong-skull-island-director-biggest-kong|title=Kong: Skull Island director promises 'the biggest Kong that you've seen on screen'|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Franich|first=Darren|date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design, saying: {{quote|We sort of went back to the 1933 version in the sense that he’s a bipedal creature that walks in an upright position, as opposed to the anthropomorphic, anatomically correct silverback gorilla that walks on all fours. Our Kong was intended to say, like, this isn’t just a big gorilla or a big monkey. This is something that is its own species. It has its own set of rules, so we can do what we want and we really wanted to pay homage to what came before…and yet do something completely different, and If anything, our Kong is meant to be a throwback to the ’33 version. I don’t think there’s much similarity at all between our version and Peter [Jackson]’s Kong. That version is very much a scaled-up silverback gorilla, and ours is something that is slightly more exaggerated. A big mandate for us was, How do we make this feel like a classic movie monster?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/10/kong-skull-island-first-look-movie-monster|title=Kong: Skull Island unleashes exclusive first look at the movie monster'|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Smith|first=C. Molly|date=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Co-producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains, "Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he's still growing into his role as alpha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2017/02/18/kong-skull-island-production-notes-and-high-res-photos/|title=Kong: Skull Island Production Notes And High-Res Photos|work=ScifiJapan|date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal rights==
While one of the most famous movie icons in history, King Kong's [[Trademark|intellectual property status]] has been questioned since his creation, featuring in numerous allegations and court battles. The rights to the character have always been split up with no single exclusive rights holder. Different parties have also contested that various aspects are [[public domain]] material and therefore ineligible for copyright status.

When [[Merian C. Cooper]] created King Kong, he assumed that he owned the character, which he had conceived in 1929, outright. Cooper maintained that he had only licensed the character to [[RKO]] for the initial film and sequel but had otherwise owned his own creation. In 1935, Cooper began to feel something was amiss when he was trying to get a ''[[Tarzan]] vs. King Kong'' project off the ground for [[Pioneer Pictures]] (where he had assumed management of the company). After David O. Selznick suggested the project to Cooper, the flurry of legal activity over using the Kong character that followed—Pioneer had become a completely independent company by this time and access to properties that RKO felt were theirs was no longer automatic—gave Cooper pause as he came to realize that he might not have full control over this product of his own imagination.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=277}}

Years later in 1962, Cooper found out that RKO was licensing the character through John Beck to [[Toho]] studios in Japan for a film project called ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''. Cooper had assumed his rights were unassailable and was bitterly opposed to the project. In 1963 he filed a lawsuit to enjoin distribution of the movie against John Beck as well as Toho and Universal (the film's U.S. copyright holder).{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=361}} Cooper discovered that RKO had also profited from licensed products featuring the King Kong character such as model kits produced by [[Aurora Plastics Corporation]]. Cooper's executive assistant, Charles B FitzSimons, stated that these companies should be negotiating through him and Cooper for such licensed products and not RKO. In a letter to Robert Bendick, Cooper stated:
{{quote|My hassle is about King Kong. I created the character long before I came to RKO and have always believed I retained subsequent picture rights and other rights. I sold to RKO the right to make the one original picture ''King Kong'' and also, later, ''Son of Kong'', but that was all.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=362,455}} }}

Cooper and his legal team offered up various documents to bolster the case that Cooper owned King Kong and had only licensed the character to RKO for two films, rather than selling him outright. Many people vouched for Cooper's claims including David O. Selznick, who had written a letter to Mr. A. Loewenthal of the Famous Artists Syndicate in Chicago in 1932 stating (in regard to Kong), "The rights of this are owned by Mr. Merian C. Cooper."{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=362,455}} But Cooper had lost key documents through the years (he discovered these papers were missing after he returned from his World War II military service) such as a key informal yet binding letter from Mr. Ayelsworth (then president of the RKO Studio Corp.) and a formal binding letter from Mr. B. B. Kahane (the current president of RKO Studio Corp.) confirming that Cooper had only licensed the rights to the character for the two RKO pictures and nothing more.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=362}}

Without these letters it seemed Cooper's rights were relegated to the Lovelace novelization that he had copyrighted (he was able to make a deal for a [[Bantam Books]] paperback reprint and a [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]] comic adaptation of the novel, but that was all he could do). Cooper's lawyer had received a letter from John Beck's lawyer, Gordon E Youngman, that stated:

{{quote|For the sake of the record, I wish to state that I am not in negotiation with you or Mr. Cooper or anyone else to define Mr. Cooper's rights in respect of King Kong. His rights are well defined, and they are non-existent, except for certain limited publication rights.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=363,456}}}}

In a letter addressed to Douglas Burden, Cooper lamented:

{{quote|It seems my hassle over King Kong is destined to be a protracted one. They'd make me sorry I ever invented the beast, if I weren't so fond of him! Makes me feel like [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]: "Bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor."{{sfn|Vaz|2005|pp=363,456}} }}

The rights over the character did not flare up again until 1975, when [[Universal Studios]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]] were fighting over who would be able to do a ''King Kong'' remake for release the following year. De Laurentiis came up with $200,000 to buy the remake rights from RKO.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}} When Universal got wind of this, they filed a lawsuit against RKO claiming that they had a verbal agreement from them regarding the remake. During the legal battles that followed, which eventually included RKO countersuing Universal, as well as De Laurentiis filing a lawsuit claiming interference, Colonel Richard Cooper (Merian's son and now head of the Cooper estate) jumped into the fray.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=386}}

During the battles, Universal discovered that the copyright of the Lovelace novelization had expired without renewal, thus making the ''King Kong'' story a public domain one. Universal argued that they should be able to make a movie based on the novel without infringing on anyone's copyright because the characters in the story were in the public domain within the context of the public domain story.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=158}} Richard Cooper then filed a cross-claim against RKO claiming while the publishing rights to the novel had not been renewed, his estate still had control over the plot/story of King Kong.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=386}}

In a four-day bench trial in Los Angeles, Judge [[Manuel Real]] made the final decision and gave his verdict on November 24, 1976, affirming that the ''King Kong'' novelization and serialization were indeed in the public domain, and Universal could make its movie as long as it did not infringe on original elements in the 1933 RKO film,{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=387}} which had ''not'' passed into public domain.&lt;ref name=Universal&gt;''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'' [http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/552835 55 USLW 2152 797 F.2d 70; 230 U.S.P.Q. 409], ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Cir.]], July 15, 1986). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322172154/http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/552835 |date=March 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Universal postponed their plans to film a King Kong movie, called ''The Legend of King Kong'', for at least 18 months, after cutting a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that included a percentage of box office profits from his remake.){{sfn|Morton|2005|p=166}}

However, on December 6, 1976, Judge Real made a subsequent ruling, which held that all the rights in the name, character, and story of King Kong (outside of the original film and its sequel) belonged to Merian C. Cooper's estate. This ruling, which became known as the "Cooper Judgment," expressly stated that it would not change the previous ruling that publishing rights of the novel and serialization were in the public domain. It was a huge victory that affirmed the position Merian C. Cooper had maintained for years.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=387}} Shortly thereafter, Richard Cooper sold all his rights (excluding worldwide book and periodical publishing rights) to Universal in December 1976. In 1980 Judge Real dismissed the claims that were brought forth by RKO and Universal four years earlier and reinstated the Cooper judgement.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=388}}

In 1982 Universal [[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.|filed a lawsuit]] against [[Nintendo]], which had created an impish ape character called [[Donkey Kong]] in 1981 and was reaping huge profits over the video game machines. Universal claimed that Nintendo was infringing on its copyright because Donkey Kong was a blatant rip-off of King Kong.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=388}} During the court battle and subsequent appeal, the courts ruled that Universal did not have exclusive trademark rights to the King Kong character. The courts ruled that trademark was not among the rights Cooper had sold to Universal, indicating that "Cooper plainly did not obtain any trademark rights in his judgment against RKO, since the California district court specifically found that King Kong had no secondary meaning."&lt;ref name=Universal/&gt; While they had a majority of the rights, they did not outright own the King Kong name and character.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=389}} The courts ruling noted that the name, title, and character of Kong no longer signified a single source of origin so exclusive trademark rights were impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/578/911/2363221/|title=Universal City Studios v. Nintendo Co., 578 F. Supp. 911 (S.D.N.Y. 1983)|work=Justia US Law|date=December 22, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts also pointed out that Kong rights were held by three parties:
* RKO owned the rights to the original film and its sequel.
* The Dino De Laurentiis company (DDL) owned the rights to the 1976 remake.
* Richard Cooper owned worldwide book and periodical publishing rights.{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=389}}

The judge then ruled that "Universal thus owns only those rights in the King Kong name and character that RKO, Cooper, or DDL do not own."&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Mark Cotta Vaz]]'s book on p. 389, and citation 9 on p. 458, this quote is taken from a court summary from the document ''Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd., 578 F. Supp. at 924''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court of appeals would also note:
{{quote|First, Universal knew that it did not have trademark rights to King Kong, yet it proceeded to broadly assert such rights anyway. This amounted to a wanton and reckless disregard of Nintendo's rights.

Second, Universal did not stop after it asserted its rights to Nintendo. It embarked on a deliberate, systematic campaign to coerce all of Nintendo's third party licensees to either stop marketing Donkey Kong products or pay Universal royalties.

Finally, Universal's conduct amounted to an abuse of judicial process, and in that sense caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong was a part of the public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Second Court of Appeals, 1986, 77–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because Universal misrepresented their degree of ownership of King Kong (claiming they had exclusive trademark rights when they knew they did not) and tried to have it both ways in court regarding the "public domain" claims, the courts ruled that Universal acted in bad faith (see ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]''). They were ordered to pay fines and all of Nintendo's legal costs from the lawsuit. That, along with the fact that the courts ruled that there was simply no likelihood of people confusing Donkey Kong with King Kong,{{sfn|Vaz|2005|p=389}} caused Universal to lose the case and the subsequent appeal.

Since the court case, Universal still retains the majority of the character rights. In 1986 they opened a King Kong ride called ''[[King Kong Encounter]]'' at their Universal Studios Tour theme park in Hollywood (which was destroyed in 2008 by a backlot fire), and followed it up with the [[Kongfrontation]] ride at their Orlando park in 1990 (which was closed down in 2002 due to maintenance issues). They also finally made a King Kong film of their own, ''[[King Kong (2005)|King Kong]]'' (2005). In the summer of 2010, Universal opened a new [[3D computer graphics|3D]] King Kong ride called [[King Kong: 360 3-D]] at their Hollywood park replacing the destroyed ''King Kong Encounter''.&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mart |first=Hugo |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-kong27-2010jan27,0,493042.story |title=&amp;#124; King Kong to rejoin Universal tours in 3-D |work=Latimes.com |date=January 27, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2016, Universal opened a new King Kong attraction called ''[[Skull Island: Reign of Kong]]'' at [[Islands of Adventure]] in Orlando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/extras/trailers/437571-skull-island-reign-of-kong-coming-to-universal-orlando-in-2016#/slide/1|title=Skull Island: Reign of Kong Coming to Universal Orlando in 2016 |work=Comingsoon.net|date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, [[Legendary Pictures]] reached an agreement with Universal in which it will market, co-finance, and distribute Legendary's films for five years starting in 2014, the year that Legendary's similar agreement with [[Warner Bros.]] was set to expire.

RKO (whose rights consisted of only the original film and its sequel) had its film library acquired by [[Ted Turner]] in 1986 via his company [[Turner Entertainment]]. Turner merged his company into [[Time Warner]] in 1996, which is how they own the rights to those two films today, although the copyright over the entire RKO films library (including King Kong and The Son Of Kong) is still held by RKO Pictures LLC. In 2017, [[Warner Brothers]] co-produced the film ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' and in 2020 will co-produce the film ''[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]'', after Legendary Pictures brought the projects from Universal to their company to build a [[MonsterVerse|shared cinematic universe]].

DDL (whose rights were limited to only their 1976 remake) did a sequel in 1986 called ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' (but they still needed Universal's permission to do so).{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=239, 241}} Today most of DDL's film library is owned by [[Studio Canal]], which includes the rights to those two films. The domestic (North American) rights to the 1976 ''[[King Kong (1976)|King Kong]]'' film still remain with the film's original distributor [[Paramount Pictures]], with [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]] handling television rights to the film via their license with Paramount.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Overview===
In the 1960s, Japanese studio [[Toho]] licensed the character from RKO and produced two films that featured the character, ''[[King Kong vs Godzilla]]'' (1962) and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' (1967). Toho's interpretation differed greatly from the original in size and abilities.

Among [[kaiju]], King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of [[Godzilla]]. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong's most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent's fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= King Kong Stats Page | url=http://www.kaijuphile.com/rodansroost/kaijustats/kingkong.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'', Kong was scaled to be {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. This version of Kong was given the ability to harvest electricity as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= King Kong | url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/kaiju/king_kong.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''King Kong Escapes'', Kong was scaled to be {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. This version was more similar to the original, where he relied on strength and intelligence to fight and survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=King Kong (2nd Generation) | url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/kaiju/king_kong2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than residing on [[Skull Island]], Toho's version resided on Faro Island in ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'' and on Mondo Island in ''King Kong Escapes''.

[[File:Kingkongsegment.jpg|thumb|left|King Kong as depicted in the cartoon show.]]

In 1966, Toho planned to produce "''Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah''" as a co-production with [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] however, [[Ishirō Honda]] was unavailable at the time to direct the film and Rankin/Bass backed out of the project, along with the King Kong license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/cutting_room/king_kong_vs_ebirah.htm|title=Lost Project: Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah|work=Toho Kingdom|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toho still proceeded with the production, replacing King Kong with Godzilla at the last minute and shot the film as ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]''. Elements of King Kong's character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla's uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Dayo.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=135}} Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced ''King Kong Escapes'' in 1967, loosely based on [[The King Kong Show|Rankin/Bass' animated show]].

Toho Studios wanted to remake ''King Kong vs. Godzilla'', which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the film as well as to celebrate Godzilla's upcoming fortieth anniversary. However they were unable to obtain the rights to use Kong, and inititially intended to use Mechani-Kong as Godzilla's next adversary. But it was soon learned that even using a mechanical creature who ''resembled'' Kong would be just as problematic legally and financially for them. As a result, the film became ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'', with no further attempts to use Kong in any way.

===Television===
* ''[[The King Kong Show]]'' (1966) - In this cartoon series, the giant gorilla befriends the Bond family, with whom he goes on various adventures, fighting monsters, robots, mad scientists and other threats. Produced by [[Rankin/Bass]], the animation was provided in Japan by [[Toei Animation]], making this the very first [[anime]] series to be commissioned right out of Japan by an American company. The show debuted with an hour-long episode and then was followed by 24 half-hour episodes that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This was also the cartoon that resulted in the production of [[Toho]]'s ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'' (originally planned as a Kong film) and ''King Kong Escapes''.
* ''[[Kong: The Animated Series]]'' (2000) - An animated production from [[BKN International]] set many decades after the events of the original film. "Kong" is cloned by a scientist named Dr. Lorna Jenkins who also used the DNA of her grandson Jason to bring it to life. Jason uses the Cyber-Link to combine with Kong in order to fight evil, allowing Kong to draw on Jason's knowledge of hand-to-hand combat. This show, coming a few years after the release of Centropolis' ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'' repeated at least two of the monsters (although with vastly different backgrounds) seen in the Godzilla series. The show ran 40 episodes and aired on [[Fox Kids]]. After the series ended, two [[direct-to-DVD]] movies were produced. ''Kong: King of Atlantis'', released in 2005 and ''Kong: Return to the Jungle'', released in 2007. The first movie was produced to try and cash in on the 2005 [[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong remake]] and that same year, [[Toon Disney]]'s "[[Jetix]]" would air not only this movie but the original series as well to also take advantage of the 2005 movie's release.
* ''[[Kong: King of the Apes]]'' (2016) - An animated series by [[41 Entertainment]] aired [[Netflix]]. The first episode aired as a two-hour movie followed by 12 half-hour episodes. [[Avi Arad]] is executive producer of the series. The series synopsis reads "Set in 2050, Kong becomes a wanted fugitive after wreaking havoc at Alcatraz Island's Natural History and Marine Preserve. What most humans on the hunt for the formidable animal do not realize, though, is that Kong was framed by an evil genius who plans to terrorize the world with an army of enormous robotic dinosaurs. As the only beast strong enough to save humanity from the mechanical dinos, Kong must rely on the help of three kids who know the truth about him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/10/01/netflix-kong-king-of-the-apes/?hootPostID=7ae72b916a37f8d1ca250676ec40553c|title=Netflix sets plans for animated series 'Kong - King of the Apes'|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 1, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''King Kong of Skull Island'' (2019) - An upcoming live action series based on Joe Devito's book of the same name, which was produced with the Merian C. Cooper estate. It is being developed by [[Stacy Title]] and [[Jonathan Penner]] (''[[The Bye Bye Man]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/king-kong-tv-series-female-lead-marvista-entertainment-im-global-tv-1202071347/|title=King Kong Female-Led TV Series In Works At MarVista Entertainment &amp; IM Global TV|work=Deadline|date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related films===
* The premise of a giant gorilla brought to the United States for entertainment purposes, and subsequently wreaking havoc, was recycled in ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949), through the same studio and with much of the same principal talent as the 1933 original. It was [[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|remade]] in 1998.
* ''King Kong'' bears some similarities with an earlier effort by special effects head [[Willis O'Brien]], ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), in which [[dinosaur]]s are found living on an isolated [[plateau]]. Scenes from a failed O'Brien project, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', were re-used for the 1933 ''Kong''. ''Creation'' was also about a group of people stumbling into an environment where prehistoric creatures have survived extinction.
* ''[[The Mighty Kong]]'', a [[direct to video]] 1998 animated [[musical film|musical]] remake of the 1933 film. It featured the voices of [[Jodi Benson]] as Ann Darrow and [[Dudley Moore]] as Carl Denham. This film also featured a song score by the [[Sherman Brothers]]. At the end of the film, King Kong falls from the Empire State Building after getting out of the net that the blimps were using on him. Due to this being a family film, King Kong survives the fall.
* ''[[Banglar King Kong]]'' – An unofficial [[Bangladesh]]i musical based on the King Kong story and directed by Iftekar Jahan. The film uses large amounts of stock footage from ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and premiered in June 2010 in the Purnima Cinema Hall in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://roberthood.net/blog/index.php/2010/06/11/the-ongoing-travels-of-king-kong/ The Ongoing Travels of King Kong]. Roberthood.net (June 11, 2010). Retrieved on December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other similar giant ape films include:
** The 1961 British film ''[[Konga (film)|Konga]]'' where a chimpanzee is enlarged after being fed a growth serum by a deranged scientist and attacks [[London]].
** The 1969 American film ''[[The Mighty Gorga]]'' which features a circus owner's quest to capture a giant gorilla in an African jungle. Unlike King Kong, Gorga remains in Africa.
** The 1976 [[Korea]]n [[3-D film|3D]] film ''[[Ape (1976 film)|Ape]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074148/ Ape (1976)]. imdb.com&lt;/ref&gt; where a giant ape runs amok in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].
** The 1976 ''[[Queen Kong]]'', another British film that parodies King Kong with a gender reversal between the giant ape and the object of the ape's affection
** The 1977 [[Hong Kong]] film ''[[The Mighty Peking Man]]'' that featured a huge [[Bigfoot]]/ape-like creature that attacks Hong Kong after it was brought to Hong Kong from its territory somewhere in India near the Himalayas.
** The 1977 ''[[Yeti: The 20th Century Giant]]'', an [[Italy|Italian]]/[[Canadian]] film where the [[Yeti|abominable snowman]] runs amok in Ontario after a millionaire industrialist thaws it out of a block of ice.

===King Kong in the name===
[[File:kingkongedo38.jpg|frame|A publicity still of Isamu Yamaguchi playing King Kong on stage from ''[[Wasei Kingu Kongu]]'']]
There were other movies to have borne the "King Kong" name that have nothing to do with the character.
* A lost silent Japanese short, {{nihongo|''[[Wasei Kingu Kongu|Japanese King Kong]]''|和製キングコング|Wasei Kingu Kongu}}, directed by [[Torajiro Saito]], featuring an all-Japanese cast and produced by the [[Shochiku]] company, was released in 1933. The plot revolves around a down-on-his-luck man who plays the King Kong character in a vaudeville theater to earn money to woo a girl he likes. The film does not actually involve King Kong ''per se''.
* {{nihongo|''[[King Kong Appears in Edo]]''|江戸に現れたキングコング|Edo ni Arawareta Kingu Kongu}}. A lost two-part silent Japanese period piece that was produced by a company called [[Zensho Kinema]] in 1938. The film revolves around kidnapping and revenge amongst the characters. The "King Kong" in this film is a trained ape (that looks more like a Yeti) who is used to kidnap one of the characters. Judging by the plot synopsis presented by periodicals at the time, the "King Kong" is regular-sized and is only depicted as gigantic on the advertisements for promotional purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=高槻真樹 (Maki Takatsuki) |title=戦前日本ＳＦ映画創世記　ゴジラは何でできているか (Senzen Nihon SF Eiga Souseiki)'' |publisher=河出書房新社 (Kawadeshobo Shinsha publishing) |year=2014 |pp=183–188 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1959 Hong Kong film ''King Kong's Adventures in the Heavenly Palace'' which featured a normal-sized gorilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= King Kong's Adventures in the Heavenly Palace | url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/6109075.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Hindi films ''King Kong'' (1962) and ''Tarzan and King Kong'' (1965) which featured the professional wrestler [[Emile Czaja|King Kong]] and has nothing to do with the famous movie monster, although the latter film featured a normal-sized gorilla.
* The 1968 Italian film ''[[Kong Island]]'' (''Eva, la Venere selvaggia'', literally '' Eve, the Wild Woman'') which was advertised in the U.S. as ''[[Kong Island|King of Kong Island]]''. Despite the American title, the film featured normal-sized gorillas and takes place in Africa.
* The 1981 Mexican film ''Las Muñecas Del King Kong'' (''The Dolls of King Kong'') which featured exotic jungle girls. The "King Kong" in the film was simply a giant ape statue on top of a building.

===Parodies and cameos===
{{sources|section|date=October 2018}}
* In ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', the giant gorilla "It" (with the vocal effects provided by [[Allen Swift]]) is a larger [[Counterfeit consumer goods|knock-off]] of King Kong and is most likely named "It" due to copyright reasons. Baron [[Victor Frankenstein|Boris von Frankenstein]] didn't send an invite to "It" since "It" can be a bore and had crushed the Isle of Evil's [[wild boar]]s the last time "It" was invited, as he explained to his assistant Francesca. Boris has his zombies patrol the island just in case "It" shows up uninvited. When "It" does show up, it goes on a rampage and snatches up the monsters and Francesca (where "It" develops a crush on her) and climbs the Isle of Evil's tallest mountain. Boris convinces "It" to take him instead of Francesca which "It" complies to. After Francesca is off the island with Boris' nephew Felix Flanken, Boris sacrifices his life where he drops the vial containing the secret of destruction which destroys himself, "It," the Isle of Evil, and everyone else that was on it at the time.
* In ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'' (a "prequel of sorts" to ''Mad Monster Party?''), there was a knock-off of King Kong called Modzoola.
* The corpse of the 1976 King Kong makes an unauthorized appearance in the film ''[[Bye Bye Monkey]]''.
* King Kong appears in the 1996 [[Imax]] film ''[[Special Effects: Anything Can Happen]]''. In this film, the classic climax of the 1933 film is recreated with modern (at the time) digital special effects.
* ''[[King of the Lost World]]'' (a direct-to-video movie produced by [[The Asylum]]) taking elements from both King Kong and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. The film was released on December 13, 2005, just one day before the theatrical release of Peter Jackson's version of King Kong. The ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'' is a giant ape that appeared in the 2005 movie ''King of the Lost World'' (a loose adaptation of ''The Lost World'' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). It is estimated to be {{convert|9.8|ft|m|0}} high and has an interest in attacking intruders, as it threw a flight attendant in the beginning of the movie. It eventually got intimidated when a plane chases it with a torch.
* Kong appears in the ''[[Where My Dogs At?]]'' episode "Buddy and Woof Do the MTV Movie Awards." He appears on the stage background at the [[MTV Movie Awards]] hosted by [[Jimmy Fallon]] (who was the back-up host after [[Dave Chappelle]] slipped on a banana peel during his intro and had to be taken to the hospital). After Jimmy Fallon makes a comparison of King Kong and [[Jack Black]] after [[Jessica Simpson]] gave birth to Jack Black's child, King Kong ended up crushing Jimmy Fallon with his fists much to everyone's delight. When the MTV Movie Awards are over, King Kong gets out of his shackles and heads home.
* King Kong had cameo appearances in two [[Warner Bros]] films:
** In the 2017 film ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', Kong (voiced by [[Seth Green]]) appears as an inmate of the [[Phantom Zone]] and is among the Phantom Zone inmates that [[Joker (character)|Joker]] releases in order to take over [[Gotham City]]. During Joker's campaign, King Kong destroys one of the towers that [[Batman]] and the others hide in. With help from [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]], and his enemies, Batman is able to defeat King Kong and send him and his fellow Phantom Zone inmates (including the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], the [[Dalek]]s and [[Lord Voldemort]]) back to the Phantom Zone.
** In the 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' (based on the [[Ready Player One|book of the same name]]), Kong appears as one of the hazards of the OASIS racetrack alongside [[King Ghidorah]] and the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' from the ''[[Jurassic Park (franchise)|Jurassic Park]]'' films. In the film, he is placed at the end of the racetrack near the Empire State Building and it is impossible to defeat, prompting the protagonist Wade Watts ("Parzival" in the [[video game]]) to search a solution in the game's creator's life to a dialogue which urges him to go backwards traveling through the [[Source code|code]] of the game, in a [[tunnel]] which ends behind King Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/262298/catch-chuckys-cameo-trailer-steven-spielbergs-new-movie/|title=Did You Catch Chucky and King Kong’s Cameo in the Trailer For Steven Spielberg’s New Movie?|first=Mike|last=Sprague|date=December 12, 2017|accessdate=December 13, 2017|work=[[DreadCentral]]|publisher=[[Dreadcentral.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{in popular culture|section|date=October 2018}}
King Kong, as well as the series of films featuring him, have been featured many times in popular culture outside of the films themselves, in forms ranging from straight copies to parodies and joke references, and in media from comics to video games.
[[File:Titano-Kong.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|The [[DC Comics]] character [[Titano]] is clearly modeled on King Kong (here seen climbing the [[Daily Planet]] building and confronting [[Superman]]). From ''Superman'' #138. Art by Curt Swan and Stan Kaye.]]

[[The Beatles]]' 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' includes a scene of the characters opening a door to reveal King Kong abducting a woman from her bed.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]" features a segment called "King Homer" which parodies the plot of the original film, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] as Kong and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] in the Ann Darrow role. It ends with King Homer marrying Marge and eating her father.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The British comedy TV series ''[[The Goodies]]'' made an episode called "[[Kitten Kong]]", in which a giant cat called Twinkle roams the streets of [[London]], knocking over the [[British Telecom Tower]].

The controversial [[World War II]] [[Dutch resistance]] fighter [[Christiaan Lindemans]] — eventually arrested on suspicion of having betrayed secrets to the Nazis — was nicknamed "King Kong" due to his being exceptionally tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British Intelligence in the Second World War: Volume 4, Security and Counter-Intelligence |year=1990 |p=373 |first1=F. H. |last1=Hinsley |first2=C. A. G. |last2=Simkins |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] recorded an instrumental about "King Kong" in 1967 and featured it on the album ''[[Uncle Meat]]''. Zappa went on to make many other versions of the song on albums such as ''[[Make a Jazz Noise Here]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 3]]'', ''[[Ahead of Their Time]]'', and ''[[Beat the Boots]]''.

[[The Kinks]] recorded a song called "King Kong" as the B-side to their 1969 "[[Plastic Man (song)|Plastic Man]]" single.

In 1972, a {{convert|550|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} fiberglass [[King Kong statue|statue of King Kong]] was erected in Birmingham, England.

The second track of [[The Jimmy Castor Bunch]] album ''Supersound'' from 1975 is titled "King Kong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/super-sound-mw0000859947|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Filk Music]] artists [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]]'s "Song of Kong", which explores the reasons why King Kong and Godzilla should not be roommates, appears on their 2001 album ''Smell No Evil''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Daniel Johnston]] wrote and recorded a song called "King Kong" on his fifth self-released [[music cassette]], ''[[Yip/Jump Music]]'' in 1983, rereleased on [[CD]] and double [[LP album|LP]] by [[Homestead Records]] in 1988. The song is an [[a cappella]] narrative of the original movie's story line. [[Tom Waits]] recorded a cover version of the song with various sound effects on the 2004 release, ''[[The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered]]''.

[[ABBA]] recorded "[[King Kong Song]]" for their 1974 album ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]''. Although later singled out by ABBA songwriters [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Björn Ulvaeus]] as one of their weakest tracks.,&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes, ''Waterloo'' re-issue, Carl Magnus Palm, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it was released as a single in 1977 to coincide with the [[King Kong (1976 film)|1976 film]] playing in theatres.

==Theme park rides==
[[File:Skull Island (37281017260).jpg|thumb|Skull Island: Reign of Kong at [[Universal's Islands of Adventure]]]]
Universal Studios has had popular King Kong attractions at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in [[Universal City, California]] and [[Universal Orlando]] Resort in [[Orlando, Florida]].

The first King Kong attraction was called [[King Kong Encounter]] and was a part of the [[Studio Tour]] at Universal Studios Hollywood. Based upon the 1976 film [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], the tour took the guests in the world of 1976 [[New York City]], where Kong was seen wreaking havoc on the city. It was opened on June 14, 1986 and was destroyed on June 1, 2008 in a major fire. Universal opened a replacement 3D King Kong ride called ''[[King Kong: 360 3-D]]'' that opened on July 1, 2010, based upon [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 film ''King Kong'']].&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36239/badass-new-teaser-promo-universals-new-king-kong-ride |title=Badass New Teaser Promo for Universal's New King Kong Ride |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date= |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second more elaborate ride was constructed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] on June 7, 1990, called [[Kongfrontation]]. The ride featured a stand-alone extended version of King Kong Encounter and pinned guests escaping on the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]] from Kong who was rampaging across New York City. The ride was closed down on September 8, 2002, and was replaced with [[Revenge of the Mummy]] on May 21, 2004.

On May 6, 2015, Universal Orlando announced that a new King Kong attraction titled ''[[Skull Island: Reign of Kong]]'' will open at [[Islands of Adventure]] in the summer of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.universalorlando.com/whats-new/reign-of-kong/ |title=King Kong Roars to Life in Groundbreaking new Attraction |publisher=blog.universalorlando.com |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first King Kong themed ride in Orlando since Kongfrontation closed down 14 years earlier at Universal Studios Florida. It officially opened on July 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=West|first1=Mike|title=Now Open - Skull Island: Reign of Kong|url=http://blog.universalorlando.com/whats-new/reign-of-kong-now-open/|website=Universal Orlando Close Up|publisher=Universal Orlando Resort|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Looting of the Eastern Mausoleum''' was an incident in which some of the major [[mausoleum]]s of the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] in the [[Eastern Qing Tombs]] were looted by troops under the command of the warlord [[Sun Dianying]].

==Prelude==
In the early hours of June 8, 1928, warlord [[Sun Dianying]] led his army into the Eastern Mausoleums of the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[Malanyu]], northwest of [[Zunhua]], [[Hebei]]. This was the final resting place of the Qing emperors and empresses, and was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the [[Forbidden City]] of Peking. The 78-square-kilometer (30.1-square-mile) burial site was for five emperors, 15 empresses and 136 imperial [[concubine]]s within 15 tombs, including the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] (1638–61), the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (1654–1722), the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1711–99) and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (1835–1908).

==Looting operation==
On June 12, 1928, Sun Dianying ordered a large-scale graverobbing operation that removed almost all the underground funeral objects of the Huifeiling and Yuling Mausoleums and the underground palace of Puxiangyu East Dingling. Ma Futian, Regimental Commander in the 28th Army of [[Zhang Zuolin]], had quietly occupied Malanyu. Sun Dianying ordered [[Tan Wenjiang]], one of his division commanders, to capture the tomb area. At dawn on July 2, Ma Futian was driven away and Tan's army looted the mausoleums in Malanyu. After that, Sun's army went straight to the area of the Eastern Qing Tombs, pretending to engage in war exercises in the area. Tan Wenjiang placed policemen all around, denying access to the area and signs declared the army was "protecting the Tombs" to prevent interference.&lt;ref name="qing east"&gt;The Qing East Imperial Tombs http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/atam/115430.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[looting]] operation was directed by Sun Dianying from his car. Trucks were on hand to speed away with the loot as soon as they were loaded. At midnight the engineering corps blew up the entrance, opening the passage leading to the underground palace. The stone door was pried open to give access to the rear room of the grave. Sun gave first priority to officers above battalion commander level to collect treasure for themselves. Ordinary soldiers were eventually allowed to take the leftovers.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

The robbers first took the large treasure objects placed around the remains of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], such as [[jadeite]] watermelons, grasshoppers and vegetables, jade lotus and coral. They snatched objects found beneath the body and ravaged the corpse itself, taking her imperial robe; tearing off her undergarments, shoes and socks, and taking all the pearls and jewels on her body. The looters even pried open her jaws and took the rare pearl from her mouth. Ultimately, they looted the objects under the coffin that had been favorites of Cixi when she was alive.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

While Tan Wenjiang was robbing Cixi's tomb, Han Dabao, a brigade commander under Sun Dianying, led another group to the Yuling Mausoleum and declared his intention to conduct a war exercise. They blew the entrance and doorways of the underground palace and rushed into the tomb. The coffins of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] and his two empresses and three concubines were pried open, all the valuables looted and the skeletons thrown into the mud. The soldiers then rushed to the Yuling Mausoleum and the underground palace of Puxiangyu East Dingling and looted what they could.

Newspapers reported the graverobbing and the news spread throughout China and around the world. People were outraged. China's dethroned last emperor [[Puyi]], who had dismissed Sun from his post, sent telegrams to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[Yan Xishan]], Commander of Garrison Force in Beijing; the Central Committee of [[Kuomintang]] and local newspapers asking them to punish Sun Dianying severely. Many others also called for punishment. However, Sun Dianying bribed those who were in a position to discipline him and nothing was done.&lt;ref name="qing east"/&gt;

After removing the treasures from the graves, Sun and his army sealed the empty chambers with stones. They carted off some of China's greatest treasures, but some things could not be easily removed and the imposing buildings of the mausoleum still survive.&lt;ref name="Qing"&gt;Qing Tombs Tell Tales http://www.china-sd.net/eng/sdnews/listnews.asp?classid=159&amp;siteid=2483&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1697">'''MUX, Incorporated''' is a [[company]] in the fictional, [[The Hardy Boys]] Casefiles [[book series]].  The word mux is an [[abbreviation]] of the word [[multiplexer]], which is a communications switching device.  

At the time of Casefiles #21 ''Street Spies'', MUX was a multinational front for a band of [[technology]] pirates, in [[New York City]], that were stealing new product ideas from world leaders in miniaturized transmitters and receivers (like ''World-Wide Technologies'') after the products were out of the expensive design and development stage.  Then they would tap the enormous [[Third-World]] labor pool and sell the products much cheaper than companies like ''World-Wide Technologies'' could.  The Hardys ended up catching the MUX agent in charge of that particular operation, Louise Trent and her strong-arm man, Chung Lei. The rest of MUX stayed intact and left the USA. Later, at the time of Casefile #37, they came back to the country to steal a highly advanced [[computer chip]] created by ''Prometheus Computing''.  But the Hardys again managed to foil MUX’s plan and catch the agents involved, even so the group is still a large.

In Casefile #21 the company’s [[finances]] were funneled through off-shore [[bank]]s in the [[Caribbean]] and in [[Panama]]. Its products were shipped through [[Taiwan]] from other countries on the [[Pacific Rim]].              

The Hardys have never been able to find out who the mastermind behind MUX is — the mastermind who has covered himself (or herself) with layers upon layers of [[umbrella organizations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">A '''mating pool''' is a concept used in [[evolutionary computation]]. More specifically, it is one of the four steps in [[genetic algorithm]] operations that places value on the [[Fitness function|fitness]] of individuals in a population.&lt;ref&gt;Regupathi, R. “Cost Optimization Of Multistoried Rc Framed Structure Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm.”  ''International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET)'', vol. 04, no. 07, July 2017, p. 890., www.irjet.net/archives/V4/i7/IRJET-V4I7211.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typically, the population of [[candidate solution]]s for a genetic algorithm is treated as a single entity. An alternative approach is to separate only individuals who will produce offspring from the remainder of the current population. These are placed into a ''mating pool''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47717957|title=Foundations of genetic programming|last=B.)|first=Langdon, W. B. (William|date=2002|publisher=Springer|others=Poli, Riccardo, 1961-|year=|isbn=3540424512|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=47717957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selection_(genetic_algorithm)|Selection operators]] are applied to the entire population in order to determine the fittest individuals of the current population, which are then placed into the mating pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol1/hmw/article1.html#introduction|title=Introduction to Genetic Algorithms|website=www.doc.ic.ac.uk|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic operator|Genetic operations]], such as crossover and mutation, are then applied to the mating pool to create the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kal-el.ugr.es/GAGS/gags-tutorial/node3.html|title=Genetic Operators|website=kal-el.ugr.es|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways to create a mating pool, including selecting the best individuals based on certain criteria, known as [[truncation selection]], and choosing individuals randomly with the probability of being chosen based on fitness level, known as [[fitness proportionate selection]]. Additionally, a random sub-group can be selected from the population and then the individuals with the highest fitness are selected for the mating pool, known as [[tournament selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39261941|title=Rough sets and current trends in computing : first international conference, RSCTC '98, Warsaw, Poland, June 22-26, 1998 : proceedings|date=1998|publisher=Springer|others=Polkowski, Lech., Skowron, Andrzej.|isbn=3540646558|location=Berlin|oclc=39261941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Dalton Cash''' (November 10, 1934 – October 11, 1986) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[first baseman]] who spent almost his entire career with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. An outstanding power hitter, his 377 career [[home run]]s were the fourth most by an [[American League]] left-handed hitter when he retired, behind [[Babe Ruth]], [[Ted Williams]] and [[Lou Gehrig]]; his 373 home runs with the Tigers rank second in franchise history behind his teammate [[Al Kaline]] (399). He also led the AL in [[assist (baseball)|assists]] three times and [[fielding percentage]] twice; he ranked among the all-time leaders in assists (4th, 1317) and [[double play]]s (10th, 1347) upon his retirement, and was fifth in AL history in games at first base (1943). He was known to fans and teammates during his playing days as "Stormin' Norman."

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Cash was born in [[Justiceburg, Texas|Justiceburg]], [[Garza County]], [[Texas]], and attended (what was then) [[Sul Ross State University|Sul Ross State Teachers College]], where he was All-Lone Star Conference in [[American football|football]] as well as playing baseball; he was drafted by the [[Chicago Bears]] as a running back in [[1955 NFL Draft|1955]], but declined to play pro football.&lt;ref name="The Ballplayers"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Charlton, James |author2=Shatzkin, Mike |author3=Holtje, Stephen |title=The Ballplayers: baseball's ultimate biographical reference |publisher=Arbor House/William Morrow |location=New York |year=1990 |pages=167–168 |isbn=0-87795-984-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1955, he spent 1957 in the military&lt;ref name="The Ballplayers"/&gt; and made his debut with the team in {{mlby|1958}}, seeing limited play as an outfielder and pinch hitter. He appeared in 58 games for the {{mlby|1959}} AL pennant-winners; the August 25 acquisition of [[Ted Kluszewski]] left him on the White Sox bench. He was hitless in four pinch-hitting appearances in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]]. In December of that year, he was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]] in an eight-player deal that brought [[Minnie Miñoso]] back to Chicago,&lt;ref name="The Ballplayers"/&gt; but the Indians [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Frank Lane]] traded Cash to Detroit for [[Steve Demeter]], who would play only four more games; both Chicago and Cleveland were haunted by Cash for the next 15 years, as he won a [[batting average|batting title]] in 1961 and a [[World Series ring]] in 1968 wearing a Detroit uniform.

===Detroit Tigers===
Cash filled the middle of the Tigers lineup for 15 seasons as part of one of the sport's top offenses.

In 1960, Cash grounded into no double plays, the first American League player to accomplish that since league records on this stat were started in 1940.

He enjoyed his breakout season in {{mlby|1961}}. He led the AL with a .361 average, and had 41 home runs (sixth in the AL), 132 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (fourth), 119 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] (fourth), 124 [[base on balls|walks]] (second) for a .488 [[on-base percentage]] (first), and 354 [[total bases]] (second) for a .662 [[slugging average]] (second); but his season was overshadowed by the 61 home runs of [[Roger Maris]], and teammate [[Rocky Colavito]] finished with more home runs and RBI. Still, his .361 average would be the highest by any major league player in the 1960s. The Tigers finished 101–61 for their best regular season record since 1934, and scored the most runs in baseball, though they finished second in the AL, eight games behind the [[New York Yankees]]; Cash was fourth in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting. In addition, Cash later admitted to using an illegal [[corked bat]] during the 1961 season, demonstrating how he had drilled a hole in his bats and filled it with a mixture of sawdust, cork and glue. His 1961 statistics turned out to be career highs which he rarely approached again &amp;ndash; in later years, he never reached 100 runs or 100 RBI, and never batted above .283. His 118-point drop to a .243 average in {{mlby|1962}} was the largest ever by a batting champion.

Cash later said of the 1961 season: "It was a freak. Even at the time, I realized that. Everything I hit seemed to drop in, even when I didn't make good contact. I never thought I'd do it again."&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"/&gt;

Pitcher [[Mickey Lolich]] once asked Cash why he never hit for a high average after that season. "He told me, `[[Jim Campbell (baseball executive)|Jim Campbell]] pays me to hit home runs,'" said Lolich, referring to the team's general manager in those years. "Norm then said, `I can get hits if I want to, just watch tomorrow.' The next day he went 3-for-4."&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"/&gt;

On June 11, 1961, Cash became the first Detroit Tiger to hit a home run ball out of Tiger Stadium. Cash hit the ball over Tiger Stadium's right field roof four times in his career.&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"/&gt;

On June 27, 1963, he played an entire game at first base without a chance, as the Minnesota Twins won 10–6.[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1963/B06270MIN1963.htm]

Even on his own team, Cash was overshadowed by his future Hall-of-Fame roommate Kaline. But while his batting average fell off sharply after 1961, Cash hit 30 or more homers four more times, and at least 20 in ten of the next eleven seasons; he also finished second in the league in home runs three times (behind [[Harmon Killebrew]] in 1962, [[Tony Conigliaro]] in 1965, and [[Bill Melton]] in 1971), with the Tigers finishing among the AL's top three scoring teams every year from 1961 through 1968.

Cash was also considered one of the better defensive first basemen of the 1960s, leading the league in [[putout]]s (1961), fielding percentage (1964, 1967) and assists (1965–67).

In the [[1968 World Series]], Cash hit .385 (10-26) with one home run.  With two out in the seventh inning of Game 7, Cash singled to start a three-run rally that broke a scoreless tie and propelled the team to its first title since 1945. He later hit a home run to give Detroit a 1–0 lead in Game 1 of the [[1972 American League Championship Series]], though the Tigers went on to lose the game and the series.

He was released by the Tigers in August {{mlby|1974}} after hitting .228 in 53 games.

====Career statistics====
Cash was a career .271 hitter with 377 home runs, 1104 RBI, 1046 runs, 1820 hits, 241 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 41 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 43 [[stolen base]]s, a .374 on-base percentage, and a .488 slugging average in 2089 games. He holds Tigers career defensive records at first base in games (1912), putouts (14,926), assists (1303), and double plays (1328), having broken the marks set by [[Hank Greenberg]] and [[Rudy York]]. He had a .992 fielding percentage at first base in his career.

Cash summed up his success as follows: "I owe my success to expansion pitching, a short right-field fence, and my hollow bats."&lt;ref name="urlNorm Cash Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=cashno01 |title=Norm Cash Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career, Cash claimed he used a [[corked bat]] in 1961, even showing ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' how he made one.&lt;ref name="Baseball: The Biographical Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pietrusza, David |author2=Matthew Silverman |author3=Gershman, Michael |title=Baseball: The Biographical Encyclopedia |publisher=Total Sports |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=183–184 |isbn=1-892129-34-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with fans and players===
Apart from his batting accomplishments, Cash was a favorite with his teammates, the media, and Tiger fans. He was known for his hard living and his sense of humor.

On July 15, 1973, as [[Nolan Ryan]] was working on his second career no-hitter, Cash went to the plate with two outs in the bottom of the ninth (after striking out his previous three at-bats), holding a table leg from the clubhouse instead of a regulation bat. The stunt drew immediate action by the umpire, who ordered Cash to use a legal bat. Cash popped out using a regulation bat to end the game. [http://mlb.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070612&amp;content_id=2021545&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb]

Teammate [[Jim Northrup (baseball)|Jim Northrup]] told the story as follows: "In his last at-bat, Norm walked up to the plate with a table leg from the locker room. The plate umpire, [[Ron Luciano]], says, `You can't use that up here.' Cash says, `Why not, I won't hit him anyway.' He then gets a bat, then hit a popup to shortstop to end the game.  As he was walking away he says to Luciano, `See, I told ya.'"&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_60/ai_76928886 |title=Former Tiger Norm Cash |format= |work= Baseball Digest|accessdate=2008-08-07 | first=Bill | last=Dow | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When you mention Norm Cash, I just smile", said [[Al Kaline]], who had a locker adjacent to Cash's for years. "He was just a fun guy to be around and a great teammate. He always came ready to play."&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"/&gt;

Once Cash was trapped between first and second base about to be tagged out. He stopped in his tracks and formed a "T" with his hands to call time-out. There was also a time when Cash missed a foul ball in the stands, turned a little boy's cap around, stuck his hand into the young fan's popcorn box and said, "Thanks, kid", as the boy looked up in bewilderment.&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"/&gt;

One trick Cash frequently tried, occurred when play resumed after a rain delay, Northrup recalled. "If Norman was on second before the rain delay, he would go to third", Northrup said. "If he was on first, he would go to second." Northrup said: "Norm had more fun than anybody."&lt;ref name="Baseball Digest"/&gt;

Cash was also noted for not ever wearing a batting helmet during his major league career, being one of the few veteran players who was permitted not to do so after helmets were mandated in {{mlby|1971}}. Protective liners, however, were required to be worn inside their caps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/cooperstown-confidential-batting-without-a-helmet/ Cooperstown Confidential: batting without a helmet] Retrieved June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
After retiring from baseball, Cash signed with the [[Detroit Caesars]], a professional softball team, and played two seasons (1977–1978). The Caesars played in the American Professional Slow Pitch Softball League (APSPL), winning league titles in both seasons with Cash. The team was owned by [[Mike Ilitch]], who would later become the owner of the Detroit Tigers. The Caesars had extensive talent from the amateur softball leagues, and both Cash and fellow former Tiger [[Jim Northrup (baseball)|Jim Northrup]] played part-time roles.

Cash was a [[color commentator]] for [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Baseball]]'' in 1976, and for Tiger telecasts on [[ONTV (pay TV)|ONTV]] pay-cable from 1981-83.

In October 1986, Cash [[drowning|drowned]] in an accident off [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] in northern [[Lake Michigan]] when he slipped off a dock and struck his head. His body was discovered about 11 a.m. in 15 feet of water at Beaver Island.&lt;ref name="New York Times obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DD143CF930A25753C1A960948260 |title=Norm Cash, 51, Is Found Dead – New York Times |format= |work= The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-07 | date=October 13, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy later revealed that Cash had a [[blood alcohol content]] of 0.18 percent at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/sports/sports-people-cash-autopsy-finding.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE; Cash Autopsy Finding – New York Times|work= The New York Times|accessdate=2016-10-06| date=October 30, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in Pine Lake Cemetery, [[West Bloomfield, Michigan]].

On April 23, 2005, the high school and [[Little League]] baseball field in [[Post, Texas]] were dedicated to Cash. He was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.posttexas.com/norm_cash_field.htm |title=Norm Cash Field |work= |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224134/http://www.posttexas.com/norm_cash_field.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20835">'''Parthanatos''' (derived from the Greek Θάνατος, "[[Death]]") is a form of [[programmed cell death]] that is distinct from other cell death processes such as [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]]. While necrosis is caused by acute cell injury resulting in traumatic cell death and apoptosis is a highly controlled process signalled by apoptotic [[Intracellular signaling|intracellular signals]], parthanatos is caused by the accumulation of PAR and the nuclear translocation of [[apoptosis-inducing factor]] (AIF) from [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;David KK, Andrabi SA, Dawson TM, Dawson VL. 2009. Parthanatos, a messenger of death. Front. Biosci. 14: 1116-28&lt;/ref&gt; Parthanatos is also known as [[PARP1|PARP-1]] dependent cell death. PARP-1 mediates parthanatos when it is over-activated in response to extreme [[genomic stress]] and synthesizes PAR which causes [[nuclear translocation]] of AIF. Parthanatos is involved in diseases that afflict hundreds of millions of people worldwide.  Well known diseases involving parthanatos include [[Parkinson's disease]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], and [[diabetes]].  It also has potential use as a treatment for ameliorating disease and various medical conditions such as diabetes and [[obesity]].

==History==

===Name===
The term parthanatos was not coined until a review in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The word parthanatos is derived from [[Thanatos]], the personification of death in Greek mythology.

===Discovery===
Parthanatos was first discovered in a 2006 paper by Yu et al. studying the increased production of mitochondrial [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) by [[hyperglycemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu T, Robotham JL, Yoon Y. 2006. Increased production of reactive oxygen species in hyperglycemic conditions requires dynamic change of mitochondrial morphology. PNAS. 103(8): p 2653-2658.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is linked with negative effects arising from clinical complications of [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]].

Researchers noticed that high glucose-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species led [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] to undergo rapid fragmentation while exposed. Inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake that blocked ROS increase did not prevent mitochondrial fragmentation. Neither reactive oxygen species increase nor mitochondrial fragmentation were observed after incubating cells with non-metabolizable [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]] L-glucose.

When mitochondrial [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] uptake that blocked ROS increase was inhibited, there was no prevention of mitochondrial fragmentation in high glucose conditions.  Ultimately, the researchers found that mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by the fission process is a necessary component for high glucose-induced respiration increase and ROS overproduction. 
Extended exposure to high glucose conditions are similar to untreated diabetic conditions, and so the effects mirror each other.  In this condition, the exposure creates a periodic and prolonged increase in ROS production along with mitochondrial morphology change.  If [[mitochondrial fission]] was inhibited, the periodic fluctuation of ROS production in a high glucose environment was prevented.  This research shows that when cell damage to the ROS is too great, PARP-1 will initiate cell death.

==Morphology==
[[File:PARP1proteindomainbreakdown.png|thumbnail|430x170px|PARP-1 protein domain breakdown]]

===Structure of PARP-1===
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ([[PARP1|PARP-1]]) is a nuclear enzyme that is found universally in all [[eukaryote]]s and is encoded by the PARP-1 gene. It belongs to the PARP family, which is a group of catalysts that transfer [[ADP-ribose]] units from NAD (nicotinamide dinucleotide) to protein targets, thus creating branched or linear polymers.&lt;ref&gt;Vyas S, Chesarone-Cataldo M, Todorova T, Huang YH, Chang P. 2013. A systematic analysis of the PARP protein family identifies new functions critical for cell physiology. Nat Commun. 4: 2240.&lt;/ref&gt; The major [[protein domain|domains]] of PARP-1 impart the ability to fulfill its functions. These protein sections include the [[DNA-binding domain]] on the [[N-terminus]] (allows PARP-1 to detect DNA breaks), the automodification domain (has a [[BRCA1]] C terminus motif which is key for protein-protein interactions), and a [[catalytic site]] with the NAD+-fold (characteristic of mono-ADP ribosylating toxins).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Role of PARP-1===
Normally, PARP-1 is involved in a variety of functions that are important for cell [[homeostasis]] such as mitosis. Another of these roles is [[DNA repair]], including the repair of base lesions and single-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds P, Cooper S, Lomax M, O’Neill P. 2015. Disruption of PARP1 function inhibits base excision repair of a sub-set of DNA lesions. Nucleic Acids Res. 43(8): 4028-4038.&lt;/ref&gt; PARP-1 interacts with a wide variety of substrates including [[histone]]s, [[helicases|DNA helicases]], high mobility group proteins, [[topoisomerase]]s I and II, single-strand break repair factors, [[base-excision repair|base-excision repair factors]], and several [[transcription factors]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Role of PAR===
PARP-1 accomplishes many of its roles through regulating poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). PAR is a [[polymer]] that varies in length and can be either linear or branched.&lt;ref&gt;Juarez-Salinas H, Mendoza-Alvarez H, Levi V, Jacobson MK, Jacobson EL. 1983. Simultaneous determination of linear and branched residues in poly(ADP-ribose). Anal Biochem. 131(2): 410-418.&lt;/ref&gt; It is negatively charged which allows it to alter the function of the proteins it binds to either [[covalently]] or non-covalently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PAR binding affinity is strongest for branched polymers, weaker for long linear polymers and weakest for short linear polymers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Panzeter PL, Realini CA, Althaus FR. 1991. Noncovalent Interactions of Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) with Histones. Biochemistry-US. 31: 1397-1385.&lt;/ref&gt;  PAR also binds selectively with differing strengths to the different histones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is suspected that PARP-1 modulates processes (such as [[DNA repair]], [[DNA transcription]], and [[mitosis]]) through the binding of PAR to its target proteins.

The parthanatos pathway is activated by [[DNA]] damage caused by [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] stress or [[excitotoxicity]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Fatokun AA, Dawson VL, Dawson TM. 2014. Parthanatos: mitochondrial-linked mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities. Br J Pahrmacol. 171:2000-2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This damage is recognized by the PARP-1 enzyme which causes an [[upregulation]] in PAR. PAR causes translocation of [[apoptosis-inducing factor]] (AIF) from the mitochondria to the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] where it induces DNA fragmentation and ultimately [[cell death]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Andrabi SA, Kim NS, Yu SW, Wang H, Koh DW, Sasaki M et al. 2006. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer is a death signal. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 103: 18308–18313&lt;/ref&gt; This general pathway has been outlined now for almost a decade. While considerable success has been made in understanding the molecular events in parthanatos, efforts are still ongoing to completely identify all of the major players within the pathway, as well how spatial and temporal relationships between mediators affect them.

===Pathway activation===
Extreme damage of DNA causing breaks and changes in [[chromatin]] structure have been shown to induce the parthanatos pathway.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Stimuli that causes the DNA damage can come from a variety of different sources. [[Methylnitronitrosoguanidine]], an alkylating agent, has been widely used in several studies to induce the parthanatos pathway.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Yu SW, Wang H, Poitras MF, Coombs C, Bowers WJ, Federoff HJ et al. (2002). Mediation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1- dependent cell death by apoptosis-inducing factor. Science 297: 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeh TY, Sbodio JI, Nguyen MT, Meyer TN, Lee RM, Chi NW (2005). Tankyrase-1 overexpression reduces genotoxin-induced cell death by inhibiting PARP1. Mol Cell Biochem 276: 183–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David KK, Sasaki M, Yu SW, Dawson TM, Dawson VL (2006). EndoG is dispensable in embryogenesis and apoptosis. Cell Death Differ 13: 1147–1155.&lt;/ref&gt; A noted number of other stimuli or toxic conditions have also been used to cause DNA damage such as [[H2O2]], [[Nitric oxide|NO]], and [[ONOO-]] generation (oxygenglucose deprivation).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moroni F, Meli E, Peruginelli F, Chiarugi A, Cozzi A, Picca R et al. (2001). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors attenuate necrotic but not apoptotic neuronal death in experimental models of cerebral ischemia. Cell Death Differ 8: 921–932.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Son YO, Kook SH, Jang YS, Shi X, Lee JC (2009). Critical role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in modulating the mode of cell death caused by continuous oxidative stress. J Cell Biochem 108: 989–997.&lt;/ref&gt;
     
The magnitude, length of exposure, type of cell used, and purity of the culture, are all factors that can influence the activation of the pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Meli E, Pangallo M, Picca R, Baronti R, Moroni F, Pellegrini-Giampietro DE (2004). Differential role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1in apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death induced by mild or intense [[NMDA]] exposure [[in vitro]]. Mol Cell Neurosci 25: 172–180&lt;/ref&gt; The damage must be extreme enough for the chromatin structure to be altered. This change in structure is recognized by the N-terminal [[zinc-finger]] domain on the PARP-1 protein.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amours D, Desnoyers S, D'Silva I, Poirier GG. 1999. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions in the regulation of nuclear functions. Biochem. J. 342: 249-268&lt;/ref&gt; The protein can recognize both single and double DNA breaks.

===Cell death initiation===
Once the PARP-1 protein recognizes the DNA damage, it [[catalyzes]] [[post-transcriptional modification]] of PAR.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; PAR will be formed either as a branched or linear molecule. Branching and long-chain polymers will be more toxic to the cell than simple short polymers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Zelphati O, Wang Y, Kitada S, Reed JC, Felgner PL, Corbeil J (2001). Intracellular delivery of proteins with a new lipid-mediated delivery system. J Biol Chem 276: 35103–35110.&lt;/ref&gt; The more extreme the DNA damage, the more PAR accumulates in the nucleus. Once enough PAR has accumulated, it will translocate from the nucleus into the [[cytosol]]. One study has suggested that PAR can translocate as a free polymer,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; however translocation of a protein-conjugated PAR cannot be ruled out and is in fact a topic of active research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; PAR moves through the cytosol and enters the mitochondria through depolarization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within the mitochondria, PAR binds directly to the [[Apoptosis-inducing factor|AIF]] which has a PAR polymer binding site, causing the AIF to dissociate from the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Y, Kim NS, Haince JF, Kang HC, David KK, Andrabi SA et al. 2011. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) binding to apoptosis-inducing factor is critical for PAR polymerase-1-dependent cell death (parthanatos). Sci Signal 4: ra20&lt;/ref&gt; AIF is then translocated to the nucleus where it induces chromatin condensation and large scale (50Kb) DNA fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; How AIF induces these effects is still unknown. It is thought that an AIF associated nuclease (PAAN) that is currently unidentified may be present.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Human AIF have a DNA binding site&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; that would indicate that AIF binds directly to the DNA in the nucleus directly causing the changes. However, as mice AIF do not have this binding domain and are still able to undergo parthanatos,&lt;ref&gt;Mate MJ, Ortiz-Lombardia M, Boitel B, Haouz A, Tello D, Susin SA et al. (2002). The crystal structure of the mouse apoptosis-inducing factor AIF. Nat Struct Biol 9: 442–446.&lt;/ref&gt; it is evident that there must be another mechanism involved.

===PARG===
PAR, which is responsible for the activation of AIF, is regulated in the cell by the [[enzyme]] poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase ([[PARG]]). After PAR is synthesized by PAR-1, it is degraded through a process catalyzed by PARG.&lt;ref&gt;Kameshita I, Matsuda Z, Taniguchi T, Shizuta Y (1984). Poly (ADP-Ribose) synthetase. Separation and identification of three proteolytic fragments as the substrate-binding domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the automodification domain. J Biol Chem 259:4770–4776.&lt;/ref&gt; PARG has been found to protect against PAR-mediated cell death&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; while its deletion has increased toxicity through the accumulation of PAR.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Other proposed mechanisms===

Before the discovery of the PAR and AIF pathway, it was thought that the overactivation of PARP-1 lead to over consumption of [[NAD+]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger NA, Sims JL, Catino DM, Berger SJ (1983). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase mediates the suicide response to massive DNA damage: studies in normal and DNA-repair defective cells. Princess Takamatsu Symp 13: 219–226.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of NAD+ depletion, a decrease of ATP production would occur, and the resulting loss of energy would kill the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Berger NA, Berger SJ (1986). Metabolic consequences of DNA damage: the role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as mediator of the suicide response. Basic Life Sci 38: 357–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ha HC, Snyder SH. 1999. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is a mediator of necrotic cell death by ATP depletion. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96: 13978–13982&lt;/ref&gt; However it is now known that this loss of energy would not be enough to account for cell death. In cells lacking [[PARG]], activation of PARP-1 leads to cell death in the presence of ample NAD+.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Y, Feng X, Koh DW (2011). Activation of cell death mediated by apoptosis-inducing factor due to the absence of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. Biochemistry 50: 2850–2859.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between cell death pathways===

Parthanatos is defined as a unique cell death pathway from [[apoptosis]] for a few key reasons. Primarily, apoptosis is dependent on the [[caspase|caspase pathway]] activated by [[cytochrome c]] release, while the parthanatos pathway is able to act independently of caspase.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, unlike apoptosis, parthanatos causes large scale DNA fragmentation (apoptosis only produces small scale fragmentation) and does not form [[apoptotic|apoptotic bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang Y, Dawson VL, Dawson TM. 2009. Poly(ADP-ribose) signals to mitochondrial [[Apoptosis-inducing factor|AIF]]: a key event in parthanatos. Exp Neurol 218: 193–202.&lt;/ref&gt;
While parthanatos does share similarities with [[necrosis]], is also has several differences. Necrosis is not a regulated pathway and does not undergo any controlled nuclear fragmentation. While parthanatos does involve loss of cell membrane integrity like [[necrosis]], it is not accompanied by cell swelling.&lt;ref&gt;Wang H, Yu SW, Koh DW, Lew J, Coombs C, Bowers W et al. (2004). Apoptosis-inducing factor substitutes for caspase executioners in NMDA-triggered excitotoxic neuronal death. J Neurosci 24: 10963–10973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathology and treatment==

===Neurotoxicity===
The PAR enzyme was originally connected to neural degradation pathways in 1993. Elevated levels of [[nitric oxide]] (NO) have been shown to cause [[neurotoxicity]] in samples of rat hippocampal [[neurons]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dawson V, Dawson T, Bartley D, Solomon H. Mechanisms of Nitric Oxide-mediated neurotoxicity in primary brain cultures.1993. Journal of Neuroscience. 13(6): 2651-2661.&lt;/ref&gt; A deeper look into the effects of NO on neurons showed that nitric oxides cause damage to DNA strands; the damage in turn elicits PAR enzyme activity that leads to further degradation and neuronal death. PAR- blockers halted the [[Cell death|cell death mechanisms]] in the presence of elevated NO levels.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

PARP activity has also been linked to the neurodegenerative properties of toxin induced [[Parkinsonism]]. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ([[MPTP]]) is a [[neurotoxin]] that has been linked to neurodegeneration and development of Parkinson Disease-like symptoms in patients since 1983. The MPTP toxin’s effects were discovered when four people were intravenously injecting the [[toxin]] that they produced inadvertently when trying to street-synthesise the merpyridine ([[MPPP]]) drug.&lt;ref&gt;Langston JW, Ballard P, Tetrud JW, Irwin I. 1983. Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a     product of meperidine-analog synthesis. Science. 219(4587): 979-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The link between MPTP and PARP was found later when research showed that the MPTP effects on neurons were reduced in [[mutation|mutated cells]] lacking the PARP gene.&lt;ref&gt;Mandir A, Przedborski S, Jackson-Lewis V, Wang Z, Simbulan-Rosenthal S, Smulson M, Hoffman B, Guastella D, Dawson V, Dawson T. 1999. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation mediates 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 96 (10): 5774–5779.&lt;/ref&gt; The same research also showed highly increased PARP activation in [[dopamine]] producing cells in the presence of MPTP.

===Multisystem involvement===
Parthanatos, as a cell death pathway, is being increasingly linked to several [[syndromes]] connected with specific tissue damage outside of the [[nervous system]]. This is highlighted in the mechanism of [[streptozotocin]] (STZ) induced [[diabetes]]. STZ is a chemical that is naturally produced by the human body. However, in high doses, STZ has been shown to produce diabetic symptoms by damaging [[pancreatic]] β cells, which are insulin-producing.&lt;ref&gt;Graham M, Janecek J, Kittredge J, Hering B, Schuurman H. 2011. The Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Nude Mouse Model: Differences between Animals from Different Sources. Comp Med 61(4): 356-360.&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of β cells by STZ was linked to PARP in 1980 when studies showed that a PAR synthesis inhibitor reduced STZ’s effects on insulin synthesis. Inhibition of PARP causes pancreatic tissue to sustain [[insulin]] synthesis levels, and reduce β cell degradation even with elevated STZ toxin levels.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto H, Okamoto H. 1980. Protection by picolinamide, a novel inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase, against both streptozotocin-induced depression of proinsulin synthesis and reduction of NAD content in pancreatic islets. Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications. 95 (1): 474-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

PARP activation has also been preliminarily connected with [[arthritis]],&lt;ref&gt;Miesel R, Kurpisz M, Kroger H.1995. Modulation of inflammatory arthritis by inhibition of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase. Inflammation 19: 379–387.&lt;/ref&gt; [[colitis]],&lt;ref&gt;Zingarelli B, Szabo C, Salzman A. 1999. Blockade of Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibits neutrophil recruitment, oxidant generation, and mucosal injury in murine colitis. Gastroenterology 116: 335–345.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[liver toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stubberfield CR, Cohen GM (1988). NAD+ depletion and cytotoxicity in isolated hepatocytes. Biochem Pharmacol 37:3967–3974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapy===
The multi-step nature of the parthanatos pathway allows for chemical manipulation of its activation and inhibition for use in therapy. This rapidly developing field seems to be currently focused on the use of PARP blockers as treatments for chronically degenerative illnesses. This culminated in 3rd generation inhibitors such as [[midazoquinolinone]] and [[isoquinolindione]] currently going to clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another path for treatments is to recruit the parthanatos pathway to induce [[cancer]] cells into [[apoptosis]], however no treatments have passed the theoretical stage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Peter To Rot''' ({{IPAc-en|t|o:|_|r|o:|t}}; 5 March 1912 - 7 July 1945) was a [[Papuan people|Papuan]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-peter-to-rot/|title=Blessed Peter To Rot|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=12 November 2016|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a well-noted and beloved [[catechist]] in his village and was entrusted with the local parish during [[World War II]] when the Japanese occupied the region.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90920|title=Blessed Peter To Rot|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stood up for religious values in the face of Japanese oppression and continued to hold secret services when the Japanese restricted him from active pastoral service. To Rot valued marriage - he himself had been married since 1936 - and he was an outspoken critic of Japanese views on [[Polygamy|taking multiple wives]].&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clairval.com/lettres/en/2009/02/18/2180209.htm|title=Spiritual Newsletter|publisher=Abbey of Saint-Joseph de Clairval|date=18 February 2009|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TD&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.thedefender.org/Peter%20ToRot.html|title=Peter ToRot|date=|publisher=The Defender|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His beatification was celebrated in [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

==Life==
===Education and marriage===
Peter To Rot was born on 5 March 1912 on the [[New Pomerania]] island in the then-[[German New Guinea]] as the third of six children to Angelo Tu Puia (the well-respected village chief) and Maria Ia Tumul who had both converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

His father taught him the basics of [[catechism]] and sent him to the local mission school in 1919 despite the fact that education was not an obligation at the time. He was quite agile in climbing coconut trees and he was more than willing to do this to acquire coconuts for older villages.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; It was rare for him to be mischievous at school but he was honest and quick to help those in need. In 1930 the parish priest of Rakunai - Father Laufer - asked his father if he would allow To Rot to start his studies for the [[priesthood]]. His father said that the time was not right for that but it would be more than appropriate if his son studied to become a [[catechist]]. In 1930 he began his studies at Saint Paul's College of the [[Missionaries of the Sacred Heart]] in Taliligap after which he was commissioned as a catechist for the parish of Rakunai in 1933 when the local bishop gave him the catechist's cross. To Rot then returned to his village where he would go on to aid Father Laufer. He was an excellent teacher and an organizer of classes for people and he had a [[Bible]] on his person at all times.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

On 11 November 1936 he married Paula Ia Varpit and the couple went on to have three children; one died as an infant and another died soon after the war. His final child lived into old age and was born after To Rot's death.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; The pair were married in a church though some of the local and traditional customs were observed.&lt;ref name=TD/&gt;

===Catechist===
Once the Japanese forces occupied the nation in March 1942 (forcing an Australian garrison out) their soldiers interned all of the foreign missionaries though remained indifferent to religion on the whole. The parish priest left To Rot in charge of his parish and he became its active leader as a result of this. In this role he cared for those who were ill and poor while also aiming to better educate converts.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=TD/&gt; Towards late 1943 the Japanese authorities restricted religious services and a few months later forbade them in full. But To Rot continued to hold them in secret and did not fear the implications on his own life despite the fear of those around him. The destruction of the church a short while later saw him build a "bush church" outside the village to hold secret services; he kept records of baptisms and weddings there.&lt;ref name=TD/&gt;

Metepa was married Christian and a policeman who worked for the Japanese; he lusted after a [[Protestant|Protestant's]] wife named Ia Mentil. To Rot and Mentil's father prevented Metepa from kidnapping Mentil as his second wife and the furious officer reported him to his superior Kueka who summoned To Rot. It should be noted that the Japanese authorities had legalised [[Polygamy|taking a second wife]] but To Rot opposed this as being the opposite to doctrine. To Rot met Kueka who ordered that he cease his pastoral activities while meanwhile Metepa and another seized Mentil and beat up her husband.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; But To Rot and the village chief managed to find Mentil and get her back to Rakunai. This event served to augment To Rot's defense of traditional marriage with spies monitoring him to catch him in the act of piousness so as to arrest him. One couple reported him and the police arrested him after finding religious objects in a house search. He was planting vegetables to give to the Japanese when he was arrested on [[Christmas]] 1944.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

To Rot was taken to the police headquarters where the chief of the police Meshida asked if he was preaching to which the catechist affirmed. Meshida beat him on the face and the back of his neck and ordered him to be imprisoned. The [[Methodist]] chief of Navunaram and the Christian Rakunai chief failed to secure his release even though he told them not to fret over it. He confided to his mother that he would die but assured her that he was more than prepared to die for [[Jesus Christ]] if that was the case; he was locked in a small and windowless cell.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=TD/&gt; To Rot was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in the Vunaiara concentration camp. On one occasion his wife and two children came to visit him and she begged him to give up being a catechist so he would remain safe. But To Rot was adamant he would not relinquish his responsibilities to the people. On the date of his death he said to his mother: "the police told me that, this evening, a Japanese doctor will come to give me some medicine. Surprising since I'm not sick. I suspect this is a trick".&lt;ref name=TD/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He told his wife to bring his cross and good clothes so he could go to [[God]] dressed in proper attire.

===Death===
He was given lethal injection in 1945 and then given something to drink. But the guards saw that the poison was slow so made him lie down while the doctor covered his mouth; he was stricken with convulsions and was held down as he died while being struck on the back of his neck with a beam.Upon his death a policeman went to Rakunai and said: "Your catechist is dead". The incredulous chief of the village demanded to know what the officers did to To Rot but the officer said: "He fell ill and died". His uncle Taura was sent to the prison with Commander Meshida to view To Rot's remains and to take them for burial.His remains were found warm and still curled up with cotton stuffed in his ears and nose with blood and a red scarf wrapped around his neck. The back of his neck was swollen and bore wounds and a clear needle mark was present on his right arm. To Rot's remains were soon buried in Rakunai.

==Commemoration==
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] - in 2012 - encouraged all married couples to look to To Rot's "example of courage" and he later dispatched Cardinal [[Joseph Zen|Joseph Zen Ze-kium]] to participate in the celebrations at [[Rabaul]] to mark the centennial of the late catechist's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://zenit.org/articles/celebrations-to-commemorate-the-life-of-blessed-peter-to-rot/|title=Celebrations to Commemorate the Life of Blessed Peter To Rot|publisher=Zenit|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NV&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/oceaniapapua-new-guinea-the-church-looks-at-the-bl|title=OCEANIA/PAPUA NEW GUINEA - The Church looks at the Blessed Peter To Rot to re-launch the value of family|date=2012|publisher=News.va|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope had discussed To Rot in his "ad limina" meeting with the Papuan bishops on 9 June 2012 while the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rabaul|Archbishop of Rabaul]] Francesco Panfilo issued a pastoral letter around that time addressing the life and example of To Rot.&lt;ref name=NV/&gt;

On 5 March 2012 the Papuan government issued a series of postage stamps in honor of the centennial of his birth.

==Beatification==
The beatification process began on 14 January 1986 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the official "[[nihil obstat]]" to the cause and titled him as a [[Servant of God]]; the formal diocesan phase collecting documentation occurred in the Rabaul archdiocese from 21 January 1987 until 30 March 1989 when all documents were sealed in boxes and sent to [[Rome]] for the C.C.S. to review. The C.C.S. validated this inquest on 2 June 1989 and after received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation of the cause in 1991. Theologians approved the dossier's contents on 26 June 1992 as did the C.C.S. members on 1 December 1992. His beatification received approval from [[Pope John Paul II]] on 2 April 1993 after the pope confirmed that To Rot had been killed "in odium fidei" (in hatred of the faith). John Paul II beatified To Rot on 17 January 1995 while on his visit to [[Papua New Guinea]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is Fr. Lucio De Stefano.

===Feast===
His liturgical feast is affixed to the date of his death as is the norm. He is included in the [[General Roman Calendar|Roman Rite liturgical calendar]] in his native Papua New Guinea as well as in the [[Solomon Islands]] and in [[Australia]] as well as for the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4533">[[File:XRF-krasue2.jpg|thumb|140px|''Penanggalan'' or Polong in Malay]]
'''Polong''' is [[Malay language|Malay]] for a spirit enslaved by a man (most of the time) for personal use. Like the [[Hantu Raya]] and [[Toyol]], it has a master. It is an unseen ghost that can be used by a black magic practitioner to harm someone. It is particularly meant to harm other people, especially when the owner has wicked intentions towards these people.

Polong is one of the ghosts mentioned in "Hikayat Abdullah", written by [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], much to the amusement of Sir [[Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles]], his employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ms icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=VihYSsllnjQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=abdullah+munshi+pelesit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S5RWudtCvI&amp;sig=F9ioXipZ5mkdM_4dUz03K9exsr0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=abrxTK6PK4qivQPI-aWfDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Hikayat Abdullah By Hamzah Hamdani, Abdullah (Munshi)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Polong is said to have been created from the [[blood]] of a murdered person and this blood is put into a [[bottle]] for one to two weeks before the spirit is invoked with incantations and magic spells.

After two weeks, the  owner will start to hear sounds coming out of the bottle. It is the sound of crying. By then he should cut his finger and drain the blood into the bottle to feed the demon. This is the sign of allegiance and of loyalty to serve the master. The blood which feeds the demon is said to have tied both parties together: one as Master and the other as the servant.

No one has ever illustrated the figure of the demon but all agree that it is evil and hideous. In East Malaysian Malays (Malays of Sarawak, Borneo Island, Malaysia) belief, polong is described as an egg-shaped flying fiery ball when it is sent to victims or when it is left out of the bottle.

==Task==
Polong has almost a similar role as the grasshopper-like [[Pelesit]], furious when not fed and will start to harm society. Per some sources, such as Judy Sierra's ''Gruesome Guide to World Monsters'', the Polong and Pelesit work in cooperation, with the latter serving as the former's steed.

Normally the owner will keep the Polong inside the bottle but unleashes it when needed. People who have been attacked by Polong are left with bruises, a few markings and almost always have blood coming out of their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sha/sss/sss04.htm GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS OF DEAD MORTALS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaknesses==
During possession, a Polong will not listen to anyone except its owner. The owner will come and pretentiously exorcise the demon in order to get money from people. But in some cases a polong which is "sent out" by its owner refuses to free the body that it has attacked. In fact it goes a step further by causing more suffering to the victim. At this stage a ''[[Bomoh]]'' ([[witch-doctor]]) or spiritual leader such as an [[Imam]] is called to cast out the polong.

Many of them know that the polong is easily weakened by [[black pepper]] seeds (mix with oil and few cloves of [[garlic]]). Normally, the shaman will place the seeds on certain parts of the body to cast off the polong. If he is a Muslim, this may be followed by [[Quran]]ic recitations. The tormented polong will cry and plead, asking for the recitations to cease. It will then confess to the shaman the name of its master. However, it is not uncommon for the polong to name some other person to misguide the ''pawang'' ([[shaman]]). Hence, the admission must be taken cautiously.

==In popular culture==
* In ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Blade]]'', a Polong appears in episode 7. It is depicted as a [[vampire]] creature that obeys whoever gives it their blood.

'''Pongsaklek Wonjongkam''' ({{lang-th|พงษ์ศักดิ์เล็ก วันจงคำ}}; born: August 11, 1977) is a Thai former [[professional boxer]] and current boxing trainer. He is a two-time former [[Lineal championship|lineal flyweight]] champion.

== Professional career ==
Wonjongkam had a record of 9-2 early in his career. Both losses were to [[Filipino people|Filipino]] journeyman Jerry Pahayahay, whom Wonjongkam would defeat by 10-round decision in February, 1998.&lt;ref name="boxrec"&gt;BoxRec.com editors. [http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=034051 "Pongsaklek Wonjongkam."] [[Boxrec.com|BoxRec.com]]. [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] accessed 5 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his second loss on July 11, 1996 to July 18, 2007, Wonjongkam won 55 consecutive bouts, the longest continuous win streak in boxing at the time.

On March 28, 1997 Wonjongkam knocked out [[Mzukisi Sikali]] of [[South Africa]] in 48 seconds to win the [[World Boxing Union|WBU]] [[Light Flyweight]] Championship. Sikali would go on to hold both the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] [[List of IBO world champions#Flyweight|Flyweight]] and [[World Boxing Union|WBU]] [[Super Flyweight]] titles.

=== WBC Flyweight Champion ===
On March 2, 2001, Wonjongkam fought [[Malcolm Tuñacao]] for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Flyweight|Lineal Flyweight]] Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/fly.htm|title=Pongsaklek Wonjongkam - Lineal Flyweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuñacao won the Flyweight Lineage Championship from [[Medgoen Singsurat]], who won the title by knocking out [[Manny Pacquiao]]. Pacquiao would later become the number one [[pound for pound]] fighter in the world. Wonjongkam won by first-round TKO after knocking Tuñacao down three times.&lt;ref name="boxrec"/&gt;

In his fourth Lineal and WBC Flyweight title defense, on April 19, 2002, Wonjongkam knocked out [[Japanese people|Japanese]] flyweight titleholder [[Daisuke Naito]] in 34 seconds.&lt;ref name="boxrec"/&gt; This knockout set the record for fastest knockout in division history.&lt;ref name="sweetscience"&gt;Mallon, Scott. [http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/2546/boxing-asia/ "Boxing in Asia."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908232224/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/2546/boxing-asia/ |date=2006-09-08 }} 24 August 2005. ''The Sweet Science.'' URL accessed 7 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2006, Wonjongkam defeated [[South African people|South African]] boxer Monelisi Mhikiza Myekeni by unanimous decision.&lt;ref name="boxrec"/&gt; Wonjongkam set the flyweight division record for consecutive title defenses, 16, with this victory.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;Jackson, Ron. [http://www.superboxing.co.za/default.asp?id=183774&amp;des=article&amp;scat=superboxing/international "Flyweight champ wins 15th defence."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930172733/http://www.superboxing.co.za/default.asp?id=183774&amp;des=article&amp;scat=superboxing%2Finternational |date=2006-09-30 }} ''SuperBoxing''. URL accessed 5 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wonjongkam was ranked number ten in [[Ring Magazine pound for pound|''Ring'' magazine's pound-for-pound rankings]], but [[Jermain Taylor]] bumped him off the list on June 18, 2006. Wonjongkam was ranked as ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'''s number one flyweight&lt;ref name="thering"&gt;''The Ring'' editors. [http://www.thering-online.com/ringpages/ratings2.html ''The Ring'' Ratings.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224024727/http://www.thering-online.com/ringpages/ratings2.html |date=2005-12-24 }} 3 July 2006. ''The Ring''. URL accessed 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; until his loss to Daisuke Naito in 2007.

=== Losing the Title ===
Wonjongkam suffered a shocking upset decision loss to [[Daisuke Naito]] in July, 2007, ending his long run as champion. Wonjongkam had defeated Naito twice in previous titles defenses. On March 8, 2008, Wonjongkam faced Naito in a rematch which ended in a draw.

=== Wonjongkam vs. Miranda ===
Wonjongkam won the vacant [[Interim championship|Interim]] WBC Flyweight Championship in a bout against Mexican [[Julio César Miranda]] on April 24, 2009. The 12 round bout ended by a unanimous decision. Wonjongkam defended his interim title against Takahisa Masuda by knockout, setting the stage for a bout against Lineal WBC Flyweight Champion [[Koki Kameda]], who had recently defeated Naito to win the title.

=== Recapturing the WBC Flyweight Championship ===
On March 27, 2010, Wonjongkam fought Lineal Champion, [[Koki Kameda]], to unify the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Flyweight Championship and Interim [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Flyweight Championship. The winner would also claim the vacant [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] Flyweight Championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ringtv.com/blog/1757/weekend_peview_huge_weekend/&lt;/ref&gt; Wonjongkam defeated Kameda by a 12-round majority decision to become the WBC and Ring Flyweight Champion.

=== Losing the WBC Flyweight Championship ===
On March 2, 2012, Wonjongkam lost his Lineal, ''The Ring'' and WBC Flyweight Titles in an upset technical knockout stoppage to [[Sonny Boy Jaro]] of Philippines. He was knocked down five times before the fight was stopped in the sixth round.

=== Later career ===
Wonjongkam won the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] International flyweight title against Hyobu Nakagama on August 31, 2012. However, he lost the title to Rey Migreno on November 1, 2012, by a third-round TKO, marking Wonjongkam's fifth defeat. Even more disappointingly for Wonjongkam, Migreno had a losing record of 17-20-3 going into this fight, and had been beaten twice before by Wonjongkam, first by ten-round UD in October 2007, and a first round stoppage in July 2010.

'''Prokop the Great''' ({{lang-cs|Prokop Veliký}}, {{lang-la|Procopius Magnus}}) or '''Prokop the Bald''' or '''the Shaven''' (Czech: ''Prokop Holý'', Latin: ''Procopius Rasus'')  (c. 1380 – 30 May 1434) was a Czech [[Hussite]] general and a prominent [[Taborite]] military leader during the [[Hussite Wars]].

Initially, Prokop was a member of the [[Utraquist]]s (the moderate wing of the Hussites) and was a married priest (having received the [[tonsure]] early in life) who belonged to an eminent family from [[Prague]]. He studied in Prague, and then traveled for several years in foreign countries.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Procopius, Andrew|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Bohemia, though a priest and continuing to officiate as such, he became the most prominent leader of the advanced Hussite or [[Taborite]] forces during the latter part of the Hussite wars. He was not the immediate successor of [[Jan Žižka]] as leader of the Taborites, as has been frequently stated, but he commanded the forces of Tabor when they obtained their great victories over the [[German people|Germans]] and Catholics at [[Battle of Ústí nad Labem|Ústí nad Labem]] in 1426 and [[Battle of Domažlice|Domažlice]] in 1431. The crushing defeat that he inflicted on the crusaders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at Domažlice led to peace negotiations (1432) at [[Cheb]] between the Hussites and representatives of the [[Council of Basel]].

He also acted as leader of the Taborites during their frequent incursions into [[Hungary]] and Germany, particularly when in 1429 a vast Bohemian army invaded [[Saxony]] and the territory of [[Nuremberg]]. The Hussites, however, made no attempt permanently to conquer German territory, and on 6 February 1430 Prokop concluded a treaty at [[Kulmbach]] with [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick I]], burgrave of Nuremberg, by which the Hussites engaged themselves to leave Germany. When the Bohemians entered into negotiations with [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] and the [[Council of Basel]] and, after prolonged discussions, resolved to send an embassy to the council, Prokop the Great was its most prominent member, reaching Basel on 4 January 1433. When the negotiations there for a time proved fruitless, Prokop with the other envoys returned to Bohemia, where new internal troubles broke out.

A Taborite army led by Prokop the Great [[Siege of Pilsen (1433-1434)|besieged]] [[Plzeň]], which was then in the hands of the Catholics. The discipline in the Hussite camp had, however, slackened in the course of prolonged warfare, and the Taborites encamped before Plzeň revolted against Prokop, who therefore returned to Prague.

[[File:List Prokopa Holého Prokůpkovi.jpg|thumb|left|A letter dated 6 May 1424 from Prokop to the besiegers of Plzeň informing them of the taking of the New Town, signed "Procopius Rasus"]]
Probably encouraged by these dissensions among the men of Tabor, the Bohemian nobility, both Catholic and Utraquist, formed a league for the purpose of opposing radicalism, which through the victories of Tabor had acquired great strength in the Bohemian towns. The struggle began at Prague. Aided by the nobles, the citizens of the Old Town took possession of the more radical [[New Town, Prague]], which Prokop unsuccessfully attempted to defend. Prokop now called to his aid [[Prokop the Lesser]], who had succeeded him in the command of the Taborite army before Plzeň. They jointly retreated eastward from Prague, and their forces, known as the army of the towns, met the army of the nobles between [[Kourim]] and [[Kolín]] in the [[Battle of Lipany]] (30 May 1434). The Taborites were decisively defeated, and both Prokops, Great and Lesser, perished in the battle.

'''Rolf  Mützelburg''' (23 June 1913 – 11 September 1942) was a German [[U-boat]] commander during [[World War II]] and a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. Mützelburg died on active service on 11 September 1942 following an accident at sea.

==Career==
Mützelburg joined the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' of the [[Weimar Republic]] on 1 April 1932 as member of "Crew 32" (the incoming class of 1932). After spending two years on minesweepers, in October 1939 he joined the U-boat arm.&lt;ref name="muetzelburg"/&gt; He spent five months commanding the school boat {{GS|U-10|1935|2}} from June to November 1940 as part of ''[[21st U-boat Flotilla]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving his first combat experience aboard {{GS|U-100|1940|2}} under [[Joachim Schepke]]. He commissioned {{GS|U-203||2}} into ''[[1st U-boat Flotilla]]'' in February 1941. On his eight patrols in the Atlantic, the US east coast, and the Caribbean Sea, he sank 19 ships for a total of {{GRT|81,961|disp=long}}, and damaged three more ({{GRT|17052|link=off}}).&lt;ref name="muetzelburg"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mützelburg died on 11 September 1942 in a freak accident. He was swimming in the Atlantic south-west of the [[Azores]], and dove from the [[conning tower]], but struck the deck head-first when the U-boat suddenly lurched in the [[Swell (ocean)|swell]]. The [[German Type XIV submarine|supply U-boat]] {{GS|U-462||2}} arrived the next day with a doctor on board, but too late, and Mützelburg was buried at sea on 12 September 1942.&lt;ref name="muetzelburg"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
'''Social dynamics''' (or '''sociodynamics''') can refer to the behavior of groups that results from the interactions of individual group members as well to the study of the relationship between individual interactions and group level behaviors.&lt;ref name=durlauf&gt;{{cite book|last=Durlauf|first=Steven|last2=Young|first2=Peyton|title=Social Dynamics|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-04186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of social dynamics brings together ideas from [[Economics]], [[Sociology]], [[Social Psychology]], and other disciplines, and is a sub-field of [[complex adaptive system]]s or [[complexity science]]. The fundamental assumption of the field is that individuals are influenced by one another's behavior.  The field is closely related to [[system dynamics]].  Like system dynamics, social dynamics is concerned with changes over time and emphasizes the role of feedbacks.  However, in social dynamics individual choices and interactions are typically viewed as the source of aggregate level behavior, while system dynamics posits that the structure of feedbacks and accumulations are responsible for system level dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterman|first=John|title=Business Dynamics|year=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-231135-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in the field typically takes a behavioral approach, assuming that individuals are [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]] and act on local information.  Mathematical and computational modeling are important tools for studying social dynamics.  Because social dynamics focuses on individual level behavior, and recognizes the importance of heterogeneity across individuals, strict analytic results are often impossible.  Instead, approximation techniques, such as [[Mean field theory|mean field approximations]] from [[statistical physics]], or [[computer simulation]]s are used to understand the behaviors of the system.  In contrast to more traditional approaches in economics, scholars of social dynamics are often interested in non-equilibrium, or dynamic, behavior.&lt;ref name=durlauf /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brookings Institution, Center for Social Dynamics and Policy|url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/dynamics|accessdate=29 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   That is, behavior that changes over time.

{{original research|date=September 2012}}
[[File:AlMcCoy boxer.jpg|thumb|[[Al McCoy (boxer)|Al McCoy]], world champion in the 1910s, displaying southpaw stance with right hand and right foot to the fore.]]
[[File:RuslanChagaev.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Ruslan Chagaev]] in southpaw stance.]]
In boxing, a '''southpaw stance''' is where the boxer has their right hand and right foot forward, leading with right [[jab]]s, and following with a left [[cross (boxing)|cross]] right [[hook (boxing)|hook]]. It is the normal stance for a [[left-handed]] boxer.  The corresponding designation for a right-handed boxer is [[Orthodox stance|orthodox]] and is generally a mirror-image of the southpaw stance.

==Strategy== 
Left-handed boxers are usually taught to fight in a southpaw stance, but right-handed fighters also fight in the southpaw stance. Fighting in a southpaw stance is believed to give the fighter a strategic advantage because of the [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] and [[cognitive]] difficulties of coping with a fighter who moves in a mirror-reverse of the norm. This is why left-handed fighters are brought up fighting in this orthodox stance. Another reason some left-handed fighters are brought up fighting in the orthodox stance is due to the (real or perceived) limited number of trainers who specialize in training the southpaw stance.

A skilled right-hander, such as [[Roy Jones Jr.]], [[Terence Crawford]] or [[Marvin Hagler]] may switch to the left-handed (southpaw) stance to take advantage of the fact that most fighters lack experience against lefties. In addition, a right-hander in southpaw with a powerful left cross obtains an explosively different combination. The converted southpaw may use a right jab followed by a left cross, with the intention of making the opponent slip to the outside of their left side. Then the converted right-hander can simply turn their body left and face their opponent, placing them in orthodox, and follow up with an unexpected right cross. If the southpaw fighter is right-hand dominant with a strong left cross, this puts the opponent in danger of knockout from each punch in the combination, as jabs with the power hand can stun or knock out (KO) in heavier weight classes.
 
While rare, the reverse is also true for left-handers; left-hand dominant fighters like [[Oscar De La Hoya]] and [[Miguel Cotto]] who fight from an orthodox stance give up the so-called "southpaw advantage" strategically, but are gifted with heavier lead hands.  Consequently, in MMA if one stands in a southpaw stance (strongside forward), one must train one's cross and left low kick to make it fast, hard and dangerous.

==Previous uses of the term southpaw==
Though many claim that the term originated due to the orientation of baseball playing fields in order to keep the sun out of the players' eyes and the resulting alignment of a left-handed pitcher's throwing arm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infoplease.com/askeds/baseball-stadiums-oriented-sun.html |title= I read somewhere that all major league baseball stadiums must point in the same direction (3rd base line north). Is this true? |publisher= Info Please }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/southpaw |title= Southpaw |publisher= Free Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term had been used decades prior to that to indicate "not-usual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url= http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/comments/southpaw |title= Southpaw |publisher= Word Origins |first= Dave |last= Wilton |date= July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5764">'''Spiritual self-schema therapy''', sometimes referred to as '''3-S Therapy''', was developed at Yale University School of Medicine by S. Kelly Avants, Ph.D., and Arthur Margolin, Ph.D. It is a therapy for addicted individuals who have contracted [[HIV]] or are at risk for contracting [[HIV]], whose goals are to reduce illicit drug use as well as drug- and sex-related risk behaviors.  In general, it aims to promote living a spiritual life aiding in their recovery .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) development program for the treatment of addiction and HIV risk behavior|url=http://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual self-schema therapy has a non-theistic foundation based on Buddhist practices, which are very similar to contemporary cognitive-behavioral techniques, and incorporates the client's spiritual beliefs, which do not need to be specifically or conventionally religious. &lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=3-S Theoretical Foundation|url=http://www.3-s.us/about/foundation/index.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  3-S therapy does not "convert" clients to Buddhism or any other spiritual or religious belief system, but always works within the client's pre-existing set of beliefs. 

==Self-schema==
The term [[self-schema]] describes a mental process to aim in understanding and organizing incoming information (stimuli). An example would include looking in your rearview mirror while driving and seeing flashing lights - typically an individual has an automatic response and prepares to pull over with out having to think. This illustrates a well-organized schema on "flashing lights". The connection between self-schema and spiritual self-schema therapy is shown in the automatic beliefs about oneself. An individual doesn't have to stop and think "Who am I? How would somebody like that respond to this situation?" If an individual is shy and believes they are ugly, they may see somebody looking in their direction and assume the person is staring at how ugly they are, when in reality they could be finding the person quite attractive or even not looking at them at all.

==3-S at Yale==
[[Yale School of Medicine]] has started a program called 3-S Thearpy, signifying '''S'''piritual '''S'''elf-'''S'''chema. Self-schemas can be helpful, but they can also be problematic. Stereotypes are an example. Additionally, people who believe that they are "bad, worthless, or unlovable" do significant amounts of mental damage to themselves. Yale School of Medicine's 3-S program promotes [[spirituality]] as a strong resource for coping with life's troubles. The goal of its program is to create a path to enhance one's spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation" /&gt;  The therapy manuals for 3-S Therapy, in English, as well as translated into Spanish and Russian, are available at the Yale University website: https://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx

==HIV==
There is a growing trend in attempting to integrate spiritual and religious beliefs into [[HIV]] prevention and addiction treatment. Spiritual self-schema therapy is one such attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avants|first1=S.

[[Image:Ayutpchedisuriyothai0605a.jpg|thumb|Phra Chedi Sisuriyothai]]

'''Suriyothai''' ({{lang-th|สุริโยทัย}}, {{IPA-th|sùʔ.ríʔ.jōː.tʰāj}}) or '''Mahathewi''' ({{lang-th|มหาเทวี}}) was a royal [[queen consort]] during the 16th century [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period of Siam (now [[Thailand]]). She is famous for having given up her life in the defense of her husband, King [[Maha Chakkraphat]], in a battle during the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1548–49)]].

[[Thai royal and noble titles#The Queen|Somdet Phra]] ({{lang|th|สมเด็จพระ}}) and [[Thai honorifics#Si.2FSri|Sri]] ({{lang|th|ศรี}}), pronounced and often transcribed '''Si''', are her honorifics. Her [[given name]] '''Suriyothai''' {{lang|th|สุริโยทัย}}  means "[[Dawn#Mythology|dawn]]". It is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''Suriya'', from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''surya'' सूर्य "sun"; plus ''Uthai'' from ''udaya'' उदय "rising", a [[cognate]] of [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] and [[Ushas]].

== Life ==
Suriyothai was married to Prince Tien when he was regent under King [[Yodfa]]'s rule. Wishing to remain faithful to Suriothai, Prince Tien entered a monastery to avoid the advances of Sudachan, the Queen Mother.&lt;ref name=prince&gt;Chakrabongse, C., 1960, ''Lords of Life'', London: Alvin Redman Limited&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}

Suriyothai was queen during the early part of the reign of King Maha Chakkraphat (2091 to 2106 [[Buddhist Era]], with another reign from 2111 to 2112 B.E.). In 1548 [[Common Era|CE]], barely six months into King Maha Chakkraphat's reign, the King of Burma invaded [[Siam]] with the intent of sacking the main capital, Ayutthaya.

===First Burmese invasion ===
{{See also|Burmese–Siamese War (1547–49)}}

[[File:Queen Suriyothai elephant combat.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Painting by Prince [[Narisara Nuvadtivongs]], depicting Queen Suriyothai (center) on her elephant putting herself between King Maha Chakkraphat (right) and the [[Thado Dhamma Yaza I of Prome|Viceroy of Prome]] (left).]]

The invasion initially met little resistance, as the Burmese force was too large for the small guard posts on the border.&lt;ref name="Damrong 15"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing of the Burmese invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at [[Suphanburi]], a town just west of Ayutthaya.&lt;ref name="Damrong 17"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Tabinshwehti]] and his Burmese army arrived at the walled town of [[Kanchanaburi]], they found it deserted.&lt;ref name="Damrong 18"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru and Chorakhe Sam Phan.&lt;ref name="Damrong 18"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tabinshwehti divided his army into three columns, the first commanded by [[Bayinnaung]], the second by the [[Thado Dhamma Yaza I of Prome|Viceroy of Prome]], and the third by Yong, the Governor of [[Pathein|Bassein]].&lt;ref name="Phayre 101"&gt;Phayre p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese continued their advance and captured the ancient town of [[Amphoe U Thong|Uthong]] as well as the villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closed on [[Suphanburi]]. When the Burmese attacked the town, the Siamese defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the [[Chao Phraya River]] near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli Plain.&lt;ref name="Damrong 18"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Maha Chakkraphat left the capital with his forces to engage Tabinshwehti and test Burmese strength. On this occasion, he mounted his chief war elephant. Accompanying him were his Chief Queen, Sri Suriyothai, and one of their young daughters, Princess Boromdhilok, the two riding together on a smaller war elephant. Both royal ladies were dressed in male military attire (helmet and armour), with the queen wearing the uniform of an [[Uparaja]]. Also accompanying their father on elephant mounts were two sons, the [[Front Palace#Ayutthaya period|Uparaja and heir apparent]], [[Prince Ramesuan]], and his brother [[Mahinthrathirat|Prince Mahin]].&lt;ref name="Damrong 18"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood 113"&gt;Wood p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elephant battle and death===
The Siamese army under Maha Chakkraphat soon met the advance column commanded by the Viceroy of Prome, and the two armies engaged in battle. The commanders of the two forces engaged in [[War elephant#Middle Ages|single elephant-combat]], as was the custom of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiwaysmagazine.com/thai_article/2417_elephant/elephant.html ''Thaiways'', "Elephant Duel: The Honorary Combat on Elephant Back"] Retrieved 6 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy, the viceroy giving chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the king and the viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit.&lt;ref name="Wood 113"&gt;Wood p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damrong 19"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The viceroy then engaged the queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also mortally wounding her daughter. Both mother and child met their deaths on the back of the same elephant.&lt;ref name="Damrong 19"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood 112"&gt;Wood p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey 159"&gt;Harvey p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck. As she fell dying, her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Burmese chronicles do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the Viceroy of Prome.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Burmese chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 181–192) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 238–248) devote a detailed account of the invasion, down to the names of war elephants the high royalty rode on. Thado Dhamma Yaza rode the war elephant named '''Ye Htut Mingala''' (Hmannan Vol. 2 2033: 244). If he was victorious in combat against any enemy of significance, such a story with a favorable outcome would likely have been included in the chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the viceroy, and drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital.&lt;ref name="Wood 113"&gt;Wood p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damrong 19"&gt;Damrong Rajanubhab p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial [[stupa|chedi]] to Queen Suriyothai, Phra Chedi Sisuriyothai, was built by King Maha Chakkraphat in her honor. The chedi is at Wat Suanluang Sopsawan on the banks of the Chao Phraya, southwest of the Wang Luang (royal palace). There is also a memorial park to her outside of Ayutthaya, featuring a large statue of the queen riding a war elephant.

In 2001, a [[Thailand|Thai]] movie about her life, ''[[The Legend of Suriyothai]]'', was released. The film was directed by M.C. [[Chatrichalerm Yukol]] of the [[Thai royal and noble titles|Thai Royal Family]] and financed by [[Sirikit|Queen Sirikit]].

In 2013 [[Bangkok Opera|Opera Siam International]] premiered [[S. P. Somtow]]'s ballet-opera called "Suriyothai" in honour of the birthday of Queen [[Sirikit]]. It starred [[Stacey Tappan]] and [[Winita Lohitkul]], and was conducted by [[Trisdee na Patalung]].

'''Tab Hunter''' (born '''Arthur Andrew Kelm'''; July 11, 1931&amp;nbsp;– July 8, 2018) was an American actor, singer, film producer and author. He appeared in over forty films and was a well-known Hollywood star and heartthrob of the 1950s and 1960s, known for his blond, clean-cut good looks.

==Early life==
Hunter was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]],&lt;ref name =NewYorkTimes/&gt; the son of Gertrude ({{Nee|Gelien}}) and Charles Kelm. His father was [[Judaism|Jewish]] and his mother was a [[Germans|German]] Catholic immigrant, from [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=nyt2003/09/09/&gt; He had an older brother, Walter.
Hunter’s father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. He was raised in [[California]] living with his mother, brother, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (née Sonnenfleth) Gelien, living in [[San Francisco]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=nyt2003/09/09&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/movies/star-s-real-life-upstages-his-films-tab-hunter-looks-back-sadness-success-ahead.html|title=A Star&amp;rsquo;s Real Life Upstages His Films; Tab Hunter Looks Back on Sadness and Success and Ahead to a Book|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|date=September 9, 2003|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother reassumed her maiden surname, Gelien, and changed her sons’ surnames, as well. As a teenager, Arthur Gelien, as he was then known, was a [[figure skating|figure skater]],&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock &amp;rsquo;N&amp;rsquo; Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=38|id=CN 5585}}&lt;/ref&gt; competing in both [[single skating|singles]] and [[pair skating|pairs]]. Hunter was sent to Catholic school by his religious mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TMOcNOk4MXUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22It+Came+as+a+shock+to+learn+we+were+Catholics.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MRgDVaHgDK3nsAThzoGAAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22It%20Came%20as%20a%20shock%20to%20learn%20we%20were%20Catholics.%22&amp;f=false|title=Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star|publisher=Books.google.ca|access-date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[United States Coast Guard ]] aged 15, lying about his age to enlist. While in the Coast Guard, he gained the nickname “[[Hollywood]]” for his penchant for watching movies rather than going to bars while on liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/Tab_Hunter.asp|title=Tab Hunter at Coast Guard History|publisher=Uscg.mil|access-date=August 17, 2015}}{{Dead url|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his age was discovered, he was discharged by the Coast Guard. He met actor [[Richard Clayton (actor)|Dick Clayton]] socially; Clayton suggested that Hunter become an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/tab-hunter-opens-up-life-781046|title=SXSW: Tab Hunter Opens Up About Life As a Closeted Gay Star During Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s Golden Age|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}
Clayton introduced Hunter to agent [[Henry Willson]], who specialized in "pretty boy" stars such as [[Guy Madison]] and [[Robert Wagner]]. It was Willson who named him "Tab Hunter".&lt;ref&gt;''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson'' by Robert Hofler, published by Carroll &amp; Graf, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7867-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter's first film role was a minor part in a [[film noir]], ''[[The Lawless]]'' (1950). He was friends with character actor [[Paul Guilfoyle (actor, born 1902)|Paul Guilfoyle]], who suggested him to director [[Stuart Heisler]], who was looking for an unknown to play the lead in ''[[Saturday Island|Island of Desire]]'' (1952) opposite [[Linda Darnell]]. The film, essentially a [[two-hander]] between Hunter and Darnell, was a hit.&lt;ref&gt;"A Critic's Remark and Hard Work Put Tab Hunter on Top: Critic and Work Spur Tab Hunter" Hopper, Hedda. ''Los Angeles Times'' February 13, 1955: D1. &lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter supported [[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]] in ''[[Gun Belt (film)|Gun Belt]]'' (1953), a Western produced by [[Edward Small]]. Small used him again for a war film, ''[[The Steel Lady]]'', (1953) supporting [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]], and as the lead in an adventure tale, ''[[Return to Treasure Island (1954 film)|Return to Treasure Island]]'' (1954). He began acting on stage, appearing in a production of ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drama: Skip Homeier Returns, Murvyn Vye With U-I; MGM Rushes POW Job Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times November 5, 1953: B11. &lt;/ref&gt; 

He was then offered a contract at [[Warner Bros.]]

===Warner Bros.===
[[File:Natalie Wood and Tab Hunter arriving at the 28th Academy Awards 1956 cropped.jpg|thumb|Hunter with [[Natalie Wood]] at the [[28th Academy Awards]] in 1956 ]]
One of Hunter's first films for Warners was ''[[The Sea Chase]]'' (1955), supporting [[John Wayne]] and [[Lana Turner]]. It was a big hit, but Hunter's part was relatively small. Rushes were seen by [[William A. Wellman]], who cast Hunter to play the younger brother of [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[Track of the Cat]]'' (1955). It was a solid hit and Hunter began to get more notice.

His breakthrough role came when he was cast as the young [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Danny in 1955's [[World War II]] drama ''[[Battle Cry (film)|Battle Cry]]''. His character has an affair with an older woman, but ends up marrying the [[girl next door]]. It was based on a bestseller by [[Leon Uris]] and became Warner Bros.' largest grossing film of that year, cementing Hunter's position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads. He was in the third (''Battle Cry'') and tenth (''The Sea Chase'') most popular films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety201-1956-01#page/n674/mode/1up/search/%22lucy+gallant%22|website=Variety|date=January 25, 1956|page=1|title=1955's Top Grossers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1955 the tabloid magazine ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' reported Hunter's 1950 arrest for disorderly conduct. The innuendo-laced article, and a second one focusing on [[Rory Calhoun]]'s prison record, were the result of a deal Henry Willson had brokered with the scandal rag in exchange for not revealing his more prominent client [[Rock Hudson]]'s sexual orientation to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star|first=Tab|last=Hunter|others=With Eddie Muller|publisher=Algonquin Books|year=2005|page=172|isbn=1-56512-466-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not only did this have no negative effect on Hunter's career, a few months later he was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star |first=Tab |last=Hunter |others=With Eddie Muller |publisher=Algonquin Books |year=2005 |pages=116–118 |isbn=1-56512-466-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he received 62,000 valentines. Hunter, [[James Dean]] and [[Natalie Wood]] were the last actors to be placed under an exclusive studio contract at Warner Bros. Warners decided to promote him to star status, teaming him with Natalie Wood in two films, a Western, ''[[The Burning Hills]]'' (1956), directed by Heisler, and ''[[The Girl He Left Behind]]'' (1956), a service comedy. These films also proved to be hits with audiences and Warners planned a third teaming of Hunter and Wood. Hunter rejected the third picture, thus ending Warners' attempt to make Hunter and Wood the [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]] of the 1950s. Hunter was Warner Bros.' most popular male star from 1955 until 1959.

Hunter received strong critical acclaim for a performance he gave on TV in "[[Forbidden Area]]", the debut show of ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', written by [[Rod Serling]] and directed by [[John Frankenheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Playhouse 90 – And Why It Is a Great Series: Key to Success Is Its Young Producer" Wolters, Larry. ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' March 17, 1957: s8. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Music career===
Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song "[[Young Love (1956 song)|Young Love]]," which was No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the [[Rock and roll|Rock 'n' Roll]] era.&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"/&gt; It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=136|isbn=0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He had another hit single, "Ninety-Nine Ways", which peaked at No. 11 in the United States and No. 5 in the United Kingdom. His success prompted [[Jack L. Warner]] to enforce the actor's contract with the [[Warner Bros.]] studio by banning [[Dot Records]], the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival [[Paramount Pictures]]), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established [[Warner Bros. Records]] specifically for Hunter.

Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'' (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, ''[[Gunman's Walk]]'' (1958), a film which Hunter considered his favorite role.

Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film ''[[Damn Yankees (film)|Damn Yankees]]'', in which he played Joe Hardy of [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[American League]] [[baseball]] club. The film had originally been a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book ''[[The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant]]'' by [[Douglass Wallop]]. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director [[George Abbott]] was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word. In 1959, he starred in the films, ''[[They Came to Cordura]]'' with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth and ''[[That Kind of Woman]]'' opposite Sophia Loren.

===''The Tab Hunter Show''===
Hunter's failure to win the role of Tony in the film adaptation of ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) prompted him to agree to star in a weekly [[television]] [[sitcom]].

''[[The Tab Hunter Show]]'' had moderate ratings (due to being scheduled opposite ''The Ed Sullivan Show'') and lasted only one season (36 episodes) but was a huge hit in the United Kingdom, where it ranked as one of the top situation comedies of the year.

===1960s===
Hunter had a starring role as [[Debbie Reynolds]]'s love interest in ''[[The Pleasure of His Company]]'' (1961). He played the lead in a swashbuckler shot in Italy, ''[[The Golden Arrow (1962 film)|The Golden Arrow]]'' (1962) and was in a war movie for [[American International Pictures]], ''[[Operation Bikini]]'' (1963).

In 1964, he starred on Broadway opposite [[Tallulah Bankhead]] in Tennessee Williams' ''[[The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore]]''. 

''[[Ride the Wild Surf]]'' (1964) was a surf film for Columbia, followed by a movie in Britain, ''[[Troubled Waters (1964 film)|Troubled Waters]]'' (1964). He stayed in England to make another picture  for AIP, ''[[City Under the Sea|War Gods Of The Deep]]'' (1965). Back in Hollywood he had a supporting role in ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'' (1965) and ''[[Birds Do It]]'' (1966). He made a film with Richard Rush, ''[[The Fickle Finger of Fate]]'' (1967).

For a short time in the late 1960s, after several seasons of starring in summer stock and dinner theater in shows such as ''Bye Bye Birdie'', ''The Tender Trap'', ''Under the Yum Yum Tree''&lt;ref&gt;Hollywood Confidential by Tab Hunter, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; and ''West Side Story'' with some of the New York cast,&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Raymond, [http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/interview-tab-hunter Interview with Tab Hunter], October 21, 2015; accessed March 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter settled in the south of [[France]], where he acted in [[Spaghetti Western]]s, including ''[[Vengeance Is My Forgiveness]]'' (1968), ''[[The Last Chance (1968 film)|The Last Chance]]'' (1968) and ''[[Bridge over the Elbe]]'' (1969).

===1970s===
Hunter had the lead role in ''[[Sweet Kill]]'' (1973), the first movie from director [[Curtis Hanson]]. He won a co-starring role in the successful fiim ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]'' (1972) with Paul Newman. He had small roles in ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'' (1976) and ''[[Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold]]'' (1978).

===1980s and later===
Hunter's career was revived in the 1980s&lt;ref name =NewYorkTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/obituaries/tab-hunter-86-1950s-hollywood-heartthrob-is-dead.html|title=Tab Hunter, 86, 1950s Hollywood Heartthrob, Is Dead|publisher= The New York Times|date= July 9, 2018|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when he starred opposite actor [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] in [[John Waters]]' ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981) and [[Paul Bartel]]'s ''[[Lust in the Dust]]'' (1985). He played Mr. Stuart, the substitute teacher in ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982), who sang "Reproduction". Hunter had a major role in the 1988 [[horror film]] ''[[Cameron's Closet]]''. He also wrote the story for, and starred in, ''[[Dark Horse (1992 film)|Dark Horse]]'' (1992), his last film.

An award-winning 2015 documentary about his life, ''[[Tab Hunter Confidential]]'', was directed by [[Jeffrey Schwarz]] and produced by Hunter's husband Allan Glaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1533089|title=Tab Hunter Confidential|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature film is currently in development at Paramount Pictures to be produced by Glaser, [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Zachary Quinto]]. Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning writer Doug Wright is attached to create the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jj-abrams-zachary-quinto-making-film-tab-hunter-anthony-perkins-1117878|title=Tab Hunter, Anthony Perkins Forbidden Love Drama in the Works From J.J.

==Personal life==
[[File:TabHunterApr10.jpg|thumb|Tab Hunter in 2010]]
Hunter's [[autobiography]], ''Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star'' (2005), co-written with [[Eddie Muller]], became a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' best-seller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/jj-abrams-zachary-quinto-tab-hunter-anthony-perkins-love-story-1202834923/|title=JJ Abrams, Zachary Quinto Developing Tab Hunter-Anthony Perkins Movie|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=June 6, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the paperback edition in 2007. The book was nominated for several writing awards. It re-entered ''The New York Times{{'}}'' Best Seller list for a third time on June 28, 2015, during the release of the [[Tab Hunter Confidential|documentary film based on the book]].

In the book, Hunter acknowledged that he was gay, confirming rumors that had circulated since the height of his fame. According to William L. Hamilton of ''The New York Times'', detailed reports about Hunter's alleged romances with close friends Debbie Reynolds and Natalie Wood were strictly the fodder of studio publicity departments. As Wood and Hunter embarked on a well-publicized but fictitious romance, promoting his apparent heterosexuality while promoting their films, insiders developed their own headline for the item: "Natalie Wood and Tab Wouldn't."&lt;ref name="See William L 2005"&gt;See William L. Hamilton, "Did Success Spoil Tab Hunter?," ''[[The New York Times]]'' (September 18, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Hollywood's [[Studio system|studio era]], Hunter said, "&amp;nbsp;[life] was difficult for me, because I was living two lives at that time. A private life of my own, which I never discussed, never talked about to anyone. And then my Hollywood life, which was just trying to learn my craft and succeed&amp;nbsp;..." The star emphasized that the word "'gay'&amp;nbsp;... wasn't even around in those days, and if anyone ever confronted me with it, I'd just kinda freak out. I was in total denial. I was just not comfortable in that Hollywood scene, other than the work process."&lt;ref&gt;See Tim Parks, "The many lives of Tab Hunter", ''Gay and Lesbian Times'' (December 15, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; "There was a lot written about my sexuality, and the press was pretty darn cruel," the actor said, but what "moviegoers wanted to hold in their hearts were the [[Girl next door|boy-next-door]] marines, [[cowboy]]s and swoon-bait sweethearts I portrayed."&lt;ref name="See William L 2005"/&gt;

"'''The Passersby'''" is the 69th episode of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Opening narration==
As the episode starts, a group of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] soldiers are walking down a road as [[Rod Serling]] does his narration:

{{quote|This road is the afterwards of the Civil War. It began at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, and ended at a place called Appomattox. It's littered with the residue of broken battles and shattered dreams.}}

After some dialogue is exchanged by the Sergeant and Lavinia Godwin, Rod Serling resumes his opening narration:

{{quote|In just a moment, you will enter a strange province that knows neither North nor South, a place we call—The Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
At the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a Confederate Army Sergeant ([[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]]), apparently wounded in battle, walks down a road aided by a wooden crutch. He carries with him a dirty bed roll and a homemade guitar. As the Sergeant limps along he sees a house. Once beautiful, the house and yard show obvious signs of the war; there is debris in the yard, and a large, dead tree stands in front of the house. It had once provided shade for its owners;  now it stands there as evidence of the former beauty of the property. This is the house of Lavinia Godwin ([[Joanne Linville]]), whose husband had gone off to fight in the war and whose bitterness towards the Union still survives.

The Sergeant, seeking water and a place to rest, receives permission from Lavinia to refresh himself at the well, and then to sit on a bench under the dead tree. The Sergeant plays his guitar, singing a song that Lavinia identifies as one that her husband used to sing. They talk while he plays the guitar, and watch as a steady stream of soldiers, both Union and Confederate, passes by the house and continue on down the road. The Sergeant learns that Lavinia has been very ill, and that Lavinia's husband was killed in the war. The Sergeant and Lavinia interact with others who are traveling on the road, both Confederate and Union soldiers whose conversation and behavior imply that they are more than just wounded men.

The Sergeant begins to realize that this is not a normal road, and these are not just wounded soldiers. He tells Lavinia that there is something down at the end of the road, and that he has to find out what it is. As the Sergeant turns to leave, Lavinia moves in front of him and tries to persuade him to stay. Suddenly they hear a man's voice singing a familiar song. The man is Lavinia's husband, Jud.

Jud tells her that everyone on that road is indeed dead—including her. The Sergeant, understanding now, moves off down the road, but Lavinia refuses to believe that it is true. Jud tells her that there is nothing left for him in that house. Insisting that she is alive, Lavinia pleads with Jud to stay. Jud refuses and continues down the road, disregarding her pleas. As he leaves, Jud tells Lavinia that he will be waiting for her at the end of the road. Lavinia cries out to her husband, imploring him to stay. Dropping to her knees on the now deserted road, she begs Jud to come back.

Then she hears a soft voice speaking to her and trying to comfort her. It is a lone passerby who turns out to be [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He tells her that he is the last man on that road. Frightened, Lavinia backs away from him, but finally she accepts her fate and runs to join her husband, who can now be seen waiting for her at the end of the road, shrouded in fog. Lavinia joins her husband there and they walk into the fog. They are followed by Lincoln, who walks slowly toward the end of the road. The entire stream of soldiers was every single casualty of the war, and Lincoln was the last casualty of the [[American Civil War|war itself]].

==Closing narration==
{{quote|Incident on a dirt road during the month of April, the year 1865. As we've already pointed out, it's a road that won't be found on a map, but it's one of many that lead in and out of the Twilight Zone.}}

==Cast==
* [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]] as The Sergeant
* [[Joanne Linville]] as Lavinia Godwin
* [[Warren Kemmerling]] as Jud Godwin

==Episode notes==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2013}}
The traditional folk song "[[Black Is the Color (Of My True Love's Hair)]]" is featured prominently throughout this episode.

Elements of the episode are re-made in an episode of the [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002 revival]] named, "Homecoming".  In this episode, a soldier returns from Iraq to repair his relationship with his son.  We find out that the soldier is dead.

The closing titles image is of the road upon which the eponymous passersby walk.

The [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|radio adaptation]] of this episode starred [[Morgan Brittany]] as Lavinia.

Practitioners of therapeutic touch state that by placing their hands on, or near, a patient, they are able to detect and manipulate what they say is the patient's [[Energy (esotericism)|energy field]].&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Bruno | first = Leonard C. | title = Therapeutic touch | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Medicine | publisher = Gale Research | year = 1999 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2601/is_0013/ai_2601001343 | accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One highly cited study, designed by the then-nine-year-old [[Emily Rosa]] and published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1998, found that practitioners of therapeutic touch could not detect the presence or absence of a hand placed a few inches above theirs when their vision was obstructed.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{Cite web | author=Larry Sarner | url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ttdata.html | title=Therapeutic Touch Study Data | publisher=QuackWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glazer 2000"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glazer |first=Sarah |title=Postmodern Nursing |publisher=The Public Interest |year=2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_2000_Summer/ai_63856599 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225160721/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0377/is_2000_Summer/ai_63856599 |archivedate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosa 1005–1010"&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1001/jama.279.13.1005|pmid = 9533499 | title =  A Close Look at Therapeutic Touch  | last1 =  Rosa | first1 =  Linda | journal =  JAMA | volume =  279 | issue =  13 | pages =  1005–10 | last2 =  Rosa | first2 =  E |author-link2=Emily Rosa| last3 =  Sarner | first3 =  L | last4 =  Barrett | first4 =  S |author-link4=Stephen Barrett| date = 1998-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger|first=Victor|author-link=Victor J.

[[Dora Kunz]], a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] promoter and one-time president (1975–1987) of the [[Theosophical Society in America]], and Dolores Krieger, now Professor Emerita of Nursing Science, [[New York University]],&lt;ref name=JProfNurse1999&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S8755-7223(99)80043-X|title =Letters to the editor|year =1999|last1 =Krieger|first1 =Dolores|journal =Journal of Professional Nursing|volume =15|issue =3|pages =200–1|pmid =10377630}}&lt;/ref&gt;  developed therapeutic touch in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quackwatch2&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/tt.html  Why Therapeutic Touch Should Be Considered Quackery] by Stephen Barrett, M.D.

Krieger states that, "in the final analysis, it is the healee (client) who heals himself. The healer or therapist, in this view, acts as a human energy support system until the healee's own immunological system is robust enough to take over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krieger | first = Dolores | title = Accepting Your Power to Heal: The Personal Practice of Therapeutic Touch | publisher = Bear &amp; Company | date = April 1, 1993 | pages = 7 | isbn = 1-879181-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justification for TT has been sought in two fields: [[Martha E. Rogers]]' contemporal "Science of Unitary Human Beings", and [[quantum mechanics]], in particular [[Fritjof Capra]]'s [[quantum mysticism|mystical interpretation]] of the latter. A 2002 review found that neither justification was tenable: Rogers' theories were found to be inconsistent with the tenets of TT, while the overlap in terminology between the two could be ascribed to a lack of precision in Rogers' works, making them multi-interpretable. The quantum physics justification holds that the possibility to heal at a distance is possible due to a "global interconnectivity" of the universe, which is connected by TT adherents to an interpretation of [[Bell's theorem]] and the possibility of [[quantum nonlocality]]; this interpretation is not supported by experimental evidence. The 2002 study concluded that "the theory TT possesses is deprived of explanatory power" and "evidence that supports the current picture of physical [[energy]] should be regarded as evidence against the theory of TT".&lt;ref name="philos"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Dónal P. |last1=O'Mathúna |first2=Steven |last2=Pryjmachuk |first3=Wayne |last3=Spencer |first4=Michael |last4=Stanwick |first5=Stephen |last5=Matthiesen |title=A critical evaluation of the theory and practice of therapeutic touch |year=2002 |journal=Nursing Philosophy |volume=3 |pages=163–176 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan_Matthiesen/publication/227601237_A_critical_evaluation_of_the_theory_and_practice_of_therapeutic_touch/links/02e7e522190e097dde000000.pdf |doi=10.1046/j.1466-769x.2002.00089.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healing in TT takes place via a supposed physical process called "electron transfer resonance", which physicist [[Alan Sokal]] describes as "nonsense".&lt;ref name="sokal"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sokal |first=Alan |year=2006 |title=Pseudoscience and postmodernism: Antagonists or fellow-travelers? |encyclopedia=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public |editor-first=Garrett G. |editor-last=Fagan |pages=286–361 |publisher=Routledge |url=http://io.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific investigations==
Over the decades, many studies have been performed to investigate TT's efficacy, as well as various [[meta-analyses]] and at least one [[systematic review]], yielding varying results and conclusions. O'Mathúna ''et al.'', in discussing these studies, note several problems, such as failure to exclude methodologically flawed studies and a susceptibility to the [[publication bias]] of complementary medicine journals, which carry a "preponderance of studies with positive results"; they argue that

{{quote|in light of background scientific knowledge, the antecedent plausibility of TT is sufficiently low that any methodological flaw in a study will always provide a more plausible explanation for any positive findings.|O'Mathúna ''et al.''{{r|philos}}}}

[[Emily Rosa]], at 9 years of age, conceived and executed a study on therapeutic touch. With the help of [[Stephen Barrett]] from [[Quackwatch]], and with the assistance of her mother, Linda Rosa, RN, Emily became the youngest research team member to have a paper accepted by the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (JAMA) for her part in a study of therapeutic touch, which [[debunker|debunked]] the claims of therapeutic touch practitioners. Twenty-one practitioners of therapeutic touch participated in her study, and they attempted to detect her [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]. The practitioners stood on one side of a cardboard screen, while Emily stood on the other. The practitioners then placed their hands through holes in the screen. Emily flipped a coin to determine which of the practitioner's hands she would place hers near (without, of course, touching the hand). The practitioners then were to indicate if they could sense her [[Energy medicine|biofield]], and where her hand was. Although all of the participants had asserted that they would be able to do this, the actual results did not support their assertions. After repeated trials the practitioners had succeeded in locating her hand at a rate not significantly different from chance.&lt;ref name="Glazer 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosa 1005–1010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quackwatch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=saf&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers |8 |2}}&lt;/ref&gt; JAMA editor George D. Lundberg, M.D, recommended that patients and insurance companies alike refuse to pay for therapeutic touch or at least question whether or not payment is appropriate "until or unless additional honest experimentation demonstrates an actual effect."&lt;ref name=Quackwatch2/&gt;

There is no good [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] for the effectiveness of therapeutic touch. A [[Cochrane collaboration|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]] found "[t]here is no robust evidence that TT promotes healing of acute wounds"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Mathúna|first=Dónal P.|date=2016-08-23|year=|title=Therapeutic touch for healing acute wounds|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=8|pages=CD002766|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002766.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27552401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Cancer Society]] has noted, "Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that TT can cure cancer or other diseases."&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editor=Ades TB |pages=248–251 |chapter=Therapeutic Touch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapeutic touch and nursing education ==
Sokal, in 2006, reported generally accepted estimates of over 80 colleges and universities spread over 70 countries where therapeutic touch is taught, as well as some 80 hospitals in North America where it is practiced. He added that "these figures should be taken with a grain of salt, inasmuch as both advocates and detractors [...] have an interest in exaggerating its incidence".{{r|sokal}}

Owen Hammer and James Underdown from the ''[[Independent Investigations Group]]'' examined nursing standards in California, where the [[California Board of Registered Nursing]] (CBRN) can award registered nurses taking classes in therapeutic touch with continuing education units (CEUs) required for licensure renewal. In 2006 Hammer and Underdown presented the Board with the scientific evidence refuting the validity of therapeutic touch as a legitimate treatment, but the Board did not change its policy.&lt;ref&gt;

KRISHNAMURTHY|website=Krishalgology.yolasite.com|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Krishnamurthy acquired a B.A. (1940, at St. Joseph's college, affiliated to [[University of Madras|Madras University]]) and a B.Sc. (Hons.) degree (1942, Presidency College, Madras University) at the University of Madras. University of Madras awarded him with the Pulny Gold Medal. He also gained an M.A. (1947, University of Madras), an M.Sc. (1952, Presidency College,  Madras University) and a Ph.D. (1957, University of Manchester, U.K.). At the age of 21 Krishnamurthy became a research scholar at the botany laboratory of the University of Madras and worked under the father of Indian algology, Prof. [[M.O.P. Iyengar]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
Krishnamurthy was the reader in [[botany]] from 1943 to 1960. In 1960 he joined Thanjavur Medical College as a professor of [[biology]], and as professor of [[microbiology]] and [[bacteriology]] in the Department of Public Health Engineering in the college of Engineering. In 1961 he joined [[Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute|Central Salts and Marine Chemicals Research Institute]] (CSIR), Bhavnagar, Gujarat as a scientist. After working in CSIR's laboratories for a decade (1961–1971) he returned to Tamil Nadu and served as professor of botany in various colleges. When he retired in 1979, he was principal at Arignar Anna Government Arts College for Men Namakkal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Contribution to algology ==
He started the Seaweed Research and Utilization Association to encourage research on seaweed in India. On behalf of this association he published the journal ''Seaweed Research Utilization''. He was the founding president of the association and he served as president until he died. He founded [[Krishnamurthy Institute of Algology]] (KIA), Chennai, India. KIA has the largest library in Tamil Nadu on algal studies, and it is fully equipped for algal research. Prof. V. K.  worked in this laboratory until his death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
