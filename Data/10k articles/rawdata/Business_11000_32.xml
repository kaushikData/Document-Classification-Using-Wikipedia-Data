'''Accounting reform''' is an expansion of [[accounting]] rules that goes beyond the realm of financial measures for both individual economic entities and national economies.  It is advocated by those who consider the focus of the present standards and practices wholly inadequate to the task of measuring and reporting the activity, success, and failure of modern enterprise, including government.

Real debate concerns concepts such as whether to report transactions, such as asset acquisitions, at their cost or at their current market values. The former, traditional approach, appeals for its reliability, but can quickly lose its relevance due to inflation and other factors; the latter, increasingly common approach, is appealing for its relevance, but is less reliable due to the need to use subjective measures. Accounting standards setters such as the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] attempt to strike a balance between relevance and reliability.

== Business ==

Limited reforms within professional [[management]] circles have led in the past to activity-based costing, [[economic value added]], and [[risk]] measures. Current accounting practices have also been criticised for being too complex.

Heads of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] since the 1980s have consistently complained that this lobbying makes it impossible for them to apply meaningful reform, even in the wake of [[accounting scandals]], e.g. that which felled [[Arthur Andersen]] in 2002.

== National economies ==
Any comprehensive scheme of accounting reform is a major professional and academic enterprise. Typically it requires examination of the role of each of the fundamental [[factors of production]], an analysis of [[capital (economics)|capital]] indicating how many types there are and how each supports each factor of a production process.

A comprehensive scheme that would affect, for instance, the United Nations standards for [[national accounts]], the rules of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], or [[Listing (finance)|listing]] requirements on the major [[stock exchange]]s, would have to defend any change against critics that advocated lesser reforms.

[[Marilyn Waring]], who deeply criticized the UN account system for systematically under-valuing the social and economic contributions of women, stated also that she had to read literally an entire room full of books in order even to understand the standards applied today.

The critique from [[ecological economics]] claims that most means of [[measuring well-being]] indicated that the [[developed nation]]s were in a state of "[[uneconomic growth]]" through the 1980s and 1990s, due mostly to failures of measurement, most or all of which could be tracked back to the practice of using [[Gross National Product]] or other narrow indicators as a means of making [[money supply]] (and other economic) decisions.

Robert Costanza, [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and others who advocate a consistent global system for valuing [[natural capital]], note that failures in this area are particularly grim:  promoting [[extinction]], loss of [[biodiversity]], [[climate change]] and destructive weather for the sake of such "growth".  [[John McMurtry]] characterized this as "the [[cancer]] stage of [[capitalism]]".
What makes "economic sense" under current standards, they argue, is in fact leading to ecological catastrophe, social conflict, and economic chaos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">The '''average accounting return''' (AAR) is the average project earnings after [[taxes]] and [[depreciation]], divided by the average [[book value]] of the investment during its life.
Approach to making capital budgeting decisions involves the average accounting return(AAR). There are many different definitions of the AAR. However, in one form or another, the AAR is always defined as: Some measure of average accounting profit divided by some measure of average accounting value. The specific definition we will use is: Average net income divided by Average book value. It is kinds of decision rule to accept or reject the finance project. For decide to these projects value, it needs cutoff rate. This rate is kind of deadline whether this project produces net income or net loss.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Corporate Finance|author1=Ross, Stephen A.|author1link=Stephen Ross (economist) |author2=Randolph W. Westerfield |author3=Jeffrey Jaffe |last-author-amp=yes |pages=166|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-310590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three steps to calculating the AAR.

First, determine the average [[net income]] of each year of the project's life. Second, determine the average [[investment]], taking depreciation into account. Third, determine the AAR by dividing the average net income by the average investment. After determine the AAR, compare with target cutoff rate. For example, if AAR determined is 20%, and given cutoff rate is 25%, then this project should be rejected. Because AAR is lower than cutoff rate so this project will not make sufficient net income to cover initial cost. Average accounting return(AAR) does have advantages and disadvantages. Advantages; It is easy to calculate than other capital budgeting decision rules. It only needs net income data and book values of the investment during its life. Another advantage is needed information will usually be available. Disadvantage; it does not take time value of money into account. When we average figures that occur at different times, we are treating the near future and the more distant future in the same way. Therefore, there is no clear indication of profitability. And also should use an arbitrary benchmark cutoff rate is kind of disadvantage thing. The last disadvantage is it is based on accounting net income and book values, not cash flows and market values.

'''''Boiler Room''''' is a 2000 American [[Crime film|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Ben Younger]], and starring [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[Nia Long]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Nicky Katt]], [[Scott Caan]], [[Tom Everett Scott]], [[Ron Rifkin]], and [[Jamie Kennedy]]. Screenwriter [[Ben Younger]] interviewed for a job at brokerage firm Sterling Foster. Younger said, "I walked in and immediately realized, 'This is my movie.' I mean, you see these kids and know something is going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagan|first=Joe|title=The Sucker Wears a Wire; How's a lowly day trader to survive in the new, high-stakes Wall Street?

==Plot==
In 1999, Seth Davis (Ribisi), a 19-year-old [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] dropout, runs an unlicensed [[casino]] in his home near the campus, catering to college students. Although he earns a successful living, he is a disappointment to his father, Marty (Rifkin), a [[New York City]] federal judge. One night, his cousin Adam (Kennedy) stops by the casino to play blackjack, bringing a rich associate named Greg Weinstein (Katt) along with him. Greg recruits Seth to join J.T. Marlin, a [[brokerage firm]] based somewhere off the [[Long Island Expressway]], promising him that he has the opportunity to get rich.

Arriving at J.T. Marlin, Seth attends a group interview and learns from Jim Young (Affleck), one of the co-founders of the firm, what is expected of his work and also how he can become a millionaire. The firm's techniques of selling are through [[cold calling]] investors to sell stock, and Seth joins as a stockbroker trainee, having to close 40 accounts and pass a  [[Series 7 Exam]] to begin working independently. The brokers love to quote insider trader [[Gordon Gekko]] from ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', seeing him as a role model. He is soon making a good living, as well as winning his father's approval and embarking on a romance with Abbie Halpert (Long), a secretary and Greg's ex-girlfriend.

Eventually, he learns that J.T. Marlin is a [[chop stock]] brokerage firm that runs a "[[pump and dump]]", using its brokers to create [[artificial demand]] in the stock of expired or fake companies, and speculative penny stocks. When the firm is done pumping the stock, the investors then have no one to sell their shares to in the market, and the price of the stock plummets. The [[FBI]] agents investigating the firm decide to pursue Seth, hoping to make him their informant.

Seth passes his Series 7 Exam and becomes a broker. He then contacts Harry Reynard ([[Taylor Nichols]]), the purchasing manager of a gourmet foods company. Although Harry is reluctant, he gives in after Seth lies that the stock is guaranteed to go up in value; Seth sells him 100 shares at $8 each. When the stock's value drops, Harry calls back to ask why the stock has done so poorly, only to have Seth persuade him to buy more worthless shares. The stock eventually tanks, costing Harry his savings and his family.

Feeling guilty for scamming Harry, Seth resolves to shut the firm down. Marty then disowns him, accusing him of destroying peoples' lives. Seth shows up at his father's office and tearfully explains that he shut down his casino and went along with a highly criminal line of work that he thought was legal to gain his family's approval. He then requests that his father help him on an [[IPO]] scheme to rob the firm of their money and bring them down. Although Marty initially refuses due to the risk of losing his judgeship, he calls Seth the next day, reconciling with him and offering to help with the scheme.

Seth is eventually arrested by the FBI for the violation of 26 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|NASD]] regulations, and is brought into their custody along with his father, as the bureau had discovered their IPO scheme from a tape-recorded phone conversation. The FBI offer him federal immunity if he agrees to testify against J.T. Marlin once all the suspects are brought into court, and threaten to involve Marty in order to assure Seth's cooperation. Seth asserts that he will testify against the firm and provide strong evidence of their illegal practices only if his father is released. He and the agents come to an agreement on this, with Seth being kept overnight. After that, it is implied that he will be free to go as the FBI will proceed to raid the building and prosecute everybody else.

Seth returns to work the next day and goes along with the FBI's instructions to make copies of investment files onto a [[floppy disk]] to use as evidence. Before leaving, Seth attempts to get Harry's money back. He lies to Michael Brantley (Scott), the company's founder, by explaining that the firm can lose a lot of money by refusing to continue to do business with Harry Reynard, who Seth makes out to be an important prospect at a make-or-break point. Brantley agrees to proceed, offering him shares of the next IPO,  with a caveat that he cannot sell the shares until the firm has sold off theirs.  In order to sell the shares behind Michael's back, Seth needs a ticket sale signed by a senior broker, something that his direct supervisor, Greg, has explicitly said that he would never do. He seeks a signing from Chris Varick (Diesel), explaining that he may as well "do one thing right" in helping a severely hit investor make his money back, now that the firm will be raided and, soon enough, there will be no future in continuing business at J.T. Marlin. Chris reluctantly agrees, and proceeds to escape the building in an attempt to flee federal enforcement. Seth walks out to his car, deciding what to do with his life now that his ties with J.T. Marlin are finished. As he departs in his car, several FBI cars, buses, and tow trucks enter the parking lot, with agents storming out ready to raid the building.

The '''British Parking Association''' ('''BPA'''), is a British-based [[trade association]] that represents the views and interests of its membership drawn principally from the [[car park|parking]] and [[traffic management]] fields. More fully described as the '''British Parking Association Limited''' the association is a [[Private company limited by guarantee|company limited by guarantee]] and [[non-profit organisation]] founded in 1968, although the limited company was not registered until 1970.

==Association==
The BPA's stated aim is to actively represent and promote the sector by advancing knowledge, raising standards and professionalism, and using its influence to deliver excellence for the benefit of all{{weasel inline|date=April 2016}}, although the BPA is fully funded by its members rather than any independent source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/About-british-parking-association&lt;/ref&gt; The association's headquarters are in Haywards Heath, West Sussex and it produces the monthly magazine ''Parking News''.

Although the association does not publish its membership lists, it asserts that there are currently about 720 members{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} which includes manufacturers and suppliers, private car park operators, [[local government in England|local authorities]], health authorities, airports, the privately owned railway operating companies, shopping centres, [[bailiff]]s, [[collection agency|debt collectors]] and consultants. Members, whether from the private or public sectors, pay a subscription based on their parking revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishparking.co.uk/write/Documents/BPA/fees_sheet_2013.pdf BPA Membership Subscription Fees], Retrieved 16 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There are five levels of individual membership each of which pay a fixed rate fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishparking.co.uk/write/Documents/BPA/IM_fees_2013.pdf Individual Membership Fees], Retrieved 16 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safer Parking Scheme ==
The association manages the "Safer Parking Scheme"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/Park-Mark---The-Safer-Parking-Scheme&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly the Secured Car Parks Award) on behalf of the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO). The purpose of the scheme is to raise the standard of safety, security, design and operation of UK car parks. 
Car parks that are found to meet the criteria set down by the scheme are awarded the Park Mark Safer Parking Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carlisle council run car parks get safe and secure mark|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/16-car-parks-get-safe-and-secure-mark-1.929363?referrerPath=news|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904004602/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/16-car-parks-get-safe-and-secure-mark-1.929363?referrerPath=news|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 September 2012|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=News &amp; Star|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is made after inspection by an accredited assessor and is subject to re-assessment every 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPS Assessment Guidelines 2010 (4.2)|url=http://www.britishparking.co.uk/write/Documents/safer%20parking/SPS%20Assessment%20Guidelines%202010.pdf|publisher=British Parking Association|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Scheme celebrated its 10th Anniversary since becoming the Safer Parking Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/parking_review/news/?ID=39486&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private parking enforcement ==
The Association set up the Approved Operator Scheme (AOS) in 2007 in response to concerns about the management of car parking on private land, an area of the parking profession in the United Kingdom which was at that time unlegislated. Members of the scheme are required to comply with the BPA's Code of Practice (CoP).&lt;ref name="britishparking.co.uk"&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/Code-of-Practice-and-compliance-monitoring&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the Coalition Government announced their intention to ban clamping on private land. The next two years saw the development and subsequent Royal Assent of the Protection of Freedoms Act&lt;ref name="enacted 2012/9"&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/contents/enacted&lt;/ref&gt; which bans all forms of immobilisation without lawful authority.

The BPA welcomed the change as a move to marginalise rogue clampers, but felt that the legislation took away a valuable form of enforcement for landowners to use in the protection of their land. In order to ensure that private enforcement remained with a robust solution, the BPA's discussions with Government resulted in a form of keeper liability being introduced with the Protection of Freedoms Act,&lt;ref name="enacted 2012/9"/&gt; allowing the private operator in England and Wales to pursue the registered keeper of a vehicle if a named driver cannot be traced or denies liability.

Private parking companies are permitted to issue notices as specified in the Protection of Freedoms Act Schedule 4.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt; They do not have the legal authority to issue fines or penalties, except in rare cases such as train or railway station car parks.

Only tickets issued by the [[police]] or [[City council|Council]] are legally enforceable (except as previously stated, certain railway or train station car parks also have legal authority to issue penalties).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== Keeper liability ==
Keeper liability has been introduced by Government on the proviso that the parking profession provides the motorist with an Independent Appeals Service (IAS), and that the service will be funded by the industry. POPLA - Parking on Private Land Appeals - launched on 1 October in England &amp; Wales only,&lt;ref name="popla.org.uk"&gt;http://www.popla.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Ireland and Scotland does not have keeper liability or Popla.

Alongside the launch of the AOS in 2007, DVLA announced that any company/organisation accessing Vehicle Keeper data via an electronic request process that is not a Local Authority or Government Organisation must be a member of an [[Accredited Trade Association]] (ATA).

A condition of an ATA is that they have a Code of Practice&lt;ref name="britishparking.co.uk"/&gt; in place. The BPA has been working with DVLA since their announcement, achieving ATA status and sharing all plans for the AOS with DVLA.

In complying with the Code, operators that are members of the AOS are able to demonstrate that their business operates to a set of standards and that it is recognised as an ostensibly professional and responsible member of the industry. However, if non-compliance to the Code is proven, it leads to sanctions being temporarily applied and could ultimately result in the member being suspended or expelled from the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/AOS-Sanctions&lt;/ref&gt;

There are principles in [[English contract law|contract law]] when applied to private parking, that the driver of a vehicle is invited by the parking operator (and/or the landowner) to park in a car parking site, and that the terms and conditions of the parking contract should be set out clearly and concisely through the placement of signs as you enter and around the site. These are clearly specified in the BPA's Code of Practice for Parking on Private Land.&lt;ref name="britishparking.co.uk"/&gt;

Operators do not have legal power to issue fines or penalties as a result of people parking on private land, as this is classed as misrepresentation of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Private Parking Company Info|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlPjpW_6pGc|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=BBC Watchdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are able to issue a Parking Charge Notice (PCN) as specified in Schedule 4 of the Protection of Freedoms Act.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/schedule/4/enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

In parking at the site, a driver may have accepted those terms and conditions, provided they are clearly displayed, and the driver has read and understood them as set out in the case of [[Arthur &amp; Another v Anker &amp; Another|''Vine v London Borough of Waltham Forest'' [2000] EWCA Civ 106]].

In his judgment, Lord Justice Roche stated:
{{quote|The act of clamping the wheel of another person's car, even when that car is trespassing, is an act of trespass to that other persons property unless it can be shown that the owner of the car has consented to, or willingly assumed, the risk of his car being clamped. To show that the car owner consented or willingly assumed the risk of his car being clamped, it has to be established that the car owner was aware of the consequences of his parking his car so that it trespassed on the land of another. That will be done by establishing that the car owner saw and understood the significance of a warning notice or notices that cars in that place without permission were liable to be clamped. Normally the presence of notices which are posted where they are bound to be seen, for example at the entrance to a private car park, which are of a type which the car driver would be bound to have read, will lead to a finding that the car driver had knowledge of and appreciated the warning. In this case the Recorder might have reached such a conclusion about the appellant's state of knowledge, but he did not do so. The Recorder made a clear finding of fact that the appellant did not see the sign. That finding is not surprising in view of the absence of any notice on the wall opposite the southern parking space and the appellant's distressed state, the reason why the appellant parked and left her car hurriedly. It was the appellant's evidence that she did not see the sign. There was never any suggestion that the appellant was other than a truthful witness.|Lord Justice Roche&lt;ref&gt;British &amp; Irish Law Institute, para 19. http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/106.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wheel clamping on private land was banned as of 1 October 2012 when the Protection of Freedoms Bill was passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons, Protection of Freedoms Bill (as originally published), clause 54 https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2010-2011/0146/cbill_2010-20110146_en_7.htm#pt3-ch2-pb1-l1g54&lt;/ref&gt;

Advice and guidance for motorists parking on private land can be found on various websites including the BPA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/Public-advice-for-parking-on-private-land&lt;/ref&gt; Know Your Parking Rights&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knowyourparkingrights.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and POPLA.&lt;ref name="popla.org.uk"/&gt; Website forums such as Pepipoo&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.pepipoo.com&lt;/ref&gt; and moneysavingexpert&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moneysavingexpert.com&lt;/ref&gt; also debate the issues.

On 10 July 2012, Martin Cutts of the Plain Language Commission made a speech at an event delivered by Landor Publishing&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landor.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; "The Enforcement Summit '12" which was attended by some BPA executive members.

{{quote|I try to be fair but I've reluctantly formed the opinion that the BPA lacks the standards of integrity normally required of a Government-accredited trade association. My main evidence for this is what the BPA told the Government as it campaigned successfully to change the law on registered keeper liability. The BPA said 2–5% of its members' tickets were ending up in court, a huge number that in real figures is 36,000 to 90,000 a year, and that this would fall considerably, freeing up the courts' time, if registered keeper liability came in. The Government printed these figures twice as part of its evidence-base in the official impact assessment on the new law, swallowing the BPA argument whole. MPs were convinced, and the law was changed. But the BPA figures were false, and it's hard to imagine that the BPA – which claims to be the "recognized authority" on parking (BPA Masterplan 2012–13) – did not know they were false. The answer to a Freedom of Information request has shown that in 2011 only 845 cases from BPA private members were registered in the court system, and only 49 of them went before a judge for a final hearing. Not 90,000, not 36,000, but 49. A BPA spokesperson has tried to justify the phoney figures, saying: "I think the BPA's data was based on anecdotal conversations with the industry and it's certainly true that these were, a best estimate based on what operators are telling us." It all amounts to the fact that the BPA has conned the Government and it has conned MPs into changing the law.|Martin Cutts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Cutts' Speech|url=http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/plcdev/files/138/original/CuttsTalk10July2012copy.pdf|publisher=Martin Cutts|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In a speech made at Europe's largest parking event Parkex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2014.parkex.net/content |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118043858/http://2014.parkex.net/content |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 June 2014,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/parkex/&lt;/ref&gt; Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport Robert Goodwill&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/people/robert-goodwill&lt;/ref&gt; praised the private parking sector by saying that industry self-regulation can succeed and that the establishment of POPLA, providing motorists with independent and free appeals is testament to the high standards that are often promoted by parking professionals, who are providing well designed, fair and proportionate parking services.

==Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA)==
This is the name of the independent appeals service established  by the BPA and initially operated by London Councils  from October 2012 to September 2015 – Ombudsman Services took over as the service provider for POPLA on 1 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.britishparking.co.uk/News/british-parking-association-appoints-ombudsman-services-to-provide-popla"&lt;/ref&gt; The remit of POPLA to handle appeals by drivers and others wanting to challenge the issue of a parking charge notice issued by members of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme on private land in England and Wales. POPLA only handles appeals after the recipient of the parking charge notice has been through the internal complaints procedures of the operator who issued the notice.&lt;ref name="popla.org.uk"/&gt;

Its adoption across England &amp; Wales makes it available to all motorists, who park on private land where parking is invited  including, retail parks, railway stations etc. as well as locations where parking is not invited. POPLA is not currently available In Scotland or Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/write/Documents/Press%20Releases/BPA_welcomes_launch_of_first_POPLA_Annual_Report_-_040613.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

POPLA is judicially independent when it comes to deciding the outcome of an appeal and their decision is binding on the operator only. The POPLA service is free to the motorist with the parking operator being charged a fee for every appeal that is considered.

At the official launch of POPLA, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport Norman Baker welcomed the Report and the success of POPLA stating "This report shows that motorists are using this new free appeals service in significant numbers and, in more than half of cases, having their appeals upheld. This shows the new system is working for drivers and for the parking industry."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transport-network.co.uk/Minister-celebrates-free-independent-parking-appeals-service/8917&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media interest ==
Media interest in the association has changed over time. Although members of the BPA have previously had their actions featured on the BBC Consumer Affairs Programme [[Watchdog (TV series)|''Watchdog'']],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/watchdog/2010/10/parking_tickets.html&lt;/ref&gt; media interest on the private parking profession has decreased since the introduction of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme and launch of POPLA. 
The BPA regularly contribute to TV and radio broadcasts when private parking is debated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/Press-Media&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer help websites including [[MoneySavingExpert.com]] forums, Pepipoo, [[Consumer Action Group]] also provide their own opinion on the profession.

== Combined Parking Solutions ==
On 30 August 2012 Combined Parking Solutions (CPS) was suspended from accessing the DVLA database for three months.
The suspension was put in place as a result of CPS breaking the DVLA's rules on signage for privately issued parking tickets. The rules state(s) that parking companies must not make reference to liability by anyone other than the driver. On 14 June this year, the DVLA sent a memo to the BPA about this issue and instructed them to put out a warning to their members, download here. However, CPS was subsequently found to be in breach of this instruction on at least three separate occasions, and this resulted in their suspension.Being suspended from accessing the DVLA's registered keeper database will have a major effect upon how CPS operates. Private parking companies use this database to find out who the registered keeper is of vehicles they wish to issue a ticket to so that they can send out demands for payment. Without this data, they have no way of trying to chase payment where the driver has not identified themselves (e.g. via an appeal). Further to this, the DVLA has confirmed that CPS will not be able to retrospectively gather this data after the suspension ends or via another parking company. Furthermore, shortly before CPS was suspended, the British Parking Association had only just recently appointed a Combined Parking Solutions representative to the Board of its Approved Operator Scheme.  They continue to be represented on the AOS Board and no further issues have since been reported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parkingcowboys.co.uk/content/CPS_Suspension_Redacted.pdf {{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parkingcowboys.co.uk/trouble-at-combined-parking-solutions/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined Parking Solutions ceased to be a member of the BPA in November 2014. As part of the BPA's new Governance, the AOS Board ceased to exist in 2014. Approved Operator Scheme members are now represented on the BPA's Council of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishparking.co.uk/Council-of-Representatives&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business communication''' is [[information sharing]] between people within and outside an organization that is performed for the commercial benefit of the organization. It can also be defined as relaying of information within a [[business]] by its people.

==Overview==

Business communication (or simply "communication," in a business context) encompasses topics such as [[marketing]], [[brand management]], [[customer relations]], [[consumer behavior]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[Organizational communication|corporate communication]], [[community]] engagement, [[reputation management]], [[interpersonal communication]], [[employee engagement]], and [[event management]]. It is closely related to the fields of [[professional communication]] and [[technical communication]].

Media channels for business communication include the [[Internet]], [[print media]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[ambient media]], and [[word of mouth]].

Business communication can also be said to be the way employees, management and administration communicate in order to reach to their organizational goals.

Business communication is a common topic included in the curricular of Undergraduate and Master's degree programs at many colleges and universities.

Methods of business communication include: 
*[[Web-based]] communication;
*[[Video conferencing]] – allows people in different locations to hold interactive meetings;
*[[Report]]s – important in documenting the activities of any department;
*[[Presentation]]s – popular method of communication in  all types of organizations, usually involving audiovisual material, like copies of reports, or material prepared in [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] or [[Adobe Flash]];
*[[Telephone]] meetings – which allow for long distance [[speech]];
*Forum boards – which allow people to instantly post information at a centralized location;
*Face-to-face meetings – which are personal and should have a written followup;
*Suggestion box – primarily for [[upward communication]], because some people may hesitate to communicate with management directly, so they can give suggestions by drafting one and putting it in the suggestion box.

== Organizations ==
*Founded in 1936 by Shankar is the Association for Business Communication (ABC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscommunication.org/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141734/http://www.businesscommunication.org/index.asp |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally called the Association of College Teachers of Business Writing, is "an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship,research ,education, and practice."
*The IEEE Professional Communication Society (PCS) [http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/] is dedicated to understanding and promoting effective communication in engineering, scientific, and other environments, including business environments. PCS's academic journal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/?q=node/24 IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the premier journals in Europe communication. The journal’s readers are engineers, writers, information designers, managers, and others working as scholars, educators, and practitioners who share an interest in the effective communication of technical and business information.
*The [[Society for Technical Communication]] is a professional association dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of technical communication. With membership of more than 6,000 technical communicators, it's the largest organization of its type in North America.
*The [[International Business Communication Standards]] are practical proposals for the conceptual and visual design of comprehensible reports and presentations.

'''Charles Wayland Bryan''' (February 10, 1867 – March 4, 1945) was an American politician who served as the 20th and 23rd [[Governor of Nebraska]], and [[Mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska]], and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]]. He was the younger brother of Secretary of State [[William Jennings Bryan]], who was the Democratic nominee for President in [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896]], [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900]], and [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]]. The Bryans are the only brothers who have been nominated for President or Vice President by a major political party.

==Early life==
Born in 1867 in [[Salem, Illinois]], Bryan attended both the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Illinois College]] in Jacksonville.  He married Elizabeth Louise Brokaw on November 29, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles W. Bryan|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7267681|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children.  Bryan worked as a tobacco broker and insurance salesman, farmed, and raised purebred livestock.

==Career==
Bryan moved to Lincoln, Nebraska in 1889,  and became business manager and political secretary for his brother, William Jennings Bryan. From 1901 to 1923, he was publisher and associate editor ofhis brother's newspaper, ''The Commoner''. Elected to the Lincoln City Commission in 1915 and 1921, he also served as mayor of [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] from 1915 to 1917 (again from 1935 to 1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles W. Bryan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWkP0DM_upwC&amp;pg=PA85|publisher=Encyclopedia of Nebraska|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan was elected the [[Governor of Nebraska]] in 1922, and served from 1923 to 1925.  In 1924, he was the Democratic [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential candidate]] in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], where he was picked largely because of his name to serve as running mate to conservative easterner [[John W. Davis]]. The ticket was overwhelmingly defeated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Calvin Coolidge]] and his running mate [[Charles G. Dawes]].

He was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1926 and 1928.  He won in 1930 and 1932, and served from 1931 to 1935.  During his tenure, the state's economy flourished, state spending was limited, and taxes were reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles W. Bryan|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_nebraska/col2-content/main-content-list/title_bryan_charles.html|publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1934, governor in 1938, the U.S. House in 1940, and governor in 1942.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9367">'''Chinese Industrial Cooperatives''' ({{zh-cp|c=工業合作社|p=Gōngyè Hézuòshè}}) ('''CICs''') were organisations established by a movement, involving various Western expatriates, to promote grassroots industrial and economic development in [[China]]. The movement was led through the '''Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association''' ('''CICA''' or '''Indusco''') founded in 1938. Its international arm the '''International Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives''' ('''ICCIC''', also known by the nickname '''Gung Ho International Committee''') was founded in 1939 in [[Hong Kong]] to promote [[cooperative]]s in China.

The movement was especially active in the 1930s and 1940s with bipartisan support from both the left and right wings of Chinese politics. The movement disappeared after the 1950s due to suppression by the [[People's Republic of China]] government, but CICA and ICCIC were revived in the 1980s and are still active today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernardi|first=Andrea|last2=Miani|first2=Mattia|date=2014-07-03|title=The long march of Chinese co-operatives: towards market economy, participation and sustainable development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13602381.2014.931044|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|volume=20|issue=3|pages=330–355|doi=10.1080/13602381.2014.931044|issn=1360-2381}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, the industrial cooperatives’ best known legacy is its nickname '''Gung Ho''' meaning "working together", which led to the word ‘[[gung-ho]]’.

==Founding==
The Gung Ho (工合 "Gōnghé", literally "work together") movement was first initiated in Shanghai in 1937. Some of the principal organizers were [[Rewi Alley]] of New Zealand, [[Edgar Snow]], Nym Wales ([[Helen Foster Snow]]), and [[Ida Pruitt]] of the USA, as well as a group of Chinese including [[Hu Yuzhi]] ([[:zh:胡愈之|胡愈之]]) and [[Sha Qianli]] ([[:zh:沙千里|沙千里]]). In August 1938, the CICA was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzchinasociety.org.nz/content/rewi-alley|title=Rewi Alley|accessdate=2010-10-31 |quote= |publisher=New Zealand China Friendship Society|date=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in the wartime capital [[Hankow]] when China was engaged in the [[War of Resistance Against Japan]]. Through the sponsorship of [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]], Finance Minister Dr. [[H. H. Kung]] supplied government financial support.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The movement aimed to organize unemployed workers and refugees, increasing production to support the war effort. The goal was to replace industrial capacity lost to bombing by dispersing and giving workers voting shares in their CICs. The CICA organized small scale self-supporting [[cooperative]]s, mainly in rural areas, to create employment for workers and refugees and produce goods for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne-Marie Brady]], ''Friend of China: The Myth of Rewi Alley'' (London; New York: Routledge Curzon, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0700714933}}): 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1939, the international arm ICCIC was established in [[Hong Kong]]. Ms. [[Soong Ching-ling]] was elected honorary chair and the Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong, the Right Rev. [[Ronald O. Hall]] to be chair, and Dr. [[Chen Hansheng]] was appointed as secretary general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alley |first=Rewi |title=Rewi Alley: an autobiography |publisher=New World Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-7-80005-344-3 | oclc = 48776431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iccic-history"&gt;{{cite web

In 1941, the Gung Ho movement reached its peak: around 3&amp;nbsp;000 cooperatives with a combined membership of nearly 300&amp;nbsp;000 people were functioning.&lt;ref name="iccic-nz"&gt;{{cite web

	}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their factories produced more than 500 products for the local people, and a large number of blankets, uniforms and other army supplies for the battlefront. Ida Pruitt toured the United States to raise substantial financial support. The unique role of Gung Ho cooperatives in the war also won such international acclaim that the term "[[gung-ho]]" became a famous slogan of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and entered the [[English language]] as a term denoting whole-hearted dedication to a meaningful cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gungho.org.cn/en-danye.php?id=11|title=Introduction of ICCIC|accessdate=2009-03-17 |quote= |publisher=International Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Nationalist government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the Communist movement of [[Mao Zedong]] supported the movement and tried to control it. Alley placated the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] but his sympathies and eventual loyalties were to the emerging [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] government. In 1942, Alley was dismissed from Gung Ho by the government of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].&lt;ref name="iccic-nz"/&gt; After Mao’s victory in 1949 Alley stayed in China, but there was no need for the CICA and ICCIC. Both CICA and ICCIC suspended their works in 1952.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

An excellent discussion of the CICs appears in Graham Peck's book ''Two Kinds of Time'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/PECTWO.html|title=University of Washington Press - Books - Two Kinds of Time|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peck traveled with Alley to a number of CICs early in 1941 and was able to see them at their height, but as his experience grew he came to understand their limitations and the fact that their course was ultimately downwards, not upwards, for a variety of reasons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Revival==
The CICA was revived in 1983, and the ICCIC was revived in 1987 in Beijing by Alley and other former Gung Ho leaders.&lt;ref name="iccic-nz"/&gt; The reorganized ICCIC registered with the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] of People's Republic of China as an international non-profit organization. [[Zhu Xuefan]] ([[:zh:朱學範|朱學範]]) was elected as honorary chair and Alley as chair.

The main task of the revived ICCIC is the promotion of cooperatives in China. Membership is open to all individuals and organizations who support the cooperative movement. The committee has approximately 100 members from China, [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Singapore]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America]], and [[Hong Kong]]. The ICCIC’s General Assembly of all members meets every five years. The Executive Board elected by the Assembly is responsible for decision-making on major issues according to its articles of association during the adjournment of the Assembly. A secretariat is set up to handle day-to-day work.

'''Communications management''' is the systematic [[plan]]ning, implementing, monitoring, and revision of all the channels of [[communication]] within an [[organization]], and between organizations; it also includes the [[organization]] and dissemination of new communication directives connected with an organization, [[Social network|network]], or [[communications technology]]. Aspects of communications management include developing corporate communication [[strategy|strategies]], designing internal and external communications directives, and managing the [[information flow|flow of information]], including [[internet|online]] communication.

== Communication management and project management ==
In project management, communication management must address the following questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmhut.com/communication-and-collaboration-in-project-management-introduction|title=Communication and Collaboration in Project Management – Introduction – Project Management Hut|date=17 February 2010|website=pmhut.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* What information needs to flow in and out of the project?
* Who needs what information?
* When is the information needed?
* What is the format of the information?
* Who will be responsible for transmitting and providing the information?
* Communication with the stake holders and contractors at all times
* Communicate in a non aggressive manner is rewarding for all parties

== Weekly reporting method ==

One simple and popular communications method is called the weekly reporting method: every employee composes an [[e-mail]] report, once a week, including information on their activities in the preceding week, their plans for the following week, and any other information deemed relevant to the larger group, bearing in mind length considerations. Reports are sent to managers, who summarize and report to their own managers, eventually leading to an overall summary led by the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], which is then sent to the [[board of directors]]. The CEO then sends the board's summary back down the ladder, where each manager can append an additional summary or note before referring it to their employees.

Eventually, each employee will receive a long e-mail, containing many or all of the above-mentioned summaries, from every level of management; reading the full result is rarely a requirement. Curious or ambitious employees are considered more likely to read the result; task-centered employees, however, are not.

'''Conrad Nicholson "Nicky" Hilton Jr.''' (July 6, 1926 – February 5, 1969) was an American [[socialite]], hotel heir, and businessman. He was one of the sons of [[Conrad Hilton]] (founder of [[Hilton Hotels]]).

==Biography==

===Early life===

Conrad Hilton Jr. was born in [[Dallas, Texas]]. His father, [[Conrad Hilton]], was the founder of [[Hilton Hotels]], and his mother was the former Mary Adelaide Barron. Hilton grew up with three siblings: [[Barron Hilton|William Barron Hilton]], [[Eric Michael Hilton]] and [[Constance Francesca Hilton]]. He was the great-uncle of [[Paris Hilton|Paris]] and [[Nicky Hilton]]. He attended [[New Mexico Military Institute]].

===Personal life===
Hilton had an affair with his stepmother, [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], in 1944, according to claims made by Gabor after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/10/zsazsa200710|title=It's a Mad, Mad, Zsa Zsa World|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|author=Leslie Bennetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s first husband, (May 6, 1950 – January 29, 1951) but his "gambling, drinking, and abusive behavior"&lt;ref name="woo20110323"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2011/03/elizabeth-taylors-obit-outtakes-from-a-12-year-work-in-progress.html |title=Elizabeth Taylor's obituary: outtakes from a 12-year work in progress | accessdate=April 1, 2011 | author=Woo, Elaine | date=March 23, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; horrified her and her parents. The marriage ended in divorce after eight months.&lt;ref name="Gussow2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/movies/elizabeth-taylor-obituary.html | title = Elizabeth Taylor, 1932–2011: A Lustrous Pinnacle of Hollywood Glamour | accessdate =March 23, 2011 | last = Gussow | first = Mel | date = March 23, 2011 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, Hilton also had an eight-month affair with Mexican actress [[Silvia Pinal]], whom he met at the opening of a hotel in [[Acapulco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telemundo.com/entretenimiento/2016/02/29/silvia-pinal-hablo-de-sus-sonados-romances-con-famosos-video ''Telemundo.com: Silvia Pinal and Her Romances'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Hilton married oil heiress from [[Oklahoma]], Patricia "Trish" McClintock. They had two sons, Conrad Nicholson Hilton III and Michael Otis Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=royals&amp;id=I56313&lt;/ref&gt; McClintock filed a divorce against Hilton on 10 February 1964, culminating in 1965. 

Conrad Hilton Jr. died suddenly on February 5, 1969 of an alcoholism-related [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 42. He is interred in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|3155|Conrad Nicholson Hilton, Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4276">'''Contingency approach''', also known as situational approach, is a concept in [[management]] stating that there is no one universally applicable set of management principles (rules) to manage organizations. [[Organization]]s are individually different, face different situations (contingency variables), and require different ways of managing. Contingency approaches remain less common than change management approaches.

==History==

Contingency  approach evolved during the 1960s. Management theory and research began to adopt a new orientation, one  that embodied a simple concept and enabled significant advancements in the study of management and organizations, now referred to as the contingency approach. It  emphasized the importance of situational influences on the management of organizations and questioned the existence of a single, best way to manage or organize. Today, the contingency approach dominates theory and research in the management literature. Contingency approach challenged the classic process and models designed by management theorists such as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] ([[Scientific management]]) and [[Henri Fayol]] ([[Fayolism]]). Various researchers concentrated on different contextual factors. [[Joan Woodward]] (1958)&lt;ref&gt;J. Woodward (1958). ''Industrial Organization. Theory and Practice''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; studied the production technology, Blau and Schoenherr (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Blau, P.M., &amp; Schoenherr, R.A. (1971). The Structure of Organizations. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; the size of the organizations, [[Tom Burns (sociologist)|Burns]] and [[George Macpherson Stalker|Stalker]] (1961)&lt;ref&gt;Tom Burns, and George Macpherson Stalker (1961). ''The Management of Innovation''. London&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Paul R. Lawrence|Lawrence]] and [[Jay Lorsch|Lorsch]] (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Lawrence Lawrence, and Jay William Lorsch Lorsch (1967). ''Organization and Environment''. Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; into the economic environment, in particular market competition and technological change.  A broader approach was developed by a British team of researchers at the [[University of Aston]], widely known as [[Aston Group]] by developing a conceptual scheme for the comparative analysis of organizational structure which took account of several contextual factors at the same time ([[Derek S. Pugh|Pugh]], [[David J. Hickson|Hickson]], et al., 1963).&lt;ref&gt;Derek S. Pugh, and David J. Hickson et.al (1963). ''A Conceptual Scheme for Organizational Analysis''. Administrative Science Quarterly, 8, 289 – 315&lt;/ref&gt;

A conceptual model of the contingency approach was developed by [[Alfred Kieser|Kieser]] and [[Herbert Kubicek|Kubicek]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Kieser, and Herbert Kubicek (1983). ''Organization'', (3rd ed. 1992), Berlin-New York&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, the formal structure of an organization defines the roles of its members in a specific way and thereby directs their behavior to a certain degree. The performance of the organization depends on the degree to which these role definitions enable members to cope with the requirements resulting from the context of the organization.

'''Daniel Edward Koshland Jr.''' (March 30, 1920{{snds}}July 23, 2007) was an American [[biochemistry|biochemist]]. He reorganized the study of biology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]],  and was the editor of the leading US science journal, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', from 1985 to 1995. He was a Member of the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Schekman R |title = The nine lives of Daniel E. Koshland Jr. (1920 2007) |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 104 |issue = 37 |pages = 14551–2 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17720803 |url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/extract/104/37/14551?etoc |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0707644104 |pmc = 1976236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Koshland was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family, the son of [[Daniel E. Koshland Sr.]] and Eleanor Haas, daughter of the Haas family patriarch [[Abraham Haas]].&lt;ref name=BKFellowship&gt;[http://bkfellowships.org/daniel-e-koshland-sr/ Butler Koshland Fellowships: "Daniel E. Koshland, Sr.] retrieved April 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather was wool merchant [[Simon Koshland]]. He has two siblings: Frances "Sissy" Koshland Geballe and Phyllis Koshland Friedman.&lt;ref name=BKFellowship /&gt; His father served as CEO of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] from 1955 to 1958&lt;ref name=BKFellowship /&gt; and is widely credited with saving the company during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/33009/daniel-koshland-biologist-and-philanthropist-dies-at-87/ JWeekly: "Daniel Koshland, biologist and philanthropist, dies at 87" by Joe Eskenazi] July 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Koshland's private fortune, derived from [[Levi Strauss]], put him on lists of America's wealthiest people.&lt;ref name="LARichest"&gt;{{cite news |title = Richest List Has Gates at No. 1, Plus 83 Californians |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/29/business/fi-37381/2 |accessdate = April 1, 2016 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = September 29, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than relying on his fortune, Koshland chose to pursue a career in science.&lt;ref name="Maugh"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Maugh, II |first1 = Thomas H. |title = Daniel Koshland Jr., 87; UC Berkeley molecular biologist |url = http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-koshland26jul26-story.html |accessdate = April 1, 2016 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koshland wrote in an autobiographical article that he decided to become a scientist in the eighth grade after reading two popular books about science, ''Microbe Hunters'' by [[Paul de Kruif]] and ''[[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Koshland D |title = How to Get Paid for Having Fun |journal = Annu.

== Research career ==

Attending [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.exeter.edu/news_and_events/news_events_958.aspx |title = Phillips Exeter Academy &amp;#124; Dr. Daniel E. Koshland '37 to Receive the John Phillips Award |publisher = Exeter.edu |date =  |accessdate = October 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for high school Koshland then became the third generation of his family to matriculate to the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) where  he majored in chemistry.
The next five years, 1941–46, were spent working with [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the University of Chicago on the top-secret [[Manhattan project]], where his team purified the plutonium that was used to make the atomic bomb at Los Alamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/1998_s_presentation.htm |title = Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science |last =  |first =  |date =  |website = laskerfoundation.org |publisher = The Lasker Foundation |accessdate = July 6, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090106181645/http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/1998_s_presentation.htm |archive-date = January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, he received his Ph.D. in [[organic chemistry]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Remembrances: Daniel E. Koshland Jr. (1920–2007) |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118559171788881054#koshland.html |newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |date = July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His early work was in [[enzyme kinetics]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], Long Island, and [[Rockefeller University]], New York. This led him to propose the [[Lock and key model|induced fit model]] for [[enzyme catalysis]]. After this advance, he turned to studying how [[bacteria]] control their movements in [[chemotaxis]].
Dr. Koshland's laboratory made three major discoveries concerning [[protein phosphorylation]] in bacteria.  (1) The first phosphorylated bacterial protein, [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]], was identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The reversible phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase of Salmonella typhimurium |date = October 1, 1982 |doi = 10.1016/0003-9861(82)90321-6 |volume = 218 |issue = 1 |journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |pages = 59–67 |pmid = 6756316 |author = Wang JY, Koshland DE }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) It was demonstrated that substituting an aspartate residue for the serine residue that was phosphorylated causes the protein to behave as if it were phosphorylated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenase by phosphorylation is mediated by the negative charge of the phosphate |date = March 25, 2013 |pmid = 3112144 |volume = 262 |issue = 22 |journal = J Biol Chem |pages = 10422–5 |author1 = Thorsness |first1 = P. E. |last2 = Koshland Jr |first2 = D. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) The [[response regulator]]s in the [[two-component regulatory system]]s were shown to be phosphorylated on an aspartate residue and to be [[protein phosphatases]] with a covalent intermediate.&lt;ref name="Sanders1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Sanders |first1 = DA |last2 = Gillece-Castro |first2 = BL |last3 = Stock |first3 = AM |last4 = Burlingame |first4 = AL |last5 = Koshland DE |first5 = Jr |title = Identification of the site of phosphorylation of the chemotaxis response regulator protein, CheY. |journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry |date = December 25, 1989 |volume = 264 |issue = 36 |pages = 21770–8 |pmid = 2689446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Phosphorylation site of NtrC, a protein phosphatase whose covalent intermediate activates transcription |date = March 25, 2013 |pmc = 206329 |pmid = 1321122 |volume = 174 |issue = 15 |journal = J Bacteriol |pages = 5117–22 |author1 = Sanders |first1 = D.

He spearheaded the reorganization of the biological sciences at Berkeley, merging 11 departments into three.&lt;ref name=Sanders /&gt;  In 1992, Koshland Hall was named after him.&lt;ref name="Maugh" /&gt; The building is located next to (and on some floors connected to) Barker Hall.

A '''Decree of the President of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|Указ Президента Российской Федерации}}; ''Ukaz Prezidenta Rossiyskoy Federatsii'') or '''Executive Order (Decree) of the President of Russia'''&lt;ref&gt;The English term "Executive Order" is also used by official website as equivalent of Russian ''ukaz''. See [http://kremlin.ru/acts/17275 in Russian] or [http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/4833 in English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example: http://eng.kremlin.ru/acts/5331&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal act (''[[ukase]]'') with the status of a by-law made by the [[Russian president]].

As normative legal acts, such ''ukazes'' have the status of [[by-law]]s in the hierarchy of legal acts (along with [[Order of the Government of Russia|Decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation]] and instructions and directions of other officials). Presidential decrees may not alter existing laws of higher precedence  - [[:Category:Treaties of Russia|Russia's international agreements]], the [[Constitution of Russia]], [[Federal Constitutional Law (Russia)|Federal Constitutional Law]]s, [[Federal Law]]s and [[laws of Russian regions]] - and may be superseded by any of these laws. For example, because of Article 15 of the Constitution of Russia, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], as an international document, has higher status than any Russian law or presidential executive order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.constitution.kremlin.ru/#article-15-4 "Universally recognized principles and norms of international law as well as international agreements of the Russian Federation should be an integral part of its legal system. If an international agreement of the Russian Federation establishes rules, which differ from those stipulated by law, ''then the rules of the international agreement shall be applied''."]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragan Đilas''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Драган Ђилас}}, {{IPA-sh|drǎɡan d͡ʑîlaːs|pron}}, born 22 February 1967) is a Serbian politician and businessman who was the [[mayor of Belgrade|Mayor]] of [[Belgrade]] from 2008 to 2013. 

From 25 November 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=83343 Belgrade Mayor is new leader of opposition DS, ''B92'', November 26, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921064617/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=83343 |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 31 May 2014, he served as the President of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Demokratska Stranka]] (DS), the nation's main opposition party.

As a member of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS), Đilas has been the mayor of the Serbian capital city since 2008. He served as the Minister without Portfolio in charge of the National Investment Plan in the [[Cabinet of Serbia (2007–2008)|2007-2008 Cabinet of Serbia]] and prior to that as the director of the People's Office of the [[President of Serbia|President]] between 2004 and 2007.

On 18 April 2011 Đilas became the President of [[Basketball Federation of Serbia]] (KSS). He resigned in November 2016.

==Early career==
Đilas graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]] Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in the [[aerospace engineering]] program.

He worked as journalist at [[Radio Index]]. On 15 May 1989, part of Radio Index merged with ''Ritam Srca'' radio programme thus forming [[B92|Radio B92]], meaning that Đilas was one of the new station's founders. He soon became a news editor at the station.

Simultaneously, Đilas was active in opposing the rule of [[Slobodan Milošević]], leading the student protests in 1991 and 1992. On 19 March 1991, only ten days following the violent [[March 9, 1991 protest|March 9th Protest]] that claimed two lives and the ensuing student clashes with the police, Milošević (at that time the President of Serbia) came to the University of Belgrade in order to face the students where student leader Đilas got a chance to address him in an uncomfortable encounter recorded by the TV cameras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AweZ3Cs2rs0 Đilas vs. Sloba, March 19, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Đilas was part of an official student delegation that Milošević received. As a student leader/activist, in June 1992, Đilas appeared on [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] interview programme ''Razgovor s povodom'' thus getting 50 minutes of air time on state television, which he used to further criticize Milošević's policies. All throughout this period Đilas continuously received offers from two largest opposition parties at that time, the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO) and the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS) to join their ranks, but he refused.

In the coming years, he continued to actively participate in various anti-Milošević rallies between 1996 and 2000, although by now his activism took a back seat to his budding business career in the [[mass media]] market.

==Business career==
Since the mid-1990s, Đilas is very active in the Serbian media market. After completion of the journalistic career has entered into marketing business as media director at the agency "Saatchi &amp; Saatchi". He then went to [[Prague]], and there with a few friends opened company in 1995. He began his first business in Belgrade 1998.

He has a minority stake in a limited-liability company called Multikom Group whose ownership is dividid between Đilas (25%), Dragoslav Ilić (42%), Milica Delević (25%) and Nebojša Garić (8%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713190035/http://pretraga.apr.gov.rs/RepsisPublicSite/Public/Enterprise/Founder.aspx?BusinessEntityId=1110760&amp;RegistryCode=17587510&amp;rnd=2136254357 Multikom Group d.o.o.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also active in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Montenegro.

Since 2001, Đilas co-owns (through Multikom Group) a closed joint stock company called Direct Media,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713065648/http://pretraga.apr.gov.rs/RepsisPublicSite/Public/Enterprise/Founder.aspx?BusinessEntityId=1022265&amp;RegistryCode=17337785&amp;rnd=258764069 Direct Media a.d.]&lt;/ref&gt; a media company that sells advertising space in various Serbian electronic media outlets. The company also offers ad rights in large sporting events such as the World Cup, Olympics, and World Basketball Championships.

==Political career==
Even though he was politically active in various forms since his early youth, Đilas officially entered politics in 2004 when he joined the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS).

===People's Office===
On October 1, 2004 Đilas became the director of the People's Office, instituted by the newly elected [[President of Serbia]] [[Boris Tadić]]. The creation of People's Office was one of Tadić's election promises at the June 2004 presidential elections. Đilas stayed in the position until May 2007 when the new [[Cabinet of Serbia (2007–2008)|Government of Serbia]] was finally formed by the DS and the [[Democratic Party of Serbia|DSS]]-[[New Serbia|NS]] coalition almost 5 months after [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|January 2007 parliamentary election]]. He became the Minister without Portfolio in charge of the National Investment Plan (NIP).

===Minister without Portfolio in charge of NIP===
His tenure, however, was short-lived since the government fell in February 2008 following the declaration of independence of Kosovo.

Đilas' time in office was marked by frequent vicious clashes with the government colleague Minister for Capital Investment [[Velimir Ilić]]. The two already had history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2005&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=180003 Ministar kapitalni opet napada, B92, November 8, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; of public feuding when they became part of the same cabinet in May 2007. It didn't take long for their feud to reignite and in October 2007 things boiled over when Ilić placed an angry, obscenity-laced phone call to Đilas' office, the transcript of which ended up in Serbian media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/politika.php?id=15240 Velja Ilić prostački izvređao Ðilasa i sekretaricu, ''Blic'', October 6, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510020340/http://www.blic.rs/politika.php?id=15240 |date=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayor of Belgrade===
On 19 August 2008, Đilas was sworn in as the new Mayor of Belgrade.

During the 2008 Belgrade mayoral election campaign, Đilas was often denounced as a "[[tycoon]]" by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia 2005)|Liberal Democratic Party]] due to his amassed personal wealth. There was even a wall-spraying campaign with the phrase "Đilas Tajkun" written on various buildings around Belgrade. However, the party denied any link with the sprayed writings.

He was dismissed as mayor on 18 November 2013 and [[Siniša Mali]] was appointed as President of the Temporary Council of Belgrade.

=== Alliance for Serbia (Savez za Srbiju - SzS) ===
After [[Belgrade City Assembly election, 2018|Belgrade City Council elections]] in 2018, Đilas announced a formation of a new opposition political alliance - as a counterweight to ruling [[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS]]. His ambition was to gather all opposition political parties and organizations, regardless of their political orientation. He partially succeeded in this, and SzS was officially formed in September 2018, gathering both center left parties like [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|DS]] and center right parties like [[People's Party (Serbia, 2017)|NS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/lutovac-dss-sds-i-psg-dobrodosli-u-savez-za-srbiju/0bvyhfj|title=Lutovac: DSS, SDS i PSG dobrodošli u Savez za Srbiju (in Serbian)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Đilas welcomed Dveri (a right wing political party) into the alliance, some liberal and left leaning organizations (notably [[Saša Janković]]'s [[Movement of Free Citizens (Serbia)|PSG]]) refused to take part in the alliance, though they stated they are willing to cooperate on various subjects, especially on the matter of election organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/sr/druga-i-ostale-kolone/a-44828222|title=Druga i ostale kolone (in Serbian)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serbianmonitor.com/en/alliance-for-serbia-founded/|title=Alliance for Serbia founded|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and other endeavours==
Đilas is the founder and vice president of Naša Srbija humanitarian organisation for Serbian children who were left without one or both parents in the wars in the former Yugoslavia.

He divorced in 2007. He was married to Milica Delević from 1994, who is also politically active. From fall 2003 until mid-August 2004 she headed the Office for Cooperation with the European Union under the [[Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro|Council of Ministers]]. Then from 2007 until 2008, she was the deputy to Serbian Foreign Minister [[Vuk Jeremić]]. From November 2008, she is heading the Office for European Integration in the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian Government]]. They have two daughters together, Sofija and Jovana.

In September 2009, 42-year-old Đilas married the 28-year-old doctor Iva Pelević in a low-key civic ceremony. A year later they had a church wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.rs/Estrada/Dragan-Djilas-posle-godinu-dana-u-braku-rekao-svojoj-zeni-da-i-u-crkvi.html Dragan Đilas posle godinu dana u braku, rekao svojoj ženi “da” i u crkvi!]&lt;/ref&gt; They have a daughter named Ana and a son named Vuk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">The '''Enron Code of Ethics''' was a 64-page booklet published by [[Enron]] Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mishkenot.org.il/Hebrew/docs/ethics/%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D/Enron%20Code%20Of%20Ethics.pdf] Scan of the complete book by [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt; the last known edition of which was in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/enrons-code-ethics] Article and scans of the book on [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of copies of the booklet on [[Ebay]] has passed into internet folklore. 
An article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' for February 10, 2002 reported a final bid level on one copy of USD 202.50. 
Another sale on Ebay (which ran from February 13 to February 20, 2002) carried the item number "1074129276". In the latter sale, the booklet was sold together with a cup, also allegedly an Enron product, which featured text extolling the virtues of the Enron retirement plan.

The content of the booklet has attracted less interest than the fact that Enron had a code of ethics.

== Biography ==
Kilzie was born on June 4, 1968.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

In 1993, he graduated from the [[Kuban State Medical University]], with a specialization «Biochemistry». In October of the same year he became the Department Head  at the Moscow Office of ANAS GROUP. In January 1995 he was appointed Managing Director of the Company, whose duties included estimation of competitive environment and competitiveness of manufacture of chemical production at the level of countries, regions of [[Russia]] and countries of the [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], as well as drawing up of reviews on condition and development prospects of separate chemical companies and enterprises.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;[http://lib.fedpress.ru/person/kilzie-fares-n Kilzie Fares N. // FederalPress]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1996, Kilzie was appointed Managing Director of FABA CHEMICALS GmbH, where he was engaged in development and implementation of projects on optimization of direct supplies of raw materials from Russia and [[CIS countries]] with arrangement of project financing, insurance of project risks in Russia.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

In January 2000, he became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Creon Advisory Company ([[Moscow]]). Since May 2012 he has been working as the Chairman of the Board of Directors at Creon Energy.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

In 2001, Kilzie established the first independent industry-specific information agency RCC (Russian Chemical Consulting) GmbH, which has become one of the most authoritative corporate information portals in Russia in the area.

In 2002, CREON Group was founded and Kilzie supervised the process of elaboration and estimation of the business plans, worked on technical and economical grounds of investment projects, conducted condition researches and prospects of development of separate oil and gas chemical companies and enterprises, and estimated the commercial potential of new technologies and products (ethylene, propylene, associated petroleum gas, liquefied hydro carbonic gas, liquefied natural gas). In 2012 Kilzie took charge of CREON Energy, which has been the official adviser of the [[Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation]] throughout several years, in particular in the classification of questions regarding liquefied hydro carbonic gas, which is considered to be the basis for customs-tariff regulation.&lt;ref name="tass"&gt;[http://tass.ru/ekonomika/836383 Mayor is againstincreaseofexporttaxesforliquefied hydrocarbon gases till 2017—2018 // Tass. 16.12.2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same 2012, a unique company entered the market - OJSC INVENTRA, focusing on consultancy services exclusively for polymers industry and the related produced products. And 2017 saw the rise of the company CREON Chemicals specializing in agro chemistry and special chemistry.

In 2016, Kilzie took the lead in the establishment of a direct investment fund, CREON Energy Fund SICAV-SIF, focused on investments in the chemicals sector in the Russian Federation. The estimated overall amount of fund investments exceeds €100mln. The Fund is investing in the projects at their initial stage, in growing and expanding Russian and CIS companies, as well as in eco-projects of 'green' economy and alternative energy. The managing company and the unlimited partner is CREON Capital S.a.r.l. with the head office located in [[Luxembourg]]. The partners of CREON Capital are [[Caceis Bank Luxembourg]] S.A., [[Ernst &amp; Young]] S.A., [[Arendt &amp; Medernach]] S.A.

Kilzie speaks fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Arabic]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He is married and has five children.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

== Professional experience ==
As the head of CREON Group, Kilzie took part in management of some projects. Thus, since 2014 CREON Group has acted as the adviser and the operator of the civil-engineering design of methanol manufacturing factory Methanol Serverny which is implemented by NGSK company in [[Ust-Luga]] ([[Leningrad region]]), and is responsible for full-scale project realization.&lt;ref name="KommUst"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2588594 Ust-Luga will accept double methanol // Kommersant. 13.10.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, after several years of cooperation, CREON Group developed a separate Gazprom Eastern Gas Program including a Feasibility Study (FS), offers on production technologies selection and evaluation of licensed extraction facilities. One of the most important factors of this program was an increase in helium production, based on the hypothesis that the development of Chayadinsk and Kovyktinsk extraction facilities might change dramatically the situation on the world gas market. Moreover, the estimation of the Vladivostok LNG was conducted – the liquefied natural gas manufacturing factory (LNG) with the capacity of at least 15 mln tonnes per year.

Within the frames of work on the KazAzot project (unique producer of ammonia and ammonium nitrate in the Republic of Kazakhstan) the efforts of the Group’s consultants were focused on execution of a full technical and technological company audit (due diligence). The strategy for the company’s further development was also elaborated together with the choice of licenses and company’s management schemes. For Sibmethachem company from Tomsk, the Group prepared the site development with due consideration of new tendencies in methanol production. As a result, in 2015, Sibmethachem hit the record production figures for methanol (874 thousand tones). At the instructions of GazpromNeft Company, the CREON Group developed a strategy for the development of oil technologies sector with identification of priority directions in development and analysis of existing and projected products portfolio. At the request of one of the largest oil-producing companies in Russia, the CREON Group worked out the justification of the investment project on the basis of market analysis for benzene production facilities across Russia and the CIS countries, with a forecast up to 2035.

Overall working experience amounts to more than 20 years of experience in investments and international petrochemicals consulting industry, including sixteen years of heading the Board of Directors of CREON Group of Companies.

== Public activities ==
=== Rating of oil&amp;gas companies in Russia performed together with WWF ===
In 2014, together with [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], Kilzie and Creon Energy organized The first [[:ru:Рейтинг экологической ответственности нефтегазовых компаний РФ|Environmental Responsibility Rating of Oil &amp; Gas companies of the Russian Federation]], within Rational Approach Project. Rating included 19 leading companies on volumes of oil and natural gas extraction. Rating grade was calculated for each company as average for 28 rating criteria. According to calculations, Surgutneftegaz Company became the winner; Sakhalin Energy comes second place, Gazprom is on the third place.&lt;ref name="Mirnovostei"&gt;[http://mirnov.ru/lenta-novostej/ekologicheski-reiting-neftegazovyh-kompani-rossii.html Presented environmental rating of oil-and-gas companies of Russia // «Mir novostei». 06.01.2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/economics/2015-04-14/4_oil.html «Common sense» of oil companies // «Nezavisimaya gazeta». 14.04.2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal idea behind this rating is to encourage companies to make good use of [[hydrocarbon]] resources, to ensure [[environmental protection]] and an ecologically and socially responsible business in Russia. This project was developed in order to provide ‘greening’ of the petrochemicals industry, to include environmental operations into the list of priorities of Oil&amp;Gas Companies and to develop regulatory activities amongst the State authorities of the Russian Federation. Today, this is the only rating in Russia that serves as a tool in evaluation of levels of environmental responsibility of all companies extracting more than 1.5 mln tonnes of oil per year.

When the results of the second Rating (end of 2015) were published, the national petrochemical industry journal Neftegazovaya Vertikal admitted that over just one year, the Rating has been recognised by the companies of this industry, which was particularly reflected in the meeting between representatives of the petrochemicals sector at the premises of CREON Group, which was dedicated to the methodology correction. This meeting was attended by representatives of 11 companies, who put forward more than 70 proposals. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) included the Rating in its compilation of corporate practice named “Business. Russia. Ecology. People.” The methodology of the research, which has no equivalents, has already attracted interest from abroad, and this helps in reinforcing a positive image of Russia overseas.&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;[http://new.wwf.ru/resources/news/neft-i-gaz/wwf-opublikovan-reyting-ekootvetstvennosti-neftegazovykh-kompaniy/ WWF: The rating of eco-responsibility of oil and gas companies is published]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/economics/2016-01-18/3_kartblanshe.html CARTE BLANCHE. The price of oil ecology is not a hindrance? // Nezavisimaya Gazeta]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rating is carried out annually and its publication is considered as a major event in the ecological field of petrochemicals sector in the Russian Federation. It includes such companies as [[Arktik Gaz]], [[Bashneft]], [[BelkamNeft]], [[Gazprom]], [[Gazprom Neft]], [[Zarubezhneft]], [[Irkutsk Oil Company]], [[LUKOIL]], [[NNK]], [[Novatek]], [[Rosneft]], [[RussNeft]], [[Salym Petroleum Development]], [[Sakhalin Energy]], [[:ru:Славнефть|Slavneft]], [[Surgutneftegaz]], [[Tatneft]], [[:ru:Томскнефть|Tomskneft]], [[Total Razvedka Razrabotka Rossiya]], [[Transneft]], and [[Exxon NL]].&lt;ref name="wwf"/&gt;

All expenditures for elaboration, estimation, corrections and drawing results are financed by Kilzie.

=== Partnership with the RIAC ===
In October 2015, The Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), in association with the Centre for Strategic Studies (SAM) of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with the support of CREON Group, held an international conference: “Russia &amp; Turkey – Forging Multidimensional Partnership”. The purpose of the conference was to discuss current aspects of collaboration between Russia and Turkey, mechanisms for implementation of joint infrastructure projects, approaches of the two countries to regional problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiancouncil.ru/news/rossiya-i-turtsiya-vmeste-protiv-nestabilnosti/?sphrase_id=70872 Russia and Turkey — together against instability // RIAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, RIAC also held in cooperation with CREON Group and Russian-Chinese Committee for Friendship and Development, the second international conference: “Russia &amp; China – Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations”. The event was held with the support of governmental agencies of the Russian Government and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this conference was to assess the status and development tendencies of Russian-Chinese relations, to identify main achievements and unsettled issues of bilateral cooperation and to prepare proposals for the leaderships of both China and Russia on further development of strategic partnership. The conference became a significant event in the preparation process of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China at the end of June 2016, and received massive coverage in the Russian, Chinese and English-language media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiancouncil.ru/news/zavershilas-konferentsiya-rossiya-i-kitay-k-novomu-kachestvu/?sphrase_id=70871 “Russia &amp; China – Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations” // RIAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International industry-related events ===
In general, for all working experience of the CREON Group and by Kilzie personally, more than 300 business conferences, congresses and forums have been held, dedicated to the issues of extraction and processing of fossil carbon fuels, processing of polymers, and development of agrochemicals. Some of the events have contributed to formation of an innovative vector of development in extracting and recycling branches of the Russian economy.

In 2007 the Group organized the first conference in the country on associated petroleum gas in last decade for subject and complex discussion of problems on effective processing liquefied natural gas (LNG) that subsequently promoted the adoption of law, forcing all oil companies by 2012 to provide 95 percent useful recycling of associated petroleum gas on all of their sites. By the seventh international conference "Associated petroleum gas 2016", a number of leading players of oil branch had already reached recycling level of 95% or have come close to it. However, there were complexities with recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the remote, complex or new sites, and the level of recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) became one of the key parameters of the rating of ecological safety of the oil and gas companies of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2015/09/08/607889-effektivnost-bez-sanktsii Efficiency without sanctions // Vedomosti]&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 witnessed the organization of unique in Russia debatable platform on coverage of helium market, which has no analogues in Europe. As a result development of manufacture of helium in Russia has justified CREON Group predictions about a high export potential of this product. The director for development and strategy of Gazprom Marketing and Trading France Didier Lebo at the conference "Helium 2016" has informed that with the start of Amur gas recycling factory of Gazprom for the first time one source of manufacture will be enough to cover predicted deficiency in the world market at various scenarios within the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogjrussia.com/uploads/images/Articles/March_17/26-29.pdf The helium market in Russia // Oil&amp;Gas Journal Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other key themes of the actions organised by CREON company and Kilzie manufacture may be highlighted LNG/CNG, LCG, [[petrol]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2016/05/05/640022-benzinovaya-stabilnost Petrol stability // Vedomosti]&lt;/ref&gt; [[diesel fuel|diesel]], mineral fertilizers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://echo.msk.ru/blog/rodionoff/1936586-echo/ How does the Russian mineral fertilizer market go through a crisis? // Echo of Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; caustic soda,&lt;ref name="expert2"/&gt; [[sulfur]] and [[sulfuric acid]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://glavportal.com/article/rynok-sery-i-sernoj-kisloty-chto-delat-proizvoditelyam-v-usloviyah-proficita-produkcii/ The market of sulfur and sulfuric acid: what should manufacturers do in the context of surplus products? // Business of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

In March 2012, Creon Company organized «Caustic Soda 2012» Conference. The key issue of the conference was cartel agreement case, initiated by the [[Federal Antimonopoly Service]] (FAS) against manufacturers of [[caustic soda]] and [[chlor]]ic production headed by United Trade Company (UTK).&lt;ref name="expert2"&gt;[http://expert.ru/expert/2012/11/privivka-ot-kartelnoj-chumyi/ Vaccination against cartel plague// Expert Online. 19.03.2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Plastics of Russia award ===
In 2014, Creon Energy Group organized the Plastics of Russia National Forum and established the self-titled award aimed at encouragement of Russian companies and enterprises engaged in the formation of the country's plastic industry. First annual Forum was supported by the [[Ministry of Industry and Trade (Russia)|Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation]] and [[Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation]]. According to Kilzie, plastic converting became the national basis and is able to be a key point for development of a significant segment of the Russian industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Speeches at this forum proved the significant opportunities for development of domestic market of plastics production in all segments of the national economy.&lt;ref name="expert"&gt;[http://expert.ru/2013/10/8/vozmozhnosti-vnutrennego-ryinka-kolossalnyi/ Huge possibilities of the internal market // Expert Online. 08.10.2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="креон"&gt;[http://www.creonenergy.ru/consulting/detailConf.php?ID=110900 Forum “Polymers of Russia — 2014” // Creon Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Plastics of Russia Award had eleven categories for polymer products producers and processors. Among the winners of the award were recognised market leaders (including Kazanorgsintez, Ufaorgsintex, SIBUR and Mosoblgaz companies) together with new market players, such as the recently-opened polymer film plant in Rostov Region Waterfall Pro.

The award ceremony was covered by leading trade publications and business media, including ''Expert'' magazine, the Prime agency for economic news, the PRO-Business television network, and other major organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">'''Fernand Collin''' ([[Antwerp]], 18 December 1897 – 11 December 1990), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman. He was president of the [[KBC Bank|Kredietbank]] from 1938 to 1973 and was also a professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].

At the start of [[World War II]], Fernand Collin, together with [[Alexandre Galopin]] ([[Société Générale de Belgique]]) and [[Max-Léo Gérard]] (Banque de Bruxelles) were given a mandate to manage the Belgian economy during the war. [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] told them in May 1940 ''Nous vous confions la Belgique'' (E: We trust you with Belgium).

He was CEO of the [[pudding]] producing company ''Imperial Products'', which merged in 1968 with ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Devos Lemmens|nl}}'' into ''Continental Foods'' (it was sold to [[Campbell Soup]] in 1985). In 1962, he published an article in the [[Yale Law Journal]], where in a note on the ''Unit of Account'' he expanded on the idea of a [[Euro|European currency]] in order to ''revitalize the international money markets''.&lt;ref&gt;The Unit of Account: Enforceability under American Law of Maintenance-of-Value Provisions in International Bonds, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 71, No. 7 (June 1962), pp. 1294-1315&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food miles''' is the distance [[food]] is [[transport]]ed from the time of its production until it reaches the [[consumer]]. Food miles are one factor used when assessing the [[Environmentalism|environmental]] impact of food, including the impact on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Engelhaupt | first1 = E | year = 2008 | title = Do food miles matter? | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 42 | issue = | page = 3482 | doi=10.1021/es087190e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of food miles originated in the early 2018s in the United Kingdom. It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.ac.uk/communityandhealth/phpcfp/foodpolicy/index.html.  He explains its history in this article Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)’, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97&lt;/ref&gt; at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment (SAFE) Alliance&lt;ref&gt;The SAFE Alliance merged with the National Food Alliance in 1999 to become Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming http://www.sustainweb.org/. Professor Tim Lang chaired Sustain from 1999 to 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in print in a report “The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport”, researched and written by Angela Paxton.&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;Paxton, A (1994). The Food Miles Report: The dangers of long-distance food transport. SAFE Alliance, London, UK. http://www.sustainweb.org/publications/?id=191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iles, A. (2005). Learning in sustainable agriculture: Food miles and missing objects. Environmental Values, 14, 163-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the [[globalization]] of trade; the focus of food supply bases into fewer, larger districts; drastic changes in delivery patterns; the increase in processed and packaged foods; and making fewer trips to the supermarket.  These make a small part of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions created by food; 83% of overall emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in production phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = C.

 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 42 | issue = 10| pages = 3508–3513
 | doi=10.1021/es702969f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle, including production, consumption, and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/ww/localfood|title=Sources and Resources for “Local Food: The Economics” - Worldwatch Institute|author=|date=|website=www.worldwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate'.  In the UK, for example, agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain (including retail, packaging, fertilizer manufacture, and other factors), whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions.&lt;ref&gt;(Garnett 2011, Food Policy)&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information.

The concept of "food miles" has been criticised, and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production. In comparison, the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29%, far greater than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;John Hendrickson, "Energy use in the U.S. Food System: A summary of existing research and analysis." Sustainable Farming (Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec), vol. 7, no. 4. Fall 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of [[sustainability]] which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including [[local food]]. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, [[City University, London]]) who says: "The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)’, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97&lt;/ref&gt;  The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Millstone and Tim Lang, The Atlas of Food, Earthscan, London, 1963, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions.

Although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a [[DEFRA]] report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at [[AEA Technology]] Environment, entitled ''The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development'', included findings that "the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over £9 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. et al. (2005) The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development: Final report. DEFRA, London. See https://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/foodmiles/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider. Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place.&lt;ref name="motu.org.nz"&gt;http://www.motu.org.nz/files/docs/agdpresentations/AgD23_Saunders_-_Carbon_footprinting_and_other_trade_factors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the positive environmental effects of [[organic farming]] may be compromised by increased [[transport]]ation, unless it is produced by local [[farm]]s.  The [[Carbon Trust]] notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontrust.com/news/2012/03/food-the-carbon-story "Food, the carbon story"], ''[[The Carbon Trust]]'', 15 March 2012. Retrieved on 20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food miles in business==
A recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez (Applied Economics and Management), at [[Cornell University]] and supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets.  It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prevor|first=Jim|title=Jim Prevor’s Perishable Pundit|url=http://www.perishablepundit.com/index.php?date=10/01/10&amp;pundit=1|accessdate=20 July 2011|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating food miles==

With processed foods that are made of many different ingredients, it is very complicated, though not impossible, to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient, by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport (air, road or rail). However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number – although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable – or not – a food product is.&lt;ref name="Paxton"/&gt;

Wal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food traveled 1500 miles before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Black, "What’s in a Number: How the Press Got the Idea That Food Travels 1,500 Miles from Farm to Plate," Slate, September 17, 2008, www.slate.com/ id/ 2200202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Fair trade ===

According to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food [[supply chain]] that also contribute to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions which are not taken into account by simple "food miles" measurements.&lt;ref name="ChiMacGregorKing"&gt;Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009). [http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=15516IIED Fair Miles: Recharting the food miles map]. [[International Institute for Environment and Development|IIED]]/[[Oxfam]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi, 2009, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development. Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce, moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, J.; Vorley, B (2006) Fair Miles? Weighing environmental and social impacts of fresh produce exports from Sub-Saharan Africa to the UK. Fresh Insights no.9. International Institute for Environment and Development/ Natural Resources Institute, London, UK, 18 pp. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutPutId=173492&lt;/ref&gt;

However, exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people.  Unless the product has a Fairtrade label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Dolan, J. Humphrey, and C. Harris-Pascal, "Value Chains and Upgrading: The Impact of U.K. Retailers on the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Industry in Africa," Institute of Development Studies Working Paper 96, University of Sussex, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous.  Sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption, so local people can go hungry.&lt;ref&gt;Action Aid is one of many organisations drawing attention to this problem and campaigning to improve this situation - http://www.actionaid.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy used in production as well as transport ===
Researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what [[energy]] is used in its production. A recent DEFRA case study indicated that [[tomato]]es grown in [[Spain]] and transported to the [[United Kingdom]] may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] than heated [[greenhouse]]s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&amp;Module=More&amp;Location=None&amp;Completed=0&amp;ProjectID=15001|title=Defra, UK - Science Search|first=Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)|last=Department for Environment|date=|website=defra.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of [[Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)]] in accordance with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14040]], entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by [[economies of scale]]. Research from the [[Justus Liebig University Giessen]] show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of [[energy use]] per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-giessen.de/fbr09/pt/PT_Ecology_of_Scale.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlich E, Fleissner U: The Ecology of Scale. Assessment of Regional Energy Turnover and Comparison with Global Food. Int J LCA 10 (3) 219-223:2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlich E: Energy Economics and the Ecology of Scale in the Food Business. In: Caldwell PG and Taylor EV (editors): New Research on Energy Economics. [[Nova Science Publishers]] Hauppauge NY:2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2006 research report from the Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit at [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]] counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in [[food production]] in [[Europe]] and [[New Zealand]], taking into account energy used to ship the food to Europe for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, C; Barber, A; Taylor, G, [http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/Documents/2328_RR285_s13389.pdf  Food Miles – Comparative Energy/Emissions Performance of New Zealand’s Agriculture Industry] (2006). Research Report No. 285. Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit, [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln University]], Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McWilliams&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/opinion/06mcwilliams.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login&amp;oref=slogin |title=Food that travels well |first=James E. |last=McWilliams |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report states, "New Zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the UK. For example New Zealand [[agriculture]] tends to apply fewer [[fertilizer]]s (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant [[CO2 emissions]]) and animals are able to [[grazing|graze]] year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in [[compound feed|feed]] such as [[concentrate]]s. In the case of [[Dairy product|dairy]] and [[Lamb and mutton|sheep meat]] production NZ is by far more [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]], even including the transport cost, than the UK, twice as efficient in the case of dairy, and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat.&lt;ref name="motu.org.nz"/&gt; In the case of [[apple]]s, NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK."

Other researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand. Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments “in favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year, during July and August, when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.”&lt;ref&gt;'Food miles' minor element of carbon footprint, http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=40471.  See also a range of publications by Professor Edwards-Jones and a team of researchers at Bangor University, http://www.bangor.ac.uk/senrgy/staff/edwards.php.en&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Dr. Christopher Weber et al. of the total [[carbon footprint]] of food production in the U.S. have shown transportation to be of minor importance, compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production, and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es702969f | volume=42 | title=Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States | year=2008 | journal=Environmental Science | pages=3508–3513 | last1 = Weber | first1 = Christopher L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Livestock production as a source of greenhouse gases ===
	
Farm animals account for between 20% and 30% of global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;To see details of the United Nations research into meat and the environment, visit: http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html. See also Steinfeld, H et al. (2006) Livestock’s long shadow: Environmental issues and options. [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Rome. {{cite web |url=http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806144540/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.htm |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, T (2007) Meat and dairy production and consumption. Exploring the livestock sector’s contribution to the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom|UK’s greenhouse gas emissions]] and assessing what less greenhouse gas intensive systems of production
and consumption might look like Working paper produced a part of the work of the Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, [[University of Surrey]] http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrnPublications/publications/PDFs/Livestock_paper_2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skepticalscience.com/how-much-meat-contribute-to-gw.html|title=How much does animal agriculture and eating meat contribute to global warming?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;That figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals. Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. [[Deforestation]] eliminates [[carbon sinks]], accelerating the process of [[climate change]]. Cultivation, including the use of [[synthetic fertiliser]]s, releases greenhouse gases such as [[nitrous oxide]]. [[Nitrogen fertiliser]] is especially demanding of [[fossil fuels]], as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil.&lt;ref name="ChiMacGregorKing"/&gt;

Meanwhile, it’s increasingly recognised that [[meat]] and [[Dairy product|dairy]] are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK’s consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom|greenhouse gas emissions]]  related to consumption.&lt;ref name="ChiMacGregorKing"/&gt;

According to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]], even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0602-ucsc_liaw_food_miles.html Food miles are less important to environment than food choices, study concludes], Jane Liaw, special to [[Mongabay]], June 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They also concluded that "Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from [[red meat]] and [[dairy products]] to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food." In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.

=== "Local" food miles ===

A commonly ignored element is the [[last mile]]. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5&amp;nbsp;kg of meat over {{convert|60000|mi|km}} by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in [[bulk transport]], or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or {{convert|40|mi|km}} to buy that meat.  Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store  consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2009. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. Food Policy, 34 (2), pp. 150-155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated.  For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the [[last mile]] by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport.  Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2011. Food miles: time for a re-think? British Food Journal, 113 (7), pp. 919-934.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifecycle analysis, rather than food miles ===

[[life cycle assessment|Lifecycle analysis]], a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in [[resource depletion]], [[air|air pollution]] and [[water pollution]] and waste generation/[[municipal solid waste]].&lt;ref&gt;Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009). Fair Miles: Recharting the food miles map. IIED/Oxfam. http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=15516IIED – p16&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include http://www.carbontrustcertification.com/ and www.cffcarboncalculator.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Some are more robust than others but, at the moment, there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough, independent and reliable, and which ones are just marketing hype.

Even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption.  However it is one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development, namely environmental, social and economic.&lt;ref&gt;World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future, (1987). Oxford University Press. Often known as the Brundtland report, after the Chair of the Commission, Gro Harlem Brundtland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunday Times Rich List|''Sunday Times'' Rich List]] estimated his wealth at £162m (U$238m) {{as of|2008|4|lc=on}}, making him the 497th richest person in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3769825.ece | title=Frank Timis – Sunday Times Rich List | journal=The Sunday Times | date=27 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian magazine ''Capital'' reckoned Timiș to be the 9th richest [[Romanians|Romanian]], estimating his wealth at $290m {{as of|2006|lc=on}}. In 2012 he became the richest Romanian with a net worth of £1.34 billion (US$2.13 billion).

==Early life==

Born in [[Borşa|Borșa]], [[Maramureş County|Maramureș County]], he graduated from a [[vocational school]] for [[auto mechanic]]s. He left [[Romania]] and settled as a refugee in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Australia.&lt;ref name="centrul"&gt;Centrul Român pentru Jurnalism de Investigaţii [http://www.crji.org/arhiva/e_020522.htm "Vasile Frank Timiş, the Mastermind Behind the 'Roşia Montană' Operation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623075309/http://www.crji.org/arhiva/e_020522.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in Australia he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to supply and fined A$27,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Companies in Australia===

Timiș started his own transport company in Australia, which owned only one truck driven by himself. However, it went bankrupt in 1986 with debts of 15,806 AUD. According to [[Jurnalul Naţional|Jurnalul Național]], Timiș failed to declare this fact in the CV he published when he listed the company [[Gabriel Resources]] on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]], as required by law.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"&gt;Radu, Paul Christian, [[Jurnalul National]], [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol.php?id=828 "Viaţa secretǎ a lui Vasile Frank Timiş"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115025127/http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol.php?id=828 |date=15 November 2006 }} 23 June 2005 [http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/secretfrank2005.htm (English translation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071202/http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/secretfrank2005.htm |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he became the CEO of Morwest Holdings Pty Ltd, the first of his gold mining businesses. Timiș and two Australian miners dug for six months for gold in a region called [[Mosquito Creek (Australia)|Mosquito Creek]], but the result was a failure. In the meantime, he founded another three companies: Riverdale Mining, Timis Corporation, and Carpathian Investments, together with Ioana Timiș and his sister, Ioana Majdik. However, these companies were liquidated by Timiș, and all creditors were paid in full.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

Another setback was Timiș' investment in Pneumatic Systems International Pty Ltd. In 2001, he quit his investment and kept only 11.6% of the company, administered via a new company, Regal Group Services, in the [[British Virgin Islands]] [[tax haven]]. According to an ex-manager of the company, in 2003, those shares were worth under $1,500 AUD.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

Regal Group Services changed its name and headquarters, and is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange as [[Regal Petroleum]]. This company is associated with a Romanian company, Global Mineral Resources, owned by a son of a former Romanian senator of the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]], [[Teodor Hăucă]], who used to be secretary of the Economic Commission of the Romanian Senate between 1996 and 2000.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

===Gabriel Resources===
{{main article|Gabriel Resources|Roşia Montană}}

In 1995, Timiș founded Gabriel Resources NL Australia, and in the autumn of the same year, the Romanian state-owned mining company "Regia Autonomă a Cuprului din [[Deva, Romania|Deva]]" (RAC) announced that it was searching for a partnership with a foreign company for the mining of [[precious metals]] from the [[tailings]] in [[Roşia Montană|Roșia Montană]] and [[Gurabarză-Brad]]. However, [[Jurnalul Naţional|Jurnalul Național]] claims that it has documents indicating a collaboration signed by RAC Deva and Gabriel Resources one day before the announcement was published, on 4 September 1995.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt; Also, RAC claimed it received several offers, including from another Australian company, Lycopodium Pty Ltd., but that company has denied RAC's claim.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt;

According to ASIC, in April 1996, Gabriel Resources NL had financial problems with its creditors, including the [[National Australia Bank]] Ltd, and Timiș started a new company after paying all creditors in full, Gabriel Resources Limited, registered in the Jersey tax haven. The mining contract was redirected to the new company.&lt;ref name="jurnalul"/&gt; Timiș had an 80% stake in the joint company. The Romanian Agency of Mineral Resources declared that the new contract was unfavourable to the Romanian state, but it was allowed by the Government after a parliamentary vote.&lt;ref name="catavencu"&gt;[[Academia Caţavencu]], [http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_20433-Frank-Timis-a-inhatat-aurul-din-Apuseni-printr-o-caruta-de-falsuri-iar-Tariceanu-a-inchis-ochii.htm "Frank Timis a inhatat aurul din Apuseni printr-o caruta de falsuri, iar Tariceanu a inchis ochii"] 19 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Timiș had access to various databanks of the Romanian research institutes of mineralogy and got data on the area. His company also hired relevant scientists and an ex-officer of the Topographic Department of the Romanian Ministry of Defence who mapped the area.&lt;ref name="catavencu"/&gt;

Gabriel Resources sent 80 tonnes of ore to a research lab in Australia to measure the gold content. The ore was high in gold, and the market value of Gabriel Resources soared to $75 million. Timiș obtained a $3 million loan from the [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild]] bank in the United States. Between 1999–2000, the area being mined was increased from 12&amp;nbsp;km² to 22&amp;nbsp;km², and then to 42.8&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="catavencu"/&gt;

The resulting project in [[Rosia Montana|Roșia Montana]] has been a source of much controversy, with local people lining up on both sides of the issue, and some national and international environmental groups joining the opposition. One source of controversy involved the method used for mining, [[gold cyanidation]], which causes pollution. The company hopes to eventually extract 300 tonnes of gold and 1600 tonnes of silver from the area but the project is currently on hold.

===Regal Petroleum===
{{main article|Regal Petroleum}}

Regal Petroleum, founded by Timiș in November 1996, was listed on the London [[Alternative Investment Market]] and owned some oil and gas resources in Romania and Ukraine. However, it became famous after the September 2003 acquisition of 60% of an oilfield located in [[Kavala]], Greece. The Regal board hoped that the company's survey team had found one of the largest oil deposits in Europe: up to a billion barrels. The oil was allegedly under so much pressure that it almost destroyed the drilling platform.&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"&gt;[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] 22 May 2005 [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article134708.ece "Focus: The gusher"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This hype drove Regal's share price up to a peak of 509p, with the company's [[market value]] reaching £500m, making it one of the highest-valued companies of the Alternative Investment Market. Many private investors and respectable institutions (including [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Commerzbank]], Artemis and [[Schroders]]) invested more than £45m in the company. Days later, Timiș secretly agreed to sell the company's assets&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,3604,1510911,00.html "New Regal shock as ex-chairman's secret sell-off deal is revealed"] 21 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the resigned as chief executive of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], [http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,3604,1501503,00.html "Regal chairman resigns "] 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-2005, it was clear that Regal's oil field contained oil but not in commercial amounts. The flow rates were around 30 barrels a day and "deemed to be non-commercial".&lt;ref name="SundayTimes"/&gt; In a few hours, the stock fell by more than 60%, and as of June 2006, the share price was at 65p, less than 20% of the peak price. In 2010, the company was still worth about £200m, and had cash reserves of £80m,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citywire.co.uk/News/NewsArticle.aspx?VersionID=83185&amp;MenuKey=News.Home "Regal losses widen after 'difficult' year"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Regal lost its Ukraine gas production license in a trial but got it back through appeal one year later.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]], [https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,1699352,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, an environmental group, Alburnus Maior, asked the Romanian Supreme Court, under the freedom of information laws, whether Timiș was under any investigations. The answer was that his name was linked with three dossiers investigated by the organised crime department. However, Timiș denied all the claims and no charges were ever filed.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Independent]], [http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/press/indy2005.htm "Regal's Timis named in Romania organised crime investigation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071219/http://www.rosiamontana.org/documents/english/press/indy2005.htm |date=28 September 2007 }} 6 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later queries to the Romanian administration on this subject were given the answer that there are no investigations concerning Timiș.&lt;ref&gt;[[Averea]], [http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_23909-Dosarele-lui-Frank-Timis-s-au-evaporat.htm "Dosarele lui Frank Timis s-au evaporat"] 6 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the collapse in the share price of this company, the Alternative Investment Market decided in 2006 to toughen regulations for companies in the natural resources sector and to hire experts who would prevent future bubbles followed by price fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Accountancy Age, [http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2158341/aim-recruits-beef-rules AIM recruits to beef up rules"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823174041/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2158341/aim-recruits-beef-rules |date=23 August 2006 }} 15 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has, however, recently been given back licences that had been frozen by the government, and has begun to produce oil again.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===African Minerals (AMI.L, was Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation)===
In 2005, the Timiș Trust bought 30% of the shares of the Sierra Leone Diamond Corporation, via the Trust's Bermuda-registered Timis Diamond Corporation Limited. SLDC holds mineral rights over a third of the area of [[Sierra Leone]] in the northern part of the country,&lt;ref&gt;Awareness Times Newspaper, Sierra Leone [http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200575.shtml "Romanian buys more Sierra Leone Diamonds shares"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618183850/http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200575.shtml |date=18 June 2006 }}, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; including some important diamond fields and the Tonkolili &amp; Marampa Iron Ore Projects. The company is also exploring for uranium at Lovetta, and for gold and base metals in the [[Sula Mountains]], Gori Hills and Nimini Hills. On 16 August 2007 the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]]-listed company was renamed African Minerals Limited (AMI.L) to reflect these other interests.,&lt;ref&gt;London Stock Exchange RNS, [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=1555088 Change of Name]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2010 AMI announced an initial Mineral Resource estimate of over 10 billion tonnes of iron ore (independently valued) at an average grade of 29.9% Total Iron in the Numbara and Simbili targets at Tonkolili.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=2081364&amp;source=RNS | title= 4.7 Billion Tonne Initial Resource Estimate Confirms Tonkolili Iron Ore Project As World Class | publisher=London Stock Exchange | last=African Minerals Limited | date=2 February 2009 | accessdate=2 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Timiș, who is executive chairman of the company, increased his shareholding to 34% in June 2006&lt;ref&gt;London Stock Exchange RNS, [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=1251501 Directors Share Dealings]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 29 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and to 34.6% (40,875,002 shares) in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;London Stock Exchange RNS, [http://www.londonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/MarketNewsPopup.aspx?id=1308488 Directors Share Dealings]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009|02}} the entire company was worth £45m (US$65m).

In 2015, Frank Timis together with then CEO Alan Watling and CFO Matthew Hird took African Minerals into administration. The company has been forced to sell its 75% share to Shandong Iron and Steel Group for a grossly undervalued sum. Half year results for AMI were impressive, the Company posted a quarterly production of 4mt – an improvement of 81% on the prior 3 months. In January 2014 AMI  hit its operating capacity for the first time, producing 5.3mt and exporting 4.6mt in the first quarter. Earnings for the Company were US$203m in 2013 compared with a US$26.5m in 2012. Despite the best efforts of the team and management, the continued downturn in iron ore prices, slowing global growth and China’s appetite and the Ebola crisis (which infected almost 15,000 and claimed 4,000 lives) left AMI exposed.  The downturn in iron ore prices from US$128.12 in January 2014 decreased rapidly over coming months reaching US$68 in December 2014 and US$63 in February 2015. This combined with the Ebola crises created a perfect storm for the beleaguered mining company. Shandong refused to release remaining funds (US$100m) and their lawyers Linklater’s recognised a perfect opportunity to take over buying 75% of AMI shares at a grossly undervalued price and through a process that was anything but transparent. The Board, management and Timis fought passionately to keep the company from going to administration, but given the perfect storm it was facing and like many other junior mining Companies then and since, there was no alternative but administration.
Timis lost all of his $450m investment as did the institution investors, shareholders and bond holders. AMI is now operating as Shan Steel under Chinese leadership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5260">'''Gábor Szetey''' (born January 6, 1968) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] former politician and former Secretary of State for Human Resources in the [[Ferenc Gyurcsány|Gyurcsány]] government, a role he held from July 2006 to April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/article/11/hungarian_go-2/?cHash=74384ebf01 Hungarian gov't member publicly announces he is gay], ''Caboodle'', 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first [[Coming out|openly gay]] Hungarian government member. He currently lives in [[Spain]].

==Biography==

After graduating from the [[Corvinus University of Budapest|Budapest University of Economic Sciences]] in 1992, Szetey was an adviser, later senior partner at consulting companies in Budapest. In 2000–01, he worked as an adviser and trainer at Time Manager International USA Inc., New York. Between 2001–04 he was Human Resources Director at [[Kraft Foods]] Hungaria and [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] Magyarország (Hungary). He continued his career at Massalin Particulares (Philip Morris Argentina) in 2005, but decided to return to Hungary in 2006, when he was invited to work in the Government of Hungary. In 2009 he quit politics and went to [[Spain]] where he is currently a company director.

==Personal life==

Szetey publicly declared that he was [[gay]] at the opening night of Budapest's Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, on July 6, 2007. He is the first LGBT member of government in Hungary, and the second politician to [[coming out|come out]], after [[Klára Ungár]].&lt;ref name="budapest-sun"&gt;Robin Marshall, [http://www.budapestsun.com/cikk.php?id=26825 Gay Pride: state sec comes out], ''Budapest Sun'', July 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Szetey's coming out came at the end of a speech on equality and tolerance:

{{cquote|When we can be proud of being Hungarian, Romanian, Jewish, Catholic, gay or straight... If we can be proud of our differences, we will be proud of our similarities. I believe in God. And I believe that all men and women have the right to love and be loved. Everywhere. Love has no party preference. Neither does happiness or choosing a partner. So: I am Gábor Szetey. I am European, and Hungarian. I believe in God, love, freedom, and equality. I am the Human Resources Secretary of State of the Government of the Republic of Hungary. Economist and HR director. Partner, friend, sometimes rival. And I am gay.&lt;ref name=365gay&gt;[http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/07/070607hungary.htm Hungarian Cab Min Comes Out], 2007-07-06. ''[[365Gay.com]]''.  Retrieved on 2007-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Amongst the audience was [[Klára Dobrev]], the wife of Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]], as well as four other members of the Hungarian cabinet.
The Prime Minister supported Szetey on his blog&lt;ref&gt;{{hu icon}}[http://blog.amoba.hu/blog-3.php?oid=Te1a803f7c2e251e0e72faf98f3b1662 About the coming out], Blog of Ferenc Gyurcsány, July 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and called for public debate about [[civil unions in Hungary|same-sex relationships in Hungary]]. Hungary currently recognises same-sex registered partnerships. After the coming out of Mr. Szetey, the Parliament adopted the Registered Civil Union Act, which came into force 1 January 2009.

In a subsequent interview, Szetey declared:

{{cquote|There is a small but vocal group of right-wing extremists which is intent on offending everyone... According to a survey, 51 percent of the respondents thought my speech was courageous and that it would improve the situation for homosexuals. It's strange that the conservatives, who attach such great importance to neighbouring states giving their Hungarian minorities equal rights, couldn't care less about equal rights in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europe.courrierinternational.com/eurotopics/article.asp?langue=uk&amp;publication=13/07/2007&amp;cat=POLITICS&amp;pi=1 Gábor Szetey on homophobia in Hungary], ''Courrier International'', 13 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''H. Upmann &amp; Co'''. was a [[Bank]] based in [[Cuba]], with a subsidiary branch in [[Bremen|Breme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n, Germany, it was founded in 1844 and presided over by [[Hermann Dietrich Upmann]].  It closed in 1922.

== History ==
H. Upmann &amp; Co. was very successful through the purchase of promissory notes in Madrid during the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. Due to the [[American blockade on Cuba|American blockade]] during the war, the Spanish government was dependent on H. Upmann’s bank to finance his war efforts. Because of the unrest in Cuba many bankers decided to withdraw their money from Cuba in 1896. As a representative of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]] and other important customers, H. Upmann &amp; Co. transferred large quantities of [[gold]] and [[Silver|silve]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r to its office in [[New York City|New York]], which had been a [[Financial centre|financial center]] and trading hub with the [[Caribbean Islands|Caribbean islands]] since the [[18th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.stadterkundungen-bielefeld.de/fileadmin/user_upload/stadterkundungen/download/H._Upmann_Zigarre_Aufsatz_Schulte_Beerbuehl__Frey_2.pdf|title=Die H. Upmann Zigarre – Der Bielefelder Hermann Dietrich Upmann und die Schaffung einer Weltmarke|last=Beerbühl|first=Margrit Schulte|publisher=Altenberend/Reinhard Vogelsang. Bielefeld|year=2015|isbn=|location=Bielefeld,Germany|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Herrings, a war correspondent, described the Upmann banking house as "the most important banking company in Cuba, perhaps in the whole of West India." &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Herrings: ''Kuba und der Krieg'',New York 1899, S. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Hermann Friedrich Upmann in 1910, the bank was presided by his nephew’s, Hermann Friedrich and Albert Upmann and [[Theodore Garbade]],a partner of the bank who quit the bank in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=2MozAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Theodor+Garbade&amp;dq=Theodor+Garbade&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1tMPv18rWAhWRaVAKHdvNDdQQ6AEIPDAD|title=The London Banks and Kindred Companies and Firms ...|last=(bart.)|first=Sir Thomas Skinner|date=1916|publisher=T. Skinner &amp; Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=504|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Havana the bank built its own business house in [[Havana]] on the corner of the Amargura and Mercader’s streets. Built in 1904, it was the first building of its kind. It houses today the agency of the [[Central Bank of Cuba]] (before called the Cuban National Bank).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldhavanaweb.com/h_upmann_bank_building.html|title=H. Upmann Bank Building|website=www.oldhavanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, H. Upmann's [[asset]]s were seized by the Custodian of Alien Enemy properties in the United States, and the firm was placed on the US Enemy Trade List. With the end of [[World War I]], in 1918, Cuba's economic situation had worsened dramatically, especially after its great crash 1920 that brought unfathomable consequences to thousands of workers who lost their jobs. Due to these difficulties, H. Upmann &amp; Co. - like so many others - left in 1922 and was sold for a mere 30,000 pesos.&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, ''Upmann Bank of Havana has $9,136,000 in Liabilities'', Monday, 27 November 1922, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, on September 3, 1925, Herman passed away and his brother Albert moved to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.juventudrebelde.cu/columnas/lecturas/2016-09-24/la-larga-saga-de-h-upmann|title=La larga saga de H.

'''Kamal M. Al-Yahya, Ph.D''' is a [[geophysicist]] and an oil company executive. He is currently a senior VP in CGG. Prior to assuming his job at CGG, Mr. Al Yahya was the Chief Executive Officer ([[CEO]]) of South Rub Al-Khali (SRAK) Company, a joint venture between [[Saudi Aramco]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]], operating in the Al-Shaiba region, on the eastern edge of the vast [[Rub Al-Khali]] desert.

==Education==
Kamal Al-Yahya graduated at the top of his class form [[Qatif]] Secondary School in 1974, earning a government scholarship to study medicine in the [[United Kingdom]]. Two years later, he quit his studies and returned to [[Saudi Arabia]] to take care of his mother and younger siblings when his father, Mansoor Al-Yahya, died of cancer at a relatively young age. In order to stay close to home, he opted out of his medical scholarship in favor of pursuing a degree in [[physics]] at [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] (KFUPM), [[Dhahran]], Saudi Arabia.  He received his [[bachelor of science]] degree in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfupmalumni.org/index.php?title=Kamal_Mansour_Al-Yahya_(779300) "Kamal Mansour Al-Yahya (779300)"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122222619/http://www.kfupmalumni.org/index.php?title=Kamal_Mansour_Al-Yahya_%28779300%29 |date=January 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation, he joined [[Saudi Aramco]]. In 1981, he was granted a scholarship to study [[geoscience]] engineering at [[UC Berkeley]], where he received his [[masters degree]] in 1983. This was immediately followed by a scholarship to pursue a [[doctorate]] degree in [[geophysics]] at [[Stanford University]], which he completed in 1987. The title of his dissertation was "Velocity Analysis by Iterative Profile Migration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/oldreports/sep53/53_00.pdf "Velocity Analysis by Iterative Profile Migration"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Dr. Al-Yahya has been working with [[Saudi Aramco]], the largest oil company in the world, since 1979. From September 2007 to August 2008, he was the CEO and [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[Petron Corporation]], the largest oil refiner in the [[Philippines]] and a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and the Philippine government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.inquirer.net/money/announcements/view_article.php?article_id=87396 "New president takes Petron helm"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011080642/http://business.inquirer.net/money/announcements/view_article.php?article_id=87396 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also concurrently served as a Director on Petron's Board of Directors, succeeding Khalid D.

{{Business administration}}

A '''business entity''' is an entity that is formed and administered as per [[corporate law]] in order to engage in [[business]] activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many types of [[business entities]] defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, for example:

:≈ [[Ltd.]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[public limited company]] (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth)
:≈ [[limited partnership]]
:≈ unlimited partnership
:≈ [[chartered company]]
:≈ [[Statutory corporation|statutory company]]
:≈ [[holding company]]
:≈ [[Subsidiary|subsidiary company]]
:≈ one man company ([[sole proprietorship]])
:≈ [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (UK)
:≈ [[non-governmental organization]]

However, the regulations governing particular types of entities, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choose a legal structure for a new business |url=https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures |publisher=[[GOV.UK]] |accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173536/https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures# |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada entities can be incorporated under either federal or provincial (or territorial) law. [[Unlimited liability corporation]]s can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC".

The word or expression "Limited", ''Limitée'', "Incorporated", ''Incorporée'', "Corporation" or ''Société par actions de régime fédéral'' or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", ''Ltée'', "Inc.", "Corp." or ''S.A.R.F.'' forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK)

As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated ''Société commerciale canadienne'' or by the abbreviation ''S.C.C.''

Under the [[Canada Cooperatives Act]] (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", ''coopérative'', "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name.

Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx|title=NS vs. Alberta ULCs|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723021544/http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2006/january-february/regulars/camagazine7794.aspx#|archive-date=2014-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures:
*SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established
*GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply
*LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor. An investor who takes an active role will be deemed a general partner, and become exposed to unlimited liability.
*Corporation
*Joint Venture: A business activity shared by two or more business entities. The joint venture's activities must be finite in terms of either time or scope.

There are three main forms of business:

(a) Sole Proprietorship
(b) Partnership
(c) Company

*Sole Proprietorship

In a sole proprietorship, an individual on his/her own account carries out the business or profession. No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.

*Partnership

A partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Partnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.

For taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:

(i) Registered Firms
(ii) Unregistered Firms

The income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.

For unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).

*Company

A company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.

A company having share capital may be formed as:

(i) A company limited by shares.
(ii) A company limited by guarantee.
(iii) An unlimited company.

*Company Limited by Shares

The liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.

*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.
*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:

(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;
(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.

A private limited company is required to use the words "(Private) Limited" as the last words of its name.

*Company Limited By Guarantee

Means a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited" as the last words of their n
Unlimited Company

Means a company having unlimited liability of its members

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.

=== Tax classifications ===
For federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[Cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.&lt;ref name="Presti and Naegele Newsletter"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="IRS Sub Chapter T"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federally incorporated===
The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name.

For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name.

*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association
*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
*NT&amp;SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks
*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)

Many federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].

===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===
{{See also|United States corporate law}}

The following are the main business designations and types:
*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.
*'''[[Trust (business)|Trust]]'''

====Partnerships====
*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.
*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. 
*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).
*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.

====Limited Liability Companies====
*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.
*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.

====Corporations====
*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "&amp; Company" or "&amp; Co.". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious "[[doing business as]]" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. 
*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.
*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.  See also [[Delaware corporation]], [[Delaware statutory trust]], [[Nevada corporation]], and [[Massachusetts business trust]].

The '''Mars family''' is an American family that owns the confectionery company [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars, Inc.]], bearing their name.  The family once was ranked as the [[richest family]] in the United States by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in 1988, it has since been surpassed by the [[Walton family]] and the [[Koch family]], currently ranking as the third richest family in America as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/06/29/billion-dollar-clans-americas-25-richest-families-2016/#6a49929032f5|title=Billion-Dollar Clans: America's 25 Richest Families 2016|first=Kerry A.|last=Dolan|website=forbes.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2010, the three children of Forrest Mars were tied for 52nd place amongst the world's richest people according to ''Forbes'', with a [[net worth]] of {{US$|11 billion}} each.&lt;ref name="Billionaires 2010 Forrest Mars Jr."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billionaires 2010 John Mars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billionaires 2010 Jacqueline Mars"/&gt;

Mars]], be photographed in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/partypictures/2006/03_29_06/partypictures03_29_06.php|title=Party Pictures 3/29/06 - A little Washington and Palm Beach|website=www.newyorksocialdiary.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">'''Rock's law''' or '''Moore's second law''', named for [[Arthur Rock]] or [[Gordon Moore]], says that the cost of a [[integrated circuit|semiconductor chip]] [[semiconductor fabrication plant|fabrication plant]] doubles every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |title=FAQs |date= |work= |publisher=India Electronics &amp; Semiconductor Association |url=http://www.iesaonline.org/aboutus/faq_pg3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the price had already reached about 14 billion US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lucian |last=Armasu |title=Samsung's New $14 Billion Chip Plant To Manufacture DRAM, Processors In 2017 |agency=Reuters |date=8 May 2015 |work= |publisher=Tom's Hardware |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-14-billion-chip-plant,29058.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock's law can be seen as the economic flip side to [[Moore's law|Moores (first) law]] – that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. The latter is a direct consequence of the ongoing growth of the capital-intensive semiconductor industry&amp;mdash;innovative and popular products mean more profits, meaning more capital available to invest in ever higher levels of [[Integrated circuit#LSI|large-scale integration]], which in turn leads to creation of even more innovative products.

The semiconductor industry has always been extremely capital-intensive, with ever-dropping manufacturing [[unit cost]]s. Thus, the ultimate [[limits to growth]] of the industry will constrain the maximum amount of capital that can be invested in new products; at some point, Rock's Law will collide with Moore's Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edavision.com/200111/feature.pdf |format=PDF |archive-date=6 May 2006 |last=Dorsch |first=Jeff |title=Does Moore's Law Still Hold Up? |publisher=Edavision.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506114410/http://www.edavision.com/200111/feature.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/~gray/Moore_Law.html |archive-date=13 November 2008 |last=Schaller |first=Bob |date=1996 |title=The Origin, Nature, and Implications of 'Moore's Law' |publisher=Research.Microsoft.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113014641/http://research.microsoft.com/~gray/Moore_Law.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jean-François |last=Tremblay |title=Riding On Flat Panels |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=26 |pages=13–16 |date=26 June 2006 |doi= 10.1021/cen-v084n026.p013|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/84/i26/Riding-Flat-Panels.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that fabrication plant costs have not increased as quickly as predicted by Rock's law – indeed plateauing in the late 1990s&lt;ref name=Ross03&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philip E. |last=Ross |title=5 Commandments |journal=IEEE Spectrum |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2003 |doi= |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/5-commandments/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and also that the fabrication plant cost ''per transistor'' (which has shown a pronounced downward trend&lt;ref name=Ross03/&gt;) may be more relevant as a constraint on Moore's Law.

'''Naumkeag''' is the former country estate of noted [[New York City]] lawyer [[Joseph Hodges Choate]] located at 5 Prospect Hill Road, [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].  The estate's centerpiece is a 44-room, [[Shingle Style]] country house designed principally by [[Stanford White]] of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]], and constructed in 1886 and 1887.

The estate is noted for its large gardens, which were designed in the mid-20th century by noted landscape designer [[Fletcher Steele]] in conjunction with Choate's daughter Mabel.  A [[National Historic Landmark District]], Naumkeag is now owned by [[The Trustees of Reservations]], who operate it as a nonprofit museum.

==Description==
Naumkeag was designed by architect [[Stanford White]] of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] in 1885 as the summer estate for [[Joseph Hodges Choate]] (1832–1917), a prominent [[New York City]] attorney and American ambassador to England from 1899 to 1905, and then his daughter Mabel. The house is built in the [[Shingle Style]] with a wood-shingled exterior featuring brick and stone towers, prominent gables and large porch, and interiors with fine woodwork. It contains the Choate family's furniture, Chinese [[porcelain]], and artwork collected from [[Americas|America]], [[Europe]], and the [[Far East]].

The house sits within {{convert|8|acre|ha}} of terraced gardens (including The Rose Garden, The Afternoon Garden, and The Chinese Garden) and landscaped grounds surrounded by {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of woodland, meadow, and pasture. Its grounds were first designed in the late 1880s by Nathan Barrett, then replanned and expanded between 1926 and 1956 by the noted landscape designer [[Fletcher Steele]]. Barrett's original designs included two terraces, perennial beds (now the Chinese Garden), and an evergreen topiary. Steele's additions include the Afternoon Garden (1926); arguably his most famous design, the Blue Steps (1938); and the Chinese Garden (1936–1955).

==History==
[[Image:ChoatesAtNaumkeag.jpg|thumb|An [[autochrome]] of the Choates in Naumkeag's garden, c. 1910.]]
Colonial settlement of the Prospect Hill section of Stockbridge began with the town's founding as a Native American mission community in the 1730s.&lt;ref name=ProspectHill/&gt;  The future site of Naumkeag was probably acquired by New York lawyer [[David Dudley Field II|David Dudley Field]] in the 1870s, and purchased by Joseph Hodges Choate in 1884.&lt;ref name=ProspectHill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=STO.P|title=MACRIS Cultural Inventory Record for Prospect Hill, Stockbridge|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;  Choate's family had vacationed in Stockbridge (where Choate's law partners also summered), and had picnicked on the property.  Choate persuaded Field (whom he had opposed in the [[Boss Tweed]] legal cases) to part with {{convert|40|acre|ha}} on the south side of the hill.&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;

Choate was a longtime friend of architect [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]], but most of the architectural design work was done by McKim's partner [[Stanford White]].&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;  Although design work began shortly after the purchase, construction was delayed by the death of Choate's son.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;  The house was completed in 1887 at a cost of about $35,000.  White was also instrumental in providing the decorations and furnishings of the house, traveling to Europe with the Choates for the purpose.&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;

The house underwent a variety of alterations and additions, some guided by architects George de Gersdorff and Charles Platt. The library was expanded in 1897, enclosing a space that had once served as a south-facing porch. The number of bathrooms was raised from four to seven in the early years of the 20th century. These changes, which included the addition of a porch to the master bedroom, necessitated the addition of a dormer on the third floor and a number of new windows.  During the period of Mabel Choate's ownership only modest changes were made.&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;

Joseph Choate first offered the landscape design to [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], but rejected his proposal to place the house halfway down the hill, where a favorite oak tree was located.  The landscaping contract was instead given to Nathan Barrett, a self-taught designer then best known for his municipal work.  Barrett's vision of the landscape was implemented between 1884 and 1894.  His design included formal flower gardens near the house, and had a broad meadow slope down the hill, with an orchard and the family cemetery plot at the bottom.&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;  For the main fountain Choate commissioned White's friend and sculptor [[Frederick MacMonnies]] to produce a work; the result was ''Young Faun with Heron''.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naumkeag, garden wall detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A garden wall.]]
Between 1895 and 1925 minor changes were made to the gardens under the guidance of Percival Gallagher and [[Marian Cruger Coffin|Marian Coffin]].  Design decisions in the later years were dominated by Choate's daughter Mabel, especially after Choate's death in 1917.  Mabel acquired full control of the estate after her mother's death in 1929.  Mabel Choate began her long and fruitful collaboration with designer Fletcher Steele in 1926.  Upon her death in 1958 the estate was bequeathed to the [[Trustees of Reservations]], to be "an authentic representation of the times and manner of living which it now [1958] reflects."&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag/&gt;

Naumkeag's main house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975; the listing was expanded and the entire estate was designated a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 2007.  Its designation was made for the architecture and content of the house, which are well-preserved examples of a Gilded Age country estate, and for the innovative landscape design work of Fletcher Steele.&lt;ref name=NHL_Naumkeag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/statelists/ma/Naumkeag.pdf|title=NHL nomination for Naumkeag|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolás Kosturakis Yanarakis''' ({{lang-el|Νικόλας Κωστουράκης Γιανναράκης}}) (April 4, 1912 – November 17, 1986) son of Antonios Kostourakis Troullinos and Eleny Giannarakis Kanou, was born in the village of [[Kalyves]], in the municipality of [[Apokoronas]], in the island of [[Crete]], Greece.

He was a notable [[Greeks|Greek]] businessman and philanthropist who emigrated to [[Mexico]] in 1930. As a person of great political and social influence in both [[Greece]] and Mexico, he was also known for his notorious charitable support, and was awarded the diplomatic title of [[Consul (representative)|Honorary Consul]] of Greece in the Mexican city of Chihuahua. He was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] of the Grand Lodge of the State of Chihuahua, "Cosmos".

Along with his wife for more than 30 years, María Lucila García Stevens, he fathered three sons and two daughters: Nicolás Kosturakis García, Demetrio Kosturakis Garcia, Jorge Kosturakis García, María Lucila Kosturakis García, and Eleny Kosturakis García.

The '''O-ring theory of economic development''' is a [[economic model|model]] of [[economic development]] put forward by [[Michael Kremer]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="kremer1993"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kremer | first1 = Michael | authorlink1 = Michael Kremer | year = 1993 | title = The O-Ring Theory of Economic Development | journal = [[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 551-575  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | jstor = 2118400 | doi = 10.2307/2118400 | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes that tasks of production must be executed proficiently together in order for any of them to be of high value. The key feature of this model is positive [[assortative mating|assortative matching]], whereby people with similar skill levels work together.

The name comes from the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger shuttle disaster]], a catastrophe caused by the failure of a single [[O-ring]].

Kremer thinks that the O-ring development theory explains why rich countries produce more complicated products, have larger firms and much higher worker productivity than poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Nafziger | first1 = E. W. | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511805615.006 | title = Economic Development  | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780511805615 | chapter = 5 - Theories of Economic Development| pages = 123-164| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==

There are five major assumptions of this model: firms are risk-neutral, [[Labour economics|labor markets]] are competitive, workers supply labor [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastically]], workers are [[Substitute good|imperfect]] substitutes for one another, and there is a sufficient [[Complementary good|complementarity]] of tasks.

Production is broken down into ''n'' tasks. Laborers can use a multitude of techniques of varying efficiency to carry out these tasks depending on their skill. Skill is denoted by ''q'', where 0≤''q''≤1. The concept of ''q'' differs depending on interpretation.  It could mean: the probability of a laborer successfully completing a task, the quality of task completion expressed as a percentage, or the quality of task completion with the condition of a margin of error that could reduce quality.&lt;ref name="todaro2011"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Michael | last1 = Todaro | authorlink1 = Michael Todaro | first2 = Stephen C. | last2 = Smith | authorlink2 = Stephen C. Smith (economist) | title = Economic Development | edition = Ninth | publisher = Addison Wesley | isbn = 1408284472}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166-7}} Output is determined by multiplying the ''q'' values of each of the ''n'' tasks together and then multiplying this result by another term (lets say, ''B'') denoting the individual characteristics of the firm. ''B'' is positively correlated with the number of tasks. The [[production function]] here is simple:

: {{math|1=F(''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') = ''Bq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}

The important implication of this production function is positive assortative matching. We can observe this through a hypothetical four-person economy with two low skill workers ({{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and two high skill workers ({{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;}}). This equation dictates the [[productive efficiency]] of skill matching:

: {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &gt; 2''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''}}

By this equation total product is maximized by pairing those with similar skill levels.

== Conclusions ==

There are several implications one can derive from this model:&lt;ref name="todaro2011" /&gt;{{rp|169-170}}

# Workers performing the same task earn higher wages in a high-skill firm than in a low-skill firm;
# Wages will be more than proportionately higher in developed countries than would be assumed by measurements of skill levels;
# Workers will consider human capital investments in light of similar investments by those around them;
# This model magnifies the effect of local bottlenecks which also reduce the expected returns to skill;
# O-ring effects across firms can create national low-production traps.

This model helps explain [[brain drain]] and [[International inequality|international economic disparity]]. As Kremer puts it, "If strategic complementarity is sufficiently strong, microeconomically identical nations or groups within nations could settle into [[Economic equilibrium|equilibria]] with different levels of human capital".&lt;ref name="kremer1993" /&gt;

== Extensions ==

[[Garett Jones]] (2013) builds upon Kremer's O-ring theory to explain why differences in worker skills are associated with "massive" differences in international productivity levels despite causing only modest differences in wages within a country. For this purpose, he distinguishes between O-ring jobs - jobs featuring high strategic complementarities in terms of skill - and foolproof jobs - jobs characterized by diminishing returns to labor - and assumes both production technologies to be available to all countries. He then goes on to show that small international variations in average worker skill per country result in both large international and small intra-national income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268112002193|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2012.10.014 | volume=85 | title=The O-ring sector and the Foolproof sector: An explanation for skill externalities|year=2013|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|pages=1–10 | last1 = Jones | first1 = Garett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Francisco Román was born on October 4, 1869 in [[Alcala, Cagayan]] to Pelagia Velásquez, a [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and José Román a [[Spanish people|Spanish national]]. Pelagia was the sister of Hilaria Velasquez, the mother of [[Jose Palma|José]] and [[Rafael Palma]]. Paco's father, José, was a licensee of the tobacco monopoly system then implemented in the province. The family moved to Manila where the elder Román established a factory. Francisco then studied at [[Ateneo Municipal]] and eventually pursued studies in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="filipiknow" /&gt;

Roman married Juliana Piqueras, whom he had two children, Juan and Carmen.&lt;ref name="kahimyang" /&gt;

== Philippine independence struggle ==
Francisco Román  assumed his father's business after the latter died and secretly donated to the [[Katipunan|revolutionary cause]]. Being the son of a Spanish national, he sided with the colonial government and was believed to have volunteered in the Spanish cavalry in order to not be suspected of aiding the revolutionary forces.&lt;ref name="filipiknow" /&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Philippine–American War]], Roman joined General [[Antonio Luna]]'s forces and rose to the ranks to become a colonel and Luna's aide-de-camp.

Román led what came to be known as the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]] where his forces were able to push the invading [[United States forces|American forces]] back to [[Recto Avenue|Azcárraga Street]] in [[Manila]].&lt;ref name="filipiknow" /&gt;

=== Assassination ===
While setting up his mountain headquarters in [[Bayambang, Pangasinan]], General Antonio Luna received a telegram on June 4, 1899 from [[Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija]] summoning him to a conference with the [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Román, together with Captain Eduardo Rusca, Majors Manuel Bernal, José Bernal, and Simeon Villa, and 25 cavalrymen, joined Luna to Cabanatuan.&lt;ref name="kahimyang" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "paw" /&gt;

The next day, en route to Cabanatuan, a broken bridge posed to delay the entire party. Luna, accompanied by only Román and Rusca, decided to proceed immediately to the parish convent which was used as Aguinaldo's office&lt;ref name= "paw" /&gt; after moving the [[First Philippine Republic|government]]'s capital from [[Malolos]].

At around three in the afternoon, Luna, Román, and Rusca arrived at the convent of Cabanatuan, with Luna proceeding to meet Aguinaldo. Upon hearing gunshots Román proceeded to come to Luna's aid, but was assassinated himself by Aguinaldo's personal guards from [[Kawit, Cavite]].&lt;ref name= "paw" /&gt;

Román was buried together with Luna at the town cemetery with military honors. However, the whereabouts of his body was lost, as Luna's was later exhumed and transferred.&lt;ref name= "kahimyang" /&gt; Aguinaldo denied any knowledge in the assassination of Luna and Román, but acknowledged his failure to persecute the people behind their deaths.&lt;ref name = "xiao" /&gt;

{{For|Rice Hotel in St. Louis|National Hotel (St. Louis, Missouri)}}

The '''Rice Lofts''', formerly the '''Rice Hotel''', is a historic building at 909 Texas Avenue in [[Downtown Houston|Downtown]] [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]. The current building is the third to occupy the site. It was completed in 1913 on the site of the former Capitol building of the [[Republic of Texas]], and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The old Capitol building was operated as a hotel until it was torn down and replaced by a new hotel around 1881. [[Jesse H. Jones]] built a new seventeen-story, double-winged hotel in 1913, also  called "The Rice Hotel." This building underwent major expansions: adding a third wing in 1925, adding an eighteenth floor in 1951, and adding a five-story "motor lobby in 1958. In addition, there were several renovations during its life as a hotel. It continued to operate as a hotel before finally shutting down in 1977. The Rice, renamed the '''Post Rice Lofts''', was renovated and turned into apartments in 1998 after twenty-one years of standing unused.

{{History of Texas}}

==Capitol building==
When [[Augustus Chapman Allen|Augustus Allen]] and [[John Kirby Allen]] commissioned the first survey of Houston in the fall of 1836, they made plans to set aside property for use by the Republic of Texas.  Eventually they chose property on the south side of Texas Avenue between Travis and Main Street.  They also agreed to construct a capitol building for the Texas government, and leased the building on easy terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McComb|first=David G.|title=Houston: A History |year=1981|edition=Revised|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|pages=14{{endash}}15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Historic Rice Hotel, Shuttered for 20 Years, Again a Houston Landmark"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Historic Rice Hotel, Shuttered for 20 Years, Again a Houston Landmark | work = hotelonline.com | url =  http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PressReleases1998_4th/Oct98_RiceHotel.html#Rice  | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Texas used this as its capitol building from 1837 to 1839, and again from 1842 to 1845.&lt;ref name=cornerstone&gt;{{cite article|url=http://ricehistoricalsociety.org/images/cornerstones/RiceCornerstoneFall1999.pdf|last=Rogers|first=Karen Hess|year=1999|title=The Rice Hotel...Rice Institute Connection |publisher=The Cornerstone: the newsletter of the Rice Historical Society|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, Mr. M. Norwood leased the building from Augustus Allen, and ran it as the Capitol Hotel. After the Texas government left Houston again, Augustus Allen resumed leasing the building to various hotel operators. Charlotte Allen sold the property to R.S. Blount in 1857. There were various hotel operators between 1857 and 1881 with a few name changes (Houston House and Barnes House).&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; It is not clear how long Charlotte owned the property before it was sold in 1857. [[John Kirby Allen]] had died in 1838 without a will. After 1843, there was a dispute about his estate, which led to a permanent estrangement between Augustus and Charlotte Allen.  Augustus left Houston in 1852.&lt;ref name="acallen"&gt;{{cite web|first=Amelia W.| last=Williams|title=ALLEN, AUGUSTUS CHAPMAN|series=Handbook of Texas Online|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal17|access-date= November 17, 2014|date=June 9, 2010|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Anson Jones]], the last president of the [[Republic of Texas]], committed suicide at the hotel in 1858.&lt;ref name="Old Houston"&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Houston | work=Landmarks and Monuments, 174 Years of Historic Houston |url=http://www.houstonhistory.com/preservation/landmarks/history9a.htm  | accessdate=2007-05-07|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=Marguerite |year=1991| publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |location=College Station, Texas|page=59|ISBN=0-89096-476-9|title=Houston: The Unknown City, 1836{{endash}}1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Rice Hotel building==

Abraham Groesbeck razed the original building and constructed a five-story Victorian hotel in 1881.&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; The building, then known as the ''Capitol Hotel'', was designed by George E. Dickey, and represented his first major commission since relocating to Houston in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Fox|title=DICKEY, GEORGE E.|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fdi30|accessdate=December 15, 2014|series=Handbook of Texas Online|date=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Marsh Rice]] bought the hotel after Groesbeck died in 1886. He added a three-story annex.  Rice was murdered in 1900, and the hotel property was transferred to the [[Rice University|Rice Institute]], which he had established in 1891.  The Rice Institute trustees renamed it the ''Rice Hotel''.&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; 

Jessie H. Jones, who would later redevelop the site, resided at the original Rice Hotel when he first arrived in Houston around 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenberg|first=Steven|year=2011|title=Unprecedented Power: Jesse Jones, Capitalism, and the Common Good|location=College Station|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|page=37|ISBN=9781603444347}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas Governor James Hogg maintained a Houston residence there in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1991), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Rice Hotel building==

The hotel had been losing money and its taxes unpaid.  [[Jesse H. Jones]] offered to lease the land from the [[Rice University|Rice Institute]] and replace the existing hotel through his company, the Houston Hotel Association. Jones obtained a ninety-nine year lease with an option for a ninety-nine year extension.  The Rice Institute also invested funds from its endowment to assist Jones in building a new hotel.  After demolishing the original Rice Hotel in 1912, Jones hired [[Mauran, Russell &amp; Crowell]] to design the new hotel.  The new seventeen-story, C-shaped (or U-shaped) hotel opened in May 1913.&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; The hotel featured four restaurants, a banquet room, a small concert hall, and a rooftop deck. The construction cost was about $3.5 million, {{Inflation|US-GDP|3500000|1913|2016|r=-6|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston (1991), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first five years, the new Rice Hotel was losing money, but the Houston Hotel Association was able to repay its loans. Jesse Jones continued improving the building. In 1922, he installed air-conditioning in the Rice Hotel Cafeteria, the first for a public room in Houston.  In 1924, he expanded the capacity of the cafeteria, but built over a basement pool (it would be discovered and re-opened in the 1998 renovation). In 1925, Jones hired [[Alfred C. Finn]] to design a new wing for the hotel, increasing the number of rooms to over 1,000 and creating the building's current E-shaped configuration. The Crystal Ballroom was air-conditioned in 1928, the same year that Houston hosted the National Democratic Convention.&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt;&lt;ref name=webb&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Webb|first=Bruce C.|date=Spring 1999|title=Deconstructing the Rice|publisher=Rice Design Alliance|journal=Cite|url=http://offcite.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/03/DeconstructingTheRice_Webb_Cite44.pdf|access-date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than preparing the Rice Hotel for convention delegates, Jones lured the Democratic Convention to Houston in the first place, donating $200,000 to the cause, {{Inflation|US-GDP|200000|1928|2016|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}. A famous guest was during the convention was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the not yet Governor of New York. Jones placed a large shed on the hotel roof before the Democratic Convention to serve as temporary accommodations. This hotel deck was a popular dance venue during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="NAC"&gt;{{cite web|series=National Archives Catalog|access-date=October 19, 2017|title=Texas SP Rice Hotel|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/40972376}} National Archives Identifier: 40972376. Slow downloads.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jones continued investing in the Rice Hotel through the 1930s. The Rice Barber Shop was remodeled in 1930, and a major remodeling of the bottom floors in 1938 coincided with a new, art-deco dining area, the Empire Room.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt; He opened a barber shop in 1930, which remained in business there until about 1977. Five years later, he introduced air-conditioning to the Crystal ballroom, perhaps the first dance venue with such an amenity in Houston.&lt;ref name="NAC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Jones embarked on another major remodeling, transforming the cafeteria into the Skyline Room, replete with plastic upholstery and fluorescent lighting. A first among Houston hotels, the Rice installed an escalator in 1946. By 1949, all the guest rooms were air-conditioned.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt; In 1951, Jones hired Staub &amp; Rather to transform the roof deck over the seventeenth floor into an eighteenth floor edition to house the Petroleum Club of Houston.&lt;ref name="elliot"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Margie C. |last1=Elliott |first2=Charles D., Jr. |last2=Maynard|issue=Fall 1992{{endash}}Winter 1993|title=The Rice Hotel|work=Cite|publisher=Rice Design Alliance|access-date=October 31, 2014|url=http://offcite.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/03/Maynard_Cite29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jones died in 1956, the estate conveyed the Rice Hotel building to the Jones family non-profit, the [[Houston Endowment Inc.|Houston Endowment]]. The Rice continued to operate as a hotel under the management of the Houston Endowment until 1971.  In 1957, Houston Endowment remodeled the Old Capital Club and the Flag Room from the previously existing Empire Room. They commissioned a five-story annex for a motor lobby and a second grand ballroom in 1958.&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt;&lt;ref name=webb/&gt; The hotel featured fine dining in the Flag Room, a casual first-floor coffee shop, and the underground Rice Hotel Cafeteria, known for its signature dish, rice pudding.  It had a variety of retail shops, including a lobby news stand, a hat store, and Bilton's Fine Jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;http://uhdigitallibrary.blogspot.com/2012/05/still-standing.html University of Houston Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}}      

In 1962 the Rice Hotel was used for a meeting of [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|NASA Astronaut Group 2 - The New Nine]] - all of whom booked in with the code name "Max Peck" as portrayed on the 1998 [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]''.

[[John F. Kennedy]] visited the Rice Hotel in 1962, and in 1963 before traveling to Fort Worth, and then Dallas, where he was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]]. Kennedy used a suite at the Rice Hotel to hold meetings, which was supplied with caviar, champagne, and his favorite beer.  After a brief visit at a [[LULAC]] event and his speech at the [[Albert Thomas Convention Center]], he returned to his suite for a change of clothes.  After less than six hours in Houston, he headed to the airport for his flight to [[Fort Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Laurie|first2=Jack |last2=Williams |title=JFK's Final Visit to Houston Came 50 Years Ago Today| url=http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/news/1384970340/|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also delivered his famous speech on religion in politics there to the Greater Houston Ministerial Conference on Sept. 12, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=JFK Presidential Library and Museum|title=Address of Senator John F.

Hobby]] and [[Captain James A. Baker]] of [[Baker and Botts]].&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; 

Other notable guests of the Rice Hotel include [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Liberace]].&lt;ref name=westheimer&gt;{{cite article|url=http://offcite.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/03/DeconstructingTheRice_Webb_Cite44.pdf|title=Rice Memories|last=Westheimer|first=David|date=Spring 1999|journal=Cite|publisher=Rice Design Alliance|accessdate=December 29, 2014|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable musicians who have performed at the Rice include [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Perry Como]],&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; [[Xavier Cugat]], [[Woody Herman]], [[Lawrence Welk]],&lt;ref name=westheimer/&gt; and a young [[Illinois Jacquet]].&lt;ref name=l'heureux&gt;{{cite journal|author=L'Heureux, Aimee|title=Illinois Jacquet: Integrating Houston Jazz Audiences . . .

[[Rice University]] assumed ownership of the Rice Hotel through a donation from the Houston Endowment.  The university had already owned the land since 1900, and the hotel had been operating under a ninety-nine year lease. The hotel ran profitably for a couple of years. However, Rice University estimated compliance to a new 1974 Houston fire code would cost as much as $1.2 million.&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; In December 1974, the university warned that they might demolish the hotel if they could not sell it. Rittenhouse Capital Corporation purchased the property in 1975, and briefly operated as the Rice-Rittenhouse, opening in April 1976 after being closed for remodeling. The hotel closed again in August 1977.&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;

Several entities assumed financial interests in the Rice Hotel after the August 1977 closure. The Rice Preservation Corporation purchased the Rice Hotel property at auction in September 1977. Portfolio Management of Texas bought the property early in 1978 for $3 million, much more than the $542,962 paid at the 1977 foreclosure auction. The new owners secured a listing on the National Register of Historic Places and federal funding to convert the building into apartments.  Portfolio Management of Texas did not raise enough capital and did not execute the federal grant. In 1981, Rovi Texas Corporation purchased the property for $7.75 million and announced they would operate it as a luxury hotel. The business plan was based on federal aid of $9.7 million, which was not forthcoming. Rovi Texas allowed its bank, Frankfurt BFG-Bank AG, to assume ownership of the property. The German Bank was asking $15 million to $17 million to sell until they discovered structural problems with the building, leading them to cut their asking price in half.&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;

==Restoration==
[[Randall Davis]] inquired about redeveloping the Rice Hotel property in 1995. He had already rehabilitated old buildings and repurposed them as loft apartments. Three examples are the Dakota Lofts, the Hogg Palace, and the Tribeca Lofts.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;
 
[[Michael Stevens, Houston developer|Michael Stevens]], head of the [[Houston Housing Finance Corporation]] (HHFC), proposed a public-private partnership, which included $5 million in capital from the Randall Davis investment group with a $5 million matching funds from the City of Houston.  However, as cost estimates for the renovation increased, private investors backed out.  Stevens developed a [[tax increment financing]] (TIF) scheme in which the Rice project would borrow against future tax revenue increases.  The City of Houston planned a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ), placing the Rice within its boundaries. Based on projected tax revenue of $700,000, he coaxed a $6 million loan from [[Wells Fargo Bank]], replacing the $5 million from the Davis group under the original plan.   As head of HHFC, Stevens committed another $8 million to the project, $3 million of which would go toward buying the Rice outright.  HHFC would recover its investment through selling federal tax credits for restoring historic buildings.&lt;ref name=shields&gt;{{cite article|url=http://offcite.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/03/DeconstructingTheRice_Webb_Cite44.pdf|title=Follow the Money|last=Shields|first=Mitchell J.|publisher=Rice Design Alliance|date=Spring 1999|journal=Cite|accessdate=October 30, 2014|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Stevens sold most of the municipal interest in the hotel to Columbus Properties for $4.5 million in cash.  Columbus (later renamed [[Post Properties]]) also assumed all the municipal debt related to the project, but also gained the tax credits and the ground lease.  The city retained ownership of the property,&lt;ref name=shields/&gt; while Davis obtained a forty-year lease.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;  

Davis hired the architectural firm of Page Southerland Page to plan the renovation of the abandoned Rice Hotel.  The firm presented Davis with a plan to limit public rooms to the ground floor.  Alternatively, the Texas State Historical Association proposed restoring the Crystal Ballroom.  Davis decided to model the public area after the 1913 Rice Hotel.  This included restoration of the former two-story lobby, the Crystal Ballroom, and the Empire Room.  The ground floor reserved 25,000-square feet of retail space, with a wide cast iron awning covering the sidewalks on the Texas Avenue side and part of the Main Street side.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;

==Rice Lofts==
[[Image:RiceLoftsHoustonFrontside.JPG|thumb|Sign indicating The Rice Lofts]]
Post Properties (renamed from Columbus Properties) opened the Rice Lofts for tenants in April 1998.&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; After renovation from 1000 hotel rooms into lofts, the building housed 312 apartments, including some 500-square foot efficiencies, many 1500-square foot apartments, and a few three-story penthouses.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;  Efficiency apartments rented as low as $750 per month.&lt;ref name=cornerstone/&gt; 

Sambuca, a jazz club, opened in ground floor space at the Rice on October 28, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Riffs at the Rice|work=Houston Chronicle|date=November 5, 1998|last=Mitchell|first=Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sambuca, which was still operating at the same location as of November 19, 2014, announced plans to open a new bar "Lawless" on the second floor.&lt;ref name=updates&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/Modern-changes-planned-for-historic-downtown-Rice-5815285.php#/0|title=Updates planned for historic downtown Rice building|publisher=Houston Chronicle|last=Sarnoff|first=Nancy|date=October 10, 2014|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early 2014, Post Properties listed the building for sale,  while claiming an apartment occupancy rate of ninety-five percent and an average rental price of $1,700 per month.&lt;ref name=updates/&gt; Later that year, CH Realty/MF Houston Rice VI (Crow Holding Capital Partners) acquired the building from Post Properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sarnoff|first=Nancy|url=http://blog.chron.com/primeproperty/2014/05/historic-rice-hotel-has-a-new-owner/ |title=Historic Rice Hotel has a new owner|work=Houston Chronicle|date=May 2, 2014|access-date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Crow Holding Capital Partners announced plans to make renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sarnoff|first=Nancy|url=http://blog.chron.com/primeproperty/2014/05/rice-hotel-owners-planning-major-renovations/ |title=Rice Hotel owners planning major renovations|work=Houston Chronicle|date=May 16, 2014|access-date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners hired architectural firm Page to design the renovations.  The plan includes installing appliances and remodeling each apartment, and moving a swimming pool and fitness center from the basement to the second floor.&lt;ref name=updates/&gt; Along with new appliances for the apartments, there were plans for remodeling of each kitchen and bathroom. The management company also announced valet service would be offered to tenants. Early in 2014 Post Properties claimed that average rent was almost $1,700 per month and the building had a vacancy rate of about five percent. One person interviewed late in 2014 said his one-bedroom apartment rented for $1,550.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/Modern-changes-planned-for-historic-downtown-Rice-5815285.php|work=Houston Chronicle|date=October 10, 2014|access-date=October 19, 2017|first=Nancy |last=Sarnoff|title=Updates planned for historic downtown Rice building}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Edward "Rob" Lee Jr.''' (October 27, 1843 – October 19, 1914) was the youngest of three sons of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], and the sixth of their seven children. He became a [[soldier]] during the [[American Civil War]], and later was a [[Planter (American South)|planter]], [[businessman]], and [[author]].

==Early life==
Rob Lee was born and raised at [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] He was close to his father, who he was named after, and his sister, Mildred Lee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He attended boarding schools during much of the 1850s, while his father, a career [[U.S. Army]] officer, was serving in the [[Mexican–American War]] and as Superintendent of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. Unlike his father and two older brothers, Rob apparently never envisioned a military career, never serving in the United States Army. In 1860, he enrolled at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Edward Lee, Jr. |url=https://www.nps.gov/arho/learn/historyculture/robert-lee-jr.htm |website=National Park Service |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
When the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861, his father and his two older brothers, [[George Washington Custis Lee|Custis]] and [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|Rooney]], all chose to serve [[Virginia]] in the [[Confederate Army]]. To his mother's dismay, Rob joined them in 1862, enlisting in the [[1st Rockbridge Artillery|Rockbridge Artillery]] as a private.

After the [[Battle of Sharpsburg]], he was promoted to the rank of Captain and assigned as aide to his older brother [[George Washington Custis Lee]]. The latter was a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] and [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], and involved in defending [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/historical_figures/3038726.html "Robert E. Lee and His Horse"], HistoryNet&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mary Custis Lee and Robert E. Lee Jr 1845.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Robert E. Lee Jr. and his mother, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary]] (c. 1845)]]
==Postbellum career==
All four Lees survived the Civil War. After the war, Rob lived and farmed [[Romancoke, Virginia|Romancoke Plantation]] on the north bank of the [[Pamunkey River]] in [[King William County, Virginia|King William County]], which he inherited from his maternal grandfather [[George Washington Parke Custis]]. Romancoke was located approximately four miles from the [[West Point, Virginia|Town of West Point]].

Rob also became a writer, gathering his memories of his family and life in ''Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee'' (1904). The first-hand account provides a valuable source of information on day-to-day life at Arlington House during his youth, and includes many items of interest regarding his father's entire life. (see link for online portion of this book below) However, some are now offended by racial views expressed therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert E. Lee Sr. advises Robert E. Lee Jr. that African Americans are their enemies and not to hire them. |url=http://www.confederatepastpresent.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=130:robert-e-lee-advises-robert-e-lee-jr-that-african-americans-are-their-enemies-and-not-to-hire-them-&amp;catid=38:reconstruction-and-fusion |website=confederatepastpresent.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000251/http://www.confederatepastpresent.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=130:robert-e-lee-advises-robert-e-lee-jr-that-african-americans-are-their-enemies-and-not-to-hire-them-&amp;catid=38:reconstruction-and-fusion |archivedate=4 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert E. Lee Jr. died in 1914. He was interred with his parents and siblings in the [[Lee Chapel]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], where his father and brother Custis each had served as a president of the college now known as [[Washington and Lee University]].

==Marriage and family==
Rob married twice. On November 16, 1871, he married Charlotte Haxall (October 23, 1848 – September 22, 1872). No children survived her.

On March 8, 1894, in Washington D.C., Rob Lee married Juliet Carter (April 6, 1860 – November 17, 1915), who was 16 years younger than him. They had two daughters, Anne Carter Lee (b. July 21, 1897) and Mary Custis Lee (b. December 23, 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Frederick Warren|title=Stratford hall and the Lees connected with its history; biographical, genealogical and historical|year=2010 |origyear=1912|publisher=Nabu Press (reprint)|isbn=1-178-21224-6|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob's mother, Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee, was the only surviving child of [[George Washington Parke Custis]] and [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary Lee Fitzhugh]]. George was the grandson of [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge]] and adopted grandson (although not legally) of [[George Washington]].

In [[finance]], '''seniority''' refers to the order of repayment in the event of a sale or [[bankruptcy]] of the issuer. Seniority can refer to either [[debt]] or [[preferred stock]]. Senior debt must be repaid before subordinated (or junior) debt is repaid.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of Businessurt Publishing Company, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Each security, either debt or equity, that a company issues has a specific seniority or ranking. Bonds that have the same seniority in a company's [[capital structure]] are described as being [[pari passu]]. Preferred stock is '''senior''' to common stock in a sale when preferred shareholders must receive back their '''preference''', typically their original investment amount, before the common shareholders receive anything.

==FpML==
The seniority of bonds recognised in [[FpML]] (Financial products Markup Language) are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FpML value
! Description
|-
| Senior
| Top precedence
|-
| SubTier3
| Subordinate, Tier 3
|-
| SubUpperTier2
| Subordinate, Upper Tier 2
|-
| SubLowerTier2
| Subordinate, Lower Tier 2
|-
| SubTier1
| Subordinate, Tier 1

The art and science of collecting and managing [[Submission (Electronic)|submissions]] (of any kind) is called Submission Management. Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of [[Internet]] in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, [[Word document|word]] and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years.

Managing submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them.

==Common scenarios==
===Academics===
It is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get [[Assignment (education)|assignments]] and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given [[Feedback#In_education|feedback]] on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a [[Learning management system|system]] (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions.

===Call-for-paper (academic) conferences===
In call-for-paper or [[academic conference]]s, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6–15 pages, which is [[peer review]]ed by members of the conference's [[program committee]] and/or external reviewers chosen by them.

===Competitions and contests===
Most [[competition]]s and [[Competition|contest]]s held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the [[nomination]]s and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.

===College events and fests===
[[Student groups|Student bodies]] in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or [[semester]] basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above.

===Pharmaceuticals industry===
Regulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical–biotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper.

===Human resources===
[[Human resources|Human resource]] departments collect [[résumé]]s and [[Curriculum vitae|CVs]] as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their résumés either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on [[employment websites]] that help connect job seekers and employers.

===Contemporary art===
In [[contemporary art]], curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===The fashion industry===
[[Model (person)|Models]] create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Publication and media houses===
Journalists and writers (full-time as well as [[freelancer]]s) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement.

===Government applications===
Most government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too.

==Challenges==
===Submission standards and formats===
As companies, agencies and institutes move towards [[electronic submission]]s, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards.

One example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the [[electronic Common Technical Document]] (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan).&lt;ref name="ICH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|title=The ICH eCTD Specification V 3.2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916072404/http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inappropriate modes and lack of automated systems===
Email is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature.

The key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert [[reviewer]]s or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Submission management systems==
Certain software vendors have begun developing [[submission management system]]s to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are [[web based]] and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.

{{Nihongo|'''''Takahashi Ujibumi'''''|高橋氏文|}} is a historical clan record of the Takahashi clan. It served as an appeal for court arbitration between two fighting clans.

The author(s) is unknown, but the contents suggest that it was composed prior to 789. The text only survives today in fragments quoted in other texts such as {{Nihongo|''Honchō Gatsuryō''|本朝月令||extra=c. 930-946}}, {{Nihongo|''Seiji Yōryaku''|政事要略||extra=1002}}, and {{Nihongo|''Nenjū Gyōji Hishō''|年中行事秘抄||}}.

Both the Takahashi and Azumi clans served in the [[Royal Table Office]]. Conflict between the two clans erupted with many conflicts occurring after 716. Seeking arbitration and a resolution to the conflict, both clans submitted their clan records to the imperial court. This is the Takahashi record; the Azumi clan record is unknown.

==Contents==

Pieced together, the text consists of three major sections:
*Takahashi clan ancestor Iwakamutsukari no Mikoto served [[Emperor Keikō]] meals and received the title "Kashiwade" (chief).
*The imperial proclamation after Iwakamutsukari died.
*A record of the 792 arbitration by the [[Daijō-kan|Department of State]] regarding the conflicts between the two clans.

==Value==

The text is highly valued as the oldest existing clan record. In addition, the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720) makes reference to the Kashiwade clan,&lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, Tarō ''et al.'' (1965). ''Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei: Nihon Shoki,'' p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; a title bestowed up the Takahashi clan. This suggests the possibility that the Takahashi clan record, at least in part, was used as a reference in compiling ''Nihon Shoki'' while also suggesting that parts of it may be even older.

Linguistically, the text includes a number of passages utilizing the archaic [[Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai]] spellings. However, there are some inconsistencies which indicate that parts of it date to a late 8th century.

'''Theodore Levitt''' (March 1, 1925, Vollmerz, [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]], [[Germany]] – June 28, 2006, [[Belmont, Massachusetts]]) was an American economist and professor at [[Harvard Business School]]. He was also editor of the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' and an editor who was especially noted for increasing the Review's circulation and for popularizing the term [[globalization]]. In 1983, he proposed a definition for ''corporate purpose:'' Rather than merely making money, it is to create and keep a customer.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, T (1983) The Marketing Imagination, New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Levitt was born in 1925 in Vollmerz to a Jewish family.  A decade later his family moved to [[Dayton, Ohio]].  He served in [[World War II]], received his high school diploma through correspondence school and then earned a [[bachelor's]] at [[Antioch College]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] at [[Ohio State University]].  His first teaching job was at the [[University of North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/062906_levittobit.html ''PROFESSORTHEODORE LEVITT, LEGENDARY MARKETING SCHOLAR AND FORMER HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW EDITOR, DEAD AT 81'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 he joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Business School]]. Later that year, he became world-renowned after publishing ''[[Marketing Myopia]]'' in [[Harvard Business Review]] where he asks "What business are you in?", a phrase that demands one account for the significance of the job one does.&lt;ref name="Mullman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mullman |first=Jeremy |title=An 'original mind' of marketing dies. | work=Advertising Age | date=July 10, 2006 | volume=77 | pages=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in developing the term "globalization"==
Though widely credited with coining the term [[globalization]] in an article entitled "Globalization of Markets", which appeared in the May–June 1983 issue of [[Harvard Business Review]], he was not the originator of the term. As a NYTimes article notes, the term 'globalization' was in use well before this publication (at least as early as 1944) and had been used by economists as early as 1981. Nonethless, Levitt can be credited with popularizing the term and bringing to a mainstream business audience. 

== Further work ==
Between 1985 and 1989, he headed the ''Harvard Business Review'' as an editor.&lt;ref name="Mullman" /&gt;

He was the author of ''The Marketing Imagination'', and was a best-selling author whose works have been translated into eleven languages. He was also the author of numerous articles on economic, political, management, and marketing subjects.

==Honors and accolades==
He was a four-time winner of the McKinsey Awards competitions for best annual article in the ''Harvard Business Review''; winner of Academy of Management Award for the outstanding business books of 1962 for ''Innovation in Marketing''; winner of John Hancock Award for Excellence in Business Journalism in 1969; recipient of the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award as "Marketing Man of the Year," 1970; recipient of the George Gallup Award for Marketing Excellence, 1976; recipient of the 1978 Paul D. Converse Award of the [[American Marketing Association]] for major contributions to marketing and recipient of the 1989 William M. McFeely Award of the International Management Council for major contributions to management.

==Death==
Levitt died at the age of 81 years in his home on June 28, 2006 after a long battle with an illness. His memorial was held at his favorite tennis club. He was survived by his wife of 58 years, and by four children.
