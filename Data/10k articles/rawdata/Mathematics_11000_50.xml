      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7889">In [[mathematics]], especially in [[algebraic geometry]] and the theory of [[complex manifolds]], the '''adjunction formula''' relates the [[canonical bundle]] of a variety and a [[hypersurface]] inside that variety. It is often used to deduce facts about varieties embedded in well-behaved spaces such as [[projective space]] or to prove theorems by induction.

== Adjunction for smooth varieties ==

===Formula for a smooth subvariety===
Let ''X'' be a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] algebraic variety or smooth complex manifold and ''Y'' be a smooth subvariety of ''X''. Denote the inclusion map {{nowrap|''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X''}} by ''i'' and the [[ideal sheaf]] of ''Y'' in ''X'' by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. The [[conormal exact sequence]] for ''i'' is
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2 \to i^*\Omega_X \to \Omega_Y \to 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω denotes a [[cotangent bundle]]. The determinant of this exact sequence is a natural isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_Y = i^*\omega_X \otimes \operatorname{det}(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2)^\vee,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; denotes the dual of a line bundle.

===The particular case of a smooth divisor===
Suppose that ''D'' is a smooth [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] on ''X''. Its [[normal bundle]] extends to a [[line bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(D)&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'', and the ideal sheaf of ''D'' corresponds to its dual &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(-D)&lt;/math&gt;. The conormal bundle &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;i^*\mathcal{O}(-D)&lt;/math&gt;, which, combined with the formula above, gives
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_D = i^*(\omega_X \otimes \mathcal{O}(D)).&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of canonical classes, this says that
:&lt;math&gt;K_D = (K_X + D)|_D.&lt;/math&gt;
Both of these two formulas are called the '''adjunction formula'''.

== Poincaré residue ==
{{see also|Poincaré residue}}&lt;!-- duplicate? --&gt;
The restriction map &lt;math&gt;\omega_X \otimes \mathcal{O}(D) \to \omega_D&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Poincaré residue'''. Suppose that ''X'' is a complex manifold.  Then on sections, the Poincaré residue can be expressed as follows. Fix an open set ''U'' on which ''D'' is given by the vanishing of a function ''f''. Any section over ''U'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(D)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as ''s''/''f'', where ''s'' is a holomorphic function on ''U''. Let η be a section over ''U'' of ω&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;. The Poincaré residue is the map
:&lt;math&gt;\eta \otimes \frac{s}{f} \mapsto s\frac{\partial\eta}{\partial f}\bigg|_{f = 0},&lt;/math&gt;
that is, it is formed by applying the vector field ∂/∂''f'' to the volume form η, then multiplying by the holomorphic function ''s''. If ''U'' admits local coordinates ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that for some ''i'', {{nowrap begin}}∂''f''/∂''z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0{{nowrap end}}, then this can also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g(z)\,dz_1 \wedge \dotsb \wedge dz_n}{f(z)} \mapsto (-1)^{i-1}\frac{g(z)\,dz_1 \wedge \dotsb \wedge \widehat{dz_i} \wedge \dotsb \wedge dz_n}{\partial f/\partial z_i}\bigg|_{f = 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another way of viewing Poincaré residue first reinterprets the adjunction formula as an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_D \otimes i^*\mathcal{O}(-D) = i^*\omega_X.&lt;/math&gt;
On an open set ''U'' as before, a section of &lt;math&gt;i^*\mathcal{O}(-D)&lt;/math&gt; is the product of a holomorphic function ''s'' with the form {{nowrap|''df''/''f''}}. The Poincaré residue is the map that takes the wedge product of a section of ω&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and a section of &lt;math&gt;i^*\mathcal{O}(-D)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Inversion of adjunction ==
The adjunction formula is false when the conormal exact sequence is not a short exact sequence. However, it is possible to use this failure to relate the singularities of ''X'' with the singularities of ''D''. Theorems of this type are called '''inversion of adjunction'''. They are an important tool in modern birational geometry.

== Applications to curves==
The [[genus-degree formula]] for plane curves can be deduced from the adjunction formula.&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne, chapter V, example 1.5.1&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''C''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be a smooth plane curve of degree ''d'' and genus ''g''. Let ''H'' be the class of a hypersurface in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, the class of a line. The canonical class of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is &amp;minus;3''H''. Consequently, the adjunction formula says that the restriction of {{nowrap|(''d'' &amp;minus; 3)''H''}} to ''C'' equals the canonical class of ''C''. This restriction is the same as the intersection product {{nowrap|(''d'' &amp;minus; 3)''H'' &amp;middot; ''dH''}} restricted to ''C'', and so the degree of the canonical class of ''C'' is {{nowrap|''d''(''d'' &amp;minus; 3)}}. By the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]], {{nowrap begin}}''g'' &amp;minus; 1 = (''d'' &amp;minus; 3)''d'' &amp;minus; ''g'' + 1{{nowrap end}}, which implies the formula
:&lt;math&gt;g = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly,&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne, chapter V, example 1.5.2&lt;/ref&gt; if ''C'' is a smooth curve on the quadric surface '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;×'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with bidegree (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (meaning ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are its intersection degrees with a fiber of each projection to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), since the canonical class of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;×'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has bidegree (&amp;minus;2,&amp;minus;2), the adjunction formula shows that the canonical class of ''C'' is the intersection product of divisors of bidegrees (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;2,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;2).  The intersection form on '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;×'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is &lt;math&gt;((d_1,d_2),(e_1,e_2))\mapsto d_1 e_2 + d_2 e_1&lt;/math&gt; by definition of the bidegree and by bilinearity, so applying Riemann–Roch gives &lt;math&gt;2g-2 = d_1(d_2-2) + d_2(d_1-2)&lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;g = (d_1 - 1)(d_2 - 1) = d_1 d_2 - d_1 - d_2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;
This gives a simple proof of the existence of curves of any genus as the graph of a function of degree &lt;math&gt;g + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The genus of a curve ''C'' which is the [[complete intersection]] of two surfaces ''D'' and ''E'' in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can also be computed using the adjunction formula. Suppose that ''d'' and ''e'' are the degrees of ''D'' and ''E'', respectively. Applying the adjunction formula to ''D'' shows that its canonical divisor is {{math|(''d'' &amp;minus; 4)''H''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is the intersection product of {{nowrap|(''d'' &amp;minus; 4)''H''}} and ''D''. Doing this again with ''E'', which is possible because ''C'' is a complete intersection, shows that the canonical divisor ''C'' is the product {{math|(''d'' + ''e'' &amp;minus; 4)''H'' &amp;middot; ''dH'' &amp;middot; ''eH''}}, that is, it has degree {{math|''de''(''d'' + ''e'' &amp;minus; 4)}}. By the Riemann–Roch theorem, this implies that the genus of ''C'' is
:&lt;math&gt;g = de(d + e - 4) / 2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, if ''C'' is the complete intersection of {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} hypersurfaces {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} of degrees {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then an inductive computation shows that the canonical class of ''C'' is &lt;math&gt;(d_1 + \cdots + d_{n-1} - n - 1)d_1 \cdots d_{n-1} H^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The Riemann–Roch theorem implies that the genus of this curve is
:&lt;math&gt;g = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(d_1 + \cdots + d_{n-1} - n - 1)d_1 \cdots d_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6476">The '''Berlekamp–Welch algorithm''', also known as the '''Welch–Berlekamp algorithm''', is named for [[Elwyn R. Berlekamp]] and [[Lloyd R. Welch]]. This is a decoder algorithm that efficiently corrects errors in [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed–Solomon codes]] for an RS(''n'', ''k''), code based on the Reed Solomon original view where a message &lt;math&gt;m_1, \cdots, m_k&lt;/math&gt; is used as coefficients of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;F(a_i)&lt;/math&gt; or used with [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange interpolation]] to generate the polynomial &lt;math&gt;F(a_i)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt; ''k'' for inputs &lt;math&gt;a_1 , \cdots, a_k&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;F(a_i)&lt;/math&gt; is applied to &lt;math&gt;a_{k+1}, \cdots , a_n&lt;/math&gt; to create an encoded codeword &lt;math&gt;c_1, \cdots , c_n&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal of the decoder is to recover the original encoding polynomial &lt;math&gt;F(a_i)&lt;/math&gt;, using the known inputs &lt;math&gt;a_1, \cdots , a_n&lt;/math&gt; and received codeword &lt;math&gt;b_1, \cdots , b_n&lt;/math&gt; with possible errors. It also computes an error polynomial &lt;math&gt;E(a_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E(a_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to errors in the received codeword.

== The key equations ==

Defining ''e'' = number of errors, the key set of ''n'' equations is

:&lt;math&gt;b_i E(a_i) = E(a_i) F(a_i) &lt;/math&gt;

Where E(''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 0 for the ''e'' cases when b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; F(a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), and E(a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;ne; 0 for the ''n'' - ''e'' non error cases where ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = F(''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') . These equations can't be solved directly, but by defining Q() as the product of E() and F():

:&lt;math&gt;Q(a_i) = E(a_i) F(a_i) &lt;/math&gt;

and adding the constraint that the most significant coefficient of E(a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''e&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1, the result will lead to a set of equations that can be solved with linear algebra.

:&lt;math&gt;b_i E(a_i) = Q(a_i)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_i E(a_i) - Q(a_i) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_i(e_0 + e_1 a_i + e_2 a_i^2 + \cdots + e_e a_i^e) -(q_0 + q_1 a_i + q_2 a_i^2 + \cdots + q_q a_i^q) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' = ''n'' - ''e'' - 1. Since ''e&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is constrained to be 1, the equations become:

:&lt;math&gt;b_i(e_0 + e_1 a_i + e_2 a_i^2 + \cdots + e_{e-1} a_i^{e-1}) -(q_0 + q_1 a_i + q_2 a_i^2 + \cdots + q_q a_i^q) = - b_i a_i^e&lt;/math&gt;

resulting in a set of equations which can be solved using linear algebra, with time complexity O(n^3).

The algorithm begins assuming the maximum number of errors ''e'' = ⌊ (''n''-''k'')/2 ⌋. If the equations can not be solved (due to redundancy), ''e'' is reduced by 1 and the process repeated, until the equations can be solved or ''e'' is reduced to 0, indicating no errors. If Q()/E() has remainder = 0, then F() = Q()/E() and the code word values F(''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') are calculated for the locations where E(''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 0 to recover the original code word. If the remainder &amp;ne; 0, then an uncorrectable error has been detected.

==Example==

Consider RS(7,3) (''n'' = 7, ''k'' = 3) defined in {{math|''GF''(7)}} with ''α'' = 3 and input values: ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = i-1 : {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. The message to be systematically encoded is {1,6,3}. Using Lagrange interpolation, ''F(a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'' = 3 x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 x + 1, and applying ''F(a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'' for ''a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 3 to ''a&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 6, results in the code word {1,6,3,6,1,2,2}. Assume errors occur at ''c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' resulting in the received code word {1,5,3,6,3,2,2}. Start off with ''e'' = 2 and solve the linear equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}

Starting from the bottom of the right matrix, and the constraint ''e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1:

&lt;math&gt;Q(a_i) = 3 x^4 + 1 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 3x + 4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E(a_i) = 1 x^2 + 2 x + 4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F(a_i) = Q(a_i) / E(a_i) = 3 x^2 + 2 x + 1&lt;/math&gt; with remainder = 0.

E(''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 0 at ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 and ''a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4
Calculate F(''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1) = 6 and F(''a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4) = 1 to produce corrected code word {1,6,3,6,1,2,2}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7191">In [[algebra]], the '''Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cut-the-knot.org/m/Algebra/BrahmaguptaFibonacci.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Chamberland: ''Single Digits: In Praise of Small Numbers''. Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9781400865697}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; expresses the product of two sums of two squares as a sum of two squares in two different ways. Hence the set of all sums of two squares is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under multiplication. Specifically, the identity says
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left(a^2 + b^2\right)\left(c^2 + d^2\right) &amp; {}= \left(ac-bd\right)^2 + \left(ad+bc\right)^2 &amp; &amp; (1) \\
                                             &amp; {}= \left(ac+bd\right)^2 + \left(ad-bc\right)^2. &amp; &amp; (2)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For example,
:&lt;math&gt;(1^2 + 4^2)(2^2 + 7^2) = 26^2 + 15^2 = 30^2 + 1^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The identity is also known as the '''Diophantus identity''',&lt;ref name=stillwell2&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|2002|p =76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Shanks]], Solved and unsolved problems in number theory, p.209, American Mathematical Society, Fourth edition 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  as it was first proved by [[Diophantus|Diophantus of Alexandria]].  It is a special case of [[Euler's four-square identity]], and also of [[Lagrange's identity]]. 

[[Brahmagupta]] proved and used a more general identity (the [[Brahmagupta identity]]), equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left(a^2 + nb^2\right)\left(c^2 + nd^2\right) &amp; {}= \left(ac-nbd\right)^2 + n\left(ad+bc\right)^2 &amp; &amp; (3) \\
                                               &amp; {}= \left(ac+nbd\right)^2 + n\left(ad-bc\right)^2. &amp; &amp; (4)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that, for any fixed ''A'', the set of all numbers of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is closed under multiplication.

The identity holds in the [[integer|ring of integers]], the [[rational number|ring of rational numbers]] and, more generally, any [[commutative ring]].  All four forms of the identity can be verified by [[polynomial expansion|expanding]] each side of the equation.  Also, (2) can be obtained from (1), or (1) from (2), by changing ''b'' to&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''b'', and likewise with (3) and (4).

==History==
The identity is actually first found in [[Diophantus]]' ''[[Arithmetica]]'' (III, 19), of the third century A.D.
It was rediscovered by Brahmagupta (598&amp;ndash;668), an [[Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] and [[Indian astronomy|astronomer]], who generalized it (to the [[Brahmagupta's identity|Brahmagupta identity]]) and used it in his study of what is now called [[Pell's equation]]. His ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta]]'' was translated from [[Sanskrit]] into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by [[Mohammad al-Fazari]], and was subsequently translated into [[Latin]] in 1126.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;{{Harvnb|Joseph|2000|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity later appeared in [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[The Book of Squares|Book of Squares]]'' in 1225.

==Related identities==

Analogous identities are [[Euler's four-square identity|Euler's four-square]] related to [[quaternions]], and [[Degen's eight-square identity|Degen's eight-square]] derived from the [[octonions]] which has connections to [[Bott periodicity]]. There is also [[Pfister's sixteen-square identity]], though it is no longer bilinear.

== Multiplication of complex numbers ==

If ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are [[real number]]s, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity is equivalent to the multiplicativity property for absolute values of [[complex numbers]]:

:&lt;math&gt;  | a+bi | \cdot | c+di | = | (a+bi)(c+di) | .&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen as follows: expanding the right side and squaring both sides, the multiplication property is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;  | a+bi |^2 \cdot | c+di |^2 = | (ac-bd)+i(ad+bc) |^2,&lt;/math&gt;

and by the definition of absolute value this is in turn equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;  (a^2+b^2)\cdot (c^2+d^2)= (ac-bd)^2+(ad+bc)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

An equivalent calculation in the case that the variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are [[rational number]]s shows the identity may be interpreted as the statement that the [[field norm|norm]] in the [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''Q'''(''i'') is multiplicative: the norm is given by 
: &lt;math&gt;N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2,&lt;/math&gt;
and the multiplicativity calculation is the same as the preceding one.

== Application to Pell's equation ==
In its original context, Brahmagupta applied his discovery of this identity to the solution of [[Pell's equation]] ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''Ay''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Using the identity in the more general form

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1^2 - Ay_1^2)(x_2^2 - Ay_2^2) = (x_1x_2 + Ay_1y_2)^2 - A(x_1y_2 + x_2y_1)^2, &lt;/math&gt;

he was able to "compose" triples (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that were solutions of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''Ay''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'', to generate the new triple

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1x_2 + Ay_1y_2 \,,\, x_1y_2 + x_2y_1 \,,\, k_1k_2).&lt;/math&gt;

Not only did this give a way to generate infinitely many solutions to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''Ay''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 starting with one solution, but also, by dividing such a composition by ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, integer or "nearly integer" solutions could often be obtained. The general method for solving the Pell equation given by [[Bhaskara II]] in 1150, namely the [[chakravala method|chakravala (cyclic) method]], was also based on this identity.&lt;ref name=stillwell&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|2002|pp=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing integers as a sum of two squares ==
When used in conjunction with one of [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|Fermat's theorems]], the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity proves that the product of a square and any number of primes of the form 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is a sum of two squares.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Cantor set''' is a set of points lying on a single [[line segment]] that has a number of remarkable and deep properties.  It was discovered in 1874 by [[Henry John Stephen Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Henry J.S. | last=Smith | date=1874 | title=On the integration of discontinuous functions | journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series=First series | volume=6 | pages=140&amp;ndash;153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The “Cantor set” was also discovered by [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] (1831&amp;ndash;1889).

The “Cantor set” was also discovered in 1881 by Vito Volterra (1860&amp;ndash;1940).

Through consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern [[point-set topology]]. Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the '''Cantor ternary set''', built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]].

==Construction and formula of the ternary set==
The Cantor ternary set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is created by iteratively deleting the [[open interval|open]] middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third ({{sfrac|1|3}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}}) from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&amp;nbsp;1], leaving two line segments: [0,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}] ∪ [{{sfrac|2|3}},&amp;nbsp;1].  Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|9}}] ∪ [{{sfrac|2|9}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}]  ∪ [{{sfrac|2|3}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|7|9}}] ∪ [{{sfrac|8|9}},&amp;nbsp;1]. This process is continued [[ad infinitum]], where the ''n''th set is

: &lt;math&gt;C_n = \frac{C_{n-1}} 3 \cup \left(\frac 2 {3} +\frac{C_{n-1}} 3 \right) \text{ for } n \ge 1, \text{ and } C_0=[0,1].&lt;/math&gt;

The Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} := \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The first six steps of this process are illustrated below.

[[Image:Cantor set in seven iterations.svg|729px|Cantor ternary set, in seven iterations]]

Using the idea of self-similar transformations, &lt;math&gt;T_L(x)=x/3,   T_R(x)=(2+x)/3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; C_n =T_L(C_{n-1})\cup T_R(C_{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt; the explicit closed formulas for the Cantor set are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Mohsen | last=Soltanifar | title=A Different Description of A Family of Middle-a Cantor Sets | journal=American Journal of Undergraduate Research | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=9–12 | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}=[0,1] \smallsetminus \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=0}^{3^n-1} \left(\frac{3k+1}{3^{n+1}},\frac{3k+2}{3^{n+1}}\right), &lt;/math&gt;
where every middle third is removed as the open interval &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left(\frac{3k+1}{3^{n+1}},\frac{3k+2}{3^{n+1}}\right) &lt;/math&gt; from the closed interval &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left[\frac{3k+0}{3^{n+1}},\frac{3k+3}{3^{n+1}}\right] = \left[\frac{k+0}{3^n},\frac{k+1}{3^n}\right] &lt;/math&gt; surrounding it, or
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=0}^{3^{n-1}-1} \left( \left[\frac{3k+0}{3^n},\frac{3k+1}{3^n}\right] \cup \left[\frac{3k+2}{3^n},\frac{3k+3}{3^n}\right] \right), &lt;/math&gt;
where the middle third &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left(\frac{3k+1}{3^n},\frac{3k+2}{3^n}\right) &lt;/math&gt; of the foregoing closed interval &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left[\frac{k+0}{3^{n-1}},\frac{k+1}{3^{n-1}}\right] = \left[\frac{3k+0}{3^n},\frac{3k+3}{3^n}\right] &lt;/math&gt; is removed by intersecting with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left[\frac{3k+0}{3^n},\frac{3k+1}{3^n}\right] \cup \left[\frac{3k+2}{3^n},\frac{3k+3}{3^n}\right] .&lt;/math&gt;

This process of removing middle thirds is a simple example of a [[finite subdivision rule]].  The Cantor ternary set is an example of a [[fractal string]].

[[File:Cantor set binary tree.svg|400px]]

In arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers on the [[unit interval]] that are expressible as a [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. Replacing the "2" digits in these fractions with "1" digits produces a bijective mapping between the Cantor set and the set of infinite binary sequences.

== Composition ==
Since the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., [[Lebesgue measure|measure]]) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the [[geometric progression]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{4}{27} + \frac{8}{81} + \cdots =  \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{3}}\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So that the proportion left is  1 &amp;ndash; 1 = 0.

This calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left&amp;mdash;after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the "middle third" of each interval involved removing [[open set]]s (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) from the original interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] leaves behind the points &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).

It may appear that ''only'' the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202… = {{overline|0.|02}}. It is in the bottom third, and the top ninth of that third, and the bottom twenty-seventh of that ninth, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3&lt;ref name="College"&gt;{{citation

&amp;mdash; the set of ''endpoints of segments'' being contained in the set
:&lt;math&gt; \{x \in [0,1] \mid \exists i \in \N_0: x \, 3^i \in \Z \} \qquad \Bigl(\subset \N_0 \, 3^{-\N_0} \Bigr) &lt;/math&gt;
which is a [[countably infinite]] set.
As to [[cardinality]], ''most'' elements of the Cantor set are not endpoints of intervals,
and the whole Cantor set is not countable.

== Properties ==

=== Cardinality ===
It can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. To see this, we show that there is a function ''f'' from the Cantor set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to the closed interval [0,1] that is [[Surjective function|surjective]] (i.e. ''f'' maps from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; onto [0,1]) so that the [[cardinality]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is no less than that of [0,1].  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].

To construct this function, consider the points in the [0,&amp;nbsp;1] interval in terms of base 3 (or [[ternary numeral system|ternary]]) notation. 
Recall that the proper ternary fractions, more precisely: the elements of &lt;math&gt;\bigl(\Z \!\setminus \! \{0\}\bigr) \cdot 3^{-\N_0}&lt;/math&gt;, admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, that can be written as 0.1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.1|0}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but also as 0.0222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.0|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, that can be written as 0.2&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.2|0}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; but also as 0.1222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.1|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any [[Numeral system#Positional systems in detail|positional system]] with [[Absolute value (algebra)#Types of absolute value|Archimedean absolute value]].&lt;/ref&gt;
When we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; where xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is strictly between 00000...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 22222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of
* Numbers of the form 0.0xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (including 0.022222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/3)
* Numbers of the form 0.2xxxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (including 0.222222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1)
This can be summarized by saying that those numbers that admit a ternary representation such that the first digit after the [[radix point]] is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.

The second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.21xxxx...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first ''two'' digits is 1.

Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step ''n'', it must have a ternary representation whose ''n''th digit is not 1.  For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.

It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.21&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.0|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.20222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.20|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
All the latter numbers are “endpoints”, here: right [[limit point]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. The same is true for the left limit points of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, e.&amp;nbsp;g. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.1|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.2|0}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.21222...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.21|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.22|0}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. All these endpoints are ''proper ternary'' [[Rational number|fractions]] (elements of &lt;math&gt;\Z \cdot 3^{-\N_0}&lt;/math&gt;) of the form &lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, where when [[Irreducible fraction|irreducible]] the denominator ''q'' is a power of 3.&lt;ref name="College"/&gt; The ternary representation of these fractions terminates (i.&amp;nbsp;e. is finite) or &amp;mdash; what is the same &amp;mdash; is infinite and “ends” in either infinitely many recurring 0s or infinitely many recurring 2s. And such a fraction is a left [[limit point]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; if its ternary representation avoiding any 1 “ends” in infinitely many recurring 0s and a right limit point of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; if its 1 avoiding ternary numeral “ends” in infinitely many recurring 2s.

This set of endpoints is [[Dense set|dense]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; (but not dense in [0, 1]) and makes up a [[countably infinite]] set. The numbers in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; which are ''not'' endpoints also have only 0s and 2s in their ternary representation, but there is ''no'' digit position from which on there are ''only'' digits 0 resp. ''only'' digits 2, i.&amp;nbsp;e. there is no trailing infinite repetition of the digit 0 nor of the digit 2.

The function from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to [0,1] is defined by taking the ternary numeral that does consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a [[Binary numeral system#Representing real numbers|binary]] representation of a real number.  In a formula,

:&lt;math&gt;f \bigg( \sum_{k\in \N} a_k 3^{-k} \bigg) = \sum_{k\in \N} \frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\forall k\in \N : a_k \in \{0,2\} .&lt;/math&gt;

For any number ''y'' in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' so that ''y'' is in the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.  For instance if ''y'' = &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.100110011001...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.|1001}}, we write ''x'' = {{overline|0.|2002}} = 0.200220022002...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.  Consequently, ''f'' is surjective. However, ''f'' is ''not'' [[injective function|injective]] &amp;mdash; the values for which ''f''(''x'') coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the ''middle thirds'' removed.  For instance, take
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.0|2}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a right limit point of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a left limit point of the middle third [&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]) &amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.2|0}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a left limit point of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a right limit point of the middle third [&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;])
so
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
f\bigl({}^1\!\!/\!_3 \bigr) = f(0.0\overline{2}_3) = 0.0\overline{1}_2 = \!\! &amp; \!\! 0.1_2 \!\! &amp; \!\! = 0.1\overline{0}_2 = f(0.2\overline{0}_3) = f\bigl({}^2\!\!/\!_3 \bigr) . \\
&amp; \parallel \\
&amp; {}^1\!\!/\!_2
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] (which has the [[Uncountable set|uncountable]] cardinality {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;).}} However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be written as 0.020202...&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{overline|0.|02}} in ternary notation.  In fact, given any &lt;math&gt;a\in[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, there exist &lt;math&gt;x,y\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a = y-x&lt;/math&gt;.  This was first demonstrated by [[Hugo Steinhaus|Steinhaus]] in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, y=x+a\} \; \cap \; (\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}) \neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a\in[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real Analysis|last=Carothers|first=N. L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-69624-1|location=Cambridge|pages=31–32|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this construction provides an injection from &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}|\geq|[-1,1]|=\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; as an immediate corollary.  Assuming that &lt;math&gt;|A\times A|=|A|&lt;/math&gt; for any infinite set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (a statement shown to be equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] by [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]), this provides another demonstration that &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{C}|=\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even [[Dense set|dense]] in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.

It has been conjectured that all [[algebraic number|algebraic]] irrational numbers are [[normal number|normal]].  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or [[transcendental number|transcendental]].

=== Self-similarity ===
The Cantor set is the prototype of a [[fractal]]. It is [[self-similar]], because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, the Cantor set is equal to the union of two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations of itself, &lt;math&gt;T_L(x)=x/3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_R(x)=(2+x)/3&lt;/math&gt;, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to [[homeomorphism]]: &lt;math&gt;T_L(\mathcal{C})\cong T_R(\mathcal{C})\cong \mathcal{C}=T_L(\mathcal{C})\cup T_R(\mathcal{C}).&lt;/math&gt;  

Repeated [[iterated function|iteration]] of &lt;math&gt;T_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_R&lt;/math&gt; can be visualized as an infinite [[binary tree]]. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set &lt;math&gt;\{T_L,T_R\}&lt;/math&gt; together with [[function composition]] forms a [[monoid]], the [[dyadic monoid]].

The [[automorphism]]s of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the [[modular group]]. Thus, the Cantor set is a [[homogeneous space]] in the sense that for any two points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the Cantor set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. An explicit construction of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; can be described more easily if we see the Cantor set [[Cantor_set#Topological_and_analytical_properties|as a product space]] of  countably many copies of the discrete space &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the map &lt;math&gt;h:\{0,1\}^\N\to\{0,1\}^\N &lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;h_n(u):=u_n+x_n+y_n \mod 2&lt;/math&gt; is an involutive homeomorphism exchanging  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Conservation law===

It has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt;th moment (where &lt;math&gt;d_f=\ln(2)/\ln(3)&lt;/math&gt; is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set &lt;ref name="KBN95"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=P. L. | last1=Krapivsky | first2=E. | last2=Ben-Naim | title=Multiscaling in Stochastic Fractals | journal=Physics Letters A | volume=196 | date=1994 | page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR95"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=M. K. | last1=Hassan | first2=G. J. | last2=Rodgers | title=Models of fragmentation and stochastic fractals | journal=Physics Letters A | page=208 | volume=95 | date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. We know that there are &lt;math&gt;N=2^n&lt;/math&gt; intervals of size &lt;math&gt;1/3^n&lt;/math&gt;
present in the system at the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th step of its construction. Then if we level the surviving intervals
as &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; then the &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt;th moment is &lt;math&gt;x_1^{d_f}+x_2^{d_f}
+...+x_{2^n}^{d_f}=1&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2= ... =x_{2^n}=1/3^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the Cantor set is equal to ln(2)/ln(3)&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.631.

===The Hausdorff dimension theorem===
An essential property of Cantor sets is giving sufficiency of fractals for any given Hausdorff dimension &lt;math&gt; r   &lt;/math&gt;:

'''Theorem'''. For any given &lt;math&gt; r&gt;0,  &lt;/math&gt; there are uncountable fractals with Hausdorff dimension &lt;math&gt; r   &lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt; R^{n}, (n \geq -[-r]). &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Mohsen | last=Soltanifar | title=On A Sequence of Cantor Fractals | journal=Rose Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal | volume=7 | issue=1 | at=Paper 9 | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topological and analytical properties ===

Although "the" Cantor set typically refers to the original, middle-thirds Cantor described above, topologists often talk about "a" Cantor set, which means any topological space that is [[homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to it.

As the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has [[Lebesgue measure]] 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[open set]]s, it itself is a [[closed set|closed]] subset of the reals, and therefore a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Since it is also [[totally bounded]], the [[Heine–Borel theorem]] says that it must be [[compact space|compact]].

For any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an [[accumulation point]] (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an [[interior point]]. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a [[perfect set]] in [[topology]], while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]] in the interval.

Every point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the Cantor set.

For any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ &amp;mdash; one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into "halves" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the [[relative topology]] on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a [[clopen set]].  Consequently, the Cantor set is [[totally disconnected]].  As a compact totally disconnected [[Hausdorff space]], the Cantor set is an example of a [[Stone space]].

As a [[topological space]], the Cantor set is naturally [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the space &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, where each copy carries the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. This is the space of all [[sequence]]s in two digits 
:&lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}=\{(x_n)\mid x_n\in \{0,1\} \text{ for } n\in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;,

which can also be identified with the set of [[p-adic numbers|2-adic integers]]. The [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the open sets of the product topology are [[cylinder set]]s; the homeomorphism maps these to the [[subspace topology]] that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the [[Cantor space]] as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via [[Tychonoff's theorem]].

From the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the [[p-adic numbers|p-adic integers]], and, if one point is removed from it, to the [[p-adic numbers]].

The Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a [[metric space]] with respect to the [[absolute difference|ordinary distance metric]]; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the [[p-adic metric]] on &lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;: given two sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_n),(y_n)\in 2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the distance between them is &lt;math&gt;d((x_n),(y_n)) = 1/k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest index such that &lt;math&gt;x_k \ne y_k&lt;/math&gt;; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same [[topological space|topology]] on the Cantor set.

We have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See [[Cantor space]] for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

The Cantor set is sometimes regarded as "universal" in the [[Category theory|category]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]]s, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not [[universal property|universal]] in the precise categorical sense. The "universal" property has important applications in [[functional analysis]], where it is sometimes known as the ''representation theorem for compact metric spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Stephen | last=Willard | title=General Topology | publisher=Addison-Wesley | date=1968 | asin=B0000EG7Q0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For any integer ''q'' ≥ 2, the topology on the group G='''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the [[Pontrjagin dual]] Γ is also '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, the topology of Γ is compact. One can see that Γ is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case ''q''=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)

The [[geometric mean]] of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1889476/cantor-set-geometric-mean&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}

===Measure and probability===
The Cantor set can be seen as the [[compact group]] of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural [[Haar measure]]. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a [[singular measure]]. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any [[probability]], making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.

In [[Lebesgue measure]] theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/theorem-36-the-cantor-set-is-an-uncountable-set-with-zero-measure/ | title=Theorem 36: the Cantor set is an uncountable set with zero measure | first=Laura | last=Irvine | website=Theorem of the week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantor numbers===
If we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise  | first=Manfred | last=Schroeder | publisher=Dover | date=1991 | pages=164–165 | isbn=0486472043}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*(1) Every real number in [0, 2] is the sum of two Cantor numbers.
*(2) Between any two Cantor numbers there is a number that is not a Cantor number.

===Smith&amp;ndash;Volterra&amp;ndash;Cantor set===
{{main|Smith&amp;ndash;Volterra&amp;ndash;Cantor set}}

Instead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle.  In the case where the middle &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case &amp;mdash; the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.

By removing progressively smaller percentages of the remaining pieces in every step, one can also construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive [[Lebesgue measure]], while still being [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]]. See [[Smith&amp;ndash;Volterra&amp;ndash;Cantor set]] for an example.

===Stochastic Cantor set===

One can modify the construction of the Cantor set by dividing randomly instead of equally. Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals. In the case of stochastic triadic Cantor set the resulting process can be described by the following rate equation&lt;ref name="KBN95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HR95"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial c(x,t)}\over{\partial t}}=-{{x^2}\over{2}}c(x,t)+2\int_x^\infty (y-x)c(y,t) \, dy,&lt;/math&gt;

and for the stochastic dyadic Cantor set&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=M. K. | last1=Hassan | first2=N. I. | last2=Pavel | first3=R. K. | last3=Pandit | first4=J. | last4=Kurths | title=Dyadic Cantor set and its kinetic and stochastic counterpart | journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | volume=60 | pages=31–39 | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial c(x,t)}\over{\partial t}}=-xc(x,t)+(1+p)\int_x^\infty c(y,t) \, dy,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c(x,t)dx&lt;/math&gt; is the number of intervals of size between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+dx&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of triadic Cantor set the fractal dimension is &lt;math&gt;0.5616&lt;/math&gt; which is 
less than its deterministic counterpart &lt;math&gt;0.6309&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set
the fractal dimension is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; which is again less than that of its deterministic counterpart &lt;math&gt;\ln (1+p)/\ln 2&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set the solution for &lt;math&gt;c(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; exhibits [[dynamic scaling]] as its solution in the long-time limit is &lt;math&gt;t^{-(1+d_f)}e^{-xt}&lt;/math&gt; where the fractal dimension of the stochastic dyadic Cantor set &lt;math&gt;d_f=p&lt;/math&gt;. In either case, like triadic Cantor set, the &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt;th moment (&lt;math&gt;\int x^{d_f}c(x,t)dx=constant)&lt;/math&gt;) of stochastic triadic and dyadic Cantor set too are conserved quantities.

=== Cantor dust ===&lt;!-- This is linked to by the redirect "Cantor dust"--&gt;
'''Cantor dust''' is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite [[Cartesian product]] of the Cantor set with itself, making it a [[Cantor space]]. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has [[Measure zero|zero measure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmberg, Gilbert|title=Getting Acquainted With Fractals|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019092-2|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbrlYO83Oq8C&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the [[Sierpinski carpet]], where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmberg, Gilbert|title=Getting Acquainted With Fractals|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019092-2|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbrlYO83Oq8C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3D analogue of this is the [[Menger sponge]].

==Historical remarks==
[[File:Cantor-like Column Capital Ile de Philae Description d'Egypte 1809.jpg|thumb|Column capital with pattern like Cantor set. Engraving of Île de Philae from ''Description d'Égypte'' by Jean-Baptiste Prosper Jollois and Édouard Devilliers, Imprimerie Impériale, Paris, 1809-1828]]

Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, and mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]]. The original paper provides several different constructions of the abstract concept.

This set would have been considered abstract at the time when Cantor devised it. Cantor himself was led to it by practical concerns about the set of points where a [[Fourier series|trigonometric series]] might fail to converge. The discovery did much to set him on the course for developing an [[axiomatic set theory|abstract, general theory of infinite sets]].

A column capital from the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian site of the island of [[Philae]] carries a pattern which resembles the Cantor set. Cantor may have seen the image, as his cousin was an Egyptologist.&lt;ref name="Lumpkin1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumpkin|first=Beatrice|title=Geometry Activities from Many Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xpr_rBdY9PwC&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Walch Publishing|isbn=978-0-8251-3285-8|page=17|quote=Napoleon's Expedition brought this picture to Europe in their report, ''Description de L'Egypte''. Notice the startling resemblance to the Cantor set diagram. ... Did George Cantor see pictures of the Egyptian columns before he conceived the set...? We don't known, but it is a possibility, because Cantor's cousin was a student of Egyptology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the [[point at infinity]] if the curvature is zero.  The [[osculating circle]] to the curve is centered at the centre of curvature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4204">In [[statistics]] and [[computational geometry]], the notion of  '''centerpoint''' is a generalization of the [[median]] to data in higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  Given a set of points in ''d''-dimensional space, a centerpoint of the set is a point such that any hyperplane that goes through that point divides the set of points in two roughly equal subsets: the smaller part should have at least a 1/(''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) fraction of the points.  Like the median, a centerpoint need not be one of the data points.  Every non-empty set of points (with no duplicates) has at least one centerpoint.

== Related concepts ==
Closely related concepts are the '''Tukey depth''' of a point (the minimum number of sample points on one side of a hyperplane through the point) and a '''Tukey median''' of a point set (a point maximizing the Tukey depth). A centerpoint is a point of depth at least ''n''/(''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), and a Tukey median must be a centerpoint, but not every centerpoint is a Tukey median. Both terms are named after [[John Tukey]].

For a different generalization of the median to higher dimensions, see [[geometric median]].

== Existence ==
A simple proof of the existence of a centerpoint may be obtained using [[Helly's theorem]]. Suppose there are ''n'' points, and consider the family of closed [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]] that contain more than ''dn''/(''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) of the points. Fewer than ''n''/(''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) points are excluded from any one of these halfspaces, so the intersection of any subset of ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 of these halfspaces must be nonempty. By Helly's theorem, it follows that the intersection of all of these halfspaces must also be nonempty. Any point in this intersection is necessarily a centerpoint.

== Algorithms ==
For points in the [[Euclidean plane]], a centerpoint may be constructed in [[linear time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jadhav|Mukhopadhyay|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any dimension ''d'', a Tukey median (and therefore also a centerpoint) may be constructed in time O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[randomized algorithm]] that repeatedly replaces sets of ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 points by their Radon point can be used to compute an [[approximation algorithm|approximation]] to a centerpoint of any point set, in the sense that its Tukey depth is linear in the sample set size, in an amount of time that is polynomial in both the number of points and the dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Clarkson|Eppstein|Miller|Sturtivant|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4522">In [[mathematics]], a '''character group''' is the group of [[group representation|representation]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] by  [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. These functions can be thought of as one-dimensional [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representations and so are special cases of the group [[character (mathematics)|characters]] that arise in the related context of [[character theory]]. Whenever a group is represented by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], the function defined by the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of the matrices is called a character; however, these traces ''do not'' in general form a group. Some important properties of these one-dimensional characters apply to characters in general:
* Characters are invariant on conjugacy classes.
* The characters of irreducible representations are orthogonal.
The primary importance of the character group for finite abelian groups is in [[number theory]], where it is used to construct [[Dirichlet characters]].  The character group of the [[cyclic group]] also appears in the theory of the [[discrete Fourier transform]]. For locally compact abelian groups, the character group (with an assumption of 
continuity) is central to [[Fourier analysis]].

==Preliminaries==
Let ''G'' be an abelian group. A function &lt;math&gt;f:G\rightarrow \mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; mapping the group to the non-zero complex numbers  is called a '''character''' of ''G'' if it is a [[group homomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^\times&lt;/math&gt;—that is, if &lt;math&gt;\forall g_1,g_2 \in G\;\; f(g_1 g_2)=f(g_1)f(g_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''f'' is a character of a finite group ''G'', then each function value ''f''(''g'') is a [[root of unity]] (since &lt;math&gt;\forall g \in G \;\; \exists k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g^{k}=e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(g)^{k}=f(g^{k})=f(e)=1&lt;/math&gt;).

Each character ''f'' is a constant on [[conjugacy class]]es of ''G'', that is, ''f''(''h'' ''g'' ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''f''(''g'').  For this reason, the character is sometimes called the '''class function'''.

A finite [[abelian group]] of order ''n'' has exactly ''n'' distinct characters.  These are denoted by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the trivial representation; that is, &lt;math&gt;\forall g \in G\;\; f_1(g)=1&lt;/math&gt;.  It is called the '''principal character of G'''; the others are called the '''non-principal characters'''.  The non-principal characters have the property that &lt;math&gt;f_i(g)\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==
If ''G'' is an abelian group of order ''n'', then the set of characters ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' forms an abelian group under multiplication &lt;math&gt;(f_j f_k)(g)= f_j(g) f_k(g)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- this notation assumes the character group is automatically finite for some reason. ---&gt; for each element &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt;.  This group is the '''character group of G''' and is sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;\hat {G}&lt;/math&gt;.  It is of order ''n''. The identity element of &lt;math&gt;\hat {G}&lt;/math&gt; is the principal character ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The inverse of ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the reciprocal 1/''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Note that since &lt;math&gt;\forall g \in G\;\; |f_k(g)|=1&lt;/math&gt;, the inverse is equal to the complex conjugate.

== Orthogonality of characters ==
Consider the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix ''A''=''A''(''G'') whose matrix elements are &lt;math&gt;A_{jk}=f_j(g_k)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th element of ''G''. 

The sum of the entries in the ''j''th row of ''A'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n A_{jk} = \sum_{k=1}^n f_j(g_k) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;j \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n A_{1k} = n&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum of the entries in the ''k''th column of ''A'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n A_{jk} = \sum_{j=1}^n f_j(g_k) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;k \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n A_{j1} = \sum_{j=1}^n f_j(e) = n&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A^\ast&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[conjugate transpose]] of ''A''.  Then 
:&lt;math&gt;AA^\ast = A^\ast A = nI&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies the desired orthogonality relationship for the characters: i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n {f_k}^* (g_i) f_k (g_j) = n \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; ,
where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] and &lt;math&gt;f^*_k (g_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;f_k (g_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Circle packing theorem K5 minus edge example.svg|thumb|A circle packing for a five-vertex planar graph]]
The '''circle packing theorem''' (also known as the '''Koebe–Andreev–Thurston theorem''') describes the possible tangency relations between circles in the plane whose interiors are disjoint.   A '''circle packing''' is a connected collection of circles (in general, on any Riemann surface) whose interiors are disjoint. The [[intersection graph]] of a circle packing is the graph having a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] for each circle, and an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] for every pair of circles that are [[tangent circles|tangent]]. If the circle packing is on the plane, or, equivalently, on the sphere, then its intersection graph is called a '''coin graph'''; more generally, intersection graphs of interior-disjoint geometric objects are called '''tangency graphs''' or '''[[contact graph]]s'''. Coin graphs are always connected, [[simple graph|simple]], and [[planar graph|planar]]. The circle packing theorem states that these are the only requirements for a graph to be a coin graph:

'''Circle packing theorem''': For every connected simple planar graph ''G'' there is a circle packing in the plane whose intersection graph is ([[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to) ''G''.

==Uniqueness==
A [[maximal planar graph]] ''G'' is a finite simple planar graph to which no more edges can be added while preserving planarity. Such a graph always has a unique planar embedding, in which every face of the embedding (including the outer face) is a triangle. In other words, every maximal planar graph ''G'' is the 1-skeleton of a [[simplicial complex]] which is [[homeomorphic]] to the sphere.  The circle packing theorem guarantees the existence of a circle packing with finitely many circles whose intersection graph is isomorphic to ''G''.  As the following theorem states more formally, every maximal planar graph can have at most one packing.

'''Koebe–Andreev–Thurston theorem''': If ''G'' is a finite maximal planar graph, then the circle packing whose tangency graph is isomorphic to ''G'' is unique, [[up to]] [[Möbius transformation]]s and reflections in lines.

Thurston&lt;ref name="thu"/&gt; observes that this uniqueness is a consequence of the [[Mostow rigidity theorem]]. To see this, let ''G'' be represented by a circle packing. Then the plane in which the circles are packed may be viewed as the boundary of a [[Poincaré half-plane model|halfspace model]] for three-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]]; with this view, each circle is the boundary of a plane within the hyperbolic space. One can define a set of disjoint planes in this way from the circles of the packing, and a second set of disjoint planes defined by the circles that [[circumscribed circle|circumscribe]] each triangular gap between three of the circles in the packing. These two sets of planes meet at right angles, and form the [[Generating set of a group|generator]]s of a [[reflection group]] whose [[fundamental domain]] can be viewed as a [[hyperbolic manifold]]. By Mostow rigidity, the hyperbolic structure of this domain is uniquely determined, up to [[isometry]] of the hyperbolic space; these isometries, when viewed in terms of their actions on the Euclidean plane on the boundary of the half-plane model, translate to Möbius transformations.

There is also a more elementary proof of the same uniqueness property, based on the [[maximum principle]] and on the observation that, in the triangle connecting the centers of three mutually tangent circles, the
angle formed at the center of one of the circles is monotone decreasing in its radius and monotone increasing in the two other radii. Given two packings for the same graph ''G'', one may apply reflections and Möbius transformations to make the outer circles in these two packings correspond to each other and have the same radii. Then, let ''v'' be an interior vertex of ''G'' for which the circles in the two packings have sizes that are as far apart as possible: that is, choose ''v'' to maximize the ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the radii of its circles in the two packings. For each triangular face of ''G'' containing ''v'', it follows that the angle at the center of the circle for ''v'' in the first packing is less than or equal to the angle in the second packing, with equality possible only when the other two circles forming the triangle have the same ratio ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of radii in the two packings. But the sum of the angles of all of these triangles surrounding the center of the triangle must be 2π in both packings, so all neighboring vertices to ''v'' must have the same ratio as ''v'' itself. By applying the same argument to these other circles in turn, it follows that all circles in both packings have the same ratio. But the outer circles have been transformed to have ratio 1, so ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and the two packings have identical radii for all circles.

==Relations with conformal mapping theory==
[[File:circleRiemannMap1.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|Circle packings can be used to approximate conformal mappings between
specified domains. Each circle on the left corresponds to a circle on the right.]]
A [[conformal map]] between two [[open set]]s in the plane or in a higher-dimensional space is a [[continuous function]] from one set to the other that preserves the [[angle]]s between any two curves. The [[Riemann mapping theorem]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1851, states that, for any two open [[Disk (mathematics)|topological disks]] in the plane, there is a conformal map from one disk to the other. Conformal mappings have applications in [[mesh generation]], [[map projection]], and other areas. However, it is not always easy to construct a conformal mapping between two given domains in an explicit way.&lt;ref name="s99"&gt;{{harvtxt|Stephenson|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Bieberbach conference in 1985, [[William Thurston]] conjectured that circle packings could be used to approximate conformal mappings. More precisely, Thurston used circle packings to find a conformal mapping from an arbitrary open disk ''A'' to the interior of a circle; the mapping from one topological disk ''A'' to another disk ''B'' could then be found by composing the map from ''A'' to a circle with the inverse of the map from ''B'' to a circle.&lt;ref name="s99"/&gt;

Thurston's idea was to pack circles of some small radius ''r'' in a hexagonal [[tessellation]] of the plane, within region ''A'', leaving a narrow region near the boundary of ''A'', of width ''r'', where no more circles of this radius can fit. He then constructs a maximal planar graph ''G'' from the [[intersection graph]] of the circles, together with one additional vertex adjacent to all the circles on the boundary of the packing. By the circle packing theorem, this planar graph can be represented by a circle packing ''C'' in which all the edges (including the ones incident to the boundary vertex) are represented by tangencies of circles. The circles from the packing of ''A'' correspond one-for-one with the circles from ''C'', except for the boundary circle of ''C'' which corresponds to the boundary of ''A''. This correspondence of circles can be used to construct a continuous function from ''A'' to ''C'' in which each circle and each gap between three circles is mapped from one packing to the other by a [[Möbius transformation]]. Thurston conjectured that, in the limit as the radius ''r'' approaches zero, the functions from ''A'' to ''C'' constructed in this way would approach the conformal function given by the Riemann mapping theorem.&lt;ref name="s99"/&gt;

Thurston's conjecture was proven by {{harvtxt|Rodin|Sullivan|1987}}. More precisely, they showed that, as ''n'' goes to infinity, the function ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' determined using Thurston's method from hexagonal packings of radius-1/''n'' circles converges uniformly on compact subsets of ''A'' to a conformal map from ''A'' to ''C''.&lt;ref name="s99"/&gt;

Despite the success of Thurston's conjecture, practical applications of this method have been hindered by the difficulty of computing circle packings and by its relatively slow convergence rate. However it has some advantages when applied to non-[[Simply connected space|simply-connected]] domains and in selecting initial approximations for numerical techniques that compute [[Schwarz–Christoffel mapping]]s, a different technique for conformal mapping of [[polygon]]al domains.&lt;ref name="s99"/&gt;

==Proofs==
There are many known proofs of the circle packing theorem. [[Paul Koebe]]'s original proof is
based on his conformal uniformization theorem saying that a finitely connected planar domain
is conformally equivalent to a circle domain. There are several different topological proofs
that are known. Thurston's proof is based on [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer's fixed point theorem]]. 
There is also a proof using a discrete variant of [[Perron's method]] of constructing solutions to the
[[Dirichlet problem]]. [[Yves Colin de Verdière]] proved&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Colin de Verdière|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the existence of the circle packing as a minimizer of a [[convex function]] on a certain configuration
space.

==Applications==
The circle packing theorem is a useful tool to study various problems in planar
geometry, conformal mappings and planar graphs. An elegant proof of the [[planar separator theorem]], 
originally due to Lipton and Tarjan,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lipton|Tarjan|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been obtained in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Miller|Teng|Thurston|Vavasis|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another application of the circle packing theorem is that unbiased limits of
bounded-degree planar graphs are almost surely recurrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Benjamini|Schramm|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other applications include implications for the [[cover time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jonnason|Schramm|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and estimates for the largest [[eigenvalue]] of bounded-[[genus]] graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kelner|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph drawing]], circle packing has been used to find drawings of planar graphs with bounded [[angular resolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Malitz|Papakostas|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and with bounded [[slope number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Keszegh|Pach|Pálvölgyi|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fáry's theorem]], that every graph that can be [[graph drawing|drawn]] without crossings in the plane using curved edges can also be drawn without crossings using straight [[line segment]] edges, follows as a simple corollary of the circle packing theorem: by placing vertices at the centers of the circles and drawing straight edges between them, a straight-line planar embedding is obtained.

[[File:Midsphere.png|thumb|A polyhedron and its midsphere. The circle packing theorem implies that every [[polyhedral graph]] can be represented as the graph of a polyhedron that has a midsphere.]]
A stronger form of the circle packing theorem asserts that any [[polyhedral graph]] and its [[dual graph]] can be represented by two circle packings, such that the two tangent circles representing a primal graph edge and the two tangent circles representing the dual of the same edge always have their tangencies at right angles to each other at the same point of the plane. A packing of this type can be used to construct a [[convex polyhedron]] that represents the given graph and that has a [[midsphere]], a sphere tangent to all of the edges of the [[polyhedron]]. Conversely, if a polyhedron has a midsphere, then the circles formed by the intersections of the sphere with the polyhedron faces and the circles formed by the horizons on the sphere as viewed from each [[polyhedron vertex]] form a dual packing of this type.

==Algorithmic aspects==
{{harvtxt|Collins|Stephenson|2003}} describe a numerical [[Relaxation (iterative method)|relaxation algorithm]] for finding circle packings, based on ideas of [[William Thurston]]. The version of the circle packing problem that they solve takes as input a planar graph, in which all the internal faces are triangles and for which the external vertices have been labeled by positive numbers. It produces as output a circle packing whose tangencies represent the given graph, and for which the circles representing the external vertices have the radii specified in the input. As they suggest, the key to the problem is to first calculate the radii of the circles in the packing; once the radii are known, the geometric positions of the circles are not difficult to calculate. They begin with a set of tentative radii that do not correspond to a valid packing, and then repeatedly perform the following steps:
#Choose an internal vertex ''v'' of the input graph.
#Calculate the total angle &amp;theta; that its ''k'' neighboring circles would cover around the circle for ''v'', if the neighbors were placed tangent to each other and to the central circle using their tentative radii.
#Determine a representative radius ''r'' for the neighboring circles, such that ''k'' circles of radius ''r'' would give the same covering angle &amp;theta; as the neighbors of ''v'' give.
#Set the new radius for ''v'' to be the value for which ''k'' circles of radius ''r'' would give a covering angle of exactly 2π.
Each of these steps may be performed with simple trigonometric calculations, and as Collins and Stephenson argue, the system of radii converges rapidly to a unique [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] for which all covering angles are exactly 2π. Once the system has converged, the circles may be placed one at a time, at each step using the positions and radii of two neighboring circles to determine the center of each successive circle.

{{harvtxt|Mohar|1993}} describes a similar iterative technique for finding simultaneous packings of a [[polyhedral graph]] and its dual, in which the dual circles are at right angles to the primal circles. He proves that the method takes time polynomial in the number of circles and in log&amp;nbsp;1/&amp;epsilon;, where &amp;epsilon; is a bound on the distance of the centers and radii of the computed packing from those in an optimal packing.

==Generalizations==
The circle packing theorem generalizes to graphs that are not planar.
If ''G'' is a graph that can be embedded on a surface ''S'',
then there is a constant [[curvature]] [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] ''d'' on ''S'' and a circle packing on (''S'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') whose contacts graph is isomorphic to ''G''.  If ''S'' is closed ([[Compact space|compact]] and without [[Manifold with boundary|boundary]])
and ''G'' is a triangulation of ''S'', then (''S'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') and the packing are unique up to conformal equivalence.  If ''S'' is the sphere, then this equivalence is up to Möbius transformations; if it is a torus, then the equivalence is up to scaling by a constant and isometries, while if ''S'' has [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] at least 2, then the equivalence is up to isometries.

Another generalization of the circle packing theorem involves replacing the condition of tangency with a specified intersection angle between circles corresponding to neighboring vertices. A particularly elegant version is as follows. Suppose that ''G'' is a finite [[connectivity (graph theory)|3-connected]] planar graph (that is, a [[polyhedral graph]]), then there is a pair of circle packings, one whose intersection graph is isomorphic to ''G'', another whose intersection graph is isomorphic to the [[dual graph|planar dual]] of ''G'',
and for every vertex in ''G'' and face adjacent to it, the circle in the first packing corresponding to the vertex
intersects orthogonally with the circle in the second packing corresponding to the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brightwell|Scheinerman|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, applying this result to the graph of the tetrahedron gives, for any four mutuall tangent circles, a second set of four mutually tangent circles each of which is orthogonal to three of the first four.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Yet another variety of generalizations allow shapes that are not circles.
Suppose that ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') is a finite planar graph, and to each vertex ''v'' of ''G''
corresponds a shape &lt;math&gt;K_v\subset\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]
to the closed unit disk and whose boundary is smooth.
Then there is a packing &lt;math&gt; P = (K'_v:v\in V)&lt;/math&gt; in the plane
such that &lt;math&gt;K'_v\cap K'_u\ne \varnothing&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;[v,u]\in E&lt;/math&gt;
and for each &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;K'_v&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;K_v&lt;/math&gt; by translating
and scaling. (Note that in the original circle packing theorem, there are three real parameters per vertex,
two of which describe the center of the corresponding circle and one of which describe the radius, and there is one equation per edge. This also holds in this generalization.)
One proof of this generalization can be obtained by applying Koebe's original proof&lt;ref name=koebe/&gt; and the theorem
of Brandt&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brandt|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harrington&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harrington|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that any finitely connected domain is conformally equivalent to
a planar domain whose boundary components have specified shapes, up to translations and scaling.

==History==

The circle packing theorem was first proved by [[Paul Koebe]].&lt;ref name=koebe&gt;{{harvtxt|Koebe|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Thurston]]&lt;ref name="thu"&gt;{{harvtxt|Thurston|1978–1981}}, Chap. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
rediscovered the circle packing theorem, and
noted that it followed from the work of [[E. M. Andreev]].  Thurston also proposed a scheme for using the circle packing theorem to obtain a homeomorphism of a simply connected proper subset of the plane onto the interior of the unit disk.  The ''Thurston Conjecture for Circle Packings'' is his conjecture that the homeomorphism will converge to the [[Riemann mapping theorem|Riemann mapping]] as the radii of the circles tend to zero.  The Thurston Conjecture was later proved
by [[Burton Rodin]] and [[Dennis Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rodin|Sullivan|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This led to a flurry of research on extensions of the circle packing theorem, relations to
conformal mappings, and applications.

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''complete Heyting algebra''' is a [[Heyting algebra]] that is [[completeness (order theory)|complete]] as a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. Complete Heyting algebras are the [[object (category theory)|objects]] of three different [[category (category theory)|categories]]; the category '''CHey''', the category '''Loc''' of locales, and its [[opposite (category theory)|opposite]], the category '''Frm''' of frames. Although these three categories contain the same  objects, they differ in their [[morphism]]s, and thus get distinct names. Only the morphisms of '''CHey''' are [[homomorphism]]s of complete Heyting algebras.

Locales and frames form the foundation of [[pointless topology]], which, instead of building on [[point-set topology]], recasts the ideas of [[general topology]] in categorical terms, as statements on frames and locales.

== Definition ==
Consider a [[partially ordered set]] (''P'', ≤) that is a [[complete lattice]]. Then ''P'' is a ''complete Heyting algebra'' if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
* ''P'' is a Heyting algebra, i.e. the operation {{nowrap|1=( ''x'' &amp;and; &amp;minus; )}} has a [[Adjoint functors|right adjoint]] (also called the lower adjoint of a (monotone) [[Galois connection]]), for each element ''x'' of ''P''.
* For all elements ''x'' of ''P'' and all subsets ''S'' of ''P'', the following infinite [[distributivity (order theory)|distributivity]] law holds:
: &lt;math&gt;x \wedge \bigvee_{s \in S} s = \bigvee_{s \in S} (x \wedge s).&lt;/math&gt;
* ''P'' is a distributive lattice, i.e., for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''P'', we have
: &lt;math&gt;x \wedge ( y \vee z ) = ( x \wedge y ) \vee ( x \wedge z )&lt;/math&gt;

: and the meet operations {{nowrap|1=( ''x'' &amp;and; &amp;minus; )}} are [[Scott continuous]] for all ''x'' in ''P'' (i.e., preserve the suprema of [[directed set]]s) .

==Examples==
The system of all open sets of a given [[topological space]] ordered by inclusion is a complete Heyting algebra.

== Frames and locales ==
The [[object (category theory)|objects]] of the category '''CHey''', the category '''Frm''' of frames and the category '''Loc''' of locales are the complete lattices satisfying the infinite distributive law. These categories differ in what constitutes a [[morphism]].

The morphisms of '''Frm''' are (necessarily [[monotonic|monotone]]) functions that [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserve]] finite meets and arbitrary joins. Such functions are not homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras.  The definition of Heyting algebras crucially involves the existence of right adjoints to the binary meet operation, which together define an additional [[implication operation]] ⇒. Thus, a ''homomorphism of complete Heyting algebras'' is a morphism of frames that in addition preserves implication. The morphisms of '''Loc''' are [[dual (category theory)|opposite]] to those of '''Frm''', and they are usually called maps (of locales).

The relation of locales and their maps to topological spaces and continuous functions may be seen as follows. Let
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
be any map. The [[power set]]s ''P''(''X'') and ''P''(''Y'') are [[complete Boolean algebra]]s, and the map
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon P(Y)\to P(X)&lt;/math&gt;
is a homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras. Suppose the spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[topological space]]s, endowed with the topology ''O''(''X'') and ''O''(''Y'') of [[open set]]s on ''X'' and ''Y''. Note that ''O''(''X'') and ''O''(''Y'') are subframes of ''P''(''X'') and ''P''(''Y''). If ''ƒ'' is a continuous function, then
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon O(Y)\to O(X)&lt;/math&gt;
preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins of these subframes.  This shows that ''O'' is a [[functor]] from the category '''Top''' of topological spaces to the category '''Loc''' of locales, taking any continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
to the map
: &lt;math&gt;O(f)\colon O(X)\to O(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''' that is defined in '''Frm''' to be the inverse image frame homomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon O(Y)\to O(X).&lt;/math&gt;
It is common, given a map of locales
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''', to write
: &lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon B\to A&lt;/math&gt;
for the frame homomorphism that defines it in '''Frm'''. Hence, using this notation, ''O''(''ƒ'') is defined by the equation {{nowrap|1=''O''(''&amp;fnof;'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

Conversely, any locale ''A'' has a topological space ''S''(''A'') that best approximates the locale, called its ''spectrum''. In addition, any map of locales
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt;
determines a continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;S(A)\to S(B),&lt;/math&gt;
and this assignment is functorial: letting ''P''(1) denote the locale that is obtained as the powerset of the terminal set {{nowrap|1=1 = { * },}} the points of ''S''(''A'') are the maps
: &lt;math&gt;p\colon P(1)\to A&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''', i.e., the frame homomorphisms
: &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon A\to P(1).&lt;/math&gt;
For each {{nowrap|1=''a'' &amp;isin; ''A''}} we define the set {{nowrap|1=''U&lt;sub&gt;a''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sube; ''S''(''A'')}} that consists of the points {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''S''(''A'')}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p''*(''a'') = { * }.}} It is easy to verify that this defines a frame homomorphism {{nowrap|1=''A'' &amp;rarr; ''P''(''S''(''A'')),}} whose image is therefore a topology on ''S''(''A''). Then, if
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is a map of locales,
to each point {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''S''(''A'')}} we assign the point ''S''(''ƒ'')(''q'') defined by letting ''S''(''ƒ'')(p)* be the composition of ''p''* with ''ƒ''*, hence obtaining a continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;S(f)\colon S(A)\to S(B).&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; from '''Loc''' to '''Top''', which is right adjoint to ''O''.

Any locale that is isomorphic to the topology of its spectrum is called ''spatial'', and any topological space that is homeomorphic to the spectrum of its locale of open sets is called ''sober''. The adjunction between topological spaces and locales restricts to an [[equivalence of categories]] between sober spaces and spatial locales.

Any function that preserves all joins (and hence any frame homomorphism) has a right adjoint, and, conversely, any function that preserves all meets has a left adjoint. Hence, the category '''Loc''' is isomorphic to the category whose objects are the frames and whose morphisms are the meet preserving functions whose left adjoints preserve finite meets. This is often regarded as a representation of '''Loc''', but it should not be confused with '''Loc''' itself, whose morphisms are formally the same as frame homomorphisms in the opposite direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7544">In [[mathematics]], '''contour sets''' [[Generalization|generalize]] and [[Formal system|formalize]] the everyday notions of
*everything superior to something
*everything superior or equivalent to something
*everything inferior to something
*everything inferior or equivalent to something.

== Formal definitions ==
Given a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] on pairs of [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s of [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq~\subseteq~X^2&lt;/math&gt;
and an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;

The '''upper contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''lower contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to them:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''strict upper contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; being ''in this way'' related to any of them:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~(y\succcurlyeq x)\land\lnot(x\succcurlyeq y)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''strict lower contour set''' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to them without any of them being ''in this way'' related to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~(x\succcurlyeq y)\land\lnot(y\succcurlyeq x)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The formal expressions of the last two may be simplified if we have defined
:&lt;math&gt;\succ~=~\left\{ \left(a,b\right)~\backepsilon~\left(a\succcurlyeq b\right)\land\lnot(b\succcurlyeq a)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
so that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' related to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the strict upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the strict lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Contour sets of a function ===
In the case of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; considered in terms of relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleright&lt;/math&gt;, reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the implied relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\triangleright f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Arithmetic ===
Consider a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the relation [[Inequality (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;]].  Then
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''greater than or equal'' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''greater'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''less than or equal'' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of numbers that were ''less'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider, more generally, the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\ge f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
Then
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(y)\ge f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(y)&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

It would be ''technically'' possible to define contour sets in terms of the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\le f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
though such definitions would tend to confound ready understanding.

In the case of a real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; (whose arguments might or might not be themselves real numbers), reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(a\succcurlyeq b)~\Leftarrow~[f(a)\ge f(b)]&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the arguments to &lt;math&gt;f()&lt;/math&gt; might be [[Tuple|vector]]s, and that the [[Mathematical notation|notation]] used might instead be
:&lt;math&gt;[(a_1 ,a_2 ,\ldots)\succcurlyeq(b_1 ,b_2 ,\ldots)]~\Leftarrow~[f(a_1 ,a_2 ,\ldots)\ge f(b_1 ,b_2 ,\ldots)]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Economic ===
In [[economics]], the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; could be interpreted as a set of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods and services]] or of possible [[Outcome (game theory)|outcomes]], the relation &lt;math&gt;\succ&lt;/math&gt; as ''strict [[preference]]'', and the relationship &lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq&lt;/math&gt; as ''weak preference''.  Then
* the upper contour set, or '''better set''',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Economic Exchange and Social Organization: The Edgeworthian Foundations of General Equilibrium Theory|last = Robert P. Gilles|first = |publisher = Springer|year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = 35|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyahaTvMB3cC&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;ots=4CelGh9izH&amp;dq=%22better%20set%22%20economics&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22better%20set%22%20}}&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''at least as desired'' as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''more desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set, or '''worse set''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''no more desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were ''less desired'' than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Such preferences might be captured by a [[utility]] function &lt;math&gt;u()&lt;/math&gt;, in which case
* the upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(y)\ge u(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the ''strict'' upper contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(y)&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* the lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x)\ge u(y)&lt;/math&gt;, and
* the ''strict'' lower contour set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(x)&gt;u(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Complementarity ==
On the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\succcurlyeq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[total order]]ing of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the upper contour set is the strict lower contour set.
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succ y\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succcurlyeq x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

and the complement of the strict upper contour set is the lower contour set.
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^2\backslash\left\{ y~\backepsilon~x\succcurlyeq y\right\}=\left\{ y~\backepsilon~y\succ x\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

{{redirect|Convergence (mathematics)||Convergence (disambiguation)}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[series (mathematics)|series]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the terms of an [[infinite sequence]] of numbers.

Given an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;\left ( a_1,\ a_2,\ a_3,\dots \right )&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n''th [[partial sum]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the first ''n'' terms of the sequence, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k.&lt;/math&gt;

A series is '''convergent''' if the sequence of its partial sums &lt;math&gt;\left \{ S_1,\ S_2,\ S_3,\dots \right \}&lt;/math&gt; tends to a [[limit of a sequence|limit]]; that means that the partial sums become closer and closer to a given number when the number of their terms increases. More precisely, a series converges, if there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; such that for any arbitrarily small positive number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there is a (sufficiently large) [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge \ N&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\left | S_n - \ell \right \vert \le \ \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
If the series is convergent, the number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; (necessarily unique) is called the '''sum of the series'''.

Any series that is not convergent is said to be [[Divergent series|divergent]].

== Examples of convergent and divergent series ==

* The reciprocals of the [[natural number|positive integers]] produce a [[divergent series]] ([[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]):
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}+{1 \over 2}+{1 \over 3}+{1 \over 4}+{1 \over 5}+{1 \over 6}+\cdots \rightarrow \infty. &lt;/math&gt;
* Alternating the signs of the reciprocals of positive integers produces a convergent series:
*: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 1} -{1\over 2} + {1\over 3} - {1\over 4} + {1\over 5} \cdots = \ln(2)&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[prime number]]s produce a [[divergent series]] (so the set of primes is "[[Small set (combinatorics)|large]]"):
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2}+{1 \over 3}+{1 \over 5}+{1 \over 7}+{1 \over 11}+{1 \over 13}+\cdots \rightarrow \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[triangular number]]s produce a convergent series:
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}+{1 \over 3}+{1 \over 6}+{1 \over 10}+{1 \over 15}+{1 \over 21}+\cdots = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[factorial]]s produce a convergent series (see [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]):
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24}  + \frac{1}{120} + \cdots = e.&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[square number]]s produce a convergent series (the [[Basel problem]]):
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}+{1 \over 4}+{1 \over 9}+{1 \over 16}+{1 \over 25}+{1 \over 36}+\cdots = {\pi^2 \over 6}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[power of two|powers of 2]] produce a convergent series (so the set of powers of 2 is "[[Small set (combinatorics)|small]]"):
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}+{1 \over 2}+{1 \over 4}+{1 \over 8}+{1 \over 16}+{1 \over 32}+\cdots = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[geometric series|powers of any n&gt;1]] produce a convergent series:
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}+{1 \over n}+{1 \over n^2}+{1 \over n^3}+{1 \over n^4}+{1 \over n^5}+\cdots = {n\over n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Alternating the signs of reciprocals of [[power of two|powers of 2]] also produces a convergent series:
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}-{1 \over 2}+{1 \over 4}-{1 \over 8}+{1 \over 16}-{1 \over 32}+\cdots = {2\over3}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Alternating the signs of reciprocals of powers of any n&gt;1 produces a convergent series:
*: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1}-{1 \over n}+{1 \over n^2}-{1 \over n^3}+{1 \over n^4}-{1 \over n^5}+\cdots = {n\over n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The reciprocals of [[Fibonacci number]]s produce a convergent series (see [[reciprocal Fibonacci constant|ψ]]):
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1} +  \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots = \psi.&lt;/math&gt;

== Convergence tests ==
{{main|Convergence tests}}

There are a number of methods of determining whether a series converges or [[divergent series|diverges]].
[[Image:Comparison test series.svg|thumb|250px|right|If the blue series, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma b_n&lt;/math&gt;, can be proven to converge, then the smaller series, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma a_n&lt;/math&gt; must converge. By contraposition, if the red series &lt;math&gt;\Sigma a_n&lt;/math&gt; is proven to diverge, then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma b_n&lt;/math&gt; must also diverge.]]
'''[[Direct comparison test|Comparison test]]'''. The terms of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a_n \right \}&lt;/math&gt; are compared to those of another sequence &lt;math&gt;\left \{ b_n \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.  If,

for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;0 \le \ a_n \le \ b_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, then so does &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

However, if,

for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;0 \le \ b_n \le \ a_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges, then so does &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Ratio test]]'''. Assume that for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;a_n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose that there exists &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|{\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}}\right| = r.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''r'' &lt; 1, then the series converges.  If {{nowrap|''r'' &gt; 1,}} then the series diverges.  If {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 1,}} the ratio test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.

'''[[Root test]]''' or ''' ''n''th root test'''. Suppose that the terms of the sequence in question are [[non-negative]].  Define ''r'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;r = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_n|},&lt;/math&gt;

:where "lim sup" denotes the [[limit superior]] (possibly ∞; if the limit exists it is the same value).

If ''r'' &lt; 1, then the series converges.  If {{nowrap|''r'' &gt; 1,}} then the series diverges.  If {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 1,}} the root test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.

The ratio test and the root test are both based on comparison with a geometric series, and as such they work in similar situations.  In fact, if the ratio test works (meaning that the limit exists and is not equal to 1) then so does the root test; the converse, however, is not true.  The root test is therefore more generally applicable, but as a practical matter the limit is often difficult to compute for commonly seen types of series.

'''[[Integral test for convergence|Integral test]]'''. The series can be compared to an integral to establish convergence or divergence.  Let &lt;math&gt;f(n) = a_n&lt;/math&gt; be a positive and [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing function]].  If

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x)\, dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} f(x)\, dx &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

then the series converges.  But if the integral diverges, then the series does so as well.

'''[[Limit comparison test]]'''. If &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a_n \right \}, \left \{ b_n \right \} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is not zero, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.

'''[[Alternating series test]]'''. Also known as the ''Leibniz criterion'', the [[alternating series test]] states that for an [[alternating series]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a_n \right \}&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically [[decreasing]], and has a limit of 0 at infinity, then the series converges.

'''[[Cauchy condensation test]]'''. If &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a_n \right \}&lt;/math&gt; is a positive monotone decreasing sequence, then
&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n &lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k a_{2^{k}} &lt;/math&gt; converges.

'''[[Dirichlet's test]]'''

'''[[Abel's test]]'''

'''[[Raabe's test]]'''

== Conditional and absolute convergence ==

[[Image:ExpConvergence.gif|thumb|right|Illustration of the absolute convergence of the power series of Exp[''z''] around 0 evaluated at {{nowrap|1=''z'' = Exp[{{frac|i|3}}]}}. The length of the line is finite.]]

[[Image:LogConvergenceAnim.gif|thumb|right|Illustration of the conditional convergence of the power series of log(''z''+1) around 0 evaluated at {{nowrap|1=''z'' = exp((&amp;pi;&amp;minus;{{frac|1|3}})''i'').}} The length of the line is infinite.]]

For any sequence &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a_1,\ a_2,\ a_3,\dots \right \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_n \le \ \left | a_n \right \vert&lt;/math&gt; for all n.  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \le \ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left | a_n \right \vert.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left | a_n \right \vert&lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; also converges (but not vice versa).

If the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left | a_n \right \vert&lt;/math&gt; converges, then the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[absolutely convergent]]. An absolutely convergent sequence is one in which the length of the line created by joining together all of the increments to the partial sum is finitely long. The power series of the [[exponential function]] is absolutely convergent everywhere.

If the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges but the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left | a_n \right \vert&lt;/math&gt; diverges, then the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[conditionally convergent]]. The path formed by connecting the partial sums of a conditionally convergent series is infinitely long. The power series of the [[logarithm]] is conditionally convergent.

The [[Riemann series theorem]] states that if a series converges conditionally, it is possible to rearrange the terms of the series in such a way that the series converges to any value, or even diverges.

== Uniform convergence ==

{{Main|uniform convergence}}

Let &lt;math&gt;\left \{ f_1,\ f_2,\ f_3,\dots \right \}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of functions.  
The series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n&lt;/math&gt; is said to converge uniformly to ''f''
if the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{s_n\}&lt;/math&gt; of partial sums defined by

: &lt;math&gt; s_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n f_k (x)&lt;/math&gt;

converges uniformly to ''f''.

There is an analogue of the comparison test for infinite series of functions called the [[Weierstrass M-test]].

== Cauchy convergence criterion ==

The '''[[Cauchy's convergence test|Cauchy convergence criterion]]''' states that a series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;
converges [[if and only if]] the sequence of [[partial sum]]s is a [[Cauchy sequence]].
This means that for every &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0, &lt;/math&gt; there is a positive integer &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq m \geq N&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt; \left| \sum_{k=m}^n a_k \right| &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty \atop m\to \infty} \sum_{k=n}^{n+m} a_k = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Conway's puzzle''', or '''Blocks-in-a-Box''', is a [[packing problem]] using rectangular blocks, named after its inventor, mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. It calls for packing thirteen 1 × 2 × 4 blocks, one 2 × 2 × 2 block, one 1 × 2 × 2 block, and three 1 × 1 × 3 blocks into a 5 × 5 × 5 box.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=ConwayPuzzle | title=Conway Puzzle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
[[Image:Conway puzzle partial solution.png|thumb|A possible placement for the three 1×1×3 blocks. The vertical block has corners touching corners of the two horizontal blocks.]]
The solution of the Conway puzzle is straightforward once one realizes, based on [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] considerations, that the three 1 × 1 × 3 blocks need to be placed so that precisely one of them appears in each 5 × 5 × 1 slice of the cube.&lt;ref&gt;Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy: winning ways for your mathematical plays, 2nd ed, vol. 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to similar insight that facilitates the solution of the simpler [[Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle]].

'''Counting''' is the process of determining the number of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of a [[finite set]] of objects. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term ''[[enumeration]]'' refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a [[Finite set|finite]] (combinatorial) [[Set (mathematics)|set]] or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.

[[File:Hanakapiai Beach Warning Sign Only.jpg|thumb|right|Counting using [[tally marks]] at [[Hanakapiai Beach]]]]
Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, "counting by twos" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,&amp;nbsp;...), or "counting by fives" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25,&amp;nbsp;...).

There is archaeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least 50,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'' (6th Edition) by [[Howard Eves]] (1990) p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as number of group members, prey animals, property, or debts  (i.e., [[accountancy]]). Notched bones were also found in the Border Caves in South Africa that may suggest that the concept of counting was known to humans as far back as 44,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mathtimeline.weebly.com/early-human-counting-tools.html|title=Early Human Counting Tools|website=Math Timeline|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of counting led to the development of [[mathematical notation]], [[numeral system]]s, and [[writing]].

==Forms of counting==
{{further|Prehistoric numerals|Numerical digit}}
Counting can occur in a variety of forms.

Counting can be verbal; that is, speaking every number out loud (or mentally) to keep track of progress. This is often used to count objects that are present already, instead of counting a variety of things over time.

Counting can also be in the form of [[tally marks]], making a mark for each number and then counting all of the marks when done tallying. This is useful when counting objects over time, such as the number of times something occurs during the course of a day. Tallying is base&amp;nbsp;1 counting; normal counting is done in base&amp;nbsp;10. Computers use [[base&amp;nbsp;2]] counting (0's and 1's).

Counting can also be in the form of [[finger counting]], especially when counting small numbers. This is often used by children to facilitate counting and simple mathematical operations.&lt;!--Um, are you kidding? Your sentence above contains circular logic: "Counting is often used ... to facilitate counting..."--&gt; Finger-counting uses unary notation (one finger&amp;nbsp;= one unit), and is thus limited to counting 10 (unless you start in with your toes). Older finger counting used the four fingers and the three bones in each finger ([[phalanges]]) to count to the number twelve.&lt;ref name=Macey&gt;{{cite book |last=Macey |first=Samuel L. |title=The Dynamics of Progress: Time, Method, and Measure |year=1989 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn=978-0-8203-3796-8 |pages=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlzCWmXguwsC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hand-gesture systems are also in use, for example the Chinese system by which one can count to 10 using only gestures of one hand. By using [[finger binary]] (base&amp;nbsp;2 counting), it is possible to keep a finger count up to {{nowrap|1=1023 = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.

Various devices can also be used to facilitate counting, such as hand tally counters and abacuses.

==Inclusive counting==
Inclusive counting is usually encountered when dealing with time in the Romance languages.&lt;ref&gt;James Evans, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVp_gkwyvC8C&amp;ots=NQoROMsMKS&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'']. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{isbn|019987445X}}. Chapter 4, page 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In exclusive counting languages such as English, when counting "8" days [[Seven-day week#Week numbering|from Sunday]], Monday will be ''day 1'', Tuesday ''day 2'', and the following Monday will be the ''eighth day''. When counting "inclusively," the Sunday (the start day) will be ''day 1'' and therefore the following Sunday will be the ''eighth day''. For example, the French phrase for "fortnight" is ''quinzaine'' (15&amp;nbsp;[days]), and similar words are present in Greek (δεκαπενθήμερο, ''dekapenthímero''), Spanish (''quincena'') and Portuguese (''quinzena''). In contrast, the English word "fortnight" itself derives from "a fourteen-night", as the archaic "[[wikt:sennight|sennight]]" does from "a seven-night"; the English words are not examples of inclusive counting.

Names based on inclusive counting appear in other calendars as well: in the Roman calendar the ''nones'' (meaning "nine") is 8 days before the ''ides''; and in the Christian calendar [[Quinquagesima]] (meaning 50) is 49&amp;nbsp;days before Easter Sunday.

Musical terminology also uses inclusive counting of [[interval (music)|intervals]] between notes of the standard scale: going up one note is a second interval, going up two notes is a third interval, etc., and going up seven notes is an ''[[octave]]''.

==Education and development==
{{Main|Pre-math skills}}
Learning to count is an important educational/developmental milestone in most cultures of the world. Learning to count is a child's very first step into mathematics, and constitutes the most fundamental idea of that discipline. However, some cultures in Amazonia and the Australian Outback do not count,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Butterworth|Butterworth, B.]], Reeve, R., Reynolds, F., &amp; Lloyd, D. (2008). Numerical thought with and without words: Evidence from indigenous Australian children. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105(35), 13179–13184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, P. (2004). Numerical cognition without words: Evidence from Amazonia. Science, 306, 496–499.&lt;/ref&gt; and their languages do not have number words.

Many children at just 2 years of age have some skill in reciting the count list (i.e., saying "one, two, three,&amp;nbsp;..."). They can also answer questions of ordinality for small numbers, e.g., "What comes after ''three''?". They can even be skilled at pointing to each object in a set and reciting the words one after another. This leads many parents and educators to the conclusion that the child knows how to use counting to determine the size of a set.&lt;ref&gt;Fuson, K.C. (1988). Children's counting and concepts of number. New York: Springer–Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that it takes about a year after learning these skills for a child to understand what they mean and why the procedures are performed.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corre, M., &amp; Carey, S. (2007). One, two, three, four, nothing more: An investigation of the conceptual sources of the verbal counting principles. Cognition, 105, 395–438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Corre, M., Van de Walle, G., Brannon, E. M., Carey, S. (2006). Re-visiting the competence/performance debate in the acquisition of the counting principles. Cognitive Psychology, 52(2), 130–169.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, children learn how to name cardinalities that they can [[subitize]].

==Counting in mathematics==
In mathematics, the essence of counting a set and finding a result ''n'', is that it establishes a [[one-to-one correspondence]] (or bijection) of the set with the set of numbers {1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''n''}. A fundamental fact, which can be proved by [[mathematical induction]], is that no bijection can exist between {1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''n''} and {1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''m''} unless {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''m''}}; this fact (together with the fact that two bijections can be [[function composition|composed]] to give another bijection) ensures that counting the same set in different ways can never result in different numbers (unless an error is made). This is the fundamental mathematical theorem that gives counting its purpose; however you count a (finite) set, the answer is the same. In a broader context, the theorem is an example of a theorem in the mathematical field of (finite) [[combinatorics]]—hence (finite) combinatorics is sometimes referred to as "the mathematics of counting."

Many sets that arise in mathematics do not allow a bijection to be established with {1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''n''} for ''any'' [[natural number]] ''n''; these are called [[infinite set]]s, while those sets for which such a bijection does exist (for some ''n'') are called [[finite set]]s. Infinite sets cannot be counted in the usual sense; for one thing, the mathematical theorems which underlie this usual sense for finite sets are false for infinite sets. Furthermore, different definitions of the concepts in terms of which these theorems are stated, while equivalent for finite sets, are inequivalent in the context of infinite sets.

The notion of counting may be extended to them in the sense of establishing (the existence of) a bijection with some well-understood set. For instance, if a set can be brought into bijection with the set of all natural numbers, then it is called "[[countably infinite]]." This kind of counting differs in a fundamental way from counting of finite sets, in that adding new elements to a set does not necessarily increase its size, because the possibility of a bijection with the original set is not excluded. For instance, the set of all [[integer]]s (including negative numbers) can be brought into bijection with the set of natural numbers, and even seemingly much larger sets like that of all finite sequences of rational numbers are still (only) countably infinite. Nevertheless, there are sets, such as the set of [[real number]]s, that can be shown to be "too large" to admit a bijection with the natural numbers, and these sets are called "[[uncountable set|uncountable]]." Sets for which there exists a bijection between them are said to have the same [[cardinality]], and in the most general sense counting a set can be taken to mean determining its cardinality. Beyond the cardinalities given by each of the natural numbers, there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite cardinalities, although only very few such cardinalities occur in ordinary mathematics (that is, outside [[set theory]] that explicitly studies possible cardinalities).

Counting, mostly of finite sets, has various applications in mathematics. One important principle is that if two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same finite number of elements, and a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is known to be [[injective]], then it is also [[surjective]], and vice versa. A related fact is known as the [[pigeonhole principle]], which states that if two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' have finite numbers of elements ''n'' and ''m'' with {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}, then any map {{nowrap|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is ''not'' injective (so there exist two distinct elements of ''X'' that ''f'' sends to the same element of ''Y''); this follows from the former principle, since if ''f'' were injective, then so would its [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] to a strict subset ''S'' of ''X'' with ''m'' elements, which restriction would then be surjective, contradicting the fact that for ''x'' in ''X'' outside ''S'', ''f''(''x'') cannot be in the image of the restriction. Similar counting arguments can prove the existence of certain objects without explicitly providing an example. In the case of infinite sets this can even apply in situations where it is impossible to give an example.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The domain of [[enumerative combinatorics]] deals with computing the number of elements of finite sets, without actually counting them; the latter usually being impossible because infinite families of finite sets are considered at once, such as the set of [[permutation]]s of {1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''n''} for any natural number ''n''.

'''Euler–Boole summation''' is a [[summation method]] for [[alternating series]] based on [[Euler's polynomials]], which are defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2e^{xt}}{e^t+1}=\sum_{n=0} E_n(x)\frac{t^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The concept is named after [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[George Boole]].

The periodic Euler functions are

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde E_n(x+1)=-\tilde E_n(x)\text{ and } \tilde E_n(x)=E_n(x)\text{ for } 0&lt;x&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

The Euler–Boole formula to sum alternating series is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \sum_{j=a}^{n-1}(-1)^j f(j+h) \\
= {} &amp; \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{E_k(h)}{k!} \left((-1)^{n-1} f^{(k)}(n)+(-1)^a f^{(k)}(a)\right) \\
&amp; {} + \frac 1 {(m-1)!} \int_a^n f^{(m)}(x)\tilde E_{m-1}(h-x) \, dx,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a,m,n\in\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; h\in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th derivative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4477">[[File:Budan Boislaurent.png|thumb|Frontpage of ''Nouvelle Méthode pour la Résolution des Équations Numériques'' (1st ed. 1807)]]
'''Ferdinand François Désiré Budan de Boislaurent''' (28 September 1761 – 6 October 1840) was a [[France|French]] amateur [[mathematician]], best known for a tract, ''Nouvelle méthode pour la résolution des équations numériques'',
first published in Paris in 1807, but based on work from 1803.

Budan was born in Limonade, Cap-Français, [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Haiti]]) on 28 September 1761. His early education was at [[Juilly, Seine-et-Marne|Juilly, France]]. He then proceeded to [[Paris]] where he studied medicine, receiving a doctorate for a thesis entitled ''Essai sur cette question d'économie médicale : Convient-il qu'un malade soit instruit de sa situation?'' Budan died in [[Paris]] on 6 October 1840.

Budan explains in his book how, given a monic polynomial p(x), the coefficients of p(x+1) can be obtained by developing a ''Pascal-like triangle'' with first row the coefficients of p(x), rather than by expanding successive powers of x+1, as in [[Pascal's triangle]] proper, and then summing; thus, the method has the flavour of [[lattice path]] combinatorics. Taken together with Descartes' [[Descartes' rule of signs|''Rule of Signs'']], this leads to an upper bound on the number of the real roots a polynomial has inside an open interval. Although [[Budan's Theorem]], as this result was known, was taken up by, among others, [[:fr:Louis Bourdon|Pierre Louis Marie Bourdon]] (1779-1854), in his celebrated algebra textbook, it tended to be eclipsed by an equivalent result due to [[Joseph Fourier]], as the consequence of a priority dispute. Interest in [[Budan's theorem]] has been revived because some further computational results are more easily deducible from it than from Fourier's version of the theorem.

Budan's book was read across the [[English Channel]]; for example, [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] includes mention of it in his entry on [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Approximation1814Barlow.pdf ''Approximation''] in his ''Dictionary'' (1814), although grouping it with the method of [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] as being accurate, but of more theoretical interest than practical use. Budan's work on approximation was studied by [[William George Horner|Horner]] in preparing his celebrated article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1819 that gave rise to the term [[Horner's method]]; Horner comments there and elsewhere on Budan's results, at first being sceptical of the value of Budan's work, but later warming to it. Thus, these writers in English have a different appreciation of Budan's work to a French writer, such as Bourdon; indeed, Horner was praised over Budan for being able to go directly from p(x) to p(x+a) for any a, rather than taking this in steps after the manner of Budan. Barlow and Horner show some awareness of the work of another writer in French, [[:fr:Louis-Benjamin Francœur|Louis-Benjamin Francoeur]] (1773-1849), who also looked at how to obtain the coefficients of p(x+a) from those of p(x) along the lines of Budan and Horner about the same time as Horner first published his work. But Budan's name and theorem only appear in late editions of Francoeur's book.

Budan, in common with other writers in French of the period working on root extraction, does not mention [[Paolo Ruffini]], notwithstanding Ruffini had been in correspondence with Lagrange; this was not just an English failing. Ruffini's work on the topic dates, in the first instance, from 1804, but, as with Budan and then Horner, several subsequent reworkings.

'''Friedrich Karl Schmidt''' (22 September 1901 – 25 January 1977) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], who made notable contributions to [[algebra]] and [[number theory]].

Schmidt studied from 1920 to 1925 in Freiburg and Marburg. In 1925 he completed his doctorate at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg]] under the direction of [[Alfred Loewy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=19950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 he became a ''Privatdozent'' (lecturer) at the [[University of Erlangen]], where he received his [[habilitation]] and in 1933 became a professor extraordinarius. In 1933/34 he was a ''Dozent'' at the [[University of Göttingen]], where he worked with [[Helmut Hasse]]. Schmidt was then a professor ordinarius at the [[University of Jena]] from 1934 to 1945. During WW II, he was at the ''Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Segelflug''  (German Research Station for Gliding) in [[Reichenhall]]. He was a professor from 1946 to 1952 at [[Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität|Westfälischen Wilhelms-Universität]] in Münster and from 1952 to 1966 at the [[University of  Heidelberg]], where he retired as professor emeritus.

(Werner from Jena).]]
In the mid-1930s Schmidt was on the editorial staff of {{ill|Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften|de}}.

Schmidt was elected in 1954 a member of the [[Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften]]&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Dörflinger: [http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/16931 Mathematik in der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften]. 2014, pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt; and was made in 1968 an honorary doctor of the [[Free University of Berlin]].

Schmidt is known for his contributions to the theory of algebraic function fields and in particular for his definitiohn of a [[zeta function]] for [[algebraic function field]]s and his proof of the  generalized [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] for algebraic function fields (where the base field can be an arbitrary [[perfect field]]). He also made contributions to [[class field theory]] and [[valuation theory]].

{{blockquote|The analogy between number fields and function fields has been realized since the latter part of the 19th century. Kronecker was already in some sense aware of some of its aspects. Dedekind originated a terminology in his study of number fields which he and Weber applied to function fields in one variable [Ded-W 1882]. Hensel-Landsberg then provided a first systematic book treatment of basic facts concerning these function fields [Hen-L 1902], using the Dedekind–Weber approach. Artin in his thesis [Art 1921] translated the Riemann hypothesis to the function field analogue (actually for quadratic fields). Several years later F. K. Schmidt treated general analytic number theory including the functional equation of the zeta function for function fields of arbitrary genus [Schm 1931].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lang, Serge|authorlink=Serge Lang|year=2000|publisher=Springer|title=Collected Papers IV: 1990–1996|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjxhoZgOXa0C&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], a '''generic filter''' is a kind of object used in the theory of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], a technique used for many purposes, but especially to establish the [[independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] of certain propositions from certain formal theories, such as [[ZFC]]. For example, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] used the method to establish that ZFC, if consistent, cannot prove the [[continuum hypothesis]], which states that there are exactly [[aleph-one]] [[real number]]s. In the contemporary re-interpretation of Cohen's proof, it proceeds by constructing a generic filter that codes more than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; reals, without changing the value of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, let ''P'' be a [[partially ordered set]], and let ''F'' be a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] on ''P''; that is, ''F'' is a subset of ''P'' such that:
#''F'' is nonempty
#If ''p'',''q''&amp;isin;''P'' and ''p''&amp;le;''q'' and ''p'' is an element of ''F'', then ''q'' is an element of ''F'' (''F'' is [[upper set|closed upward]])
#If ''p'' and ''q'' are elements of ''F'', then there is an element ''r'' of ''F'' such that ''r''&amp;le;''p'' and ''r''&amp;le;''q'' (''F'' is [[directed set|downward directed]])

Now if ''D'' is a collection of [[dense set|dense]] [[open set|open]] subsets of ''P'', in the topology whose basic open sets are all sets of the form {''q''|''q''&amp;le;''p''} for particular ''p'' in ''P'', then ''F'' is said to be '''''D''-generic''' if ''F'' meets all sets in ''D''; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;F\cap E \ne \varnothing,\,&lt;/math&gt; for all E &amp;isin; D.

Similarly, if ''M'' is a [[transitive set|transitive]] [[model theory|model]] of ZFC (or some sufficient fragment thereof), with ''P'' an element of ''M'', then ''F'' is said to be '''''M''-generic''', or sometimes '''generic over ''M''''', if ''F'' meets all dense open subsets of ''P'' that are elements of ''M''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="113711">As a branch of [[mathematics]], [[algebra]] emerged at the end of the 16th century in Europe, with the work of [[François Viète]]. Algebra can essentially be considered as doing computations similar to those of [[arithmetic]] but with non-numerical mathematical objects. However, until the 19th century, algebra consisted essentially of the [[theory of equations]]. For example, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] belongs to the theory of equations and is not, nowadays, considered as belonging to algebra (in fact, every proof must use the [[completeness of the real numbers]], which is not an algebraic property).

This article describes the history of the theory of equations, called here "algebra", from the origins to the emergence of algebra as a separate area of mathematics.

==Etymology==
The word "algebra" is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word الجبر ''al-jabr'', and this comes from the treatise written in the year 830 by the medieval Persian mathematician, [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], whose Arabic title, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala]]'', can be translated as ''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing''. The treatise provided for the systematic solution of [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s. According to one history, "[i]t is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the previous translation. The word 'al-jabr' presumably meant something like 'restoration' or 'completion' and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word 'muqabalah' is said to refer to 'reduction' or 'balancing'—that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. Arabic influence in Spain long after the time of al-Khwarizmi is found in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', where the word 'algebrista' is used for a bone-setter, that is, a 'restorer'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Boyer|1991|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used by al-Khwarizmi to describe the operations that he introduced, "[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey A. Oaks, Haitham M. Alkhateeb, ''Simplifying equations in Arabic algebra'', Historia Mathematica, '''34''' (2007), 45-61, {{issn|0315-0860}}, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hm.2006.02.006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of algebra==
{{See also|Timeline of algebra}}

===Algebraic expression===
Algebra did not always make use of the symbolism that is now ubiquitous in mathematics; instead, it went through three distinct stages. The stages in the development of symbolic algebra are approximately as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p.180}} "It has been said that three stages of in the historical development of algebra can be recognized: (1) the rhetorical or early stage, in which everything is written out fully in words; (2) a syncopated or intermediate state, in which some abbreviations are adopted; and (3) a symbolic or final stage. Such an arbitrary division of the development of algebra into three stages is, of course, a facile oversimplification; but it can serve effectively as a first approximation to what has happened""&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rhetorical algebra''', in which equations are written in full sentences. For example, the rhetorical form of ''x'' + 1 = 2 is "The thing plus one equals two" or possibly "The thing plus 1 equals 2". Rhetorical algebra was first developed by the ancient [[Babylonians]] and remained dominant up to the 16th century.
* '''Syncopated algebra''', in which some symbolism is used, but which does not contain all of the characteristics of symbolic algebra. For instance, there may be a restriction that subtraction may be used only once within one side of an equation, which is not the case with symbolic algebra. Syncopated algebraic expression first appeared in [[Diophantus]]' ''[[Arithmetica]]'' (3rd century AD), followed by [[Brahmagupta]]'s ''[[Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta]]'' (7th century).
* '''Symbolic algebra''', in which full symbolism is used. Early steps toward this can be seen in the work of several [[Islamic mathematics|Islamic mathematicians]] such as [[Ibn al-Banna al-Marrakushi|Ibn al-Banna]] (13th-14th centuries) and [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī|al-Qalasadi]] (15th century), although fully symbolic algebra was developed by [[François Viète]] (16th century). Later, [[René Descartes]] (17th century) introduced the modern notation (for example, the use of ''x''—[[#The symbol x|see below]]) and showed that the problems occurring in geometry can be expressed and solved in terms of algebra ([[Cartesian geometry]]).

Equally important as the use or lack of symbolism in algebra was the degree of the equations that were addressed. [[Quadratic equations]] played an important role in early algebra; and throughout most of history, until the early modern period, all quadratic equations were classified as belonging to one of three categories.
* &lt;math&gt;x^2 + px = q&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^2 = px + q&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^2 + q = px&lt;/math&gt;
where p and q are positive.
This trichotomy comes about because quadratic equations of the form &lt;math&gt;x^2 + px + q = 0&lt;/math&gt;, with p and q positive, have no positive roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 32}} "Until modern times there was no thought of solving a quadratic equation of the form &lt;math&gt;x^2 + px + q = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where p and q are positive, for the equation has no positive root. Consequently, quadratic equations in ancient and Medieval times—and even in the early modern period—were classified under three types: (1)&lt;math&gt;x^2 + px = q&lt;/math&gt; (2)&lt;math&gt;x^2 = px + q&lt;/math&gt; (3)&lt;math&gt;x^2 + q = px&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt;

In between the rhetorical and syncopated stages of symbolic algebra, a '''geometric constructive algebra''' was developed by classical [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] and [[Indian mathematics|Vedic Indian mathematicians]] in which algebraic equations were solved through geometry. For instance, an equation of the form &lt;math&gt;x^2 = A&lt;/math&gt; was solved by finding the side of a square of area ''A''.

===Conceptual stages===
In addition to the three stages of expressing algebraic ideas, some authors recognized four conceptual stages in the development of algebra that occurred alongside the changes in expression. These four stages were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Victor J.|last1=Katz|first2=Bill|last2= Barton|title=Stages in the History of Algebra with Implications for Teaching|journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Netherlands]]|volume=66|issue=2|date=October 2007|doi=10.1007/s10649-006-9023-7|pages=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=December 2017}}

*'''Geometric stage''', where the concepts of algebra are largely [[Geometry|geometric]]. This dates back to the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and continued with the [[Greek mathematics|Greeks]], and was later revived by [[Omar Khayyám]].
*'''Static equation-solving stage''', where the objective is to find numbers satisfying certain relationships. The move away from geometric algebra dates back to [[Diophantus]] and [[Brahmagupta]], but algebra didn't decisively move to the static equation-solving stage until [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] introduced generalized algorithmic processes for solving algebraic problems.
*'''Dynamic function stage''', where motion is an underlying idea. The idea of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] began emerging with [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]], but algebra did not decisively move to the dynamic function stage until [[Gottfried Leibniz]].
*'''Abstract stage''', where mathematical structure plays a central role. [[Abstract algebra]] is largely a product of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Babylon==
{{See also|Babylonian mathematics}}
[[File:Plimpton 322.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Plimpton 322]] tablet.]]
The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Dirk J.|last=Struik|title=A Concise History of Mathematics|publisher=New York: Dover Publications|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} who developed a positional number system that greatly aided them in solving their rhetorical algebraic equations. The Babylonians were not interested in exact solutions but approximations, and so they would commonly use [[linear interpolation]] to approximate intermediate values.&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylon p30"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 30}} "Babylonian mathematicians did not hesitate to interpolate by proportional parts to approximate intermediate values. Linear interpolation seems to have been a commonplace procedure in ancient Mesopotamia, and the positional notation lent itself conveniently to the rile of three. [...] a table essential in Babylonian algebra; this subject reached a considerably higher level in Mesopotamia than in Egypt. Many problem texts from the Old Babylonian period show that the solution of the complete three-term quadratic equation afforded the Babylonians no serious difficulty, for flexible algebraic operations had been developed. They could transpose terms in an equations by adding equals to equals, and they could multiply both sides by like quantities to remove fractions or to eliminate factors. By adding 4ab to (a − b) &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; they could obtain (a + b) &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for they were familiar with many simple forms of factoring. [...]Egyptian algebra had been much concerned with linear equations, but the Babylonians evidently found these too elementary for much attention. [...] In another problem in an Old Babylonian text we find two simultaneous linear equations in two unknown quantities, called respectively the "first silver ring" and the "second silver ring.""&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous tablets is the [[Plimpton 322|Plimpton 322 tablet]], created around 1900–1600&amp;nbsp;BC, which gives a table of [[Pythagorean triples]] and represents some of the most advanced mathematics prior to Greek mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/plimpnote.html | title = Plimpton 322 | author = Joyce, David E. | year = 1995 | quote=The clay tablet with the catalog number 322 in the G. A. Plimpton Collection at Columbia University may be the most well known mathematical tablet, certainly the most photographed one, but it deserves even greater renown. It was scribed in the Old Babylonian period between -1900 and -1600 and shows the most advanced mathematics before the development of Greek mathematics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babylonian algebra was much more advanced than the Egyptian algebra of the time; whereas the Egyptians were mainly concerned with linear equations the Babylonians were more concerned with quadratic and cubic equations.&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylon p30" /&gt; The Babylonians had developed flexible algebraic operations with which they were able to add equals to equals and multiply both sides of an equation by like quantities so as to eliminate fractions and factors.&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylon p30" /&gt; They were familiar with many simple forms of factoring,&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylon p30" /&gt; three-term quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 31}} "The solution of a three-term quadratic equation seems to have exceeded by far the algebraic capabilities of the Egyptians, but Neugebauer in 1930 disclosed that such equations had been handled effectively by the Babylonians in some of the oldest problem texts."&lt;/ref&gt; and many cubic equations&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylonian Cubic Equations" /&gt; although it is not known if they were able to reduce the general cubic equation.&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylonian Cubic Equations"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 33}} "There is no record in Egypt of the solution of a cubic equations, but among the Babylonians there are many instances of this. [...] Whether or not the Babylonians were able to reduce the general four-term cubic, ax&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + bx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + cx = d, to their normal form is not known."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
[[File:Egyptian A'h-mosè or Rhind Papyrus (1065x1330).png|right|thumb|200px|A portion of the [[Rhind Papyrus]].]]
{{See also|Egyptian mathematics}}
Ancient Egyptian algebra dealt mainly with linear equations while the Babylonians found these equations too elementary and developed mathematics to a higher level than the Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Boyer Babylon p30" /&gt;

The Rhind Papyrus, also known as the Ahmes Papyrus, is an ancient Egyptian papyrus written c. 1650&amp;nbsp;BC by Ahmes, who transcribed it from an earlier work that he dated to between 2000 and 1800&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" p. 11}} "It had been bought in 1959 in a Nile resort town by a Scottish antiquary, Henry Rhind; hence, it often is known as the Rhind Papyrus or, less frequently, as the Ahmes Papyrus in honor of the scribe by whose hand it had been copied in about 1650&amp;nbsp;BC. The scribe tells us that the material is derived from a prototype from the Middle Kingdom of about 2000 to 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE."&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most extensive ancient Egyptian mathematical document known to historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" p. 19}} "Much of our information about Egyptian mathematics has been derived from the Rhind or Ahmes Papyrus, the most extensive mathematical document from ancient Egypt; but there are other sources as well."&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhind Papyrus contains problems where linear equations of the form &lt;math&gt;x + ax = b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + ax + bx = c&lt;/math&gt; are solved, where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are known and ''x'', which is referred to as "aha" or heap, is the unknown.&lt;ref name="Boyer Chapter Egypt"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" pp. 15–16}} "The Egyptian problems so far described are best classified as arithmetic, but there are others that fall into a class to which the term algebraic is appropriately applied. These do not concern specific concrete objects such as bread and beer, nor do they call for operations on known numbers. Instead they require the equivalent of solutions of linear equations of the form &lt;math&gt;x + ax = b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x + ax + bx = c&lt;/math&gt;, where a and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred to as "aha," or heap. [...] The solution given by Ahmes is not that of modern textbooks, but one proposed characteristic of a procedure now known as the "method of false position," or the "rule of false." A specific false value has been proposed by 1920s scholars and the operations indicated on the left hand side of the equality sign are performed on this assumed number. Recent scholarship shows that scribes had not guessed in these situations. Exact rational number answers written in Egyptian fraction series had confused the 1920s scholars. The attested result shows that Ahmes "checked" result by showing that 16 + 1/2 + 1/8 exactly added to a seventh of this (which is 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), does obtain 19. Here we see another significant step in the development of mathematics, for the check is a simple instance of a proof."&lt;/ref&gt; The solutions were possibly, but not likely, arrived at by using the "method of false position", or ''[[regula falsi]]'', where first a specific value is substituted into the left hand side of the equation, then the required arithmetic calculations are done, thirdly the result is compared to the right hand side of the equation, and finally the correct answer is found through the use of proportions. In some of the problems the author "checks" his solution, thereby writing one of the earliest known simple proofs.&lt;ref name="Boyer Chapter Egypt" /&gt;

==Greek geometric algebra&lt;!-- [[Greek geometric algebra]] redirects here --&gt;==
{{See also|Greek mathematics}}

It is sometimes alleged that the [[Greeks]] had no algebra, but this is inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Greek Geometric Algebra" /&gt; By the time of [[Plato]], Greek mathematics had undergone a drastic change. The Greeks created a '''geometric algebra'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; where terms were represented by sides of geometric objects,&lt;ref name="A history of Mathematics the application of areas" /&gt; usually lines, that had letters associated with them,&lt;ref name="Euclid and Khwarizmi"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Europe in the Middle Ages" p. 258}} "In the arithmetical theorems in Euclid's ''Elements'' VII–IX, numbers had been represented by line segments to which letters had been attached, and the geometric proofs in al-Khwarizmi's ''Algebra'' made use of lettered diagrams; but all coefficients in the equations used in the ''Algebra'' are specific numbers, whether represented by numerals or written out in words. The idea of generality is implied in al-Khwarizmi's exposition, but he had no scheme for expressing algebraically the general propositions that are so readily available in geometry."&lt;/ref&gt; and with this new form of algebra they were able to find solutions to equations by using a process that they invented, known as "the application of areas".&lt;ref name="A history of Mathematics the application of areas"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Heroic Age" pp. 77–78}} "Whether deduction came into mathematics in the sixth century BCE or the fourth and whether incommensurability was discovered before or after 400&amp;nbsp;BCE, there can be no doubt that Greek mathematics had undergone drastic changes by the time of Plato. [...] A "geometric algebra" had to take the place of the older "arithmetic algebra," and in this new algebra there could be no adding of lines to areas or of areas to volumes. From now on there had to be strict homogeneity of terms in equations, and the Mesopotamian normal form, xy = A, x ± y = b, were to be interpreted geometrically. [...] In this way the Greeks built up the solution of quadratic equations by their process known as "the application of areas," a portion of geometric algebra that is fully covered by Euclid's ''Elements''. [...] The linear equation ax = bc, for example, was looked upon as an equality of the areas ax and bc, rather than as a proportion—an equality between the two ratios a:b and c:x. Consequently, in constructing the fourth proportion ''x'' in this case, it was usual to construct a rectangle OCDB with the sides b = OB and c = OC (Fig 5.9) and then along OC to lay off OA = a. One completes the rectangle OCDB and draws the diagonal OE cutting CD in P. It is now clear that CP is the desired line x, for rectangle OARS is equal in area to rectangle OCDB"&lt;/ref&gt; "The application of areas" is only a part of geometric algebra and it is thoroughly covered in [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements''.

An example of geometric algebra would be solving the linear equation ax = bc. The ancient Greeks would solve this equation by looking at it as an equality of areas rather than as an equality between the ratios a:b and c:x. The Greeks would construct a rectangle with sides of length b and c, then extend a side of the rectangle to length a, and finally they would complete the extended rectangle so as to find the side of the rectangle that is the solution.&lt;ref name="A history of Mathematics the application of areas"/&gt;

===Bloom of Thymaridas===
[[Iamblichus]] in ''Introductio arithmatica'' tells us that [[Thymaridas]] (c. 400&amp;nbsp;BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. 350&amp;nbsp;BCE) worked with simultaneous linear equations.&lt;ref name="Heath Thymaridas"&gt;{{Harv|Heath|1981a|loc="The ('Bloom') of Thymaridas" pp. 94–96}} Thymaridas of Paros, an ancient Pythagorean already mentioned (p. 69), was the author of a rule for solving a certain set of ''n'' simultaneous simple equations connecting ''n'' unknown quantities. The rule was evidently well known, for it was called by the special name [...] the 'flower' or 'bloom' of Thymaridas. [...] The rule is very obscurely worded, but it states in effect that, if we have the following ''n'' equations connecting ''n'' unknown quantities ''x'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, namely [...] Iamblichus, our informant on this subject, goes on to show that other types of equations can be reduced to this, so that they rule does not 'leave us in the lurch' in those cases either."&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he created the then famous rule that was known as the "bloom of Thymaridas" or as the "flower of Thymaridas", which states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the sum of ''n'' quantities be given, and also the sum of every pair containing a particular quantity, then this particular quantity is equal to 1/ (n - 2) of the difference between the sums of these pairs and the first given sum.&lt;ref name="Flegg"&gt;{{Harv|Flegg|1983|loc="Unknown Numbers" p. 205}} "Thymaridas (fourth century) is said to have had this rule for solving a particular set of ''n'' linear equations in ''n'' unknowns:&lt;br&gt;If the sum of ''n'' quantities be given, and also the sum of every pair containing a particular quantity, then this particular quantity is equal to 1/ (n - 2) of the difference between the sums of these pairs and the first given sum."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Euclid of Alexandria===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Euclid.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Hellenistic mathematician [[Euclid]] details [[geometric]]al algebra.]]
[[Euclid]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Εὐκλείδης}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] mathematician who flourished in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], almost certainly during the reign of [[Ptolemy I]] (323–283&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="Boyer Euclid Alexandria"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 100}} "but by 306&amp;nbsp;BCE control of the Egyptian portion of the empire was firmly in the hands of Ptolemy I, and this enlightened ruler was able to turn his attention to constructive efforts. Among his early acts was the establishment at Alexandria of a school or institute, known as the Museum, second to none in its day. As teachers at the school he called a band of leading scholars, among whom was the author of the most fabulously successful mathematics textbook ever written—the ''Elements'' (''Stoichia'') of Euclid. Considering the fame of the author and of his best seller, remarkably little is known of Euclid's life. So obscure was his life that no birthplace is associated with his name."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 101}} "The tale related above in connection with a request of Alexander the Great for an easy introduction to geometry is repeated in the case of Ptolemy, who Euclid is reported to have assured that "there is no royal road to geometry.""&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the year nor place of his birth&lt;ref name="Boyer Euclid Alexandria" /&gt; have been established, nor the circumstances of his death.

Euclid is regarded as the "father of [[geometry]]". His ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is the most successful [[textbook]] in the [[history of mathematics]].&lt;ref name="Boyer Euclid Alexandria"/&gt; Although he is one of the most famous mathematicians in history there are no new discoveries attributed to him, rather he is remembered for his great explanatory skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 104}} "Some of the faculty probably excelled in research, others were better fitted to be administrators, and still some others were noted for teaching ability. It would appear, from the reports we have, that Euclid very definitely fitted into the last category. There is no new discovery attributed to him, but he was noted for expository skills."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' is not, as is sometimes thought, a collection of all Greek mathematical knowledge to its date, rather, it is an elementary introduction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 104}} "The ''Elements'' was not, as is sometimes thought, a compendium of all geometric knowledge; it was instead an introductory textbook covering all ''elementary'' mathematics."&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Elements''====
The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in [[Euclid|Euclid's]] ''Elements'', provided the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations.

Book II of the ''Elements'' contains fourteen propositions, which in Euclid's time were extremely significant for doing geometric algebra. These propositions and their results are the geometric equivalents of our modern symbolic algebra and trigonometry.&lt;ref name="Greek Geometric Algebra" /&gt; Today, using modern symbolic algebra, we let symbols represent known and unknown magnitudes (i.e. numbers) and then apply algebraic operations on them. While in Euclid's time magnitudes were viewed as line segments and then results were deduced using the axioms or theorems of geometry.&lt;ref name="Greek Geometric Algebra"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p.109}} "Book II of the ''Elements'' is a short one, containing only fourteen propositions, not one of which plays any role in modern textbooks; yet in Euclid's day this book was of great significance. This sharp discrepancy between ancient and modern views is easily explained—today we have symbolic algebra and trigonometry that have replaced the geometric equivalents from Greece. For instance, Proposition 1 of Book II states that "If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments." This theorem, which asserts (Fig. 7.5) that AD (AP + PR + RB) = AD·AP + AD·PR + AD·RB, is nothing more than a geometric statement of one of the fundamental laws of arithmetic known today as the distributive law: a (b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad. In later books of the ''Elements'' (V and VII) we find demonstrations of the commutative and associative laws for multiplication. Whereas in our time magnitudes are represented by letters that are understood to be numbers (either known or unknown) on which we operate with algorithmic rules of algebra, in Euclid's day magnitudes were pictured as line segments satisfying the axions and theorems of geometry. It is sometimes asserted that the Greeks had no algebra, but this is patently false. They had Book II of the ''Elements'', which is geometric algebra and served much the same purpose as does our symbolic algebra. There can be little doubt that modern algebra greatly facilitates the manipulation of relationships among magnitudes. But it is undoubtedly also true that a Greek geometer versed in the fourteen theorems of Euclid's "algebra" was far more adept in applying these theorems to practical mensuration than is an experienced geometer of today. Ancient geometric "algebra" was not an ideal tool, but it was far from ineffective. Euclid's statement (Proposition 4), "If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the while is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments, is a verbose way of saying that &lt;math&gt;(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2&lt;/math&gt;,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many basic laws of addition and multiplication are included or proved geometrically in the ''Elements''. For instance, proposition 1 of Book II states:

:If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments.

But this is nothing more than the geometric version of the (left) distributive law, &lt;math&gt;a(b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad&lt;/math&gt;; and in Books V and VII of the ''Elements'' the commutative and associative laws for multiplication are demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Greek Geometric Algebra" /&gt;

Many basic equations were also proved geometrically. For instance, proposition 5 in Book II proves that &lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 110}} "The same holds true for ''Elements'' II.5, which contains what we should regard as an impractical circumlocution for &lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; and proposition 4 in Book II proves that &lt;math&gt;(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Greek Geometric Algebra" /&gt;

Furthermore, there are also geometric solutions given to many equations. For instance, proposition 6 of Book II gives the solution to the quadratic equation {{math|''ax'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and proposition 11 of Book II gives a solution to {{math|''ax'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 111}} "In an exactly analogous manner the quadratic equation {{math|''ax'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is solved through the use of II.6: If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the whole (with the added straight line) and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line. [...] with II.11 being an important special case of II.6. Here Euclid solves the equation {{math|''ax'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Data''====
[[Data (Euclid)|''Data'']] is a work written by Euclid for use at the schools of Alexandria and it was meant to be used as a companion volume to the first six books of the ''Elements''. The book contains some fifteen definitions and ninety-five statements, of which there are about two dozen statements that serve as algebraic rules or formulas.&lt;ref name="Euclid's Data Boyer" /&gt; Some of these statements are geometric equivalents to solutions of quadratic equations.&lt;ref name="Euclid's Data Boyer" /&gt; For instance, ''Data'' contains the solutions to the equations {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''adx'' + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''c'' {{=}} 0}} and the familiar Babylonian equation {{math|''xy'' {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''x'' ± ''y'' {{=}} ''b''}}.&lt;ref name="Euclid's Data Boyer"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 103}} "Euclid's ''Data'', a work that has come down to us through both Greek and the Arabic. It seems to have been composed for use at the schools of Alexandria, serving as a companion volume to the first six books of the ''Elements'' in much the same way that a manual of tables supplements a textbook. [...] It opens with fifteen definitions concerning magnitudes and loci. The body of the text comprises ninety-five statements concerning the implications of conditions and magnitudes that may be given in a problem. [...] There are about two dozen similar statements serving as algebraic rules or formulas. [...] Some of the statements are geometric equivalents of the solution of quadratic equations. For example[...] Eliminating {{mvar|y}} we have {{math|(''a'' - ''x'')''dx'' {{=}} ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''c''}} or {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''adx'' + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c {{=}} 0}}, from which {{math|''x'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''|2}} ± {{sqrt|({{sfrac|''a''|2}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{sfrac|''c''|''d''}})}}}}. The geometric solution given by Euclid is equivalent to this, except that the negative sign before the radical is used. Statements 84 and 85 in the Data are geometric replacements of the familiar Babylonian algebraic solutions of the systems {{math|''xy'' {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''x'' ± ''y'' {{=}} ''b''}}, which again are the equivalents of solutions of simultaneous equations."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conic sections===
A [[conic section]] is a curve that results from the intersection of a cone with a plane. There are three primary types of conic sections: [[ellipse]]s (including [[circles]]), [[parabolas]], and [[hyperbolas]]. The conic sections are reputed to have been discovered by [[Menaechmus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Euclidean Synthesis" p. 103}} "Eutocius and Proclus both attribute the discovery of the conic sections to Menaechmus, who lived in Athens in the late fourth century BC. Proclus, quoting Eratosthenes, refers to "the conic section triads of Menaechmus." Since this quotation comes just after a discussion of "the section of a right-angled cone" and "the section of an acute-angled cone," it is inferred that the conic sections were produced by cutting a cone with a plane perpendicular to one of its elements. Then if the vertex angle of the cone is acute, the resulting section (called''oxytome'') is an ellipse. If the angle is right, the section (''orthotome'') is a parabola, and if the angle is obtuse, the section (''amblytome'') is a hyperbola (see Fig. 5.7)."&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 380&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 320&amp;nbsp;BC) and since dealing with conic sections is equivalent to dealing with their respective equations, they played geometric roles equivalent to cubic equations and other higher order equations.

Menaechmus knew that in a parabola, the equation y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''l''x holds, where ''l'' is a constant called the [[latus rectum]], although he was not aware of the fact that any equation in two unknowns determines a curve.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menaechmus"/&gt; He apparently derived these properties of conic sections and others as well. Using this information it was now possible to find a solution to the problem of the [[duplication of the cube]] by solving for the points at which two parabolas intersect, a solution equivalent to solving a cubic equation.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menaechmus"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 94–95}} "If OP=y and OD = x are coordinates of point P, we have y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = R).OV, or, on substituting equals, &lt;br&gt;y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=R'D.OV=AR'.BC/AB.DO.BC/AB=AR'.BC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.x&lt;br&gt;Inasmuch as segments AR', BC, and AB are the same for all points P on the curve EQDPG, we can write the equation of the curve, a "section of a right-angled cone," as y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=lx, where l is a constant, later to be known as the latus rectum of the curve. [...] Menaechmus apparently derived these properties of the conic sections and others as well. Since this material has a string resemblance to the use of coordinates, as illustrated above, it has sometimes been maintains that Menaechmus had analytic geometry. Such a judgment is warranted only in part, for certainly Menaechmus was unaware that any equation in two unknown quantities determines a curve. In fact, the general concept of an equation in unknown quantities was alien to Greek thought. [...] He had hit upon the conics in a successful search for curves with the properties appropriate to the duplication of the cube. In terms of modern notation the solution is easily achieved. By shifting the curring plane (Gig. 6.2), we can find a parabola with any latus rectum. If, then, we wish to duplicate a cube of edge a, we locate on a right-angled cone two parabolas, one with latus rectum ''a'' and another with latus rectum 2''a''. [...] It is probable that Menaechmus knew that the duplication could be achieved also by the use of a rectangular hyperbola and a parabola."&lt;/ref&gt;

We are informed by [[Eutocius]] that the method he used to solve the cubic equation was due to [[Dionysodorus]] (250&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 190&amp;nbsp;BC). Dionysodorus solved the cubic by means of the intersection of a rectangular [[hyperbola]] and a [[parabola]]. This was related to a problem in [[Archimedes]]' ''On the Sphere and Cylinder''. Conic sections would be studied and used for thousands of years by Greek, and later Islamic and European, mathematicians. In particular [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s famous ''[[Apollonius of Perga#Conics|Conics]]'' deals with conic sections, among other topics.

==China==
{{See also|Chinese mathematics}}
Chinese Mathematics dates to at least 300&amp;nbsp;BC with the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]'', generally considered to be one of the oldest Chinese mathematical documents.&lt;ref name="Boyer Chinese Math"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" pp. 195–197}} "estimates concerning the ''Chou Pei Suan Ching'', generally considered to be the oldest of the mathematical classics, differ by almost a thousand years. [...] A date of about 300&amp;nbsp;B.C. would appear reasonable, thus placing it in close competition with another treatise, the ''Chiu-chang suan-shu'', composed about 250&amp;nbsp;B.C., that is, shortly before the Han dynasty (202&amp;nbsp;B.C.). [...] Almost as old at the ''Chou Pei'', and perhaps the most influential of all Chinese mathematical books, was the ''Chui-chang suan-shu'', or ''Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art''. This book includes 246 problems on surveying, agriculture, partnerships, engineering, taxation, calculation, the solution of equations, and the properties of right triangles. [...] Chapter eight of the ''Nine chapters'' is significant for its solution of problems of simultaneous linear equations, using both positive and negative numbers. The last problem in the chapter involves four equations in five unknowns, and the topic of indeterminate equations was to remain a favorite among Oriental peoples."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chiu-chang suan-shu'' or ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', written around 250&amp;nbsp;BC, is one of the most influential of all Chinese math books and it is composed of some 246 problems. Chapter eight deals with solving determinate and indeterminate simultaneous linear equations using positive and negative numbers, with one problem dealing with solving four equations in five unknowns.&lt;ref name="Boyer Chinese Math" /&gt;

===''Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements''===
''Ts'e-yuan hai-ching'', or ''Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements'', is a collection of some 170 problems written by [[Li Zhi (mathematician)|Li Zhi]] (or Li Ye) (1192&amp;nbsp;– 1279 CE). He used ''fan fa'', or Horner's method, to solve equations of degree as high as six, although he did not describe his method of solving equations.&lt;ref name="Boyer Sea Mirror"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 204}} "Li Chih (or Li Yeh, 1192–1279), a mathematician of Peking who was offered a government post by Khublai Khan in 1206, but politely found an excuse to decline it. His ''Ts'e-yuan hai-ching'' (''Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements'') includes 170 problems dealing with[...]some of the problems leading to equations of fourth degree. Although he did not describe his method of solution of equations, including some of sixth degree, it appears that it was not very different form that used by Chu Shih-chieh and Horner. Others who used the Horner method were Ch'in Chiu-shao (c. 1202 – c. 1261) and Yang Hui (fl. c. 1261 – 1275). The former was an unprincipled governor and minister who acquired immense wealth within a hundred days of assuming office. His ''Shu-shu chiu-chang'' (''Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections'') marks the high point of Chinese indeterminate analysis, with the invention of routines for solving simultaneous congruences."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections''===
''Shu-shu chiu-chang'', or ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]'', was written by the wealthy governor and minister [[Ch'in Chiu-shao]] (c. 1202&amp;nbsp;– c. 1261) and with the invention of a method of solving simultaneous congruences, now called [[Chinese remainder theorem]], it marks the high point in Chinese indeterminate analysis.&lt;ref name="Boyer Sea Mirror" /&gt;

===Magic squares===
[[File:Yanghui triangle.gif|right|thumb|[[Yang Hui]] (Pascal's) triangle, as depicted by the ancient Chinese using [[Counting rods|rod numerals]].]]
The earliest known magic squares appeared in China.&lt;ref name="Boyer Magic Squares"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 197}} "The Chinese were especially fond of patters; hence, it is not surprising that the first record (of ancient but unknown origin) of a magic square appeared there. [...] The concern for such patterns left the author of the ''Nine Chapters'' to solve the system of simultaneous linear equations [...] by performing column operations on the matrix [...] to reduce it to [...] The second form represented the equations 36z = 99, 5y + z = 24, and 3x + 2y + z = 39 from which the values of z, y, and x are successively found with ease."&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Nine Chapters'' the author solves a system of simultaneous linear equations by placing the coefficients and constant terms of the linear equations into a magic square (i.e. a matrix) and performing column reducing operations on the magic square.&lt;ref name="Boyer Magic Squares" /&gt; The earliest known magic squares of order greater than three are attributed to [[Yang Hui]] (fl. c. 1261&amp;nbsp;– 1275), who worked with magic squares of order as high as ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" pp. 204–205}} "The same "Horner" device was used by Yang Hui, about whose life almost nothing is known and who work has survived only in part. Among his contributions that are extant are the earliest Chinese magic squares of order greater than three, including two each of orders four through eight and one each of orders nine and ten."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Precious Mirror of the Four Elements''===
''Ssy-yüan yü-chien''《四元玉鑒》, or ''Precious Mirror of the Four Elements'', was written by [[Chu Shih-chieh]] in 1303 and it marks the peak in the development of Chinese algebra. The [[Classical element|four elements]], called heaven, earth, man and matter, represented the four unknown quantities in his algebraic equations. The ''Ssy-yüan yü-chien'' deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of degrees as high as fourteen. The author uses the method of ''fan fa'', today called [[Horner scheme|Horner's method]], to solve these equations.&lt;ref name="Boyer Precious Mirror"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 203}} "The last and greatest of the Sung mathematicians was Chu Chih-chieh ([[floruit|fl.]] 1280–1303), yet we know little about him-, [...] Of greater historical and mathematical interest is the ''Ssy-yüan yü-chien'' (''Precious Mirror of the Four Elements'') of 1303. In the eighteenth century this, too, disappeared in China, only to be rediscovered in the next century. The four elements, called heaven, earth, man, and matter, are the representations of four unknown quantities in the same equation. The book marks the peak in the development of Chinese algebra, for it deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of degrees as high as fourteen. In it the author describes a transformation method that he calls ''fan fa'', the elements of which to have arisen long before in China, but which generally bears the name of Horner, who lived half a millennium later."&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Precious Mirror'' opens with a diagram of the arithmetic triangle ([[Pascal's triangle]]) using a round zero symbol, but Chu Shih-chieh denies credit for it. A similar triangle appears in Yang Hui's work, but without the zero symbol.&lt;ref name="Boyer Precious Mirror p205" /&gt;

There are many summation series equations given without proof in the ''Precious mirror''. A few of the summation series are:&lt;ref name="Boyer Precious Mirror p205"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 205}} "A few of the many summations of series found in the ''Precious Mirror'' are the following:[...] However, no proofs are given, nor does the topic seem to have been continued again in China until about the nineteenth century. [...] The ''Precious Mirror'' opens with a diagram of the arithmetic triangle, inappropriately known in the West as "pascal's triangle." (See illustration.) [...] Chu disclaims credit for the triangle, referring to it as a "diagram of the old method for finding eighth and lower powers." A similar arrangement of coefficients through the sixth power had appeared in the work of Yang Hui, but without the round zero symbol."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diophantine algebra==
{{See also|Diophantine equation}}

[[File:Diophantus-cover.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of the 1621 edition of Diophantus' ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]].]]
[[Diophantus]] was a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] mathematician who lived c. 250 CE, but the uncertainty of this date is so great that it may be off by more than a century. He is known for having written ''Arithmetica'', a treatise that was originally thirteen books but of which only the first six have survived.&lt;ref name="Boyer Diophantus"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178}} Uncertainty about the life of Diophantus is so great that we do not know definitely in which century he lived. Generally he is assumed to have flourished about 250 CE, but dates a century or more earlier or later are sometimes suggested[...] If this conundrum is historically accurate, Diophantus lived to be eighty-four-years old. [...] The chief Diophantine work known to us is the ''Arithmetica'', a treatise originally in thirteen books, only the first six of which have survived."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arithmetica'' has very little in common with traditional Greek mathematics since it is divorced from geometric methods, and it is different from Babylonian mathematics in that Diophantus is concerned primarily with exact solutions, both determinate and indeterminate, instead of simple approximations.&lt;ref name="Boyer Arithmetica"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" pp. 180–182}} "In this respect it can be compared with the great classics of the earlier [[Alexandrian Age]]; yet it has practically nothing in common with these or, in fact, with any traditional Greek mathematics. It represents essentially a new branch and makes use of a different approach. Being divorced from geometric methods, it resembles Babylonian algebra to a large extent. But whereas Babylonian mathematicians had been concerned primarily with '' approximate'' solutions of ''determinate'' equations as far as the third degree, the ''Arithmetica'' of Diophantus (such as we have it) is almost entirely devoted to the ''exact'' solution of equations, both ''determinate'' and ''indeterminate''. [...] Throughout the six surviving books of ''Arithmetica'' there is a systematic use of abbreviations for powers of numbers and for relationships and operations. An unknown number is represented by a symbol resembling the Greek letter ζ (perhaps for the last letter of arithmos). [...] It is instead a collection of some 150 problems, all worked out in terms of specific numerical examples, although perhaps generality of method was intended. There is no postulation development, nor is an effort made to find all possible solutions. In the case of quadratic equations with two positive roots, only the larger is give, and negative roots are not recognized. No clear-cut distinction is made between determinate and indeterminate problems, and even for the latter for which the number of solutions generally is unlimited, only a single answer is given. Diophantus solved problems involving several unknown numbers by skillfully expressing all unknown quantities, where possible, in terms of only one of them."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. There is no evidence that suggests Diophantus even realized that there could be two solutions to a quadratic equation. He also considered simultaneous quadratic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Diophantus.html|title=Diophantus biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, no general method may be abstracted from all Diophantus' solutions.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Hermann Hankel]] wrote "With our author [Diophantos] not the slightest trace of a general, comprehensive method is discernible; each problem calls for some special method which refuses to work even for the most closely related problems. For this reason it is difficult for the modern scholar to solve the 101st problem even after having studied 100 of Diophantos’s solutions". (Hankel H.,''Geschichte der mathematic im altertum und mittelalter'', Leipzig, 1874, translated and quoted in English in Ulrich Lirecht. ''Chinese Mathematics in the thirteenth century'', Dover publications, New York, 1973.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Arithmetica'', Diophantus is the first to use symbols for unknown numbers as well as abbreviations for powers of numbers, relationships, and operations;&lt;ref name="Boyer Arithmetica" /&gt; thus he used what is now known as ''syncopated'' algebra. The main difference between Diophantine syncopated algebra and modern algebraic notation is that the former lacked special symbols for operations, relations, and exponentials.&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178}} "The chief difference between Diophantine syncopation and the modern algebraic notation is the lack of special symbols for operations and relations, as well as of the exponential notation."&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, what we would write as
:&lt;math&gt;x^3 - 2x^2 + 10x -1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
Diophantus would have written this as
:Κ&lt;sup&gt;Υ&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;α̅ς&amp;nbsp;ι̅&amp;nbsp;⫛ Δ&lt;sup&gt;Υ&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;β̅ '''Μ'''&amp;nbsp;α̅ ἴσ '''Μ'''&amp;nbsp;ε̅
where the symbols represent the following:&lt;ref name="Diophantus Syncopation"&gt;{{Harv|Derbyshire|2006|loc="The Father of Algebra" pp. 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cooke|1997|loc="Mathematics in the Roman Empire" pp. 167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the coefficients come after the variables and that addition is represented by the juxtaposition of terms. A literal symbol-for-symbol translation of Diophantus's syncopated equation into a modern symbolic equation would be the following:&lt;ref name="Diophantus Syncopation" /&gt;

==India==
{{See also|Indian mathematics}}
The Indian mathematicians were active in studying about number systems. The earliest known [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematical]] documents are dated to around the middle of the first millennium BC (around the 6th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Mathematics of the Hindus" p. 197}} "The oldest surviving documents on Hindu mathematics are copies of works written in the middle of the first millennium B.C., approximately the time during which Thales and Pythagoras lived. [...] from the sixth century B.C."&lt;/ref&gt;

The recurring themes in Indian mathematics are, among others, determinate and indeterminate linear and quadratic equations, simple mensuration, and Pythagorean triples.&lt;ref name="India Algebra in General"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 222}} "The ''Livavanti'', like the ''Vija-Ganita'', contains numerous problems dealing with favorite Hindu topics; linear and quadratic equations, both determinate and indeterminate, simple mensuration, arithmetic and geometric progressions, surds, Pythagorean triads, and others."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aryabhata''===
[[Aryabhata]] (476–550) was an Indian mathematician who authored ''[[Aryabhatiya]]''. In it he gave the rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Mathematics of the Hindus" p. 207}} "He gave more elegant rules for the sum of the squares and cubes of an initial segment of the positive integers. The sixth part of the product of three quantities consisting of the number of terms, the number of terms plus one, and twice the number of terms plus one is the sum of the squares. The square of the sum of the series is the sum of the cubes."&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = {n(n + 1)(2n + 1) \over 6}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2&lt;/math&gt;

===''Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta''===
[[Brahmagupta]] (fl. 628) was an Indian mathematician who authored ''[[Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta]]''. In his work Brahmagupta solves the general quadratic equation for both positive and negative roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 219}} "Brahmagupta (fl. 628), who lived in Central India somewhat more than a century after Aryabhata [...] in the trigonometry of his best-known work, the ''Brahmasphuta Siddhanta'', [...] here we find general solutions of quadratic equations, including two roots even in cases in which one of them is negative."&lt;/ref&gt; In indeterminate analysis Brahmagupta gives the Pythagorean triads &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2}({m^2\over n} - n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2}({m^2\over n} + n)&lt;/math&gt;, but this is a modified form of an old Babylonian rule that Brahmagupta may have been familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 220}} "Hindu algebra is especially noteworthy in its development of indeterminate analysis, to which Brahmagupta made several contributions. For one thing, in his work we find a rule for the formation of Pythagorean triads expressed in the form m, 1/2 (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/n − n), 1/2 (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/n + n); but this is only a modified form of the old Babylonian rule, with which he may have become familiar."&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to give a general solution to the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. Unlike Diophantus who only gave one solution to an indeterminate equation, Brahmagupta gave ''all'' integer solutions; but that Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus has led some historians to consider the possibility of a Greek influence on Brahmagupta's work, or at least a common Babylonian source.&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 221}} "he was the first one to give a ''general'' solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. [...] It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta that he gave ''all'' integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation, whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek influence in India—or the possibility that they both made use of a common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar. The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of appropriate words. [...] Bhaskara (1114 – c. 1185), the leading mathematician of the twelfth century. It was he who filled some of the gaps in Brahmagupta's work, as by giving a general solution of the Pell equation and by considering the problem of division by zero."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the algebra of Diophantus, the algebra of Brahmagupta was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations" /&gt; The extent of Greek influence on this syncopation, if any, is not known and it is possible that both Greek and Indian syncopation may be derived from a common Babylonian source.&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations"/&gt;

===Bhāskara II===
[[Bhāskara II]] (1114 – c. 1185) was the leading mathematician of the 12th century. In Algebra, he gave the general solution of [[Pell's equation]].&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations" /&gt; He is the author of ''[[Lilavati]]'' and ''Vija-Ganita'', which contain problems dealing with determinate and indeterminate linear and quadratic equations, and Pythagorean triples&lt;ref name="India Algebra in General" /&gt; and he fails to distinguish between exact and approximate statements.&lt;ref name="Boyer Lilvati222-223"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" pp. 222–223}} "In treating of the circle and the sphere the ''Lilavati'' fails also to distinguish between exact and approximate statements. [...] Many of Bhaskara's problems in the ''Livavati'' and the ''Vija-Ganita'' evidently were derived from earlier Hindu sources; hence, it is no surprise to note that the author is at his best in dealing with indeterminate analysis."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the problems in ''Lilavati'' and ''Vija-Ganita'' are derived from other Hindu sources, and so Bhaskara is at his best in dealing with indeterminate analysis.&lt;ref name="Boyer Lilvati222-223" /&gt;

Bhaskara uses the initial symbols of the names for colors as the symbols of unknown variables. So, for example, what we would write today as

:&lt;math&gt;( -x - 1 ) + ( 2x - 8 ) = x - 9&lt;/math&gt;

Bhaskara would have written as
::       .    &lt;span style="color:white;"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; .
: ''ya'' 1 ''ru'' 1
:::               .
: ''ya'' 2 ''ru'' 8
::::                .
: Sum ''ya'' 1 ru ''9''

where ''ya'' indicates the first syllable of the word for ''black'', and ''ru'' is taken from the word ''species''. The dots over the numbers indicate subtraction.

{{See also|Islamic mathematics}}

The first century of the [[Islam]]ic [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] saw almost no scientific or mathematical achievements since the Arabs, with their newly conquered empire, had not yet gained any intellectual drive and research in other parts of the world had faded. In the second half of the 8th century, Islam had a cultural awakening, and research in mathematics and the sciences increased.&lt;ref name="Boyer Intro Islamic Algebra"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 227}} "The first century of the Muslim empire had been devoid of scientific achievement. This period (from about 650 to 750) had been, in fact, perhaps the nadir in the development of mathematics, for the Arabs had not yet achieved intellectual drive, and concern for learning in other parts of the world had faded. Had it not been for the sudden cultural awakening in Islam during the second half of the eighth century, considerably more of ancient science and mathematics would have been lost. [...] It was during the caliphate of al-Mamun (809–833), however, that the Arabs fully indulged their passion for translation. The caliph is said to have had a dream in which Aristotle appeared, and as a consequence al-Mamun determined to have Arabic versions made of all the Greek works that he could lay his hands on, including Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' and a complete version of Euclid's ''Elements''. From the Byzantine Empire, with which the Arabs maintained an uneasy peace, Greek manuscripts were obtained through peace treaties. Al-Mamun established at Baghdad a "House of Wisdom" (Bait al-hikma) comparable to the ancient Museum at Alexandria. Among the faculty members was a mathematician and astronomer, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose name, like that of Euclid, later was to become a household word in Western Europe. The scholar, who died sometime before 850, wrote more than half a dozen astronomical and mathematical works, of which the earliest were probably based on the ''Sindhad'' derived from India."&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Mamun]] (809–833) is said to have had a dream where Aristotle appeared to him, and as a consequence al-Mamun ordered that Arabic translation be made of as many Greek works as possible, including Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' and Euclid's ''Elements''. Greek works would be given to the Muslims by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in exchange for treaties, as the two empires held an uneasy peace.&lt;ref name="Boyer Intro Islamic Algebra" /&gt; Many of these Greek works were translated by [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] (826–901), who translated books written by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius.&lt;ref name="Boyer Islamic Rhetoric Algebra Thabit"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 234}} "but al-Khwarizmi's work had a serious deficiency that had to be removed before it could serve its purpose effectively in the modern world: a symbolic notation had to be developed to replace the rhetorical form. This step the Arabs never took, except for the replacement of number words by number signs. [...] Thabit was the founder of a school of translators, especially from Greek and Syriac, and to him we owe an immense debt for translations into Arabic of works by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three theories about the origins of Arabic Algebra. The first emphasizes Hindu influence, the second emphasizes Mesopotamian or Persian-Syriac influence and the third emphasizes Greek influence. Many scholars believe that it is the result of a combination of all three sources.&lt;ref name="Boyer Three Influences on al Jabr"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230}} "Al-Khwarizmi continued: "We have said enough so far as numbers are concerned, about the six types of equations. Now, however, it is necessary that we should demonstrate geometrically the truth of the same problems which we have explained in numbers." The ring of this passage is obviously Greek rather than Babylonian or Indian. There are, therefore, three main schools of thought on the origin of Arabic algebra: one emphasizes Hindu influence, another stresses the Mesopotamian, or Syriac-Persian, tradition, and the third points to Greek inspiration. The truth is probably approached if we combine the three theories."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout their time in power, before the fall of Islamic civilization, the Arabs used a fully rhetorical algebra, where often even the numbers were spelled out in words. The Arabs would eventually replace spelled out numbers (e.g. twenty-two) with [[Arabic numerals]] (e.g. 22), but the Arabs did not adopt or develop a syncopated or symbolic algebra&lt;ref name="Boyer Islamic Rhetoric Algebra Thabit" /&gt; until the work of [[Ibn al-Banna]] in the 13th century and [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] in the 15th century.

The Muslim&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" pp. 228–229}} "the author's preface in Arabic gave fulsome praise to Mohammed, the prophet, and to al-Mamun, "the Commander of the Faithful.""&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persia]]n mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] was a faculty member of the "[[House of Wisdom]]" (''Bait al-Hikma'') in Baghdad, which was established by Al-Mamun. Al-Khwarizmi, who died around 850 CE, wrote more than half a dozen mathematical and astronomical works, some of which were based on the Indian ''Sindhind''.&lt;ref name="Boyer Intro Islamic Algebra" /&gt; One of al-Khwarizmi's most famous books is entitled ''Al-jabr wa'l muqabalah'' or ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'', and it gives an exhaustive account of solving polynomials up to the second degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 228}} "The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization—respects in which neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled."&lt;/ref&gt; The book also introduced the fundamental concept of "[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which Al-Khwarizmi originally described as ''al-jabr''.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 229}} "It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, which is evident in the treatise; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing"—that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation."&lt;/ref&gt;

R. Rashed and Angela Armstrong write:

''Al-Jabr'' is divided into six chapters, each of which deals with a different type of formula. The first chapter of ''Al-Jabr'' deals with equations whose squares equal its roots (ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = bx), the second chapter deals with squares equal to number (ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c), the third chapter deals with roots equal to a number (bx = c), the fourth chapter deals with squares and roots equal a number (ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + bx = c), the fifth chapter deals with squares and number equal roots (ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + c = bx), and the sixth and final chapter deals with roots and number equal to squares (bx + c = ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Al Jabr and its chapters"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 229}} "in six short chapters, of the six types of equations made up from the three kinds of quantities: roots, squares, and numbers (that is x, x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and numbers). Chapter I, in three short paragraphs, covers the case of squares equal to roots, expressed in modern notation as x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5x, x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3 = 4x, and 5x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10x, giving the answers x = 5, x = 12, and x = 2 respectively. (The root x = 0 was not recognized.) Chapter II covers the case of squares equal to numbers, and Chapter III solves the cases of roots equal to numbers, again with three illustrations per chapter to cover the cases in which the coefficient of the variable term is equal to, more than, or less than one. Chapters IV, V, and VI are more interesting, for they cover in turn the three classical cases of three-term quadratic equations: (1) squares and roots equal to numbers, (2) squares and numbers equal to roots, and (3) roots and numbers equal to squares."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bodleian MS. Huntington 214 roll332 frame36.jpg|thumbnail|right|Pages from a 14th-century Arabic copy of the book, showing geometric solutions to two quadratic equations]]
In ''Al-Jabr'', al-Khwarizmi uses geometric proofs,&lt;ref name="Euclid and Khwarizmi" /&gt; he does not recognize the root x = 0,&lt;ref name="Al Jabr and its chapters"/&gt; and he only deals with positive roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" pp. 229–230}} "The solutions are "cookbook" rules for "completing the square" applied to specific instances. [...] In each case only the positive answer is give. [...] Again only one root is given for the other is negative. [...]The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive roots."&lt;/ref&gt; He also recognizes that the [[discriminant]] must be positive and described the method of [[completing the square]], though he does not justify the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230}} "Al-Khwarizmi here calls attention to the fact that what we designate as the discriminant must be positive: "You ought to understand also that when you take the half of the roots in this form of equation and then multiply the half by itself; if that which proceeds or results from the multiplication is less than the units above mentioned as accompanying the square, you have an equation." [...] Once more the steps in completing the square are meticulously indicated, without justification,"&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek influence is shown by ''Al-Jabr'''s geometric foundations&lt;ref name="Boyer Three Influences on al Jabr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 231}} "The ''Algebra'' of al-Khwarizmi betrays unmistakable Hellenic elements,"&lt;/ref&gt; and by one problem taken from Heron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 233}} "A few of al-Khwarizmi's problems give rather clear evidence of Arabic dependence on the Babylonian-Heronian stream of mathematics. One of them presumably was taken directly from Heron, for the figure and dimensions are the same."&lt;/ref&gt; He makes use of lettered diagrams but all of the coefficients in all of his equations are specific numbers since he had no way of expressing with parameters what he could express geometrically; although generality of method is intended.&lt;ref name="Euclid and Khwarizmi" /&gt;

Al-Khwarizmi most likely did not know of Diophantus's ''Arithmetica'',&lt;ref name="al-Khwarizmi Diophantus Brahmagupta"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 228}} "the algebra of al-Khwarizmi is thoroughly rhetorical, with none of the syncopation found in the Greek ''Arithmetica'' or in Brahmagupta's work. Even numbers were written out in words rather than symbols! It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers."&lt;/ref&gt; which became known to the Arabs sometime before the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ibn Turk" /&gt; And even though al-Khwarizmi most likely knew of Brahmagupta's work, ''Al-Jabr'' is fully rhetorical with the numbers even being spelled out in words.&lt;ref name="al-Khwarizmi Diophantus Brahmagupta" /&gt; So, for example, what we would write as
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 10x = 39&lt;/math&gt;
Diophantus would have written as&lt;ref name="Unknown Quantity, Dia, al-Khwar"&gt;{{Harv|Derbyshire|2006|loc="The Father of Algebra" p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Δ&lt;sup&gt;Υ&lt;/sup&gt;α̅ ςι̅ 'ίσ '''Μ''' λ̅θ̅
And al-Khwarizmi would have written as&lt;ref name="Unknown Quantity, Dia, al-Khwar"/&gt;
:One square and ten roots of the same amount to thirty-nine ''[[dirhem]]s''; that is to say, what must be the square which, when increased by ten of its own roots, amounts to thirty-nine?

===''Logical Necessities in Mixed Equations''===
[['Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk]] authored a manuscript entitled ''Logical Necessities in Mixed Equations'', which is very similar to al-Khwarzimi's ''Al-Jabr'' and was published at around the same time as, or even possibly earlier than, ''Al-Jabr''.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ibn Turk"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 234}} "The ''Algebra'' of al-Khwarizmi usually is regarded as the first work on the subject, but a recent publication in Turkey raises some questions about this. A manuscript of a work by 'Abd-al-Hamid ibn-Turk, entitled "Logical Necessities in Mixed Equations," was part of a book on ''Al-jabr wa'l muqabalah'' which was evidently very much the same as that by al-Khwarizmi and was published at about the same time—possibly even earlier. The surviving chapters on "Logical Necessities" give precisely the same type of geometric demonstration as al-Khwarizmi's ''Algebra'' and in one case the same illustrative example x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 21 = 10x. In one respect 'Abd-al-Hamad's exposition is more thorough than that of al-Khwarizmi for he gives geometric figures to prove that if the discriminant is negative, a quadratic equation has no solution. Similarities in the works of the two men and the systematic organization found in them seem to indicate that algebra in their day was not so recent a development as has usually been assumed. When textbooks with a conventional and well-ordered exposition appear simultaneously, a subject is likely to be considerably beyond the formative stage. [...] Note the omission of Diophantus and Pappus, authors who evidently were not at first known in Arabia, although the Diophantine ''Arithmetica'' became familiar before the end of the tenth century."&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript gives exactly the same geometric demonstration as is found in ''Al-Jabr'', and in one case the same example as found in ''Al-Jabr'', and even goes beyond ''Al-Jabr'' by giving a geometric proof that if the discriminant is negative then the quadratic equation has no solution.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ibn Turk" /&gt; The similarity between these two works has led some historians to conclude that Arabic algebra may have been well developed by the time of al-Khwarizmi and 'Abd al-Hamid.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ibn Turk" /&gt;

===Abu Kamil and al-Karkhi===
Arabic mathematicians treated [[irrational number]]s as [[algebra]]ic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|class=HistTopics|id=Arabic_mathematics|title=Arabic mathematics: forgotten brilliance?|year=1999}} "Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers, irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as "algebraic objects"."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egypt]]ian mathematician [[Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam]] (c. 850–930) was the first to accept irrational numbers (often in the form of a [[square root]], [[cube root]] or [[Nth root|fourth root]]) as solutions to [[quadratic equation]]s or as [[coefficient]]s in an [[equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Sesiano, "Islamic mathematics", p. 148, in {{citation|title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Mathematics|editor1-first=Helaine|editor1-last=Selin|editor1-link=Helaine Selin|editor2-first=Ubiratan|editor2-last=D'Ambrosio|editor2-link=Ubiratan D'Ambrosio|year=2000|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1-4020-0260-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first to solve three non-linear [[simultaneous equations]] with three unknown [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]].&lt;ref name=Berggren-518&gt;{{cite book | first=J.

[[Al-Karaji|Al-Karkhi]] (953–1029), also known as Al-Karaji, was the successor of [[Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī]] (940–998) and he discovered the first numerical solution to equations of the form ax&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt; + bx&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = c.&lt;ref name="Boyer al-Karkhi ax2n"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 239}} "Abu'l Wefa was a capable algebraist as well as a trionometer. [...] His successor al-Karkhi evidently used this translation to become an Arabic disciple of Diophantus—but without Diophantine analysis!

His work on algebra and [[polynomial]]s, gave the rules for arithmetic operations to manipulate polynomials. The [[History of mathematics|historian of mathematics]] F. Woepcke, in ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi'' ([[Paris]], 1853), praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the theory of algebraic [[calculus]]". Stemming from this, Al-Karaji investigated [[binomial coefficients]] and [[Pascal's triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Karaji|title=Abu Bekr ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn Al-Karaji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omar Khayyám, Sharaf al-Dīn, and al-Kashi===
[[File:005-a-Ruby-kindles-in-the-vine-810x1146.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Khayyam]] is credited with identifying the foundations of [[algebraic geometry]] and found the general geometric solution of the [[cubic equation]].]]

The solution is given by the length of the horizontal line segment from the origin to the intersection of the vertical line and the ''x''-axis.]]

[[Omar Khayyám]] (c. 1050 – 1123) wrote a book on Algebra that went beyond ''Al-Jabr'' to include equations of the third degree.&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" pp. 241–242}} "Omar Khayyam (c. 1050 – 1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an ''Algebra'' that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, [...] One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved.""&lt;/ref&gt; Omar Khayyám provided both arithmetic and geometric solutions for quadratic equations, but he only gave geometric solutions for general [[Cubic function|cubic equations]] since he mistakenly believed that arithmetic solutions were impossible.&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots" /&gt; His method of solving cubic equations by using intersecting conics had been used by [[Menaechmus]], [[Archimedes]], and [[Ibn al-Haytham|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)]], but Omar Khayyám generalized the method to cover all cubic equations with positive roots.&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots" /&gt; He only considered positive roots and he did not go past the third degree.&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots" /&gt; He also saw a strong relationship between Geometry and Algebra.&lt;ref name="Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots" /&gt;

In the 12th century, [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] (1135–1213) wrote the ''Al-Mu'adalat'' (''Treatise on Equations''), which dealt with eight types of cubic equations with positive solutions and five types of cubic equations which may not have positive solutions. He used what would later be known as the "[[Ruffini's rule|Ruffini]]-[[Horner scheme|Horner]] method" to [[Numerical analysis|numerically]] approximate the [[root of a function|root]] of a cubic equation. He also developed the concepts of the [[maxima and minima]] of curves in order to solve cubic equations which may not have positive solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Tusi_Sharaf|title=Sharaf al-Din al-Muzaffar al-Tusi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the importance of the [[discriminant]] of the cubic equation and used an early version of [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]]'s formula&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Rashed | first1=Roshdi | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=0-7923-2565-6 | pages=342–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find algebraic solutions to certain types of cubic equations. Some scholars, such as Roshdi Rashed, argue that Sharaf al-Din discovered the [[derivative]] of cubic polynomials and realized its significance, while other scholars connect his solution to the ideas of Euclid and Archimedes.&lt;ref name=Berggren&gt;{{Citation|first=J.

Sharaf al-Din also developed the concept of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} In his analysis of
the equation &lt;math&gt;\ x^3 + d = bx^2&lt;/math&gt; for example, he begins by changing the equation's form to &lt;math&gt;\ x^2 (b - x) = d&lt;/math&gt;. He then states that the question of whether the equation has a solution depends on whether or not the “function” on the left side reaches the value &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt;. To determine this, he finds a maximum value for the function. He proves that the maximum value occurs when &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{2b}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the functional value &lt;math&gt;\frac{4b^3}{27}&lt;/math&gt;. Sharaf al-Din then states that if this value is less than &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt;, there are no positive solutions; if it is equal to &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt;, then there is one solution at &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{2b}{3}&lt;/math&gt;; and if it is greater than &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt;, then there are two solutions, one between &lt;math&gt;\ 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{2b}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and one between &lt;math&gt;\frac{2b}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Victor J.

In the early 15th century, [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] developed an early form of [[Newton's method]] to numerically solve the equation &lt;math&gt;\ x^P - N = 0&lt;/math&gt; to find roots of &lt;math&gt;\ N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Tjalling J.

However, J. Lennart Berggrenn notes that he was mistaken, as decimal fractions were first used five centuries before him by the [[Baghdad]]i mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] as early as the 10th century.&lt;ref name=Berggren-518/&gt;

===Al-Hassār, Ibn al-Banna, and al-Qalasadi===
[[Al-Hassār]], a mathematician from [[Morocco]] specializing in [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence]] during the 12th century, developed the modern symbolic [[mathematical notation]] for [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], where the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] are separated by a horizontal bar. This same fractional notation appeared soon after in the work of [[Fibonacci]] in the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] (1412–1486) was the last major medieval [[Arab]] algebraist, who made the first attempt at creating an [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] since [[Ibn al-Banna]] two centuries earlier, who was himself the first to make such an attempt since [[Diophantus]] and [[Brahmagupta]] in ancient times.&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syncopated notations of his predecessors, however, lacked symbols for [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operations]].&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; Al-Qalasadi "took the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism by using letters in place of numbers"&lt;ref name=Qalasadi/&gt; and by "using short Arabic words, or just their initial letters, as mathematical symbols."&lt;ref name=Qalasadi/&gt;

==Europe and the Mediterranean region==

Just as the death of [[Hypatia]] signals the close of the [[Library of Alexandria]] as a mathematical center, so does the death of [[Boethius]] signal the end of mathematics in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Although there was some work being done at [[Athens]], it came to a close when in 529 the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian]] closed the [[pagan]] philosophical schools. The year 529 is now taken to be the beginning of the medieval period. Scholars fled the West towards the more hospitable East, particularly towards [[Persia]], where they found haven under King [[Khosrau I|Chosroes]] and established what might be termed an "Athenian Academy in Exile".&lt;ref name="Boyer 192-193"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria pp. 192–193}} "The death of Boethius may be taken to mark the end of ancient mathematics in the Western Roman Empire, as the death of Hypatia had marked the close of Alexandria as a mathematical center; but work continued for a few years longer at Athens. [...] When in 527 Justinian became emperor in the East, he evidently felt that the pagan learning of the Academy and other philosophical schools at Athens was a threat to orthodox Christianity; hence, in 529 the philosophical schools were closed and the scholars dispersed. Rome at the time was scarcely a very hospitable home for scholars, and Simplicius and some of the other philosophers looked to the East for haven. This they found in Persia, where under King Chosroes they established what might be called the "Athenian Academy in Exile."(Sarton 1952; p. 400)."&lt;/ref&gt; Under a treaty with Justinian, Chosroes would eventually return the scholars to the [[Eastern Empire]]. During the Dark Ages, European mathematics was at its nadir with mathematical research consisting mainly of commentaries on ancient treatises; and most of this research was centered in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The end of the medieval period is set as the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in 1453.

===Late Middle Ages===
The 12th century saw a [[Latin translations of the 12th century|flood of translations]] from [[Arabic]] into [[Latin]] and by the 13th century, European mathematics was beginning to rival the mathematics of other lands. In the 13th century, the solution of a cubic equation by [[Fibonacci]] is representative of the beginning of a revival in European algebra.

As the Islamic world was declining after the 15th century, the European world was ascending. And it is here that Algebra was further developed.

==Symbolic algebra==
{{Missing information|section|most important results in algebra that are more recent than 15th century, and are completely ignored|talksection=Single Source|date=January 2017}}
Modern notation for arithmetic operations was introduced between the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century by [[Johannes Widmann]] and [[Michael Stifel]]. At the end of 16th century, [[François Viète]] introduced symbols, presently called [[variable (mathematics)|variables]], for representing indeterminate or unknown numbers. This created a new algebra consisting of computing with symbolic expressions as if they were numbers.

Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a [[determinant]] was developed by [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese mathematician]] [[Kowa Seki]] in the 17th century, followed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. [[Gabriel Cramer]] also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century.

===The symbol ''x''===
By tradition, the first unknown [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] in an algebraic problem is nowadays represented by the [[symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\mathit{x}&lt;/math&gt;; if there is a second or a third unknown, these are labeled &lt;math&gt;\mathit{y}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Algebraic ''x'' is conventionally printed in [[italic type]] to distinguish it from the sign of multiplication.

Mathematical historians&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Bashmakova|Smirnova|2000|p=78}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Boyer|1991|p=180}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Burton|1995|p=319}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Derbyshire|2006|p=93}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Katz|Parshall|2014|p=238}},  {{Harvcoltxt|Sesiano|1999|p=125}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Swetz|2013|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally agree that  the use of ''x'' in algebra was introduced by [[René Descartes]] and was first published in his treatise ''[[La Géométrie]]'' (1637).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Descartes|1637|pp=301–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Descartes|1925|pp=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that work, he used letters from the beginning of the alphabet (''a'', ''b'', ''c'',...) for known quantities, and letters from the end of the alphabet (''z'', ''y'', ''x'',...) for unknowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cajori|1919|p=698}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Cajori|1928|vol=1|pp=381–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that he later settled on ''x'' (in place of ''z'') for the first unknown because of its relatively greater abundance in the French and Latin typographical fonts of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Eneström|1905|vol=1|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three alternative theories of the origin of algebraic ''x'' were suggested in the 19th century: (1) a symbol used by German algebraists and thought to be derived from a cursive letter ''r'', mistaken for ''x'';&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Tropfke|1902|p=150}}. But [[Gustaf Eneström]] (1905:316-317) showed that Descartes, in a letter written in 1619, used the German symbol in clear contrast to his own ''x''.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the numeral ''1'' with oblique [[strikethrough]];&lt;ref&gt;A crossed numeral ''1'' was used by [[Pietro Cataldi]] for the first power of the unknown. The link between this convention and ''x'' is attributed by Cajori to [[:de:Gustav Wertheim (Mathematiker)|Gustav Wertheim]], but Cajori (1919:699; 1928:382) finds no evidence to support it.&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) an Arabic/Spanish source (see below). But the Swiss-American historian of mathematics [[Florian Cajori]] examined these and found all three lacking in concrete evidence; Cajori credited Descartes as the originator, and described his ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' as "free from tradition[,] and their choice purely arbitrary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cajori|1919|p=699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Hispano-Arabic hypothesis continues to have a presence in [[popular culture]] today.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] by Terry Moore, entitled [http://www.ted.com/talks/terry_moore_why_is_x_the_unknown?language=en "Why Is 'x' the Unknown?"], released in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the claim that algebraic ''x'' is the abbreviation of a supposed [[loanword]] from Arabic in Old Spanish. The theory originated in 1884 with the German "[[Oriental studies|orientalist]]" [[Paul de Lagarde]], shortly after he published his edition of a 1505 Spanish/Arabic bilingual glossary&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Alcalá|1505}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Spanish ''cosa'' ("thing") was paired with its Arabic equivalent, شىء (''shay&lt;sup&gt;ʔ&lt;/sup&gt;''), transcribed as ''xei''. (The "sh" sound in [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] was routinely spelled ''x''.) Evidently Lagarde was aware that Arab mathematicians, in the "rhetorical" stage of algebra's development, often used that word to represent the unknown quantity. He surmised that "nothing could be more natural" (Nichts war also natürlicher...) than for the initial of the Arabic word—[[Romanization|romanized]] as the Old Spanish ''x''—to be adopted for use in algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lagarde|1884|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A later reader reinterpreted Lagarde's conjecture as having "proven" the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jacob|1903|p=519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lagarde was unaware that early Spanish mathematicians used, not a ''transcription'' of the Arabic word, but rather its ''translation'' in their own language, "cosa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rider|1982}} lists five treatises on algebra published in Spanish in the sixteenth century, all of which use "cosa": {{Harvcoltxt|Aurel|1552}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Ortega|1552}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Díez|1556}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Pérez de Moya|1562}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Nunes|1567}}. The latter two works also abbreviate ''cosa'' as "''co.''"—as does {{Harvcoltxt|Puig|1672}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no instance of ''xei'' or similar forms in several compiled historical vocabularies of Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;The forms are absent from {{Harvcoltxt|Alonso|1986}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kasten|Cody|2001}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Oelschläger|1940}}, the [[Real Academia Española|Spanish Royal Academy]]’s online diachronic corpus of Spanish ([http://corpus.rae.es/cordenet.html CORDE]), and [[Mark Davies (linguist)|Davies]]'s ''[http://www.corpusdelespanol.org/x.asp Corpus del Español]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
Although the mathematical notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]] was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as [[abscissa]], [[ordinate]], [[tangent]], [[chord (geometry)|chord]], and the [[Normal (geometry)|perpendicular]].&lt;ref&gt;Struik (1969), 367&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, "function" lost these geometrical associations.

Leibniz realized that the coefficients of a system of [[linear equation]]s could be arranged into an array, now called a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], which can be manipulated to find the solution of the system, if any. This method was later called [[Gaussian elimination]]. Leibniz also discovered [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and [[symbolic logic]], also relevant to algebra.

===Abstract algebra===
The ability to do algebra is a skill cultivated in [[mathematics education]]. As explained by Andrew Warwick, [[Cambridge University]] students in the early 19th century practiced "mixed mathematics",&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'', Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]]  {{isbn|0-226-87374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; doing [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]]s  based on physical variables such as space, time, and weight. Over time the association of [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s with physical quantities faded away as mathematical technique grew. Eventually mathematics was concerned completely with abstract [[polynomial]]s, [[complex number]]s, [[hypercomplex number]]s and other concepts. Application to physical situations was then called [[applied mathematics]] or [[mathematical physics]], and the field of mathematics expanded to include [[abstract algebra]]. For instance, the issue of [[constructible number]]s showed some mathematical limitations, and the field of [[Galois theory]] was developed.

==The father of algebra==
The [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] mathematician [[Diophantus]] has traditionally been known as "the father of algebra"&lt;ref name="Carl Boyer For Al Khwarizmi"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 228}} "Diophantus sometimes is called "the father of algebra," but this title more appropriately belongs to Abu Abdullah bin mirsmi al-Khwarizmi. It is true that in two respects the work of al-Khwarizmi represented a retrogression from that of Diophantus. First, it is on a far more elementary level than that found in the Diophantine problems and, second, the algebra of al-Khwarizmi is thoroughly rhetorical, with none of the syncopation found in the Greek ''Arithmetica'' or in Brahmagupta's work. Even numbers were written out in words rather than symbols! It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Derbyshire For Diophantus"&gt;{{Harv|Derbyshire|2006|loc="The Father of Algebra" p. 31}} "Diophantus, the father of algebra, in whose honor I have named this chapter, lived in Alexandria, in Roman Egypt, in either the 1st, the 2nd, or the 3rd century CE."&lt;/ref&gt; but debate now exists as to whether or not [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] deserves this title instead.&lt;ref name="Carl Boyer For Al Khwarizmi"/&gt; Those who support Diophantus point to the fact that the algebra found in ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Jabr]]'' is more elementary than the algebra found in ''[[Arithmetica]]'' and that ''Arithmetica'' is syncopated while ''Al-Jabr'' is fully rhetorical.&lt;ref name="Carl Boyer For Al Khwarizmi" /&gt;

Those who support Al-Khwarizmi point to the fact that he gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230}} "The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khwarizmi's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions."&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first to teach algebra in an [[Elementary algebra|elementary form]] and for its own sake, whereas Diophantus was primarily concerned with the [[number theory|theory of numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Gandz and Saloman (1936), ''The sources of al-Khwarizmi's algebra'', Osiris i, p. 263–277: "In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called "the father of algebra" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers".&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi also introduced the fundamental concept of "reduction" and "balancing" (which he originally used the term ''al-jabr'' to refer to), referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229/&gt; Other supporters of Al-Khwarizmi point to his algebra no longer being concerned "with a series of [[problem]]s to be resolved, but an [[Expository writing|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study." They also point to his treatment of an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong/&gt;

'''Hyperstructures''' are [[algebraic structure]]s equipped with at least one [[multi-valued]] operation, called a ''hyperoperation''. The largest classes of the hyperstructures are the ones called ''Hv'' – structures.

A hyperoperation (*) on a non-empty set ''H'' is a mapping from ''H''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''H'' to [[power set]] ''P''*(''H'') (the set of all non-empty subsets of ''H''), i.e.

(*): ''H'' × ''H'' → ''P''*(''H''): (''x'', ''y'') → ''x''*''y'' ⊆ ''H''.

If ''Α'', ''Β'' ⊆ ''Η'' then we define

: ''A''*''B'' = &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{a \in A, b\in B} (a \star b)&lt;/math&gt; and ''A''*''x'' = ''A''*{''x''}, ''x''*''B'' = {''x''}* ''B''.

(''Η'',*) is a ''semihypergroup'' if (*) is an [[associative]] hyperoperation, i.e. ''x''*(''y''*''z'') = (''x''*''y'')*''z'', for all ''x'',''y'',''z'' of ''H''.
Furthermore, a ''hypergroup'' is a semihypergroup (''H'', *), where the [[reproduction axiom]] is valid, i.e. ''a''*''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''H''*''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''H'', for all ''a'' of ''H''.

'''Jovan Karamata''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Карамата}}; February 1, 1902 – August 14, 1967) was [[Serbia]]n [[mathematician]]. He is remembered for contributions to [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], in particular, the [[abelian and tauberian theorems|Tauberian theory]] and the theory of [[slowly varying function]]s. Considered to be among the most influential Serbian mathematicians&lt;ref name="maric"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marić|first=V.|year=2002|title=Jovan Karamata (1902–1967)|journal=Mat. Vesnik|volume=54|issue=1&amp;ndash;2|pages=45&amp;ndash;51|mr=1958493}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 20th century, Karamata was one of the founders of the Mathematical Institute of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], established in 1946.

== Life ==
Jovan Karamata was born in [[Zagreb]] on February 1, 1902 into a family descended from merchants based in the city of [[Zemun]], which was then in [[Austria-Hungary]], and now in [[Serbia]]. Being of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] origin, the family traced its roots back to [[Pyrgoi]], [[Eordaia]], [[West Macedonia]] ''(his father Ioannis Karamatas was the president of the "Greek Community of Zemun")''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/2010/06/21/ellinikes-paroikies-proin-yugoslavi/ The Greek Communities in former Yugoslavia (17th - 20th century) republication of article of ''Kathimerini'' newspaper, from 12th of July 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Its business affairs on the borders of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires were very well known. In 1914, he finished most of his primary school in Zemun but because of constant warfare on the borderlands, Karamata's father sent him, together with his brothers and his sister, to [[Switzerland]] for their own safety. In [[Lausanne]], 1920, he finished primary school oriented towards mathematics and sciences. In the same year he enrolled at the Engineering faculty of [[Belgrade University]] and, after several years moved to the Philosophy and Mathematicians sector, where he graduated in 1925.

He spent the years 1927–1928 in [[Paris]], as a fellow of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and in 1928 he became Assistant for Mathematics at the Faculty of Philosophy of Belgrade University. In 1930 he became Assistant Professor, in 1937 Associate Professor and, after the end of [[World War II]], in 1950 he became Full Professor. In 1951 he was elected Full Professor at the [[University of Geneva]]. In 1933 he became a member of [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]], Czech Royal Society in 1936, and Serbian Royal Academy in 1939 as well as a fellow of Serbian Academy of Sciences in 1948. He was one of the founders of the ''Mathematical Institute'' of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1946.

Karamata was member of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] mathematical societies, the French Association for the Development of Science, and the primary editor of the journal ''L’Enseignement Mathématique'' in [[Geneva]]. He also taught at the [[University of Novi Sad]].

In 1931 he married Emilija Nikolajevic, who gave birth to their two sons and a daughter. His wife died in 1959. After a long illness, Karamata died on August 14, 1967 in Geneva. His ashes rest in his native town of Zemun.&lt;ref name=maric/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Karamata published 122 scientific papers, 15 monographs and text-books as well as 7 professional-pedagogical papers.&lt;ref name=nik&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.|last=Nikolić|url=http://www.dmi.uns.ac.rs/NSJOM/Papers/32_1/nsjom_32_1_001_005.pdf|title=Jovan Karamata (1902–1967)|journal=Novi Sad Journal of Mathematics|volume=32|year=2002|pages=1&amp;ndash;5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331085716/http://www.dmi.uns.ac.rs/NSJOM/Papers/32_1/nsjom_32_1_001_005.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karamata is best known for his work on [[mathematical analysis]]. He introduced the notion of [[regularly varying function]], and discovered a new class of theorems of [[Tauberian theorem|Tauberian]] type, today known as [[Karamata's tauberian theorem]]s. He also worked on [[Mercer's theorem]]s, [[Froullani]]’s integrals, and other topics in analysis. In 1935 he introduced the brackets and braces notation for [[Stirling numbers]] (analogous to the [[binomial coefficients]] notation), which is now known as [[Karamata notation]].  He is also cited for [[Karamata's inequality]].

In Serbia, Karamata founded the "Karamata's (Yugoslav) school of mathematics”. Today, Karamata is the most frequently cited Serbian mathematician. He is the developer and co-developer of dozens of mathematical theorems and has had  a lasting influence in 20th-century mathematics.&lt;ref name=nik/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">The '''Kendall tau rank distance''' is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] that counts the number of pairwise disagreements between two ranking lists. The larger the distance, the more dissimilar the two lists are. Kendall tau distance is also called '''bubble-sort distance''' since it is equivalent to the number of swaps that the [[bubble sort]] algorithm would take to place one list in the same order as the other list. The Kendall tau distance was created by [[Maurice Kendall]].

==Definition==
The Kendall tau ranking distance between two lists &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;K(\tau_1, \tau_2) = |\{(i,j): i &lt; j, ( \tau_1(i) &lt; \tau_1(j) \wedge \tau_2(i) &gt; \tau_2(j) ) \vee ( \tau_1(i) &gt; \tau_1(j) \wedge \tau_2(i) &lt; \tau_2(j) )\}|.&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_1(i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2(i)&lt;/math&gt; are the rankings of the element &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

&lt;math&gt;K(\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to 0 if the two lists are identical and &lt;math&gt;n(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the list size) if one list is the reverse of the other. Often Kendall tau distance is normalized by dividing by &lt;math&gt;n(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; so a value of 1 indicates maximum disagreement. The normalized Kendall tau distance therefore lies in the interval [0,1].

Kendall tau distance may also be defined as

: &lt;math&gt;K(\tau_1,\tau_2) = \begin{matrix} \sum_{\{i,j\}\in P} \bar{K}_{i,j}(\tau_1,\tau_2) \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''P'' is the set of unordered pairs of distinct elements in &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;  
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{K}_{i,j}(\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; = 0 if ''i'' and ''j'' are in the same order in &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{K}_{i,j}(\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; = 1 if ''i'' and ''j'' are in the opposite order in &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Kendall tau distance can also be defined as the total number of [[discordant pairs]].

Kendall tau distance in Rankings: A permutation (or ranking) is an array of N integers where each of the integers between 0 and N-1 appears exactly once.
The Kendall tau distance between two rankings is the number of pairs that are in different order in the two rankings. For example, the Kendall tau distance between 0 3 1 6 2 5 4 and 1 0 3 6 4 2 5 is four because the pairs 0-1, 3-1, 2-4, 5-4 are in different order in the two rankings, but all other pairs are in the same order.&lt;ref&gt;http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/25applications/&lt;/ref&gt;

If Kendall tau function is performed as &lt;math&gt;K(L1,L2)&lt;/math&gt; instead of  &lt;math&gt;K(\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; are the rankings of &lt;math&gt;L1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L2&lt;/math&gt; elements respectively), then triangular inequality is not guaranteed. The triangular inequality fails in cases where there are repetitions in the lists. So then we are not any more dealing with a metric.

==Example==
Suppose we rank a group of five people by height and by weight:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person !! A !! B !! C !! D !! E
|-
! Rank by Height
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
|-
! Rank by Weight
| 3 || 4 || 1 || 2 || 5
|}

Here person A is tallest and third-heaviest, and so on.

In order to calculate the Kendall tau distance, pair each person with every other person and count the number of times the values in list 1 are in the opposite order of the values in list 2.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pair !! Height !! Weight !! Count
|-
! (A,B)
| 1 &lt; 2 || 3 &lt; 4 ||
|-
! (A,C)
| 1 &lt; 3 || 3 &gt; 1 || '''X'''
|-
! (A,D)
| 1 &lt; 4 || 3 &gt; 2 || '''X'''
|-
! (A,E)
| 1 &lt; 5 || 3 &lt; 5 ||
|-
! (B,C)
| 2 &lt; 3 || 4 &gt; 1 || '''X'''
|-
! (B,D)
| 2 &lt; 4 || 4 &gt; 2 || '''X'''
|-
! (B,E)
| 2 &lt; 5 || 4 &lt; 5 ||
|-
! (C,D)
| 3 &lt; 4 || 1 &lt; 2 ||
|-
! (C,E)
| 3 &lt; 5 || 1 &lt; 5 ||
|-
! (D,E)
| 4 &lt; 5 || 2 &lt; 5 ||
|}

Since there are 4 pairs whose values are in opposite order, the Kendall tau distance is 4. The normalized Kendall tau distance is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{5(5 - 1)/2} = 0.4.&lt;/math&gt;

A value of 0.4 indicates that 40% of pairs differ in ordering between the two lists.

== Computing the Kendall tau distance ==
Given two rankings &lt;math&gt;\tau_1,\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to rename the items such that &lt;math&gt;\tau_1 = (1,2,3,...)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the problem of computing the Kendall tau distance reduces to computing the number of ''inversions'' in &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; --- the number of index pairs &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;i&lt;j&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\tau_2(i) &gt; \tau_2(j)&lt;/math&gt;. There are several algorithms for calculating this number.
* A simple algorithm based on [[merge sort]] requires time &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ionescu|first1=Vlad|title=calculating the number of “inversions” in a permutation|url=http://stackoverflow.com/a/6523781/827927|website=Stack overflow|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A more advanced algorithm requires time &lt;math&gt;O(n\sqrt{\log{n}})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|doi=10.1137/1.9781611973075.15|chapter=Counting Inversions, Offline Orthogonal Range Counting, and Related Problems|title=Proceedings of the Twenty-First Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms|pages=161|year=2010|last1=Chan|first1=Timothy M.|last2=Pătraşcu|first2=Mihai|isbn=978-0-89871-701-3|citeseerx=10.1.1.208.2715}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Python scipy.stats library contains a function for calculating Kendall's tau which also handles ties in rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kendalltau.html|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology''' (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of [[systems biology]] models, their characterization and interrelationships. KiSAO is part of the [[BioModels.net]] project and of the [[COMBINE]] initiative.&lt;ref name="10.1038/msb.2011.77" /&gt;

==Structure==
KiSAO consists of three main branches:
* simulation algorithm,
* simulation algorithm characteristic,
* simulation algorithm parameter.
The elements of each algorithm branch are linked to characteristic and parameter branches using ''has characteristic'' and ''has parameter'' relationships accordingly.The algorithm branch itself is hierarchically structured using ''subClassOf'' relationships, which denote that the descendant algorithms were derived from, or specify, more general ancestors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">In [[differential equation]]s, the '''Laplace invariant''' of any of certain [[differential operator]]s is a certain function of the coefficients and their [[derivative]]s.  Consider a bivariate hyperbolic differential operator of the second order

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x \, \partial_y + a\,\partial_x + b\,\partial_y + c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

whose coefficients

:&lt;math&gt; a=a(x,y), \ \ b=c(x,y), \ \ c=c(x,y), &lt;/math&gt;

are smooth functions of two variables.  Its '''Laplace invariants'''  have the form

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}= c- ab -a_x \quad \text{and} \quad \hat{b}=c- ab  -b_y.&lt;/math&gt;

Their importance is due to the classical theorem:

'''Theorem''':  ''Two operators of the form are equivalent under [[gauge transformation]]s if and only if their Laplace invariants coincide pairwise.''

Here the operators
 
:&lt;math&gt;A \quad \text{and} \quad \tilde A&lt;/math&gt; 

are called ''equivalent'' if there is a [[gauge transformation]] that takes one to the other:

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde Ag= e^{-\varphi}A(e^{\varphi}g)\equiv A_\varphi g. &lt;/math&gt;

Laplace invariants can be regarded as factorization "remainders" for the initial operator ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x\, \partial_y + a\,\partial_x + b\,\partial_y + c = \left\{\begin{array}{c}
(\partial_x + b)(\partial_y + a) - ab - a_x + c ,\\
(\partial_y + a)(\partial_x + b) - ab - b_y + c .
\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

If at least one of Laplace invariants is not equal to zero, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; c- ab -a_x \neq 0 \quad \text{and/or} \quad
c- ab  -b_y  \neq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

then this representation is a first step of the [[Laplace–Darboux transformation]]s used for solving
''non-factorizable'' bivariate linear partial differential equations (LPDEs).

If both Laplace invariants are equal to zero, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; c- ab -a_x=0 \quad \text{and} \quad
c- ab  -b_y =0,&lt;/math&gt;

then the differential operator ''A'' is factorizable and corresponding linear partial differential equation of second order is solvable.

Laplace invariants have been introduced for a bivariate linear partial differential operator (LPDO) of order 2 and of hyperbolic type. They are a particular case of ''generalized invariants'' which can be constructed for a bivariate LPDO of arbitrary order and arbitrary type; see [[Invariant factorization of LPDOs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45002">This is an indexed list of the uniform and stellated polyhedra from the book ''Polyhedron Models'', by [[Magnus Wenninger]].

The book was written as a guide book to building polyhedra as physical models. It includes templates of face elements for construction and helpful hints in building, and also brief descriptions on the theory behind these shapes. It contains the 75 nonprismatic [[Uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]], as well as 44 [[Stellation|stellated forms]] of the convex regular and quasiregular polyhedra.

Models listed here can be cited as "Wenninger Model Number ''N''", or ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; for brevity.

The polyhedra are grouped in 5 tables: Regular (1–5), Semiregular (6–18), regular star polyhedra (20–22,41), Stellations and compounds (19–66), and uniform star polyhedra (67–119). ''The four regular star polyhedra are listed twice because they belong to both the uniform polyhedra and stellation groupings.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">In [[logic]], a '''logical framework''' provides a means to define (or present) a logic as a signature in a higher-order [[type theory]] in such a way that [[Provability logic|provability]] of a formula in the original logic reduces to a [[type inhabitation]] problem in the framework type theory.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart Jacobs|title=Categorical Logic and Type Theory|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-50853-9|page=598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabbay1994"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Dov M. Gabbay|title=What is a logical system?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqCu4XjHrIQC&amp;pg=PA382|year=1994|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-853859-2|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used successfully for (interactive) [[automated theorem proving]]. The first logical framework was [[Automath]]; however, the name of the idea comes from the more widely known Edinburgh Logical Framework, '''LF'''. Several more recent proof tools like [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]] are based on this idea.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2001"/&gt; Unlike a direct embedding, the logical framework approach allows many logics to be embedded in the same type system.&lt;ref name="BoveBarbosa2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ana Bove|author2=Luis Soares Barbosa|author3=Alberto Pardo|title=Language Engineering and Rigourous (sic) Software Development: International LerNet ALFA Summer School 2008, Piriapolis, Uruguay, February 24 - March 1, 2008, Revised, Selected Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOqHiA5MYpEC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-03152-6|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A logical framework is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules and proofs by means of a [[dependent type theory|dependently typed lambda calculus]]. Syntax is treated in a style similar to, but more general than [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s system of arities.

To describe a logical framework, one must provide the following:

# A characterization of the class of object-logics to be represented;
# An appropriate meta-language;
# A characterization of the mechanism by which object-logics are represented.

This is summarized by:

:"''Framework = Language + Representation''."

==LF==
In the case of the '''LF logical framework''', the meta-language is the [[λΠ-calculus]]. This is a system of first-order dependent function types which are related by the [[propositions as types principle]] to [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[minimal logic]]. The key features of the λΠ-calculus are that it consists of entities of three levels: objects, types and kinds (or type classes, or families of types). It is [[Impredicativity|predicative]], all well-typed terms are [[strongly normalizing]] and [[Church-Rosser]] and the property of being well-typed is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. However, [[type inference]] is undecidable.

A logic is represented in the '''LF logical framework''' by the judgements-as-types representation mechanism. This is inspired by [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s development of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s notion of [[judgement (mathematical logic)|judgement]], in the 1983 Siena Lectures. The two higher-order judgements, the hypothetical &lt;math&gt;J\vdash K&lt;/math&gt; and the general, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda x\in J. K(x)&lt;/math&gt;, correspond to the ordinary and dependent function space, respectively. The methodology of judgements-as-types is that judgements are represented as the types of their proofs. A [[logical system]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal L}&lt;/math&gt; is represented by its signature which assigns kinds and types to a finite set of constants that represents its syntax, its judgements and its rule schemes. An object-logic's rules and proofs are seen as primitive proofs of hypothetico-general judgements &lt;math&gt;\Lambda x\in C. J(x)\vdash K&lt;/math&gt;.

An implementation of the LF logical framework is provided by the [[Twelf]] system at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Twelf includes
* a logic programming engine
* meta-theoretic reasoning about logic programs (termination, coverage, etc.)
* an inductive [[meta-logic]]al theorem prover

In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''maxima and minima''' (the respective plurals of '''maximum''' and '''minimum''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], known collectively as '''extrema''' (the plural of '''extremum'''), are the largest and smallest value of the function, either within a given range (the '''local''' or '''relative''' extrema) or on the entire [[domain of a function]] (the '''global''' or '''absolute''' extrema).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Thomas | first1 = George B. | last2=Weir | first2= Maurice D. | last3=Hass | first3=Joel |author3-link = Joel Hass| authorlink=George B. Thomas | title=Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | year=2010 | edition=12th | isbn=0-321-58876-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre de Fermat]] was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, [[adequality]], for finding the maxima and minima of functions.

As defined in [[set theory]], the maximum and minimum of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] are the [[Greatest element|greatest and least elements]] in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of [[real number]]s, have no minimum or maximum.

==Definition==
A real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' defined on a [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''maximum point''' at ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. Similarly, the function has a '''global''' (or '''absolute''') '''minimum point''' at ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X''. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the '''maximum value''' of the function and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the '''minimum value''' of the function.

If the domain ''X'' is a [[metric space]] then ''f'' is said to have a '''local''' (or '''relative''') '''maximum point''' at the point ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if there exists some ''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0 such that ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;ge; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the function has a '''local minimum point''' at ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;le; ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;. A similar definition can be used when ''X'' is a [[topological space]], since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods.

In both the global and local cases, the concept of a '''strict''' extremum can be defined. For example, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''strict global maximum point''' if, for all ''x'' in ''X'' with ''x'' ≠ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, we have ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''f''(''x''), and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is a '''strict local maximum point''' if there exists some ''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0 such that, for all ''x'' in ''X'' within distance ''&amp;epsilon;'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; with ''x'' ≠ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, we have ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''f''(''x''). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points.

A [[Continuous function|continuous]] real-valued function with a [[Compact space|compact]] domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed (and bounded) [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[real number]]s (see the graph above).

==Finding functional maxima and minima==
Finding global maxima and minima is the goal of [[mathematical optimization]]. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the [[extreme value theorem]] global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the largest (or smallest) one.

Local extrema of differentiable functions can be found by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], which states that they must occur at [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s. One can distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum by using the [[first derivative test]], [[derivative test#Second derivative test (single variable)|second derivative test]], or [[higher-order derivative test]], given sufficient differentiability.

For any function that is defined [[piecewise]], one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is largest (or smallest).

==Examples==
[[Image:xth root of x.svg|thumb|right|The global maximum of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{x}&lt;/math&gt; occurs at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.]]
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a unique global minimum at ''x'' = 0.
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has no global minima or maxima.  Although the first derivative (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is 0 at ''x'' = 0, this is an [[inflection point]].
* The function &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[x]{x}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique global maximum at ''x'' = ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''. (See figure at right)
* The function x&lt;sup&gt;−x&lt;/sup&gt; has a unique global maximum over the positive real numbers at ''x'' = 1/''e''.
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3 − ''x'' has first derivative ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 and [[second derivative]] 2''x''.  Setting the first derivative to 0 and solving for ''x'' gives stationary points at −1 and +1.  From the sign of the second derivative we can see that −1 is a local maximum and +1 is a local minimum.  Note that this function has no global maximum or minimum.
* The function |''x''| has a global minimum at ''x'' = 0 that cannot be found by taking derivatives, because the derivative does not exist at ''x'' = 0.
* The function cos(''x'') has infinitely many global maxima at 0, ±2{{pi}}, ±4{{pi}}, ..., and infinitely many global minima at ±&amp;pi;, ±3&amp;pi;, ….
* The function 2 cos(''x'') − ''x'' has infinitely many local maxima and minima, but no global maximum or minimum.
* The function cos(3{{pi}}''x'')/''x'' with 0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;1.1 has a global maximum at ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0.1 (a boundary), a global minimum near ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0.3, a local maximum near ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0.6, and a local minimum near ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 1.0. (See figure at top of page.)
* The function ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''x'' + 1 defined over the closed interval (segment) [−4,2] has a local and maximum at ''x'' = −1−{{radic|15}}/3, a local minimum at ''x'' = −1+{{radic|15}}/3, a global maximum at ''x'' = 2 and a global minimum at ''x'' = −4.

==Functions of more than one variable==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Indifference curve]] --&gt;
{{main article|Second partial derivative test}}
[[File:Modell einer Peanoschen Fläche -Schilling XLIX, 1-.jpg|thumb|[[Peano surface]], a counterexample to some criteria of local maxima of the 19th century]]
For functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure at the right, the necessary conditions for a ''local'' maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first [[partial derivatives]] as to  ''z'' (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure).  The second partial derivatives are negative.  These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum because of the possibility of a [[saddle point]]. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function ''z'' must also be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] throughout. The [[second partial derivative test]] can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum.
In contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function ''f'' defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the [[intermediate value theorem]] and [[Rolle's theorem]] to prove this by [[reductio ad absurdum]]). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails, as the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y)= x^2+y^2(1-x)^3,\qquad x,y\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;
shows. Its only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with ƒ(0,0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. However, it cannot be a global one, because ƒ(2,3)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−5.

==Maxima or minima of a functional==
If the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions, i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]], the extremum is found using the [[calculus of variations]].

==In relation to sets==
Maxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an [[ordered set]] ''S'' has a [[greatest element]] ''m'', ''m'' is a [[maximal element]]. Furthermore, if ''S'' is a subset of an ordered set ''T'' and ''m'' is the greatest element of ''S'' with respect to order induced by ''T'', ''m'' is a [[supremum|least upper bound]] of ''S'' in ''T''. The similar result holds for [[least element]], [[minimal element]] and [[infimum|greatest lower bound]].

In the case of a general [[partial order]], the '''least element''' (smaller than all other) should not be confused with a '''minimal element''' (nothing is smaller).  Likewise, a '''[[greatest element]]''' of a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is an [[upper bound]] of the set which is contained within the set, whereas a '''maximal element''' ''m'' of a poset ''A'' is an element of ''A'' such that if ''m'' ≤ ''b'' (for any ''b'' in ''A'') then ''m'' = ''b''. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.  If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.

In a [[total order|totally ordered]] set, or ''chain'', all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element.  Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set we can simply use the terms '''''minimum''''' and '''''maximum'''''. If a chain is finite then it will always have a maximum and a minimum.  If a chain is infinite then it need not have a maximum or a minimum.  For example, the set of [[natural number]]s has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain ''S'' is bounded, then the [[topological closure|closure]] ''Cl(S)'' of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in such case they are called the '''greatest lower bound''' and the '''least upper bound''' of the set ''S'', respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8385">In [[mathematics]], the '''multinomial theorem''' describes how to expand a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of a sum in terms of powers of the terms in that sum. It is the generalization of the [[binomial theorem]] to polynomials.

==Theorem==
For any positive integer ''m'' and any nonnegative integer ''n'', the multinomial formula tells us how a sum with ''m'' terms expands when raised to an arbitrary power ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2  + \cdots + x_m)^n
 = \sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m=n} {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}
  \prod_{t=1}^m x_t^{k_t}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}
 = \frac{n!}{k_1!\, k_2! \cdots k_m!}&lt;/math&gt;
is a '''multinomial coefficient'''.  The sum is taken over all combinations of [[nonnegative]] [[integer]] indices ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the sum of all ''k''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is ''n''.  That is, for each term in the expansion, the exponents of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must add up to ''n''.  Also, as with the [[binomial theorem]], quantities of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; that appear are taken to equal 1 (even when ''x'' equals zero).

In the case ''m'' = 2, this statement reduces to that of the binomial theorem.

===Example===
The third power of the trinomial ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3 a^2 b + 3 a^2 c + 3 b^2 a + 3 b^2 c + 3 c^2 a + 3 c^2 b + 6 a b c.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be computed by hand using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, but it can also be done (perhaps more easily) with the multinomial theorem, which gives us a simple formula for any coefficient we might want. It is possible to "read off" the multinomial coefficients from the terms by using the multinomial coefficient formula. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 b^0 c^1 &lt;/math&gt; has the coefficient &lt;math&gt;{3 \choose 2, 0, 1} = \frac{3!}{2!\cdot 0!\cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a^1 b^1 c^1&lt;/math&gt; has the coefficient &lt;math&gt;{3 \choose 1, 1, 1} = \frac{3!}{1!\cdot 1!\cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 6&lt;/math&gt;.

===Alternate expression===
The statement of the theorem can be written concisely using [[multiindices]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1+\cdots+x_m)^n = \sum_{|\alpha|=n}{n \choose \alpha}x^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2\dots,\alpha_m)
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
x^\alpha=x_1^{\alpha_1} x_2^{\alpha_2} \dots x_m^{\alpha_m}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
This proof of the multinomial theorem uses the [[binomial theorem]] and [[Mathematical induction|induction]] on ''m''.

First, for ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, both sides equal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; since there is only one term ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' in the sum. For the induction step, suppose the multinomial theorem holds for ''m''.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_m+x_{m+1})^n = (x_1+x_2+\cdots+(x_m+x_{m+1}))^n &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;   = \sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_{m-1}+K=n}{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{m-1},K} x_1^{k_1}x_2^{k_2}\cdots x_{m-1}^{k_{m-1}}(x_m+x_{m+1})^K
&lt;/math&gt;
by the induction hypothesis.  Applying the binomial theorem to the last factor,
:&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_{m-1}+K=n}{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{m-1},K} x_1^{k_1}x_2^{k_2}\cdots x_{m-1}^{k_{m-1}}\sum_{k_m+k_{m+1}=K}{K\choose k_m,k_{m+1}}x_m^{k_m}x_{m+1}^{k_{m+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_{m-1}+k_m+k_{m+1}=n}{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{m-1},k_m,k_{m+1}} x_1^{k_1}x_2^{k_2}\cdots x_{m-1}^{k_{m-1}}x_m^{k_m}x_{m+1}^{k_{m+1}}
&lt;/math&gt;
which completes the induction.  The last step follows because
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{m-1},K}{K\choose k_m,k_{m+1}} = {n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{m-1},k_m,k_{m+1}},&lt;/math&gt;
as can easily be seen by writing the three coefficients using factorials as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \cdots k_{m-1}!K!} \frac{K!}{k_m! k_{m+1}!}=\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \cdots k_{m+1}!}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Multinomial coefficients==
The numbers
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}&lt;/math&gt;
appearing in the theorem are the [[Binomial coefficient#Generalization to multinomials|multinomial coefficients]].  They can be expressed in numerous ways, including as a product of [[binomial coefficient]]s or of [[factorial]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;
{n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} = \frac{n!}{k_1!\, k_2! \cdots k_m!} = {k_1\choose k_1}{k_1+k_2\choose k_2}\cdots{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m\choose k_m}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Sum of all multinomial coefficients===
The substitution of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for all ''i'' into the multinomial theorem
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m=n} {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} \cdots x_m^{k_m}
= (x_1 + x_2  + \cdots + x_m)^n&lt;/math&gt;
gives immediately that 
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m=n} {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} = m^n.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Number of multinomial coefficients===

The number of terms in a multinomial sum, #&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, is equal to the number of monomials of degree ''n'' on the variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\#_{n,m} = {n+m-1 \choose m-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The count can be performed easily using the method of [[Stars and bars (combinatorics)|stars and bars]].

===Valuation of multinomial coefficients===
The largest power of a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; that divides a multinomial coefficient may be computed using a generalization of [[Kummer's theorem]].

==Interpretations==

===Ways to put objects into bins===
The multinomial coefficients have a direct combinatorial interpretation, as the number of ways of depositing ''n'' distinct objects into ''m'' distinct bins, with ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; objects in the first bin, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; objects in the second bin, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dlmf.nist.gov/ |title=NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions |author=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=May 11, 2010 |at=[http://dlmf.nist.gov/26.4 Section 26.4] |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of ways to select according to a distribution===
In [[statistical mechanics]] and [[combinatorics]] if one has a number distribution of labels then the multinomial coefficients naturally arise from the binomial coefficients. Given a number distribution  {''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} on a set of ''N'' total items, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the number of items to be given the label ''i''.  (In statistical mechanics ''i'' is the label of the energy state.)

The number of arrangements is found by 
*Choosing ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the total ''N'' to be labeled 1.  This can be done &lt;math&gt;N\choose n_1&lt;/math&gt; ways.
*From the remaining ''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; items choose ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to label 2.  This can be done &lt;math&gt;N-n_1 \choose n_2&lt;/math&gt; ways.
*From the remaining ''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; items choose ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to label 3.  Again, this can be done &lt;math&gt;N-n_1-n_2 \choose n_3&lt;/math&gt; ways.

Multiplying the number of choices at each step results in:
:&lt;math&gt;{N \choose n_1}{N-n_1\choose n_2}{N-n_1-n_2\choose n_3}...=\frac{N!}{(N-n_1)!n_1!}\frac{(N-n_1)!}{(N-n_1-n_2)!n_2!}\frac{(N-n_1-n_2)!}{(N-n_1-n_2-n_3)!n_3!}....&lt;/math&gt;

Upon cancellation, we arrive at the formula given in the introduction.

===Number of unique permutations of words===
The multinomial coefficient is also the number of distinct ways to [[permutation|permute]] a [[multiset]] of ''n'' elements, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicities]] of each of the distinct elements. For example, the number of distinct permutations of the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI, which has 1 M, 4 Is, 4 Ss, and 2 Ps is
:&lt;math&gt;{11 \choose 1, 4, 4, 2} = \frac{11!}{1!\, 4!\, 4!\, 2!} = 34650.&lt;/math&gt;

(This is just like saying that there are 11! ways to permute the letters—the common interpretation of [[factorial]] as the number of unique permutations. However, we created duplicate permutations, because some letters are the same, and must divide to correct our answer.)

===Generalized Pascal's triangle===
One can use the multinomial theorem to generalize [[Pascal's triangle]] or [[Pascal's pyramid]] to [[Pascal's simplex]]. This provides a quick way to generate a lookup table for multinomial coefficients.

The Nyāya Sūtras is a Hindu text,{{refn|group=note|[[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]] states, "Nyaya is the traditional school of Hindu logic. In the early centuries BCE the Nyaya logicians undertook the project of describing the world in a coherent rational fashion and without reliance on revelation or a commitment to any particular deity. Nyaya's primary text, the Nyaya Sutras of Gautama, can be read as a neutral analysis neither favoring nor opposing the idea of God".&lt;ref&gt;Francis X Clooney (2001), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries between Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;}} notable for focusing on knowledge and logic, and making no mention of Vedic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 129; Quote: "In focusing on knowledge and logic, Gautama's Sutras made no mention of Vedic ritual".&lt;/ref&gt; The first book is structured as a general introduction and table of contents of sixteen categories of knowledge.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; Book two is about ''[[pramana]]'' (epistemology), book three is about ''prameya'' or the objects of knowledge, and the text discusses the nature of knowledge in remaining books.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; It set the foundation for Nyaya tradition of the empirical theory of validity and truth, opposing uncritical appeals to intuition or scriptural authority.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 3, 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nyaya sutras cover a wide range of topics, including Tarka-Vidyā, the science of debate or Vāda-Vidyā, the science of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 191–199, 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nyāya Sutras'' are related to but extend the [[Vaisheshika|{{IAST|Vaiśeṣika}}]] [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, pages 98, 103–104, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentaries expanded, expounded and discussed Nyaya sutras, the earlier surviving commentaries being by Vātsyāyana (c.450–500 CE), followed by the ''Nyāyavārttika'' of [[Uddyotakāra]] (c. 6th–7th centuries), [[Vācaspati Miśra]]'s ''Tātparyatīkā'' (9th century), [[Udayana]]'s ''Tātparyapariśuddhi'' (10th century), and [[Jayanta Bhatta|Jayanta]]'s ''Nyāyamañjarī'' (10th century).&lt;ref name=chakrabartinyaya14/&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteip8/&gt;

==Author and chronology==
{{Asian philosophy sidebar}}
The ''Nyaya-sutras'' is attributed to Gautama, who was at least the principal author.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; According to Karl Potter, this name has been a very common Indian name,&lt;ref name=potterteoip221/&gt; and the author is also reverentially referred to as Gotama, Dirghatapas and Aksapada Gautama.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; Little is known about Gautama, or which century he lived in. Scholarly estimates, based on textual analysis, vary from the 6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE, making him a contemporary of Buddha and Mahavira, to as late as the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century CE.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; Some scholars favor the theory that the cryptic text Nyaya-sutras was expanded over time by multiple authors,&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; with the earliest layer from about mid-first millennium BCE that was composed by Gautama.&lt;ref name=potterteoip221/&gt; The earliest layer is likely to be Book 1 and 5 of the text, while Book 3 and 4 may have been added last, but this is not certain.&lt;ref name=potterteoip221/&gt;

One may sum up the situation pretty safely by saying that we have not the vaguest idea who wrote the Nyayasutras or when he lived.|Karl Potter|The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies&lt;ref name=potterteoip221&gt;Karl Potter (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo0FeYVcOmUC The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology], Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is likely, states Jeaneane Fowler, that Nyaya and the science of reason stretch back into the Vedic era; it developed in the ancient Indian tradition that involved "dialectical tournaments, in the halls of kings and schools of Vedic philosophers", and Gautama was the one who distilled and systematized this pre-existing knowledge into [[sutra]]s, or aphoristic compilations called ''nyayasutras''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, pages 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nyaya school of Hinduism influenced all other schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], as well as Buddhism. Despite their differences, these scholars studied with each other and debated ideas, with Tibetan records suggesting that Buddhist scholars spent years residing with Hindu Nyaya scholars to master the art of reasoning and logic.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor130/&gt; This cooperation has enabled scholars to place the currently surviving version of the ''Nyayasutras'', to a [[terminus ante quem]] (completed before) date of about the 2nd century CE, because one of the most famous and established Buddhist scholars of that era, [[Nagarjuna]], explicitly states, "sutra 4.2.25 is addressed against the Madhyamika system" of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=potterteoip221/&gt; Other ancient Buddhist texts confirm that Nyayasutras existed before them, and the text is considered the primary text of old Nyaya school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=potterteoip222&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 221–223&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is written in ''sutra'' genre.

The Nyayasutra is divided into five books, each book subdivided into two chapters each.

The first sutra 1.1.1 of the text asserts its scope and the following sixteen categories of knowledge as a means to gain competence in any field of interest:&lt;ref name=potterteoip222/&gt;
{{Quote|
Perfection is attained by the correct knowledge about true nature of sixteen categories: means of right knowledge ([[pramāṇa]]); object of right knowledge (''prameya''); doubt (''samsaya''); purpose (''prayojana''); familiar instance (''dṛṣṭānta''); established tenet (''siddhānta''); members of an inference (''avayava''); reasoning (''tarka''); ascertainment or results (''nirṇaya''); discussion (''vāda''); sophistic disputations (''jalpa''); cavil (''vitaṇḍa''); fallacies (''hetvābhāsa''); quibbles ([[fraud|chala]]); futile rejoinders (''jāti''); and methods of losing an argument (''nigrahasthāna'').

These sixteen categories cover many sections of the text. The verse 1.1.2 of the ''Nyāya Sūtra'' declares the text's goal is to study and describe the attainment of liberation of soul from wrong knowledge, faults and sorrow, through the application of above sixteen categories of perfecting knowledge.&lt;ref name=potterteoip222/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chattopadhyaya, D. (1986).

===Means of attaining valid knowledge===
The Nyaya-sutras assert the premise that "all knowledge is not intrinsically valid", that "most knowledge is not valid unless proven" and "truth exists whether we human beings know it or not".&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 134-138&lt;/ref&gt; However, states Fowler, the text accepts the foundation that "some knowledge is self evident" and axiomatic in every field of knowledge, which can neither be proven nor needs proof, such as "I am conscious", "I think" and "soul exists".&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Dasgupta (1996), ''Yoga Philosophy: In Relation to Other Systems of Indian Thought'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120809093}}, pages 142–148&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the text presents its thesis that knowledge is not self-revealing, man must make effort to gain knowledge and this is a systematic process that empowers one to learn correct knowledge, and abandon incorrect knowledge.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillipsnyaya1&gt;Stephen Phillips (2014), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1138008816}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nyāya]] sutras asserts and then discusses four reliable means of obtaining knowledge (''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]]''), viz., Perception, Inference, Comparison and Reliable Testimony.&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteoipnyayafull/&gt;

====Pratyaksha: Perception====
The Nyayasutras assert that perception is the primary proper means of gaining true knowledge.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt; All other epistemic methods are directly or indirectly based on perception, according to the text, and anything that is claimed to be "true knowledge" must be confirmed or confirmable by perception.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt; This it terms as the doctrine of convergence, and this doctrine includes direct or implied perception.&lt;ref name=phillipsnyaya1/&gt; Gautama defines perception as the knowledge that arises by the contact of one or more senses with an object or phenomenon.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteoip223&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; Gautama dedicates many sutras to discuss both the object and subject in the process of perception, and when senses may be unreliable. Erratic eyesight or other senses (''Avyabhicara'') can be a source of doubt or false knowledge, as can prejudgmental or prejudicial state of mind, states the Nyayasutras.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteoip223/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillipsnyaya1/&gt;

The text asserts ''Pratyaksa'' leads to ''Laukika'' or ordinary knowledge, where the five senses directly and clearly apprehend a reality, and this is true definite knowledge according to the text.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillipsnyaya1/&gt; It defines indefinite knowledge as one where there is doubt, and the text gives an example of seeing a distant stationary object in the evening and wondering whether it is a post or a man standing in the distance. In some of these cases, states Nyayasutras, correct knowledge is formulated by the principle of cumulative evidence.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt; ''Manas'' (mind) is considered an internal sense, in the text, and it can either lead to correct or incorrect knowledge depending on how it includes, excludes or integrates information.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt; These ideas are compiled, in later chapters of the text, into its treatise on ''Aprama'' (Theory on Errors).&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor134/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillipsnyaya1/&gt;

====Anumana: Inference====
{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote=
&lt;poem&gt;
Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception,
and is of three kinds:
a priori, a posteriori and commonly seen.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|source =— ''Nyayasutras'' 1.1.5&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushan and NL Sinha (1990), The Nyâya Sûtras of Gotama, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807488}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The epistemic rationale for inference as a reliable source of knowledge, and Nyaya's theory has been a major contribution to the diverse schools of Hinduism, and other schools looked up to Nyaya scholars for insights on correct knowledge and incorrect knowledge through inference.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt; The sections in Nyayasutras on inference blossomed into a treatise on [[syllogism]] over time.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt;

Nyayasutras defines inference as the knowledge that follows or derives from other knowledge. It always follows perception, states the text, and is a universal relation or essential principle. One form of inference is a ''Purvavat'', or as Fowler translates, "from cause to effect or a priori".&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt; Thus, if a path or road is wet or river is swollen, states the text, then "it has rained" is a valid knowledge.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt; The sutras assert that the "universal relationship" between the two is necessary for correct, reliable knowledge, that is "if in all cases of A, B is true, then one may correctly infer B whenever A is perceived".&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt; Further, there is a causal relation between the two, whether one knows or not of that cause, but inferred knowledge does not require one to know the cause for it to be valid knowledge, states Nyayasutra.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushan and NL Sinha (1990), The Nyâya Sûtras of Gotama, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807488}}, pages 55–70&lt;/ref&gt; The text states one must not confuse coexistence as a universal relation, and that while deduction and induction both are useful and valid means for gaining true knowledge, it lists rules when this method can lead to false knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, pages 142–144&lt;/ref&gt;

====Upamana: Comparison and analogy====
The word ''upamana'', states Fowler, is a compound of ''upa'' (similarity) and ''mana'' (knowledge).&lt;ref name=jflowerpor144&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), ''Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, pages 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; It is a means of gaining knowledge based on "similarity, comparison, analogy", and considered reliable in Nyaya and many schools of Hinduism (but not in Vaisheshika and Charvaka, or Buddhism).&lt;ref&gt;John A.

The Nyayasutras define ''upamana'' as the knowledge of a thing based on "its likeness to another thing which is familiar".&lt;ref name=jflowerpor144/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushana (1913, Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n27/mode/2up The Nyâya Sutras], The Sacred Book of the Hindus, Volume VIII, Bhuvaneshvar Asrama Press, pages 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from ''Anumana'' (inference) in lacking a direct or immediate causal relation.

====Shabda: Testimony and reliable sources====
''Śabda'' (Sanskrit: शब्द, Word), in ''Nyayasutras'', means relying on word, testimony of a reliable source.&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushana (1913, Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n29/mode/2up The Nyâya Sutras], The Sacred Book of the Hindus, Volume VIII, Bhuvaneshvar Asrama Press, pages 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;

This means of gaining correct knowledge is either spoken or written, but it is through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt;&lt;ref name=jflowerpor145/&gt; In addition to words, state the Nyayasutras, ''Shabda'' as a means of true knowledge depends on an agreed convention on what words mean, the structure of sentences, establishing context and their import.&lt;ref name=jflowerpor145/&gt; The source must be reliable and comprehensible, and the receiver of knowledge must be able to understand the knowledge therefrom.&lt;ref name=jflowerpor145/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JL Shaw (2000), Conditions for Understanding the Meaning of a Sentence: The Nyāya and the Advaita Vedānta, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 28, Issue 3, pages 273–293&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; The schools of Hindu philosophy have debated if, how and when reliability of source can be objectively established. Gautama, in the Nyayasutras, offers a description for a reliable source.&lt;ref name=jflowerpor145/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushana (1913, Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n29/mode/2up The Nyâya Sutras], The Sacred Book of the Hindus, Volume VIII, Bhuvaneshvar Asrama Press, pages 4–5, 37–39, 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools, such as [[Charvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' in the [[Vedas]] or anyone else, can never be a proper ''pramana''. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of proper Argument===
The text, in sutras 1.1.32 and 1.1.39 presents its theory of proper Argument, stating that it must include five members:&lt;ref name=potterteip224&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, page 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushan and NL Sinha (1990), The Nyâya Sûtras of Gotama, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807488}}, pages 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Pratijna'' – the proposition or hypothesis (that which needs to be proved or decided)
# ''Hetu'' – the reason (can be positive or negative)
# ''Udaharana'' – the example(s) (that which is independently confirmed or confirmable)
# ''Upanaya'' – the application (validity test, or example to the instance)
# ''Nigamana'' – the conclusion (either hypothesis is true or false or in doubt)

The text defines and aphoristically discusses each of these.&lt;ref name=potterteip224/&gt;

===Theory of doubt as incomplete knowledge===
The Nyayasutras define and discuss ''Samsaya'' (Sanskrit: संशय, doubt) in sutras 1.1.23, 2.1.1 to 2.1.7, 3.2.1, 4.2.4 among others.&lt;ref&gt;SC Vidyabhushan and NL Sinha (1990), The Nyâya Sûtras of Gotama, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807488}}, pages 10, 29–32, 105, 158&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion is similar to those found in other schools of Hindu philosophy, expands on the theory of doubt presented by Kanada in the [[Vaisheshika]] school, but disagrees with the [[Charvaka]] school's theory of doubt and consequent "there is no empirical knowledge ever".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 170–172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mohantydoubt198/&gt;

The theory of doubt, according to the Nyayasutras, starts with the premise that doubt is part of the human learning process and occurs when conflicting possibilities exist with regard to a cognized object.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor132/&gt; Doubt is neither error nor absence of knowledge, but a form of uncertainty and human struggle with probability when it faces incomplete or inconsistent information.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor132/&gt; It is a knowledge that is possibly partially valid and partially invalid, but doubt is a form of knowledge that has positive value.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor132/&gt; Doubt is an invitation to "proceed to further investigation", asserts the text. All four means of knowledge discovery (perception, inference, comparison and testimony) may be useful in this investigation, but doubt is both a psychological state and a means to knowledge, not in itself a valid knowledge, according to the sutras.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor132&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 132-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mohantydoubt198&gt;JN Mohanty (1970), Nyāya Theory of Doubt, Phenomenology and Ontology, Volume 37, {{ISBN|978-9401032544}}, pages 198–219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hetvabhasa, theory of errors===
The Nyayasutra defines error as knowledge, an opinion or a conclusion about something that is different from what it really is.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt; Gautama states in the text that the error is always in the process of cognition itself, or the "subjective self", and not in the object.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139/&gt;&lt;ref name=srao59/&gt; It is the duty of the knowledge-seeker to "test the validity of his knowledge", both in assumptions or through practice (experience), but neither the object of knowledge nor the knowledge itself is responsible for errors; only the knowledge-seeker and his process of cognition is.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor139&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=srao59&gt;S Rao (1998), Perceptual Error: The Indian Theories, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824819583}}, pages 59–72&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyaya theory shares ideas on the theory of errors with [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Mimamsa]] schools of Indian philosophies, states Rao, and these schools likely influenced each other.&lt;ref&gt;S Rao (1998), Perceptual Error: The Indian Theories, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824819583}}, pages 22–23, 21–44&lt;/ref&gt;

The text identifies and cautions against five kinds of fallacious reasoning (''hetvabhasa'') in sutra 1.2.4, discussing each in the sutras that follow, stating that these lead to false knowledge, in contrast to proper reasoning (''hetu''), which leads to true knowledge.&lt;ref name=perrettiplpxiv/&gt; The five fallacies or errors, according to Nyayasutras, are to be avoided, in addition to watching for debating tricks (''chala'') used by those whose aim isn't true knowledge.&lt;ref name=perrettiplpxiv&gt;Roy Perrett (2001), Indian Philosophy: Logic and philosophy of language, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336105}}, page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; The five forms of bogus reasoning identified by the text, states Ganeri, are:&lt;ref&gt;J Ganeri (2003), Philosophy in Classical India: An Introduction and Analysis, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415240352}}, pages 33–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K Ramasubramanian (2011), The Concept of Hetvābhāsa in Nyāya-śāstra, in ''Proof, Computation and Agency'', Volume 352, Springer Netherlands, {{ISBN|978-9400700796}}, pages 355–371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of causality===
The Nyayasutras dedicate many sections on causality and causal relations (''Karana'', Sanskrit: कारण), particularly Book 4.&lt;ref&gt;Bimal Krishna Matilal (1975), Causality in the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika School, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 25, No. 1, pages 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Dasgupta (2004), A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804128}}, pages 319–326&lt;/ref&gt; Causes, in Nyaya view states Fowler, are "antecedents of their effects invariably and unconditionally".&lt;ref name=jflowerpor150&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, pages 150–152&lt;/ref&gt; A specific effect is produced by a specific cause (plurality in causes accepted), and in Nyayasutras view a specific cause produces a specific effect and no other (plurality in effect, or contradictory effect is not accepted). The sutras assert that there cannot be reciprocity to a cause, either we misunderstand the cause or misapprehend the effect.&lt;ref name=jflowerpor150/&gt; The text rejects remote or supernatural causes, and rejects that qualities are causes. The text asserts that causes are immediately antecedent, causes exist before an effect in time, and to know something is to understand the effect and the specific cause(s).&lt;ref name=jflowerpor150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bimal Krishna Matilal (1975), Causality in the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika School, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 25, No. 1, pages 41–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The text identifies three types of causes – inherent or material cause (''Samavayi-karana''), non-inherent cause (''Asamavayi-karana''), and efficient cause (''Nimitta-karana'').&lt;ref&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Patristic-Sutra period, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805507}}, pages 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; These, it states, arise from ''Dravya'' (substance), ''Guna'' (quality) and ''Karma'' (action).&lt;ref name=jflowerpor150/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JL Shaw (2002), Causality: Sāmkhya, Bauddha and Nyāya, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 30, Issue 3, pages 213–270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of negatives===
The text seeds the theory of negative entities, where both being and non-being, presence and absence of something is considered correct and useful knowledge.&lt;ref name=chakrabartitne129&gt;KK Chakrabarti (1978), The Nyaya-Vaisesika theory of negative entities, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 6, No. 2, pages 129–144&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of book on a table or absence of particular color in a painting has a place in its epistemic process, in addition to positively verifiable characteristics of the table or a painting.&lt;ref name=chakrabartitne129/&gt;

===Atheism in Nyayasutras===
Early [[Nyaya]] school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the Nyayasutras and early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1–34&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including ''Ishvara''. Verses 19–21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt;

Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is God ([[Ishvara]]) and various arguments to prove the existence of ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X.

He was followed by [[Udayana]], who in his text ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'', interpreted "it" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as "human action" and "him" as "Ishvara", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara, a reasoning that fueled the debate and disagreements on God in Neo-Nyaya and other Hindu traditions of 2nd millennium CE.&lt;ref name=fxc2/&gt;&lt;ref name=csharma&gt;Sharma, C.

A large part of the third book of the Nyayasutras is dedicated to the premise and the nature of a Self (soul, atman) and its relation to knowledge, liberation from sorrow and inner freedom (moksha).&lt;ref name=fowleriph147/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 31–37, 95–96, 228–233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy: a form of Yoga===
The sutras 4.2.42 to 4.2.48 of Nyayasutras, states Stephen Phillips, state that "philosophy is a form of [[yoga]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144841}}, page 281 footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The text recommends [[Dhyana in Hinduism|yogic meditation]] in quiet places such as a forest, cave or sandy beach in sutra 4.2.42, that the knowledge seeker should purify one's soul by [[Yamas]], [[Niyama]]s and spiritualism of yoga in sutra 4.2.46.&lt;ref name=vidyabhushana137/&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteip237/&gt; Meditation is a treasured and recommended practice in the text, and extensively discussed by Nyaya scholars that followed Aksyapada Gautama.&lt;ref name=fowleriph157&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723943}}, page 157&lt;/ref&gt; Vatsyayana wrote in his commentary on Nyayasutras, for example, that meditation is that which enables the mind to contact one's soul, which is accompanied by a conscious eagerness to get at the truth, and such meditation is an essential practice to gain true knowledge.&lt;ref name=fowleriph157/&gt;

The Nyayasutras state that one must study the means of correct knowledge and hold discussions with the learned, sincere and unenvious fellow seekers of knowledge state sutras 4.2.47 and 4.2.48.&lt;ref name=vidyabhushana137/&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteip237/&gt; One must, translates Phillips, take into account "consideration of personal character as well as the nature of beliefs held by the opponent", in deciding the nature of one's discussions, according to Nyayasutras.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144841}}, pages 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, asserts the text, it is better to avoid arguing with hostile opponents and use methods of knowledge like "a fence is used to safeguard the growth of seeds".&lt;ref name=vidyabhushana137&gt;SC Vidyabhushana (1913, Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/NyayaSutra/nyaya_sutras_of_gautama#page/n161/mode/2up The Nyâya Sutras], The Sacred Book of the Hindus, Volume VIII, Bhuvaneshvar Asrama Press, pages 137–139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteip237&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, page 237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
The earliest surviving complete [[bhasya]] (review and commentary) on Nyaya Sutras is by Vatsyayana.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; This commentary itself inspired many secondary and tertiary ''bhasya''. Vatsyayana's commentary has been variously dated to be from the 5th century CE,&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; or much earlier around 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name=chakrabartinyaya14&gt;KK Chakrabarti (1999), Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind: The Nyaya Dualist Tradition, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791441718}}, pages 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Another often studied surviving commentary on the text is credited to Vacaspati Mishra from about 9th century CE.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt;

Other historical Indian commentaries and works inspired by Nyayasutras and which have survived into the modern era, include ''Nyaya-varttika'' by 6th-century Uddyotakara, ''Nyaya-bhasyatika'' by 6th-century Bhavivikta, another ''Nyaya-bhasyatika'' by 7th-century Aviddhakarna, ''Nyaya-bhusana'' by 9th-century Bhasarvajana, ''Nyaya-manjari'' by 9th-century [[Kashmir]] scholar Jayanta Bhatta, ''Nyaya-prakirnaka'' by 10th-century [[Vijayanagara Empire|Karnata]] scholar Trilocana, and ''Nyaya-kandali'' by 10th-century [[Bengal]] scholar Sridhara.&lt;ref name=chakrabartinyaya14/&gt;&lt;ref name=potterteip8&gt;Karl Potter (2004), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Indian metaphysics and epistemology, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, pages 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other commentaries are referenced in other Indian historical texts, but these manuscripts are either lost or yet to be found. Starting around 11th- to 12th century CE, Udayana wrote a primary work, that built upon and expanded the theories on reason found in Nyayasutras. Udayana's work created the foundation for Navya-Nyaya (new Nyaya) school.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor130/&gt; The Hindu scholar Gangesa of 13th- or 14th-century, integrated the Gautama's Nyayasutras and Udayana's Navya-Nyaya work, to create the influential ''[[Tattvacintāmaṇi]]'' text considered a masterpiece by scholars.&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1992), Review: Gadadhara's Theory of Objectivity, Philosophy East and West, Volume 42, Issue 4, page 669&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nyaya-sutras have been one of the foundations for the historic debate between Hinduism's premise that ultimate reality and atman (soul) exists, and Buddhism's premise that there is voidness and anatta (no-soul).&lt;ref&gt;P Bilimoria and JN Mohanty (2003), Relativism, Suffering and Beyond, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195662078}}, pages i–ix with Introduction and Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Ganeri (2012), The Self: Naturalism, Consciousness, and the First-Person Stance, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199652365}}, pages 162–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ganganatha Jha (1999 Reprint), Nyaya-Sutras of Gautama, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812642}}, pages 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; In Nyaya-sutra, the Buddhist premises and arguments to refute those premise are found in many chapters,{{refn|group=note|Nyayasutras' 3.2.10–17 present its argument against Buddhist "momentariness of everything", while sutras 4.1.37–40 challenge the "voidness of everything" premise of Buddhism, sutras 4.2.6–4.2.11 question its "whole is not separate from parts" premise, and sutras 4.2.26–37 present its refutation of Buddhism's "denial of objects and observed reality" premises.&lt;ref name=sadhukhan39/&gt;}} such as sutras of chapters 3.2, 4.1 and 4.2.&lt;ref name=sadhukhan39/&gt; The text has been influential in this debate, with the 2nd-century Buddhist scholar [[Nagarjuna]] states that the Nyaya school and Buddhism differ on their conception of Self (Atman) and their views on the [[Vedas]], and the sutra 4.2.25 of Nyayasutra is addressed against the Madhyamika system of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=potterteoip221/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Like other schools of Hinduism, the Nyaya school holds the premise, "Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth".

Nagarjuna's ''Madhyamika-karika'' targets Nyaya-sutra, among other Hindu texts, for his critique and in order to establish his doctrine of [[Anatta|no self]] and [[Shunya|voidness]].

The [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thesis that all things are negative in nature (inasmuch as a thing's nature is constituted by its differences from others) is rejected, as is the view that all things are eternal or that all things are noneternal. Both these latter views are untrue to experience.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[File:Fluorescein (2).jpg|thumb|[[Fluorescein]] aqueous solutions, diluted from 1–10,000 parts-per-million]]
In [[science]] and [[engineering]], the '''parts-per notation''' is a set of pseudo-units to describe small values of miscellaneous [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]], e.g. [[mole fraction]] or [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]. Since these [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] are quantity-per-quantity measures, they are pure numbers with no associated [[units of measurement]]. Commonly used are '''ppm''' (parts-per-million, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;}}), '''ppb''' (parts-per-billion, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;}}), '''ppt''' (parts-per-[[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]], {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and '''ppq''' (parts-per-quadrillion, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;}}). This notation is not part of the SI system and its meaning is ambiguous.

==Overview==
Parts-per notation is often used describing dilute solutions in [[chemistry]], for instance, the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water. The quantity “1&amp;nbsp;ppm” can be used for a mass fraction if a water-borne pollutant is present at one-millionth of a [[gram]] per gram of sample solution. When working with aqueous solutions, it is common to assume that the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Therefore, it is common to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 L of water. Consequently, 1 ppm corresponds to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 μg/L.

Similarly, parts-per notation is used also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]] to express the value of various proportional phenomena. For instance, a special metal alloy might expand 1.2 [[micrometre|micrometers]] per [[metre|meter]] of length for every [[Celsius|degree Celsius]] and this would be expressed as “''[[Coefficient of thermal expansion|α]]''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.2&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C.” Parts-per notation is also employed to denote the change, stability, or [[Standard deviation|uncertainty]] in measurements. For instance, the accuracy of land-survey distance measurements when using a [[laser rangefinder]] might be 1&amp;nbsp;millimeter per kilometer of distance; this could be expressed as “[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;ppm.”&lt;ref&gt;This is a simplified explanation. Laser rangefinders typically have a measurement [[granularity]] of one to ten millimeters; thus, the complete specification for distance measurement accuracy might read as follows:&amp;nbsp; Accuracy: ±(1&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;ppm). Consequently, a distance measurement of only a few meters would still have an accuracy of ±1&amp;nbsp;mm in this example.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts-per notations are all [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]: in mathematical expressions, the units of measurement always cancel. In fractions like “2 nanometers per meter” (2&amp;nbsp;n&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;/&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;nano&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;ppb&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.000&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;000&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;001)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so the [[quotient]]s are pure-number [[coefficient]]s with positive values less than&amp;nbsp;1. When parts-per notations, including the [[percent]] symbol (%), are used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expressions), they are still pure-number dimensionless quantities. However, they generally take the literal “parts per” meaning of a comparative ratio (e.g., “2&amp;nbsp;ppb” would generally be interpreted as “two parts in a billion parts”).&lt;ref name="BIPM"&gt;BIPM: [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-3-7.html 5.3.7 ''Stating values of dimensionless quantities, or quantities of dimension one]''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts-per notations may be expressed in terms of any unit of the same measure. For instance, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of a certain [[brass]] alloy, ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18.7&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C, may be expressed as 18.7&amp;nbsp;([[Micrometre|µm]]/m)/°C, or as 18.7&amp;nbsp;(µ[[Inch|in]]/in)/°C; the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of measure.&lt;ref&gt;In the particular case of coefficient of thermal expansion, the change to inches (one of the [[United States customary units|U.S. customary units]]) is typically also accompanied by a change to [[Fahrenheit|degrees Fahrenheit]]. Since a Fahrenheit-sized interval of temperature is only {{frac|5|9}} that of a Celsius-sized interval, the value is typically expressed as 10.4&amp;nbsp;(µin/in)/°F rather than 18.7&amp;nbsp;(µin/in)/°C.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a [[metering pump]] that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate ''[[Volumetric flow rate|Q]]&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;125&amp;nbsp;ppm, is doing so at a rate that may be expressed in a variety of volumetric units, including 125&amp;nbsp;µL/L, 125&amp;nbsp;µ[[Gallon|gal]]/gal, 125&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], etc.

===In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy===

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), [[chemical shift]] is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the instrument's magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely more than a few hundred Hz from the reference frequency, so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument's field strength.

==Parts-per expressions==&lt;!-- This specific section is linked from [[Uranium]] and other articles; please do not rename this section. In the following equivalencies, it is assumed that one xxxx of water has a volume of 0.05 ml (20 xxxx per milliliter).--&gt;
{{visualisation_parts_per.svg}}
*''One part per [[100 (number)|hundred]]'' is generally represented by the [[percent sign]] (%) and denotes one part [[percentage|per 100 parts]], one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about fifteen minutes out of one day.
{{anchor|Thousand}}
*''One part per [[thousand]]'' should generally be spelled out in full and '''not''' as "ppt" (which is usually understood to represent "parts per trillion"). It may also be denoted by the [[per mille|permille]] sign (‰). Note however, that specific disciplines such as oceanography, as well as educational exercises, do use the "ppt" abbreviation. "One part per thousand" denotes one part per 1000 parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about one and a half minutes out of one day.
*''One part per [[ten thousand]]'' is denoted by the [[Basis point#Permyriad|permyriad]] sign (‱). Although rarely used in science (ppm is typically used instead), one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per {{val|10000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about nine seconds out of one day.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, in [[finance]], the [[basis point]] is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates (although it can also be used in other cases where it is desirable to express quantities in hundredths of a percent). For instance, a change in an interest rate from 5.15% per annum to 5.35% per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points (per annum).&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS:

Unlike the % symbol, which constitutes a formatting exception to the rule of the SI, a space goes between the value and both the permille and permyriad symbols (‰ and {{unicode|‱}}). Besides adhering to the rule of the SI, this is also good technical writing practice as it helps to distinguish these two less-common symbols from the percent symbol.

--&gt; As with interest rates, the words "per annum" (or "per year") are often omitted. In that case, the basis point is a quantity with a dimension of (time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/basis-points-bps-definition/|title=What are Basis Points (BPS)?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''One part per [[million]]'' ('''ppm''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, {{sfrac|{{val|1000000}}}} × 100% = 0.0001% (or 1% = {{val|10000}} ppm), and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about 32 seconds out of a year; in [[distance measurement]], it is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;mm of error per km of distance traversed.
{{anchor|ppb}}
*''One part per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]'' ('''ppb''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, {{sfrac|{{val|1000000000}}}} × 100% = {{val|0.0000001}}% (or 1% = {{val|10000000}} ppb) and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about three seconds out of a [[century]].
{{anchor|ppt}}
*''One part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]'' ('''ppt''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about thirty seconds out of every million years.
{{anchor|ppq}}
*''One part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]]'' ('''ppq''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about two and a half minutes out of the [[age of the Earth]] (4.5 billion years). Although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry, measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed.&lt;ref&gt;
Measurements of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] are routinely made at the ''sub''-ppq level. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) currently sets a hard limit of 30&amp;nbsp;ppq for dioxin in drinking water but once recommended a voluntary limit of 0.013&amp;nbsp;ppq. Also, radioactive contaminants in drinking water, which are quantified by measuring their radiation, are often reported in terms of ppq; 0.013&amp;nbsp;ppq is equivalent to the thickness of a sheet of paper versus a journey of {{val|146000}} trips around the world.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE REGARDING {{val|146000}} TRIPS AROUND THE WORLD:

The analogy of paper thickness vs. 146k trips around the world may be so wildly counterintuitive that the statement might seemingly be in error, but please do not change the statement without first understanding the below math (shown here with excess precision):

Paper thickness = 0.0030 inch = 0.0000762 m (0.003 × 25.4 mm/inch ÷ 1000 mm/m)
Earth’s mean circumference = 40,041,470 m

In then follows that…
[[Image:Image-Olympic Pool Munich 1972, color adj.jpg|thumb|right|300px|One part per trillion (1 ppt) is a proportion equivalent to a drop of water diluted into 400 [[Olympic-size swimming pool]]s.]]

In [[science]] and [[engineering]], the '''parts-per notation''' is a set of pseudo-units to describe

146,386.7 trips × 40,041,470 m × 0.013E-15 = 0.0000762 m = 0.0030 inch = paper thickness
--&gt;

== Criticism ==

Although the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (an international standards organization known also by its [[France|French]]-language initials BIPM) recognizes the use of parts-per notation, it is not formally part of the [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt; Note that although “[[Percentage|percent]]” (%) is not formally part of the SI, both the BIPM and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] take the position that ''“in mathematical expressions, the internationally recognized symbol % (percent) may be used with the SI to represent the number 0.01”'' for dimensionless quantities.&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantities and units'' - Part 0: ''General principles'', ISO 31-0:1992.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]], ''“a continued source of annoyance to unit purists has been the continued use of percent, ppm, ppb, and ppt.”''&lt;ref name="IUPAP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on recent Committee activities on behalf of IUPAP to the 1999 IUPAP General Assembly |author-first=Brian W. |author-last=Petley |date=September 1998 |url=http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html&lt;!-- http://www.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html --&gt; |access-date=2017-08-15 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815113700/http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html |archive-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[#SI-compliant expressions|SI-compliant expressions]] should be used as an alternative, the parts-per notation remains nevertheless widely used in technical disciplines. The main problems with the parts-per notation are the following:

=== Long and short scales ===

Because the [[Names of large numbers|named numbers]] starting with a “[[Long and short scales|billion]]” have different values in different countries, the BIPM suggests avoiding the use of “ppb” and “ppt” to prevent misunderstanding. The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) takes the stringent position, stating that ''“the language-dependent terms [ .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ] are not acceptable for use with the SI to express the values of quantities.”''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.3em"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIST: ''[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.10.3 Rules and Style Conventions for Expressing Values of Quantities: 7.10.3 ppm, ppb, and ppt]''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

=== Thousand vs. trillion ===

Although "ppt" usually means "parts per trillion", it occasionally means "parts per thousand". Unless the meaning of "ppt" is defined explicitly, it has to be determined from the context.

=== Mass fraction vs. mole fraction vs. volume fraction ===

Another problem of the parts-per notation is that it may refer to [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], [[mole fraction]] or [[volume fraction]]. Since it is usually not stated which quantity is used, it is better to write the unit as kg/kg, mol/mol or m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (even though they are all dimensionless).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is quite significant when dealing with gases and it is very important to specify which quantity is being used. For example, the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas [[CFC-11]] in air. For volume fraction, the suffix "V" or "v" is sometimes appended to the parts-per notation (e.g., ppmV, ppbv, pptv).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA On-line Tools for Site Assessment Calculation: Indoor Air Unit Conversion|url=http://www.epa.gov/athens/learn2model/part-two/onsite/ia_unit_conversion.html|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton R. Beychok|title=Fundamentals of Stack Gas Dispersion|url=http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html|article=Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas|publisher=Milton R. Beychok|edition=4th|isbn=0964458802|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, ppbv and pptv are also often used for mole fractions (which is identical to volume fraction only for ideal gases).

To distinguish the mass fraction from volume fraction or mole fraction, the letter w (standing for weight) is sometimes added to the abbreviation (e.g., ppmw, ppbw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Introduction to Green Engineering|url=https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/CE_2050_F12/2012/08/23/units/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the parts-per notation is generally quite fixed inside most specific branches of science, leading some researchers to draw the conclusion that their own usage (mass/mass, mol/mol, volume/volume, or others) is the only correct one. This, in turn, leads them to not specify their usage in their publications, and others may therefore misinterpret their results. For example, [[electrochemistry|electrochemists]] often use volume/volume, while [[Chemical engineering|chemical engineers]] may use mass/mass as well as volume/volume. Many academic papers of otherwise excellent level fail to specify their usage of the parts-per notation.

Note that the notations in the “SI units” column above are all [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]; that is, the units of measurement factor out in expressions like “1&amp;nbsp;nm/m” (1&amp;nbsp;n&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;/&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;nano&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) so the [[quotient]]s are pure-number [[coefficient]]s with values less than 1.

==Uno==
Because of the cumbersome nature of expressing certain dimensionless quantities per SI guidelines, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) in 1999 proposed the adoption of the special name "uno" (symbol: U) to represent the number 1 in dimensionless quantities.&lt;ref name="IUPAP"/&gt; This symbol is not to be confused with the always-italicized symbol for the variable "uncertainty" (symbol: ''U''). This unit name "uno" and its symbol could be used in combination with the [[SI prefix]]es to express the values of dimensionless quantities that are much less—or even ''greater''—than one.&lt;ref&gt;Certain mathematical functions can produce proportional quantities with values greater than 1.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parts-per notations in terms of the uno are given in the table below.

In 2004, a report to the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (known also by its French-language initials CIPM) stated that response to the proposal of the uno "had been almost entirely negative" and the principal proponent "recommended dropping the idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of the 16th meeting (13–14 May 2004) to the International Committee for Weights and Measures, of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |author=Consultative Committee for Units |date=13–14 May 2004 |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310054340/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the uno has not been adopted by any [[standards organization]] and it appears unlikely it will ever become an officially sanctioned way to express low-value (high-ratio) dimensionless quantities. The proposal was instructive, however, as to the perceived shortcomings of the current options for denoting dimensionless quantities.

==Improper applications==
Parts-per notation may properly be used only to express true dimensionless quantities; that is, the units of measurement ''must'' cancel in expressions like "1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg" so that the quotients are pure numbers with values less than 1. Mixed-unit quantities such as "a [[radon]] concentration of 15&amp;nbsp;p[[Curie|Ci]]/[[Litre|L]]" are not dimensionless quantities and may not be expressed using any form of parts-per notation, such as "15&amp;nbsp;ppt". Other examples of measures that are not dimensionless quantities are as follows:

* [[Particulate|Particulate matter]] in the air: 50&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; not 50&amp;nbsp;ppb.
* A [[stepper motor]]/gear system that produces a motion of 1&amp;nbsp;µm/pulse; not 1&amp;nbsp;ppm
* Mercury vapor concentration in air: 0.6&amp;nbsp;ng/[[Litre|L]]; not 0.6&amp;nbsp;ppt&lt;!--EDITORS NOTE: This example intentionally juxtaposes nano (one billionth) and ppt (parts per trillion) rather than ppb, as a lead-in to the below discussion regarding how what is commonly done with aqueous concentrations (where one liter of water has a mass of 1 kg) may not be done with air.--&gt;

Note however, that it is not uncommon to express aqueous concentrations—particularly in drinking-water reports intended for the general public—using parts-per notation (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm, 0.8&amp;nbsp;ppb, etc.) and further, for those reports to state that the notations denote milligrams per [[Litre|liter]] or micrograms per liter. Although "2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L" is not a dimensionless quantity, it is assumed in scientific circles that "2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg" (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm) is the true measure because one liter of water has a mass of about one kilogram. The goal in all [[technical writing]] (including drinking-water reports for the general public) is to clearly communicate to the intended audience with minimal confusion. Drinking water is intuitively a volumetric quantity in the public’s mind so measures of contamination expressed on a per-liter basis are considered to be easier to grasp. Still, it is technically possible, for example, to "dissolve" more than one liter of a very hydrophilic chemical in 1 liter of water; parts-per notation would be confusing when describing its solubility in water (greater than a million parts per million), so one would simply state the volume (or mass) that will dissolve into a liter, instead.

When reporting air-borne rather than water-borne densities, a slightly different convention is used since air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water. In water, 1&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is roughly equivalent to parts-per-trillion whereas in air, it is roughly equivalent to parts-per-billion. Note also, that in the case of air, this convention is much less accurate. Whereas one liter of water is almost exactly 1&amp;nbsp;kg, one cubic meter of air is often taken as 1.143&amp;nbsp;kg—much less accurate, but still close enough for many practical uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">In [[graph theory]], the [[strongly connected component]]s of a [[directed graph]] may be found using an algorithm that uses [[depth-first search]] in combination with two [[stack (data structure)|stacks]], one to keep track of the vertices in the current component and the second to keep track of the current search path.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sedgewick|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of this algorithm have been proposed by {{harvtxt|Purdom|1970}}, {{harvtxt|Munro|1971}}, {{harvtxt|Dijkstra|1976}}, {{harvtxt|Cheriyan|Mehlhorn|1996}}, and {{harvtxt|Gabow|2000}}; of these, Dijkstra's version was the first to achieve [[linear time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~hal/Papers/DFS/pbDFShistory.html History of Path-based DFS for Strong Components], Harold N. Gabow, accessed 2012-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The algorithm performs a depth-first search of the given graph ''G'', maintaining as it does two stacks ''S'' and ''P'' (in addition to the normal call stack for a recursive function).
Stack ''S'' contains all the vertices that have not yet been assigned to a strongly connected component, in the order in which the depth-first search reaches the vertices.
Stack ''P'' contains vertices that have not yet been determined to belong to different strongly connected components from each other. It also uses a counter ''C'' of the number of vertices reached so far, which it uses to compute the preorder numbers of the vertices.

When the depth-first search reaches a vertex ''v'', the algorithm performs the following steps:
#Set the preorder number of ''v'' to ''C'', and increment ''C''.
#Push ''v'' onto ''S'' and also onto ''P''.
#For each edge from ''v'' to a neighboring vertex ''w'':
#* If the preorder number of ''w'' has not yet been assigned, recursively search ''w'';
#*Otherwise, if ''w'' has not yet been assigned to a strongly connected component:
#**Repeatedly pop vertices from ''P'' until the top element of ''P'' has a preorder number less than or equal to the preorder number of ''w''.
#If ''v'' is the top element of ''P'':
#*Pop vertices from ''S'' until ''v'' has been popped, and assign the popped vertices to a new component.
#*Pop ''v'' from ''P''.

The overall algorithm consists of a loop through the vertices of the graph, calling this recursive search on each vertex that does not yet have a preorder number assigned to it.

==Related algorithms==
Like this algorithm, [[Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm]] also uses depth first search together with a stack to keep track of vertices that have not yet been assigned to a component, and moves these vertices into a new component when it finishes expanding the final vertex of its component. However, in place of the stack ''P'', Tarjan's algorithm uses  a vertex-indexed [[array (data type)|array]] of preorder numbers, assigned in the order that vertices are first visited in the [[depth-first search]]. The preorder array is used to keep track of when to form a new component.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">The '''prime signature''' of a number is the [[multiset]] of exponents of its [[prime factorization]]. The prime signature of a number having prime factorization &lt;math&gt;p_1^{m_1}p_2^{m_2} \dots p_n^{m_n}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left \{m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, all [[prime number]]s have a prime signature of {1}, the squares of primes have a prime signature of {2}, the products of 2 distinct primes have a prime signature of {1,1} and the products of a square of a prime and a different prime (e.g. 12,18,20,... ) have a prime signature of {2,1}.

== Properties ==

The [[divisor function]] τ(''n''), the [[Möbius function]] ''μ''(''n''), the number of distinct prime divisors ω(''n'') of ''n'', the number of prime divisors Ω(''n'') of ''n'', the [[indicator function]] of the [[squarefree integer]]s, and many other important functions in number theory, are functions of the prime signature of ''n''.

In particular, τ(''n'') equals the product of the incremented by 1 exponents from the prime signature of ''n''. 
For example, 20 has prime signature {2,1} and so the number of divisors is (2+1)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(1+1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Indeed, there are six divisors: 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;10 and&amp;nbsp;20.

The smallest number of each prime signature is a product of [[primorial]]s. The first few are:
:1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, 32, 36, 48, 60, 64, 72, 96, 120, 128, 144, 180, 192, 210, 216, ... {{OEIS|id=A025487}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13237">In [[mathematics]], a proof by '''infinite descent''' is a particular kind of [[proof by contradiction]] that relies on the [[least integer principle]]. One typical application is to show that a given equation has no solutions.

Typically, one shows that if a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more natural numbers, it would necessarily imply that a second solution existed, which was related to one or more 'smaller' natural numbers. This in turn would imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on. However, there cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers, and therefore by [[mathematical induction]] (repeating the same step) the original premise&amp;mdash;that any solution exists&amp;mdash; is incorrect: its correctness produces a [[contradiction]].

An alternative way to express this is to assume one or more solutions or examples exists. Then there must be a smallest solution or example&amp;mdash;a [[minimal counterexample]]. We then prove that if a smallest solution exists, it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense)&amp;mdash;which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction.

The earliest uses of the method of infinite descent appear in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']]. A typical example is Proposition 31 of Book 7, in which [[Euclid]] proves that every composite integer is divided (in Euclid's terminology "measured") by some prime number. 

The method was much later developed by [[Fermat]], who coined the term and often used it for [[Diophantine equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = Number Theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = [[Birkhäuser Verlag|Birkhäuser]] | year = 1984 | pages = 75–79 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two typical examples are showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and proving [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], which states that an odd prime ''p'' can be expressed as a sum of two [[square number|squares]] only when ''p''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;([[Modular arithmetic|mod]]&amp;nbsp;4) (see [[Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares#Euler.27s proof by infinite descent|proof]]). In some cases, to the modern eye, his "method of infinite descent" is an exploitation of the [[Inversive geometry|inversion]] of the doubling function for [[rational point]]s on an elliptic curve ''E''. The context is of a hypothetical non-trivial rational point on ''E''. Doubling a point on ''E'' roughly doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits), so that a "halving" a point gives a rational with smaller terms. Since the terms are positive, they cannot decrease forever. In this way Fermat was able to show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in [[arithmetic progression]]).

== Number theory==
In the [[number theory]] of the twentieth century, the infinite descent method was taken up again, and pushed to a point where it connected with the main thrust of [[algebraic number theory]] and the study of [[L-function]]s. The structural result of [[Mordell]], that the rational points on an elliptic curve ''E'' form a [[finitely-generated abelian group]], used an infinite descent argument based on ''E''/2''E'' in Fermat's style.

To extend this to the case of an [[abelian variety]] ''A'', [[André Weil]] had to make more explicit the way of quantifying the size of a solution, by means of a [[Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry#Height function|height function]] – a concept that became foundational. To show that ''A''(''Q'')/2''A''(''Q'') is finite, which is certainly a necessary condition for the finite generation of the group ''A''(''Q'') of rational points of ''A'', one must do calculations in what later was recognised as [[Galois cohomology]]. In this way, abstractly-defined cohomology groups in the theory become identified with ''descents'' in the tradition of Fermat. The [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] was at the start of what later became a very extensive theory.

== Application examples ==

=== Irrationality of {{radic|2}} ===
The proof that the [[square root of 2]] ({{radic|2}}) is [[irrational number|irrational]] (i.e. cannot be expressed as a fraction of two whole numbers) was discovered by the [[ancient Greek]]s, and is perhaps the earliest known example of a proof by infinite descent. [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is [[irrational number|irrational]]. Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of [[Hippasus]] of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie J. Morris, [http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt669/student.folders/morris.stephanie/emt.669/essay.1/pythagorean.html "The Pythagorean Theorem"], Dept. of Math. Ed., [[University of Georgia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Clegg, [http://nrich.maths.org/2671 "The Dangerous Ratio ..."], Nrich.org, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt von Fritz, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1969021 "The discovery of incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum"], Annals of Mathematics, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; The square root of two is occasionally called "Pythagoras' number" or "Pythagoras' Constant", for example {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[ancient Greek]]s, not having [[algebra]], worked out a [[Square root of 2#Geometric proof|geometric proof]] by infinite descent ([[John Horton Conway]] presented another [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sq_root.shtml geometric proof (no. 8 ' ' ' )] by infinite descent that may be more accessible). The following is an [[algebra]]ic proof along similar lines:

Suppose that {{radic|2}} were [[rational number|rational]]. Then it could be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

for two natural numbers, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Then squaring would give

:&lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = p^2, &lt;/math&gt;

so 2 must divide ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Because 2 is a [[prime number]], it must also divide ''p'', by [[Euclid's lemma]]. So ''p'' = 2''r'', for some integer ''r''.

But then

:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^2 = 2r^2, &lt;/math&gt;

which shows that 2 must divide ''q'' as well. So ''q'' = 2''s'' for some integer ''s''.

This gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}=\frac{2r}{2s}=\frac{r}{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, if {{radic|2}} could be written as a rational number, it could always be written as a rational number with smaller parts, which itself could be written with yet-smaller parts, ''[[ad infinitum]]''. But [[Well-ordering principle|this is impossible in the set of natural numbers]].  Since {{radic|2}} is a [[real number]], which can be either rational or irrational, the only option left is for {{radic|2}} to be irrational.

(Alternatively, this proves that if {{radic|2}} were rational, no "smallest" representation as a fraction could exist, as any attempt to find a "smallest" representation ''p''/''q'' would imply a smaller one existed, which is a similar contradiction).

=== Irrationality of {{radic|''k''}} if it is not an integer ===

For positive integer ''k'', suppose that {{radic|''k''}} is not an integer, but is rational and can be expressed as &lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', and let ''q'' be the largest integer no greater than {{radic|''k''}}.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sqrt k &amp;=\frac mn\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m(\sqrt k-q)}{n(\sqrt k-q)}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m\sqrt k-mq}{n\sqrt k-nq}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{(n \sqrt k)\sqrt k-mq}{n (\frac{m}{n}) -nq}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{nk-mq}{m-nq}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The numerator and denominator were each multiplied by the expression ({{radic|''k''}} − ''q'')—which is positive but less than 1—and then simplified independently. So two resulting products, say ''m' '' and ''n' '', are themselves integers, which are less than ''m'' and ''n'' respectively.  Therefore, no matter what natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'' are used to express {{radic|''k''}}, there exist smaller natural numbers ''m' '' &lt; ''m'' and ''n' '' &lt; ''n'' that have the same ratio.  But infinite descent on the natural numbers is impossible, so this disproves the original assumption that {{radic|''k''}} could be expressed as a ratio of natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sagher | first = Yoram |date=February 1988 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 95 | page = 117 | title = What Pythagoras could have done | doi=10.2307/2323064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-solvability of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and its permutations===
{{See also|Fermat's right triangle theorem#Fermat's proof}}

The non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers is sufficient to show the non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;q^4 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers, which is a special case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the historical proofs of the latter proceeded by more broadly proving the former using infinite descent. The following more recent proof demonstrates both of these impossibilities by proving still more broadly that a [[Pythagorean triangle]] cannot have any two of its sides each either a square or twice a square, since there is no smallest such triangle:&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Stan, "Fermat's method of ''descente infinie''", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 95, July 2011, 269–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose there exists such a Pythagorean triangle. Then it can be scaled down to give a primitive (i.e., with no common factors other than 1) Pythagorean triangle with the same property. Primitive Pythagorean triangles' sides can be written as &lt;math&gt;x=2ab,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y=a^2-b^2,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;, with ''a'' and ''b'' [[coprime|relatively prime]] and with ''a+b'' odd and hence ''y'' and ''z'' both odd. The property that ''y'' and ''z'' are each odd means that neither  ''y'' nor ''z'' can be twice a square. Furthermore, if ''x'' is a square or twice a square, then each of ''a'' and ''b'' is a square or twice a square. There are three cases, depending on which two sides are postulated to each be a square or twice a square:

*'''''y'' and ''z''''': In this case ''y'' and ''z'' are both squares. But then the right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{yz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; also would have integer sides including a square leg (&lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;) and a square hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;), and would have a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).
*'''''z'' and ''x''''': ''z'' is a square. The integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; also would have two sides (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) each of which is a square or twice a square, and a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; compared to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
*'''''y'' and ''x''''': ''y'' is a square. The integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; would have two sides (''b'' and ''a'') each of which is a square or twice a square, with a smaller hypotenuse than the original triangle (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).

In any of these cases, one Pythagorean triangle with two sides each of which is a square or twice a square has led to a smaller one, which in turn would lead to a smaller one, etc.; since such a sequence cannot go on infinitely, the original premise that such a triangle exists must be wrong.

This implies that the equations
:&lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 = t^4,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^4 + s^2 =t^4,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;r^4 + s^4 =t^2&lt;/math&gt;
cannot have non-trivial solutions, since non-trivial solutions would give Pythagorean triangles with two sides being squares.

Usually this pattern is used by [[string searching algorithm]]s for "find" or "find and replace" operations on [[String (computer science)|strings]], or for input validation. It is a technique that developed in [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language]] theory.

The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] formalized the description of a ''[[regular language]]''. The concept came into common use with [[Unix]] text-processing utilities. Since the 1980s&lt;!---introduction of POSIX and Perl---&gt;, different [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntaxes]] for writing regular expressions exist, one being the [[POSIX]] standard and another, widely used, being the [[Perl]] syntax.

Regular expressions are used in [[search engine]]s, search and replace dialogs of [[word processor]]s and [[text editor]]s, in text processing utilities such as [[sed]] and [[AWK]] and in [[lexical analysis]]. Many [[programming language]]s provide regex capabilities, built-in or via [[Library (computing)|libraries]].&lt;!-- not too much info here. Put it into its own chapter--&gt;&lt;!--, built-in (for example [[Perl language structure#Regular expressions|Perl]], [[JavaScript]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[AWK]], and [[Tcl]]) and others via a [[standard library]] (for example [[.NET Framework|.NET languages]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C POSIX library#regex.h|POSIX C]], and [[C++]] since [[C++11#regex|C++11]]). Most other languages offer regexes via a library.--&gt;

==Patterns==
The phrase ''regular expressions'', and consequently, ''regexes'', is often used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax (distinct from the mathematical notation described below) for representing patterns for matching text. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a [[metacharacter]], having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning. For example, in the regex &lt;code&gt;a.&lt;/code&gt;, ''a'' is a literal character which matches just 'a', while  '.' is a meta character that matches every character except a newline. Therefore, this regex matches, for example, 'a ', or 'ax', or 'a0'. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify text of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it. Pattern matches may vary from a precise equality to a very general similarity, as controlled by the metacharacters. For example, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; is a very general pattern, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[a-z]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (match all lower case letters from 'a' to 'z') is less general and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a precise pattern (matches just 'a'). The metacharacter syntax is designed specifically to represent prescribed targets in a concise and flexible way to direct the automation of [[text processing]] of a variety of input data, in a form easy to type using a standard [[ASCII]] [[computer keyboard|keyboard]].

A very simple case of a regular expression in this syntax is to locate a word spelled two different ways in a [[text editor]], the regular expression &lt;code&gt;seriali[sz]e&lt;/code&gt; matches both "serialise" and "serialize". [[Wildcard character|Wildcards]] also achieve this, but are more limited in what they can pattern, as they have fewer metacharacters and a simple language-base.

The usual context of [[wildcard character]]s is in [[glob (programming)|globbing]] similar names in a list of files, whereas regexes are usually employed in applications that pattern-match text strings in general. For example, the regex &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;^[ \t]+|[ \t]+$&lt;/source&gt; matches excess whitespace at the beginning or end of a line. An advanced regular expression that matches any numeral is &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;[+-]?(\d+(\.\d+)?|\.\d+)([eE][+-]?\d+)?&lt;/source&gt;.

A '''regex processor''' translates a regular expression in the above syntax into an internal representation which can be executed and matched against a [[string (computing)|string]] representing the text being searched in. One possible approach is the [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] to construct a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA), which is then [[Powerset construction|made deterministic]] and the resulting [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) is run on the target text string to recognize substrings that match the regular expression.
The picture shows the NFA scheme &lt;code&gt;''N''(''s''*)&lt;/code&gt; obtained from the regular expression &lt;code&gt;''s''*&lt;/code&gt;, where ''s'' denotes a simpler regular expression in turn, which has already been [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] translated to the NFA ''N''(''s'').

==History==
Regular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] described [[regular language]]s using his mathematical notation called ''regular sets''.{{sfn|Kleene|1951}} These arose in [[theoretical computer science]], in the subfields of [[automata theory]] (models of computation) and the description and classification of [[formal language]]s. Other early implementations of [[pattern matching]] include the [[SNOBOL]] language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own pattern matching constructs.

Regular expressions entered popular use from 1968 in two uses: pattern matching in a text editor{{sfn|Thompson|1968}} and lexical analysis in a compiler.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}} Among the first appearances of regular expressions in program form was when [[Ken Thompson]] built Kleene's notation into the editor [[QED (text editor)|QED]] as a means to match patterns in [[text file]]s.{{sfn|Thompson|1968}}&lt;ref name="Beautiful Code Kernighan"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kernighan | first1 = Brian | authorlink1 = Brian Kernighan | title = Beautiful Code | chapter = A Regular Expressions Matcher | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | pages = 1–2 | url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html | accessdate = 2013-05-15 | isbn = 978-0-596-51004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |title=An incomplete history of the QED Text Editor |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dennis M. |publisher= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221023422/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html |archive-date=1999-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) to [[IBM 7094]] code on the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]], an important early example of JIT compilation.{{sfn|Aycock|2003|loc=2. JIT Compilation Techniques, 2.1 Genesis, p. 98}} He later added this capability to the Unix editor [[ed (text editor)|ed]], which eventually led to the popular search tool [[grep]]'s use of regular expressions ("grep" is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: &lt;code&gt;g/''re''/p&lt;/code&gt; meaning "Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/grep.html | title=Jargon File 4.4.7: grep | author=[[Eric S. Raymond|Raymond, Eric S.]] citing [[Dennis Ritchie]] | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Around the same time when Thompson developed QED, a group of researchers including [[Douglas T. Ross]] implemented a tool based on regular expressions that is used for [[lexical analysis]] in [[compiler]] design.{{sfn|Johnson|Porter|Ackley|Ross|1968}}

Many variations of these original forms of regular expressions were used in [[Unix]]{{sfn|Aho|Ullman|1992|loc=10.11 Bibliographic Notes for Chapter 10, p. 589}} programs at [[Bell Labs]] in the 1970s, including [[vi]], [[Lex programming tool|lex]], [[sed]], [[AWK]], and [[expr]], and in other programs such as [[Emacs]]. Regexes were subsequently adopted by a wide range of programs, with these early forms standardized in the [[POSIX.2]] standard in 1992.

In the 1980s the more complicated regexes arose in [[Perl]], which originally derived from a regex library written by [[Henry Spencer]] (1986), who later wrote an implementation of ''Advanced Regular Expressions'' for [[Tcl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/regexp81.html | title = New Regular Expression Features in Tcl 8.1 | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tcl library is a hybrid [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFA]]/[[Deterministic finite automaton|DFA]] implementation with improved performance characteristics. Software projects that have adopted Spencer's Tcl regular expression implementation include [[PostgreSQL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/functions-matching.html | title = PostgreSQL 9.3.1 Documentation: 9.7. Pattern Matching | accessdate = 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perl later expanded on Spencer's original library to add many new features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html | title=perlre: Perl regular expressions | author=[[Larry Wall|Wall, Larry]] and the Perl 5 development team | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not yet caught up with Spencer's Advanced Regular Expressions implementation in terms of performance or [[Unicode]] handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://perldoc.perl.org/perlreguts.html#Unicode-and-Localisation-Support | title = Unicode and Localisation Support | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html | title = Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast (but is slow in Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, …) | author = Russ Cox | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the effort in the design of [[Perl 6]] is to improve Perl's regex integration, and to increase their scope and capabilities to allow the definition of [[parsing expression grammar]]s.&lt;ref name="Apocalypse5"&gt;{{harvtxt|Wall|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a [[mini-language]] called [[Perl 6 rules]], which are used to define Perl 6 grammar as well as provide a tool to programmers in the language. These rules maintain existing features of Perl 5.x regexes, but also allow [[Backus–Naur form|BNF]]-style definition of a [[recursive descent parser]] via sub-rules.

The use of regexes in structured information standards for document and database modeling started in the 1960s and expanded in the 1980s when industry standards like [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|ISO SGML]] (precursored by ANSI "GCA 101-1983") consolidated. The kernel of the [[XML schema#Validation|structure specification language]] standards consists of regexes. Its use is evident in the [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] element group syntax.

Starting in 1997, [[Philip Hazel]] developed [[Perl Compatible Regular Expressions|PCRE]] (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), which attempts to closely mimic Perl's regex functionality and is used by many modern tools including [[PHP]] and [[Apache HTTP Server]].

Today regexes are widely supported in programming languages, text processing programs (particularly lexers), advanced text editors, and some other programs. Regex support is part of the [[standard library]] of many programming languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and [[ECMAScript]]. Implementations of regex functionality is often called a '''regex engine''', and a number of libraries are available for reuse.

==Basic concepts==
A regular expression, often called a '''pattern''', is an expression used to specify a [[Set (computer science)|set]] of strings required for a particular purpose. A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its [[Data element|elements]] or members. However, there are often more concise ways to specify the desired set of strings. For example, the set containing the three strings "Handel", "Händel", and "Haendel" can be specified by the '''pattern''' &lt;code&gt;H(ä|ae?)ndel&lt;/code&gt;; we say that this pattern '''matches''' each of the three strings. In most [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]s, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expression that also match it—the specification is not unique. Most formalisms provide the following operations to construct regular expressions.

;Boolean "or"
:A [[vertical bar]] separates alternatives. For example, {{code|lang=perl|code=gray{{!}}grey}} can match "gray" or "grey".
;Grouping
:[[Parentheses]] are used to define the scope and precedence of the [[Operator (programming)|operators]] (among other uses). For example, &lt;code&gt;gray|grey&lt;/code&gt; and {{code|lang=perl|code=gr(a{{!}}e)y}} are equivalent patterns which both describe the set of "gray" or "grey".
;Quantification
:A [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] after a [[Lexical analysis#Token|token]] (such as a character) or group specifies how often that a preceding element is allowed to occur. The most common quantifiers are the [[question mark]] &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, the [[asterisk]] &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (derived from the [[Kleene star]]), and the [[plus sign]] &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; ([[Kleene plus]]).
:{|
| style="width:15px; vertical-align:top;" | &lt;code&gt;'''?'''&lt;/code&gt;
|The question mark indicates ''zero or one'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;!--DON'T CHANGE THIS TO "colo?r"! REGULAR EXPRESSIONS DON'T WORK LIKE WILDCARDS!--&gt;&lt;!--Why not? Give reason in main context.!--&gt;colou?r&lt;/code&gt; matches both "color" and "colour".
|-
| style="vertical-align:top;" | &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;
|The asterisk indicates ''zero or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab*c&lt;/code&gt; matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on.
|-
| style="vertical-align:top;" | &lt;code&gt;'''+'''&lt;/code&gt;
|The plus sign indicates ''one or more'' occurrences of the preceding element. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab+c&lt;/code&gt; matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on, but not "ac".
|-
|&lt;code&gt;'''{n}'''&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="grep"&gt;grep(1) man page&lt;/ref&gt;
| The preceding item is matched exactly ''n'' times.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;'''{min,}'''&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="grep"/&gt;
| The preceding item is matched ''min'' or more times.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;'''{min,max}'''&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="grep"/&gt;
| The preceding item is matched at least ''min'' times, but not more than ''max'' times.
|}
;Wildcard
The wildcard &lt;code&gt;'''.'''&lt;/code&gt; matches any character. For example, &lt;code&gt;a.b&lt;/code&gt; matches any string that contains an "a", then any other character and then a "b", &lt;code&gt;a.*b&lt;/code&gt; matches any string that contains an "a" and a "b" at some later point.

These constructions can be combined to form arbitrarily complex expressions, much like one can construct arithmetical expressions from numbers and the operations '''+''', '''−''', '''×''', and '''÷'''. For example, &lt;code&gt;H(ae?|ä)ndel&lt;/code&gt; and {{code|lang=perl|code=H(a{{!}}ae{{!}}ä)ndel}} are both valid patterns which match the same strings as the earlier example, &lt;code&gt;H(ä|ae?)ndel&lt;/code&gt;.

The precise [[syntax]] for regular expressions varies among tools and with context; more detail is given in the [[#Syntax|''Syntax'']] section.

==Formal language theory==
Regular expressions describe [[regular language]]s in [[Formal language|formal language theory]]. They have the same expressive power as [[regular grammar]]s.

===Formal definition===
Regular expressions consist of constants, which denote sets of strings, and operator symbols, which denote operations over these sets. The following definition is standard, and found as such in most textbooks on formal language theory.&lt;ref name="HopcroftMotwaniUllman01"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sipser|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a finite [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] Σ, the following constants are defined
as regular expressions:
*(''empty set'') ∅ denoting the set ∅.
*(''[[empty string]]'') ε denoting the set containing only the "empty" string, which has no characters at all.
*(''[[string literal|literal character]]'') &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in Σ denoting the set containing only the character ''a''.

Given regular expressions R and S, the following operations over them are defined
to produce regular expressions:
* (''[[concatenation]]'') ''RS'' denotes the set of strings that can be obtained by concatenating a string in R and a string in S. For example, let R = {"ab", "c"}, and S = {"d", "ef"}. Then, RS = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}.
*(''[[alternation (formal language theory)|alternation]]'') ''R'' | ''S'' denotes the [[set union]] of sets described by ''R'' and ''S''. For example, if R describes {"ab", "c"} and S describes {"ab", "d", "ef"}, expression ''R'' | ''S'' describes {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}.
*(''[[Kleene star]]'') ''R''* denotes the smallest [[subset|superset]] of the set described by ''R'' that contains ε and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under string concatenation. This is the set of all strings that can be made by concatenating any finite number (including zero) of strings from the set described by ''R''. For example, {"0","1"}* is the set of all finite [[binary string]]s (including the empty string), and {"ab", "c"}* = {ε, "ab", "c", "abab", "abc", "cab", "cc", "ababab", "abcab", … }.

To avoid parentheses it is assumed that the Kleene star has the highest priority, then concatenation and then alternation. If there is no ambiguity then parentheses may be omitted. For example, &lt;code&gt;(ab)c&lt;/code&gt; can be written as &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;a|(b(c*))&lt;/code&gt; can be written as &lt;code&gt;a|bc*&lt;/code&gt;.
Many textbooks use the symbols ∪, +, or ∨ for alternation instead of the vertical bar.

'''Examples:'''
*&lt;code&gt;a|b*&lt;/code&gt; denotes {ε, "a", "b", "bb", "bbb", …}
*&lt;code&gt;(a|b)*&lt;/code&gt; denotes the set of all strings with no symbols other than "a" and "b", including the empty string: {ε, "a", "b", "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb", "aaa", …}
*&lt;code&gt;ab*(c|ε)&lt;/code&gt; denotes the set of strings starting with "a", then zero or more "b"s and finally optionally a "c": {"a", "ac", "ab", "abc", "abb", "abbc", …}
*&lt;code&gt;(0|(1(01*0)*1))*&lt;/code&gt; denotes the set of binary numbers that are multiples of 3: { ε, "0", "00", "11", "000", "011", "110", "0000", "0011", "0110", "1001", "1100", "1111", "00000", … }

===Expressive power and compactness===

The formal definition of regular expressions is purposely parsimonious and avoids defining the redundant quantifiers &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, which can be expressed as follows: &lt;code&gt;a+&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;aa*&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;a?&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;(a|ε)&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes the [[set complement|complement]] operator is added, to give a ''generalized regular expression''; here ''R&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'' matches all strings over Σ* that do not match ''R''. In principle, the complement operator is redundant, as it can always be circumscribed by using the other operators. However, the process for computing such a representation is complex, and the result may require expressions of a size that is [[Double exponential function|double exponentially]] larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gelade|Neven|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular expressions in this sense can express the regular languages, exactly the class of languages accepted by [[deterministic finite automata]]. There is, however, a significant difference in compactness. Some classes of regular languages can only be described by deterministic finite automata whose size grows [[exponential growth|exponentially]] in the size of the shortest equivalent regular expressions. The standard example here is the languages
''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' consisting of all strings over the alphabet {''a'',''b''} whose ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-from-last letter equals&amp;nbsp;''a''. On one hand, a regular expression describing ''L''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
&lt;math&gt;(a\mid b)^*a(a\mid b)(a\mid b)(a\mid b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Generalizing this pattern to ''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives the expression:
&lt;math&gt;(a\mid b)^*a\underbrace{(a\mid b)(a\mid b)\cdots(a\mid b)}_{k-1\text{ times}}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, it is known that every deterministic finite automaton accepting the language ''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' must have at least 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; states. Luckily, there is a simple mapping from regular expressions to the more general [[nondeterministic finite automata]] (NFAs) that does not lead to such a blowup in size; for this reason NFAs are often used as alternative representations of regular languages. NFAs are a simple variation of the type-3 [[formal grammar|grammars]] of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="HopcroftMotwaniUllman01"/&gt;

In the opposite direction, there are many languages easily described by a DFA that are not easily described a regular expression. For instance, determining the validity of a given [[ISBN]] number requires computing the modulus of the integer base 11, and can be easily implemented with an 11-state DFA. However, a regular expression to answer the same problem of divisibility by 11 is at least multiple megabytes in length.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Given a regular expression, [[Thompson's construction algorithm]] computes an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton. A conversion in the opposite direction is achieved by [[Kleene's algorithm]].

Finally, it is worth noting that many real-world "regular expression" engines implement features that cannot be described by the regular expressions in the sense of formal language theory; rather, they implement ''regexes''. See [[#Patterns for non-regular languages|below]] for more on this.

===Deciding equivalence of regular expressions===

As seen in many of the examples above, there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.

It is possible to write an [[algorithm]] that, for two given regular expressions, decides whether the described languages are equal; the algorithm reduces each expression to a [[minimal deterministic finite state machine]], and determines whether they are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (equivalent).

Algebraic laws for regular expressions can be obtained using a method by Gischer which is best explained along an example: In order to check whether (''X''+''Y'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and (''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; denote the same regular language, for all regular expressions ''X'', ''Y'', it is necessary and sufficient to check whether the particular regular expressions (''a''+''b'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; denote the same language over the alphabet Σ={''a'',''b''}. More generally, an equation ''E''=''F'' between regular-expression terms with variables holds if, and only if, its instantiation with different variables replaced by different symbol constants holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url= | author=Jay L. Gischer | institution=Stanford Univ., Dept. of Comp. Sc. | title=(Title unknown) | type=Technical Report | number=STAN-CS-TR-84-1033 | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-201-44124-1 | author=John E. Hopcroft and Rajeev Motwani and Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | location=Upper Saddle River/NJ | publisher=Addison Wesley | year=2003 }} Here: Sect.3.4.6, p.117-120. &amp;mdash; This property need not hold for extended regular expressions, even if they describe no larger class than regular languages; cf. p.121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The redundancy can be eliminated by using [[Kleene star]] and [[Union (set theory)|set union]] to find an interesting subset of regular expressions that is still fully expressive, but perhaps their use can be restricted.{{clarify|reason=I don't understand the preceding sentence: What is an 'interesting' subset? Does 'perhaps' indicate an open research problem, or what else does it mean? Is it possible to find for each regular expression an equaivalent one built solely from Kleene star and union?|date=February 2015}} This is a surprisingly difficult problem. As simple as the regular expressions are, there is no method to systematically rewrite them to some normal form. The lack of axiom in the past led to the [[star height problem]]. In 1991, [[Dexter Kozen]] axiomatized regular expressions as a [[Kleene algebra#History|Kleene algebra]], using equational and [[Horn clause]] axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kozen|1991}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Already in 1964, Redko had proved that no finite set of purely equational axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=V.N. Redko| url=http://umj.imath.kiev.ua/article/?article=10002 | title=On defining relations for the algebra of regular events| journal=Ukrainskii Matematicheskii Zhurnal| year=1964| volume=16| number=1 | pages=120–126}} (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
&lt;!-- header linked from Google Codesearch FAQ, please do not change --&gt;
A regex ''pattern'' matches a target ''string''. The pattern is composed of a sequence of ''atoms''. An atom is a single point within the regex pattern which it tries to match to the target string. The simplest atom is a literal, but grouping parts of the pattern to match an atom will require using &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; as metacharacters. Metacharacters help form: ''atoms''; ''quantifiers'' telling how many atoms (and whether it is a [[#Lazy_matching|''greedy'' quantifier]] or not); a logical OR character, which offers a set of alternatives, and a logical NOT character, which negates an atom's existence; and backreferences to refer to previous atoms of a completing pattern of atoms. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities.

Depending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are "escaped", i.e. preceded by an [[escape sequence]], in this case, the backslash &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;. Modern and POSIX extended regexes use metacharacters more often than their literal meaning, so to avoid "backslash-osis" or [[leaning toothpick syndrome]] it makes sense to have a metacharacter escape to a literal mode; but starting out, it makes more sense to have the four bracketing metacharacters &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt; be primarily literal, and "escape" this usual meaning to become metacharacters. Common standards implement both. The usual metacharacters are &lt;code&gt; {}[]()^$.|*+?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;. The usual characters that become metacharacters when escaped are &lt;code&gt;dswDSW&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;.

===Delimiters===
When entering a regex in a programming language, they may be represented as a usual string literal, hence usually quoted; this is common in C, Java, and Python for instance, where the regex &lt;code&gt;re&lt;/code&gt; is entered as &lt;code&gt;"re"&lt;/code&gt;. However, they are often written with slashes as [[delimiter]]s, as in &lt;code&gt;/re/&lt;/code&gt; for the regex &lt;code&gt;re&lt;/code&gt;. This originates in [[Ed (text editor)|ed]], where &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is the editor command for searching, and an expression &lt;code&gt;/re/&lt;/code&gt; can be used to specify a range of lines (matching the pattern), which can be combined with other commands on either side, most famously &lt;code&gt;g/re/p&lt;/code&gt; as in [[grep]] ("global regex print"), which is included in most [[Unix]]-based operating systems, such as [[Linux]] distributions. A similar convention is used in [[sed]], where search and replace is given by &lt;code&gt;s/re/replacement/&lt;/code&gt; and patterns can be joined with a comma to specify a range of lines as in &lt;code&gt;/re1/,/re2/&lt;/code&gt;. This notation is particularly well-known due to its use in [[Perl]], where it forms part of the syntax distinct from normal string literals. In some cases, such as sed and Perl, alternative delimiters can be used to avoid collision with contents, and to avoid having to escape occurrences of the delimiter character in the contents. For example, in sed the command &lt;code&gt;s,/,X,&lt;/code&gt; will replace a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, using commas as delimiters.

===Standards===

{{anchor|POSIX}}The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[POSIX]] standard has three sets of compliance: BRE (Basic Regular Expressions),&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 ''Information technology – Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) – Part 2: Shell and Utilities'', successively revised as ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002 ''Information technology – Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) – Part 2: System Interfaces'', ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003, and currently ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 ''Information technology – Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX®) Base Specifications, Issue 7''&lt;/ref&gt; ERE (Extended Regular Expressions), and SRE (Simple Regular Expressions). SRE is [[Deprecation|deprecated]],&lt;ref&gt;The Single Unix Specification (Version 2)&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of BRE, as both provide backward compatibility. The subsection below covering the ''character classes'' applies to both BRE and ERE.

BRE and ERE work together. ERE adds &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, and it removes the need to escape the metacharacters &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;, which are ''required'' in BRE. Furthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications. Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a "standard" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, GNU grep has the following options: "grep -E" for ERE, and "grep -G" for BRE (the default), and "grep -P" for Perl regexes.

Perl regexes have become a de facto standard, having a rich and powerful set of atomic expressions. Perl has no "basic" or "extended" levels. As in POSIX EREs, &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt; are treated as metacharacters unless escaped; other metacharacters are known to be literal or symbolic based on context alone. Additional functionality includes [[#Lazy matching|lazy matching]], [[backtracking]], named capture groups, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] patterns.

====POSIX basic and extended====

In the [[POSIX]] standard, Basic Regular Syntax ('''BRE''') requires that the [[metacharacter]]s &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt; be designated &lt;code&gt;\(\)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\{\}&lt;/code&gt;, whereas Extended Regular Syntax ('''ERE''') does not.

{| class="wikitable"

!&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches any single character (many applications exclude [[newline]]s, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, &lt;code&gt;a.c&lt;/code&gt; matches "abc", etc., but &lt;code&gt;[a.c]&lt;/code&gt; matches only "a", ".", or "c".
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/code&gt;
|A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, &lt;code&gt;[abc]&lt;/code&gt; matches "a", "b", or "c". &lt;code&gt;[a-z]&lt;/code&gt; specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from "a" to "z". These forms can be mixed: &lt;code&gt;[abcx-z]&lt;/code&gt; matches "a", "b", "c", "x", "y", or "z", as does &lt;code&gt;[a-cx-z]&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, if present) character within the brackets: &lt;code&gt;[abc-]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[-abc]&lt;/code&gt;. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) character: &lt;code&gt;[]abc]&lt;/code&gt;.
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;[^&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, &lt;code&gt;[^abc]&lt;/code&gt; matches any character other than "a", "b", or "c". &lt;code&gt;[^a-z]&lt;/code&gt; matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from "a" to "z". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;( )&lt;/code&gt;
|Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, &lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt;). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. '''BRE mode requires {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;\(&amp;nbsp;\)&lt;/code&gt;}}'''.
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches what the ''n''th marked subexpression matched, where ''n'' is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab*c&lt;/code&gt; matches "ac", "abc", "abbbc", etc. &lt;code&gt;[xyz]*&lt;/code&gt; matches "", "x", "y", "z", "zx", "zyx", "xyzzy", and so on. &lt;code&gt;(ab)*&lt;/code&gt; matches "", "ab", "abab", "ababab", and so on.
|- valign="top"
!{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;{''m'',''n''}&lt;/code&gt;}}
|Matches the preceding element at least ''m'' and not more than ''n'' times. For example, &lt;code&gt;a{3,5}&lt;/code&gt; matches only "aaa", "aaaa", and "aaaaa". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. '''BRE mode requires &lt;code&gt;{{nowrap|\{''m'',''n''\}}}&lt;/code&gt;'''.

|}

'''Examples:'''
*&lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; matches any three-character string ending with "at", including "hat", "cat", and "bat".
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches "hat" and "cat".
*&lt;code&gt;[^b]at&lt;/code&gt; matches all strings matched by &lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; except "bat".
*&lt;code&gt;[^hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches all strings matched by &lt;code&gt;.at&lt;/code&gt; other than "hat" and "cat".
*&lt;code&gt;^[hc]at&lt;/code&gt; matches "hat" and "cat", but only at the beginning of the string or line.
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]at$&lt;/code&gt; matches "hat" and "cat", but only at the end of the string or line.
*&lt;code&gt;\[.\]&lt;/code&gt; matches any single character surrounded by "[" and "]" since the brackets are escaped, for example: "[a]" and "[b]".
*&lt;code&gt;s.*&lt;/code&gt; matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: "s" and "saw" and "seed".

====POSIX extended====
The meaning of metacharacters [[escape character|escaped]] with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression ('''ERE''') syntax. With this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character. So, for example, &lt;code&gt;\(&amp;nbsp;\)&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\{&amp;nbsp;\}&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;{&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, support is removed for &lt;code&gt;\''n''&lt;/code&gt; backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Metacharacter
! Description
|- valign="top"
!&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab?c&lt;/code&gt; matches only "ac" or "abc".
|-
!&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;
|Matches the preceding element one or more times. For example, &lt;code&gt;ab+c&lt;/code&gt; matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on, but not "ac".
|-
!&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|The choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;abc|def&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; matches "abc" or "def".&lt;/td&gt;
|}

'''Examples:'''
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]?at&lt;/code&gt; matches "at", "hat", and "cat".
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]*at&lt;/code&gt; matches "at", "hat", "cat", "hhat", "chat", "hcat", "cchchat", and so on.
*&lt;code&gt;[hc]+at&lt;/code&gt; matches "hat", "cat", "hhat", "chat", "hcat", "cchchat", and so on, but not "at".
*&lt;code&gt;cat|dog&lt;/code&gt; matches "cat" or "dog".

POSIX Extended Regular Expressions can often be used with modern Unix utilities by including the [[command line]] flag &lt;var&gt;-E&lt;/var&gt;.

====Character classes====
The character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. For example, &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;[A-Z]&lt;/source&gt; could stand for the uppercase alphabet, and &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;\d&lt;/source&gt; could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.

When specifying a range of characters, such as &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;[a-Z]&lt;/source&gt; (i.e. lowercase ''&lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;a&lt;/source&gt;'' to uppercase ''&lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;z&lt;/source&gt;''), the computer's locale settings determine the contents by the numeric ordering of the character encoding. They could store digits in that sequence, or the ordering could be ''abc…zABC…Z'', or ''aAbBcC…zZ''. So the POSIX standard defines a character class, which will be known by the regex processor installed. Those definitions are in the following table:

POSIX character classes can only be used within bracket expressions. For example, &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;[[:upper:]ab]&lt;/source&gt; matches the uppercase letters and lowercase "a" and "b".

An additional non-POSIX class understood by some tools is &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;[:word:]&lt;/source&gt;, which is usually defined as &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;[:alnum:]&lt;/source&gt; plus underscore. This reflects the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that may be used in identifiers. The editor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] further distinguishes ''word'' and ''word-head'' classes (using the notation &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;\w&lt;/source&gt; and &lt;source lang="ragel" inline&gt;\h&lt;/source&gt;) since in many programming languages the characters that can begin an identifier are not the same as those that can occur in other positions.

Note that what the POSIX regex standards call ''character classes'' are commonly referred to as ''POSIX character classes'' in other regex flavors which support them. With most other regex flavors, the term ''character class'' is used to describe what POSIX calls ''bracket expressions''.

===Perl and PCRE===
{{seealso|Perl Compatible Regular Expressions}}
Because of its expressive power and (relative) ease of reading, many other utilities and programming languages have adopted syntax similar to Perl's—for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[.NET Framework]], and [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]]. Some languages and tools such as [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] and [[PHP]] support multiple regex flavors. Perl-derivative regex implementations are not identical and usually implement a subset of features found in Perl 5.0, released in 1994. Perl sometimes does incorporate features initially found in other languages, for example, Perl 5.10 implements syntactic extensions originally developed in [[PCRE]] and Python.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#PCRE%2fPython-Support | title= Perl Regular Expression Documentation |publisher=perldoc.perl.org | accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lazy matching===
In Python and some&lt;!---should be 'many', or 'most', or 'a few', or ...?---&gt; other implementations (e.g. Java), the three common quantifiers (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;) are [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] by default because they match as many characters as possible.&lt;ref name=py-re&gt;{{cite web|title=Regular Expression Syntax|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax|website=Python 3.5.0 documentation|publisher=[[Python Software Foundation]]|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regex &lt;code&gt;".+"&lt;/code&gt; applied to the string

 "Ganymede," he continued, "is the largest moon in the Solar System."

matches the entire line instead of matching only the first character, ". The aforementioned quantifiers may, however, be made ''lazy'' or ''minimal'' or ''reluctant'', matching as few characters as possible, by appending a question mark: &lt;code&gt;".+?"&lt;/code&gt; matches only &lt;code&gt;"Ganymede,"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=py-re/&gt;

However, this does not ensure that not the whole sentence is matched in some contexts.  The question-mark operator does not change the meaning of the dot operator, so this still can match the quotes in the input.  A pattern like &lt;code&gt;".*?" EOF&lt;/code&gt; will still match the whole input if this is the string

 "Ganymede," he continued, "is the largest moon in the Solar System." EOF

To ensure that the quotes cannot be part of the match, the dot has to be replaced, e. g. like this: &lt;code&gt;"[^"]*"&lt;/code&gt;  This will match a quoted text part without additional quotes in it.

===Possessive matching===
In Java, quantifiers may be made ''possessive'' by appending a plus sign, which disables backing off, even if doing so would allow the overall match to succeed:&lt;ref name=es-re&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential classes: Regular Expressions: Quantifiers: Differences Among Greedy, Reluctant, and Possessive Quantifiers|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/quant.html#difs|website=The Java Tutorials|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the regex &lt;code&gt;".*"&lt;/code&gt; applied to the string

 "Ganymede," he continued, "is the largest moon in the Solar System."

matches the entire line, the regex &lt;code&gt;".*+"&lt;/code&gt; does {{em|not match at all}}, because &lt;code&gt;.*+&lt;/code&gt; consumes the entire input, including the final &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, possessive quantifiers are most useful with negated character classes, e.g. &lt;code&gt;"[^"]*+"&lt;/code&gt;, which matches &lt;code&gt;"Ganymede,"&lt;/code&gt; when applied to the same string.

Possessive quantifiers are easier to implement than greedy and lazy quantifiers, and are typically more efficient at runtime.&lt;ref name=es-re/&gt;

==Patterns for non-regular languages==
Many features found in virtually all modern regular expression libraries provide an expressive power that far exceeds the [[regular language]]s. For example, many implementations allow grouping subexpressions with parentheses and recalling the value they match in the same expression (''{{visible anchor|backreferences}}''). This means that, among other things, a pattern can match strings of repeated words like "papa" or "WikiWiki", called ''squares'' in formal language theory. The pattern for these strings is &lt;code&gt;(.+)\1&lt;/code&gt;.

The language of squares is not regular, nor is it [[context-free language|context-free]], due to the [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]]. However, [[pattern matching]] with an unbounded number of backreferences, as supported by numerous modern tools, is still [[context-sensitive language|context sensitive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cezar Câmpeanu and Kai Salomaa, and Sheng Yu | title=A Formal Study of Practical Regular Expressions | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=14 | number=6 | pages=1007–1018 | url=http://137.149.157.5/Articles/index.php?aid=1&lt;!---This url was taken from Câmpeanu's publications page http://www.csit.upei.ca/~ccampeanu/Research/RJ---&gt;| date=Dec 2003 }} Theorem 3 (p.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many tools, libraries, and engines that provide such constructions still use the term ''regular expression'' for their patterns. This has led to a nomenclature where the term regular expression has different meanings in [[formal language|formal language theory]] and pattern matching. For this reason, some people have taken to using the term ''regex'', ''regexp'', or simply ''pattern'' to describe the latter. [[Larry Wall]], author of the Perl programming language, writes in an essay about the design of Perl 6:

{{bq|1="Regular expressions" […] are only marginally related to real regular expressions. Nevertheless, the term has grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here. I will, however, generally call them "regexes" (or "regexen", when I'm in an Anglo-Saxon mood).&lt;ref name="Apocalypse5"/&gt;}}

=={{anchor|Implementations}}Implementations and running times==
There are at least three different [[algorithm]]s that decide whether and how a given regex matches a string.

The oldest and fastest relies on a result in formal language theory that allows every [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to be transformed into a [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA). The DFA can be constructed explicitly and then run on the resulting input string one symbol at a time. Constructing the DFA for a regular expression of size ''m'' has the time and memory cost of [[Big O notation|''O'']](2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;), but it can be run on a string of size ''n'' in time ''O''(''n'').

An alternative approach is to simulate the NFA directly, essentially building each DFA state on demand and then discarding it at the next step. This keeps the DFA implicit and avoids the exponential construction cost, but running cost rises to ''O''(''mn''). The explicit approach is called the DFA algorithm and the implicit approach the NFA algorithm. Adding caching to the NFA algorithm is often called the "lazy DFA" algorithm, or just the DFA algorithm without making a distinction. These algorithms are fast, but using them for recalling grouped subexpressions, lazy quantification, and similar features is tricky.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvtxt|Cox|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Laurikari|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third algorithm is to match the pattern against the input string by [[backtracking]]. This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but this terminology can be confusing. Its running time can be exponential, which simple implementations exhibit when matching against expressions like {{code|lang=perl|code=(a{{!}}aa)*b}} that contain both alternation and unbounded quantification and force the algorithm to consider an exponentially increasing number of sub-cases. This behavior can cause a security problem called [[ReDoS|Regular expression Denial of Service]].

Although backtracking implementations only give an exponential guarantee in the worst case, they provide much greater flexibility and expressive power. For example, any implementation which allows the use of backreferences, or implements the various extensions introduced by Perl, must include some kind of backtracking. Some implementations{{which|date=June 2014}} try to provide the best of both algorithms by first running a fast DFA algorithm, and revert to a potentially slower backtracking algorithm only when a backreference is encountered during the match.

==Unicode==
In theoretical terms, any token set can be matched by regular expressions as long as it is pre-defined. In terms of historical implementations, regexes were originally written to use [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange|ASCII]] characters as their token set though regex libraries have supported numerous other [[character set]]s. Many modern regex engines offer at least some support for [[Unicode]]. In most respects it makes no difference what the character set is, but some issues do arise when extending regexes to support Unicode.

* '''Supported encoding'''. Some regex libraries expect to work on some particular encoding instead of on abstract Unicode characters. Many of these require the [[UTF-8]] encoding, while others might expect [[UTF-16]], or [[UTF-32]]. In contrast, Perl and Java are agnostic on encodings, instead operating on decoded characters internally.
* '''Supported Unicode range'''. Many regex engines support only the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], that is, the characters which can be encoded with only 16 bits. Currently (as of 2016) only a few regex engines (e.g., Perl's and Java's) can handle the full 21-bit Unicode range.
* '''Extending ASCII-oriented constructs to Unicode'''. For example, in ASCII-based implementations, character ranges of the form &lt;code&gt;[x-y]&lt;/code&gt; are valid wherever ''x'' and ''y'' have [[code point]]s in the range [0x00,0x7F] and codepoint(''x'') ≤ codepoint(''y''). The natural extension of such character ranges to Unicode would simply change the requirement that the endpoints lie in [0x00,0x7F] to the requirement that they lie in [0x0000,0x10FFFF]. However, in practice this is often not the case. Some implementations, such as that of [[Gawk (GNU package)|gawk]], do not allow character ranges to cross Unicode blocks. A range like [0x61,0x7F] is valid since both endpoints fall within the Basic Latin block, as is [0x0530,0x0560] since both endpoints fall within the Armenian block, but a range like [0x0061,0x0532] is invalid since it includes multiple Unicode blocks. Other engines, such as that of the [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] editor, allow block-crossing but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html#/%5B%5D |title=Vim documentation: pattern |publisher=Vimdoc.sourceforge.net |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Case insensitivity'''. Some case-insensitivity flags affect only the ASCII characters. Other flags affect all characters. Some engines have two different flags, one for ASCII, the other for Unicode. Exactly which characters belong to the POSIX classes also varies.
* '''Cousins of case insensitivity'''. As ASCII has case distinction, case insensitivity became a logical feature in text searching. Unicode introduced alphabetic scripts without case like [[Devanāgarī|Devanagari]]. For these, [[case sensitivity]] is not applicable. For scripts like Chinese, another distinction seems logical: between traditional and simplified. In Arabic scripts, insensitivity to [[IMFI|initial, medial, final, and isolated position]] may be desired. In Japanese, insensitivity between [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] is sometimes useful.
* '''Normalization'''. Unicode has [[Unicode#Combining characters|combining characters]]. Like old typewriters, plain letters can be followed by one or more non-spacing symbols (usually diacritics like accent marks) to form a single printing character, but also provides precomposed characters, i.e. characters that already include one or more combining characters. A sequence of a character + combining character should be matched with the identical single precomposed character. The process of standardizing sequences of characters + combining characters is called normalization.
* '''New control codes'''. Unicode introduced amongst others, [[byte order mark]]s and text direction markers. These codes might have to be dealt with in a special way.
* '''Introduction of character classes for Unicode blocks, scripts, and numerous other character properties'''. Block properties are much less useful than script properties, because a block can have code points from several different scripts, and a script can have code points from several different blocks.&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web
| title = UTS#18 on Unicode Regular Expressions, Annex A: Character Blocks
| url = http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Character_Blocks
| accessdate = 2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Perl]] and the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.util.regex|java/util/regex}} library, properties of the form &lt;code&gt;\p{InX}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\p{Block=X}&lt;/code&gt; match characters in block ''X'' and &lt;code&gt;\P{InX}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\P{Block=X}&lt;/code&gt; matches code points not in that block. Similarly, &lt;code&gt;\p{Armenian}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\p{IsArmenian}&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;\p{Script=Armenian}&lt;/code&gt; matches any character in the Armenian script. In general, &lt;code&gt;\p{X}&lt;/code&gt; matches any character with either the binary property ''X'' or the general category ''X''. For example, &lt;code&gt;\p{Lu}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\p{Uppercase_Letter}&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;\p{GC=Lu}&lt;/code&gt; matches any uppercase letter. Binary properties that are ''not'' general categories include &lt;code&gt;\p{White_Space}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\p{Alphabetic}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\p{Math}&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\p{Dash}&lt;/code&gt;. Examples of non-binary properties are &lt;code&gt;\p{Bidi_Class=Right_to_Left}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\p{Word_Break=A_Letter}&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\p{Numeric_Value=10}&lt;/code&gt;.

==Uses==
Regexes are useful in a wide variety of [[text processing]] tasks, and more generally [[string processing]], where the data need not be textual. Common applications include [[data validation]], [[data scraping]] (especially [[web scraping]]), [[data wrangling]], simple [[parsing]], the production of [[syntax highlighting]] systems, and many other tasks.

While regexes would be useful on Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s, processing them across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex. Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public. Notable exceptions: [[Google Code Search]], [[Exalead]]. Google Code Search has been shut down as of January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Google|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html|title=A fall sweep|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It used a trigram index to speed queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Russ|date=January 2012|url=https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html|title=Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index, or How Google Code Search Worked}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The specific syntax rules vary depending on the specific implementation, [[programming language]], or [[Library (computing)|library]] in use. Additionally, the functionality of regex implementations can vary between [[Software versioning|version]]s.

Because regexes can be difficult to both explain and understand without examples, interactive web sites for testing regexes are a useful resource for learning regexes by experimentation.
This section provides a basic description of some of the properties of regexes by way of illustration.

The following conventions are used in the examples.&lt;ref name="clarify000"&gt;The character 'm' is not always required to specify a [[Perl]] match operation. For example, &lt;code&gt;m/[^abc]/&lt;/code&gt; could also be rendered as &lt;code&gt;/[^abc]/&lt;/code&gt;. The 'm' is only necessary if the user wishes to specify a match operation without using a forward-slash as the regex [[delimiter]]. Sometimes it is useful to specify an alternate regex delimiter in order to avoid "[[delimiter collision]]". See '[http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html perldoc perlre]' for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

 metacharacter(s) ;; the metacharacters column specifies the regex syntax being demonstrated
 =~ m//           ;; indicates a regex '''match''' operation in Perl
 =~ s///          ;; indicates a regex '''substitution''' operation in Perl

Also worth noting is that these regexes are all Perl-like syntax. Standard [[#POSIX Basic Regular Expressions|POSIX]] regular expressions are different.

Unless otherwise indicated, the following examples conform to the [[Perl]] programming language, release 5.8.8, January 31, 2006. This means that other implementations may lack support for some parts of the syntax shown here (e.g. basic vs. extended regex, &lt;code&gt;\( \)&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, or lack of &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt; instead of [[POSIX]] &lt;code&gt;[:digit:]&lt;/code&gt;).

The syntax and conventions used in these examples coincide with that of other programming environments as well.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see ''[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[O'Reilly Media#In a Nutshell|in a Nutshell]]'', p. 213; ''[[Python (programming language)|Python]] Scripting for Computational Science'', p. 320; Programming [[PHP]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Induction==
{{main article|Induction of regular languages}}

Regular expressions can often be created ("induced" or "learned") based on a set of example strings. This is known as the [[induction of regular languages]], and is part of the general problem of [[grammar induction]] in [[computational learning theory]]. Formally, given examples of strings in a regular language, and perhaps also given examples of strings ''not'' in that regular language, it is possible to induce a grammar for the language, i.e., a regular expression that generates that language. Not all regular languages can be induced in this way (see [[language identification in the limit]]), but many can. For example, the set of examples {1, 10, 100}, and negative set (of counterexamples) {11, 1001, 101, 0} can be used to induce the regular expression 1⋅0* (1 followed by zero or more 0s).

==Education and early life==
Robin Gandy was born in the village of [[Rotherfield Peppard]], Oxfordshire, England.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; He was the son of Thomas Hall Gandy (1876–1948) and Ida Caroline née Hony (1885–1977) and great-great-grandson of the architect and artist [[Joseph Gandy]] (1771–1843).

Educated at [[Abbotsholme School]], Gandy took two years of the [[Mathematical Tripos]], at [[King's College, Cambridge]], before enlisting for military service in 1940. During [[World War II]] he worked on radio intercept equipment at [[Hanslope Park]], where [[Alan Turing]] was working on a speech [[encipherment]] project, and he became one of Turing's lifelong friends and associates. In 1946, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, then began studying for a [[PhD]] under Turing's supervision. He completed his thesis, ''On axiomatic systems in mathematics and theories in Physics'', in 1952.&lt;ref name=gandyphd/&gt; He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Career and research==
Gandy held positions at the [[University of Leicester]], the [[University of Leeds]], and the [[University of Manchester]]. Gandy was a visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] from 1966 to 1967, and held a similar position at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1968. In 1969, he moved to [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], where he became [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Mathematical Logic. One of the residential buildings of the college is now named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/stommy/2502650192/ | title=Robin Gandy Buildings, Wolfson | publisher=[[Flickr]] | accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his work in [[recursion theory]]. His contributions include the Spector–Gandy theorem, the Gandy Stage Comparison theorem, and the Gandy Selection Theorem. He also made a significant contribution to the [[History of the Church–Turing thesis#Gandy 1980: .22machine computation.22 as discrete.2C deterministic and limited to .22local causation.22 by the speed of light|understanding of the Church—Turing thesis]], and his generalisation of the [[Turing machine]] is called a Gandy machine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/docs/tech-reports/175_Sieg.pdf Wilfried Sieg, 2005, ''Church without dogma: axioms for computability,'' Carnegie Mellon University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandy died in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/robin.html Robin Gandy — The Alan Turing Scrapbook], [https://archive.is/20121224171734/http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/robin.html archived] at Archive.Today&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Simon Kirwan Donaldson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born 20 August 1957), is an [[England|English]] mathematician known for his work on the [[topology]] of smooth (differentiable) four-dimensional [[manifold]]s and [[Donaldson–Thomas theory]]. He is currently  a permanent member of the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]]&lt;ref name="scgp.stonybrook.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/bios/simon-donaldson|title=Simon Donaldson, Simons Center for Geometry and Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Professor in Pure Mathematics at [[Imperial College London]].

== Biography ==
Donaldson's father was an electrical engineer in the physiology department at the [[University of Cambridge]], and his mother earned a science degree there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&amp;twoid=12&amp;threeid=41&amp;fourid=22&amp;fiveid=11 Simon Donaldson Autobiography, The Shaw Prize, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Donaldson gained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[mathematics]] from [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] in 1979, and in 1980 began postgraduate work at [[Worcester College, Oxford]], at first under [[Nigel Hitchin]] and later under [[Michael Atiyah]]'s supervision. Still a postgraduate student, Donaldson proved in 1982 a result that would establish his fame. He published the result in a paper "Self-dual connections and the topology of smooth 4-manifolds" which appeared in 1983. In the words of Atiyah, the paper "stunned the mathematical world" (Atiyah 1986).

Whereas [[Michael Freedman]] classified topological four-manifolds, Donaldson's work focused on four-manifolds admitting a [[differentiable structure]], using [[instantons]], a particular solution to the equations of [[Yang–Mills]] [[gauge theory]] which has its origin in [[quantum field theory]]. One of Donaldson's first results gave severe restrictions on the [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] of a smooth four-manifold. As a consequence, a large class of the topological four-manifolds do not admit any [[smooth structure]] at all. Donaldson also derived polynomial invariants from [[gauge theory]]. These were new topological invariants sensitive to the underlying smooth structure of the four-manifold. They made it possible to deduce the existence of "exotic" smooth structures—certain topological four-manifolds could carry an infinite family of different smooth structures.

After gaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree from [[Oxford University]] in 1983, Donaldson was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], he spent the academic year 1983–84 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], and returned to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as [[Wallis Professor of Mathematics]] in 1985. After spending one year visiting [[Stanford University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/d/1854/Simon+Kirwan.aspx Biography at DeBretts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620191352/http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/d/1854/Simon+Kirwan.aspx |date=20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to [[Imperial College London]] in 1998.

In 2014, he joined the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.&lt;ref name="scgp.stonybrook.edu"/&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Donaldson received the [[Junior Whitehead Prize]] from the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1985 and in the following year he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and, also in 1986, he received a [[Fields Medal]]. He was awarded the 1994 [[Crafoord Prize]].

In February 2006, Donaldson was awarded the King Faisal International Prize for science for his work in pure mathematical theories linked to physics, which have helped in forming an understanding of the laws of matter at a subnuclear level.

In April 2008, he was awarded the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]], a mathematics prize awarded by [[Northwestern University]].

In 2009 he was awarded the [[Shaw Prize]] in Mathematics (jointly with [[Clifford Taubes]]) for their contributions to geometry in 3 and 4 dimensions.

In 2010, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="kva"&gt;[http://www.kva.se/en/News/2010/New-foreign-members-elected-to-the-academy/ New foreign members elected to the academy], press announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2010-05-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Donaldson was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2012 [[New Year Honours]] for services to mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60009 |date=31 December 2011 |page=1 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, he was awarded the degree "Docteur Honoris Causa" by [[Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble]].

In 2014 he was awarded the [[Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics]] "for the new revolutionary invariants of 4-dimensional manifolds and for the study of the relation between stability in algebraic geometry and in global differential geometry, both for bundles and for Fano varieties."&lt;ref&gt;[https://breakthroughprize.org/?controller=Page&amp;action=news&amp;news_id=18], retrieved 2014-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, he was awarded the degree "DOCTOR HONORIS CAUSA" by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

In January 2019, he will be awarded the [[Oswald Veblen Prize]] in Geometry (jointly with [[Xiuxiong Chen]] and [[Song Sun]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=4705 Oswald Veblen Prize 2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donaldson's work==
Donaldson's work is on the application of [[mathematical analysis]] (especially the analysis of elliptic [[partial differential equations]]) to problems in geometry. The problems mainly concern [[4-manifold]]s, complex [[differential geometry]] and [[symplectic geometry]]. The following theorems have been mentioned:

* The diagonalizability theorem {{harvs|last=Donaldson|year1=1983a|year2=1983b|year3=1987a}}: If the [[intersection theory|intersection form]] of a smooth, closed, simply connected [[4-manifold]] is positive- or negative-definite then it is diagonalizable over the integers. This result is sometimes called [[Donaldson's theorem]].
* A smooth [[h-cobordism]] between simply connected 4-manifolds need not be trivial {{harv|Donaldson|1987b}}. This contrasts with the situation in higher dimensions.
* A stable [[holomorphic vector bundle]] over a non-singular projective [[algebraic variety]]  admits a [[Hermitian–Einstein metric]] {{harv|Donaldson|1987c}}. (Another proof of a somewhat more general result was given by {{harvtxt|Uhlenbeck|Yau|1986}}.)
* A non-singular, projective algebraic surface can be diffeomorphic to the connected sum of two oriented 4-manifolds only if one of them has negative-definite intersection form {{harv|Donaldson|1990}}. This was an early application of the [[Donaldson invariant]] (or [[instanton]] invariants).
* Any compact symplectic manifold admits a symplectic [[Lefschetz pencil]] {{harv|Donaldson|1999}}.

Donaldson's recent work centers on a problem in complex differential geometry concerning a conjectural relationship between algebro-geometric "stability" conditions for smooth projective varieties and the existence of "extremal" [[Kähler manifold|Kähler metrics]], typically those with constant [[scalar curvature]] (see for example [[cscK metric]]). Donaldson obtained results in the toric case of the problem (see for example {{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001}}). He then solved the Kähler-Einstein case of the problem in 2012, in collaboration with Chen and Sun. This latest spectacular achievement involved a number of difficult and technical papers. The first of these was the paper of {{harvtxt|Donaldson|Sun|2014}} on Gromov-Hausdorff limits. The summary of the existence proof for Kähler-Einstein metrics appears in {{harvtxt|Chen|Donaldson|Sun|2014}}. Full details of the proofs appear in {{harvs|txt|last1=Chen|last2=Donaldson|last3=Sun|year1=2015a|year2=2015b|year3=2015c}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12015">In [[mathematics]], '''singular integrals''' are central to [[harmonic analysis]] and are intimately connected with the study of partial differential equations. Broadly speaking a singular integral is an [[integral operator]]

: &lt;math&gt;T(f)(x) = \int K(x,y)f(y) \, dy, &lt;/math&gt;

whose kernel function ''K'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is [[Mathematical singularity|singular]] along the diagonal ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''.  Specifically, the singularity is such that |''K''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')| is of size |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''|&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; asymptotically as |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''|&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. Since such integrals may not in general be absolutely integrable, a rigorous definition must define them as the limit of the integral over |''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;ε as ε&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0, but in practice this is a technicality. Usually further assumptions are required to obtain results such as their boundedness on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).

==The Hilbert transform==

{{main|Hilbert transform}}

The archetypal singular integral operator is the [[Hilbert transform]] ''H''. It is given by convolution against the kernel ''K''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/(π''x'') for ''x'' in '''R'''. More precisely,

: &lt;math&gt;H(f)(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int_{|x-y|&gt;\varepsilon} \frac{1}{x-y}f(y) \, dy. &lt;/math&gt;

The most straightforward higher dimension analogues of these are the [[Riesz transform]]s, which replace ''K''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' with

: &lt;math&gt;K_i(x) = \frac{x_i}{|x|^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' = 1, …, ''n'' and  &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''-th component of ''x'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. All of these operators are bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; and satisfy weak-type (1,&amp;nbsp;1) estimates.&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{cite news | last = Stein | first = Elias | title = Harmonic Analysis | work = | pages = | publisher = Princeton University Press| year = 1993 | url = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singular integrals of convolution type==
{{Main|Singular integral operators of convolution type}}
A singular integral of convolution type is an operator ''T'' defined by convolution with a kernel ''K'' that is [[locally integrable function|locally integrable]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;\{0}, in the sense that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;T(f)(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int_{|y-x|&gt;\varepsilon} K(x-y)f(y) \, dy. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Suppose that the kernel satisfies:

1. The ''size'' condition on the [[Fourier transform]] of ''K''

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{K}\in L^\infty(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;

2. The ''smoothness'' condition: for some ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{y \neq 0} \int_{|x|&gt;2|y|} |K(x-y) - K(x)| \, dx \leq C.&lt;/math&gt;

Then it can be shown that ''T'' is bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and satisfies a weak-type (1,&amp;nbsp;1) estimate.

Property 1. is needed to ensure that convolution ({{EquationNote|1}}) with the [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]] p.v.&amp;nbsp;''K'' given by the [[Cauchy principal value|principal value integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{p.v.}\,\, K[\phi] = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0^+} \int_{|x|&gt;\epsilon}\phi(x)K(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
is a well-defined [[Fourier multiplier]] on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Neither of the properties 1. or 2. is necessarily easy to verify, and a variety of sufficient conditions exist.  Typically in applications, one also has a ''cancellation'' condition

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{R_1&lt;|x|&lt;R_2} K(x) \, dx = 0 ,\ \forall R_1,R_2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

which is quite easy to check.  It is automatic, for instance, if ''K'' is an [[odd function]].  If, in addition, one assumes 2. and the following size condition

: &lt;math&gt;\sup_{R&gt;0} \int_{R&lt;|x|&lt;2R} |K(x)| \, dx \leq C,&lt;/math&gt;

then it can be shown that 1. follows.

The smoothness condition 2. is also often difficult to check in principle, the following sufficient condition of a kernel ''K'' can be used:
* &lt;math&gt;K\in C^1(\mathbf{R}^n\setminus\{0\})&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;|\nabla K(x)|\le\frac{C}{|x|^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
Observe that these conditions are satisfied for the Hilbert and Riesz transforms, so this result is an extension of those result.&lt;ref name = grafakos&gt;{{Citation | last = Grafakos | first = Loukas | title = Classical and Modern Fourier Analysis | chapter = 7 | work = | pages = | publisher = Pearson Education, Inc. | place = New Jersey| year = 2004 | url = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singular integrals of non-convolution type==

These are even more general operators. However, since our assumptions are so weak, it is not necessarily the case that these operators are bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund kernels===

A function ''K''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is said to be a ''[[Alberto Calderón|Calderón]]&amp;ndash;[[Antoni Zygmund|Zygmund]] kernel'' if it satisfies the following conditions for some constants ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name=grafakos/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(a) \qquad |K(x,y)| \leq \frac{C}{|x-y|^n}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(b) \qquad |K(x,y) - K(x',y)| \leq \frac{C|x-x'|^\delta}{\bigl(|x-y|+|x'-y|\bigr)^{n+\delta}}\text{ whenever }|x-x'| \leq \frac{1}{2}\max\bigl(|x-y|,|x'-y|\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(c) \qquad |K(x,y) - K(x,y')| \leq \frac{C|y-y'|^\delta}{\bigl(|x-y|+|x-y'|\bigr)^{n+\delta}}\text{ whenever }|y-y'| \leq \frac{1}{2}\max\bigl(|x-y'|,|x-y|\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

===Singular integrals of non-convolution type===

''T'' is said to be a ''singular integral operator of non-convolution type'' associated to the Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund kernel ''K'' if

: &lt;math&gt;\int g(x) T(f)(x) \, dx = \iint g(x) K(x,y) f(y) \, dy \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

whenever ''f'' and ''g'' are smooth and have disjoint support.&lt;ref name=grafakos/&gt; Such operators need not be bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;

===Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund operators===

A singular integral of non-convolution type ''T'' associated to a Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund kernel ''K'' is called a ''Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund operator'' when it is bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, there is a ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that

: &lt;math&gt;\|T(f)\|_{L^2} \leq C\|f\|_{L^2},&lt;/math&gt;

for all smooth compactly supported ƒ.

It can be proved that such operators are, in fact, also bounded on all ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; with 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞.

===The ''T''(''b'') theorem===

The ''T''(''b'') theorem provides sufficient conditions for a singular integral operator to be a Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund operator, that is for a singular integral operator associated to a Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund kernel to be bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In order to state the result we must first define some terms.

A ''normalised bump'' is a smooth function φ on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; supported in a ball of radius 10 and centred at the origin such that |∂&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;φ(''x'')|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, for all multi-indices |α|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2. Denote by τ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;(φ)(''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x'') and φ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;φ(''x''/''r'') for all ''x'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. An operator is said to be ''weakly bounded'' if there is a constant ''C'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; \left|\int T\bigl(\tau^x(\varphi_r)\bigr)(y) \tau^x(\psi_r)(y) \, dy\right| \leq Cr^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

for all normalised bumps φ and ψ. A function is said to be ''accretive'' if there is a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that Re(''b'')(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''c'' for all ''x'' in '''R'''. Denote by ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; the operator given by multiplication by a function ''b''.

The ''T''(''b'') theorem states that a singular integral operator ''T'' associated to a Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund kernel is bounded on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if it satisfies all of the following three conditions for some bounded accretive functions ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = David | first = |author3=Journé |author2=Semmes  | title = Opérateurs de Calderón&amp;ndash;Zygmund, fonctions para-accrétives et interpolation | publisher = Revista Matemática Iberoamericana | volume = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;56| language = French | year = 1985 | url = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(a) &lt;math&gt;M_{b_2}TM_{b_1}&lt;/math&gt; is weakly bounded;

(b) &lt;math&gt;T(b_1)&lt;/math&gt; is in [[Bounded mean oscillation|BMO]];

(c) &lt;math&gt;T^t(b_2),&lt;/math&gt; is in [[Bounded mean oscillation|BMO]], where ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose operator of&amp;nbsp;''T''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">In [[model theory]], '''[[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s exponential function problem''' asks whether the [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] of the [[real number]]s together with the [[exponential function]] is [[Decidability (logic)#Decidability of a theory|decidable]]. Tarski had previously shown that the theory of the real numbers (without the exponential function) is decidable.

==The problem==

The ordered real field '''R''' is a structure over the language of [[ordered ring]]s ''L''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(+,·,&amp;minus;,&lt;,0,1), with the usual interpretation given to each symbol.  It was proved by Tarski that the theory of the [[Real closed field|real field]], Th('''R'''), is decidable.  That is, given any ''L''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;-sentence ''φ'' there is an effective procedure for determining whether

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Th}(\R)\models\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

He then asked whether this was still the case if one added a unary function exp to the language that was interpreted as the [[exponential function]] on '''R''', to get the structure '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Conditional and equivalent results==

The problem can be reduced to finding an effective procedure for determining whether any given [[exponential polynomial]] in ''n'' variables and with coefficients in '''Z''' has a solution in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  {{harvtxt|Macintyre|Wilkie|1995}} showed that [[Schanuel's conjecture]] implies such a procedure exists, and hence gave a conditional solution to Tarski's problem. Schanuel's conjecture deals with all complex numbers so would be expected to be a stronger result than the decidability of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, and indeed, Macintyre and Wilkie proved that only a real version of Schanuel's conjecture is required to imply the decidability of this theory.

Even the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is not a [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary condition]] for the decidability of the theory.  In their paper, Macintyre and Wilkie showed that an equivalent result to the decidability of Th('''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;) is what they dubbed the Weak Schanuel's Conjecture.  This conjecture states that there is an effective procedure that, given ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;1 and exponential polynomials in ''n'' variables with integer coefficients ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g'', produces an integer ''η''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;1 that depends on ''n'', ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g'', and such that if ''α''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Singular point of a curve|non-singular]] solution of the system

:&lt;math&gt;f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n,e^{x_1},\ldots,e^{x_n})=\ldots=f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n,e^{x_1},\ldots,e^{x_n})=0&lt;/math&gt;

then either ''g''(''α'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or |''g''(''α'')|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''η''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Workaround ==

Recently there are attempts at handling the theory of the real numbers with functions such as exp, sin by relaxing decidability to the weaker notion of quasi-decidability. A theory is quasi-decidable if there is a procedure that decides satisfiability but that may run forever for inputs that are not robust in a certain, well-defined sense. Such a procedure exists for systems of n equations in n variables ({{harvtxt|Franek|Ratschan|Zgliczynski|2011}}).

In [[quantum computing]], and more specifically in [[superconducting quantum computing]], a '''transmon''' is a type of [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] [[charge qubit]] that was designed to have reduced sensitivity to charge noise. The transmon was developed by [[Robert J. Schoelkopf]], [[Michel Devoret]], [[Steven M. Girvin]] and their colleagues at [[Yale University]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;J. Koch ''et al.'', "Charge-insensitive qubit design derived from the Cooper pair box," ''Phys. Rev. A'' '''76''', 04319 (2007), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042319}}, [https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703002 arXiv:0703002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schreier&gt;J.A. Schreier ''et al.'', "Suppressing charge noise decoherence in superconducting charge qubits," ''Phys. Rev.

Chow, and Matthias Steffen, 2017).png|thumb|upright=0.8|left|A device consisting of four transmon qubits, four [[quantum bus]]ses, and four readout [[Resonator#Transmission line resonators|resonators]] fabricated by [[IBM]] and published in [[npj Quantum Information]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;J.

The transmon achieves its reduced sensitivity to charge noise by significantly increasing the ratio of the [[Josephson energy]] to the charging energy. This is accomplished through the use of a large shunting capacitor. The result is energy level spacings that are approximately independent of offset charge. Planar on-chip transmon qubits have [[Relaxation (NMR)|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coherence times]] ~ 30 μs to 40 μs.&lt;ref name=Barends&gt;R. Barends ''et al.'', "Coherent Josephson Qubit Suitable for Scalable Quantum Integrated Circuits," ''Phys. Rev.

Understanding the fundamental limits on the coherence time in [[superconducting qubits]] such as the transmon is an active area of research.

== Comparison to charge qubit ==
[[File:Charge2transmon.svg|thumb|Schematical qubit energy levels diagram evolution from charge qubit (top, &lt;math&gt;E_J/E_C=1&lt;/math&gt;) to transmon (bottom, &lt;math&gt;E_J/E_C=50&lt;/math&gt;), plotted for the first 3 energy levels (&lt;math&gt;m=0,1,2&lt;/math&gt;), as function of the average number &lt;math&gt;n_g&lt;/math&gt; of [[Cooper pairs]] across the junction, normalized to the gap between the ground and the first excited state.&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The charge qubit (top) is normally operated at the &lt;math&gt;n_g=0.5&lt;/math&gt; "sweet spot", where fluctuations in &lt;math&gt;n_g&lt;/math&gt; cause less energy shift, and the anharmonicity is maximal. Transmon (bottom) energy levels are insensitive to &lt;math&gt;n_g&lt;/math&gt; fluctuations, but the anharmonicity is reduced]]
The transmon design is similar to the [[charge qubit]], both are described by the same Hamiltonian, with the only difference being the increase in the &lt;math&gt;E_J/E_C&lt;/math&gt; ratio, achieved by shunting the [[Josephson junction]] with an additional large [[capacitor]]. Here &lt;math&gt;E_J&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Josephson effect#Josephson energy|Josephson energy]] of the junction, and &lt;math&gt;E_C&lt;/math&gt; is the charging energy inversely proportional to the total capacitance of the qubit circuit. The benefit of increasing the &lt;math&gt;E_J/E_C&lt;/math&gt; ratio is insensitivity to charge noise - the energy levels become independent of electrical charge across the junction, thus the coherence times of the qubit are prolonged. The disadvantage is decrease in the anharmonicity &lt;math&gt;\frac{E_2-E_1}{E_1-E_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the state &lt;math&gt;|i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Reduced anharmonicity complicates the device operation as a two level system, e.g. exciting the device from the ground state to the first excited state by a resonant pulse also populates the second excited state. This complication is overcome by complex microwave pulse design, that takes into account the higher energy levels, and prohibits their excitation by destructive interference.

Measurement, control and coupling of the transmons is performed by means of microwave resonators with techniques of [[circuit quantum electrodynamics]], also applicable to [[Superconducting quantum computing#Single qubit gates|other superconducting qubits]]. The coupling to the resonators is done by a putting a capacitor between the qubit and the resonator, at a point where the resonator [[electromagnetic field]] is biggest. For example, in [[IBM Quantum Experience]] devices, the resonators are implemented with "[[quarter wave]]" [[coplanar waveguide]] with maximal field at the signal-ground short at the waveguide end, thus every IBM transmon qubit has a long resonator "tail". The initial proposal included similar [[transmission line]] resonators coupled to every transmon, becoming a part of the name. However, charge qubits operated at a similar &lt;math&gt;E_J/E_C&lt;/math&gt; regime, coupled to different kinds of microwave cavities are referred as transmons as well.

The symmetry algebra of a WZW model is an [[affine Lie algebra]].

==Action==
Let ''G'' denote a [[compact space|compact]] [[simply-connected]] [[Lie group]] and ''g'' its [[simple Lie algebra]]. Suppose that ''γ'' is a ''G''-valued field on the [[complex plane]]. More precisely, we want ''γ'' to be defined on the [[Riemann sphere]] '''''S''''' ², which amounts to  the complex plane [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]] by adding a [[point at infinity]].

The WZW model is then a [[nonlinear sigma model]] defined by ''γ'' with an [[action (physics)|action]] given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(\gamma)= - \,  \frac {k}{8\pi} \int_{S^2} d^2x\, 
\mathcal{K} (\gamma^{-1} \partial^\mu \gamma \,  , \,   
\gamma^{-1} \partial_\mu \gamma) + 2\pi k\, S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;  {{=}}  ∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[partial derivative]] and the usual [[summation convention]] over indices is used, with a [[Euclidean metric]].  Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Killing form]] on ''g'', and thus the first term is the standard kinetic term of [[quantum field theory]].

The term ''S''&lt;sup&gt;WZ&lt;/sup&gt; is called the ''Wess–Zumino term'' and can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma) = - \, \frac{1}{48\pi^2} \int_{B^3} d^3y\, 
\epsilon^{ijk} \mathcal{K} \left( 
\gamma^{-1} \, \frac {\partial \gamma} {\partial y^i} \, , \, 
\left[
\gamma^{-1} \, \frac {\partial \gamma} {\partial y^j} \, , \,
\gamma^{-1} \, \frac {\partial \gamma} {\partial y^k}
\right]
\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where [,] is the [[commutator]], {{math|''ε&lt;sup&gt;ijk&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the [[completely anti-symmetric tensor]], and the integration coordinates ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''i''=1,2,3 range over the [[unit ball]] '''''B''''' ³. In this integral, the field γ has been extended so that it is defined on the interior of the unit ball. This extension can always be done because the [[homotopy group]] π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''G'') always vanishes for any compact, simply-connected Lie group, and we originally defined ''γ'' on the 2-sphere '''''S''''' ² = ∂'''''B''''' ³.

===Pullback===
Note that if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; are the basis vectors for the [[Lie algebra]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K} (e_a, [e_b, e_c])&lt;/math&gt; are the [[structure constants]] of the Lie algebra.  Note also that the structure constants are completely anti-symmetric, and thus they define a [[alternating form|3-form]] on the [[group manifold]] of ''G''.  Thus, the integrand above is just the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the harmonic 3-form to the ball '''''B''''' ³. Denoting the harmonic 3-form by ''c'' and the pullback by ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, one then has 
:&lt;math&gt;S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma) = \int_{B^3} \gamma^{*} c.&lt;/math&gt;
This form leads directly to a topological analysis of the WZ term.

Geometrically, this term describes the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] of the respective manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braaten | first1 = E. | last2 = Curtright | first2 = T. L. | last3 = Zachos | first3 = C.

===Topological obstructions===
The extension of the field to the interior of the ball is not unique; the need that the physics be independent of the extension imposes a quantization condition on the coupling parameter ''k'', the ''level''.  Consider two different extensions of γ to the interior of the ball.  They are maps from flat 3-space into the Lie group ''G''. Consider now glueing these two balls together at their boundary '''''S'''''².  The result of the gluing is a topological 3-sphere; each ball '''''B'''''³ is a hemisphere of '''''S'''''³.  The two different extensions of ''γ'' on each ball now becomes a map '''''S'''''³ → ''G''.  However, the homotopy group  π&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'') = ℤ for any compact, connected simple Lie group ''G''.

Thus, one has
:&lt;math&gt;S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma) = S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma')+n     ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''γ'' and ''γ'  ''   denote the two different extensions onto the ball, and ''n'', an integer, is the [[winding number]] of the glued-together map.

The physics that this model leads to will stay the same if
:&lt;math&gt;\exp \left(i2\pi k S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma) \right)=  \exp \left( i2\pi k S^{\mathrm WZ}(\gamma')\right)~.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, topological considerations lead one to conclude that the level ''k'' must be an integer when ''G'' is a connected, compact, simple Lie group.  For a semisimple or disconnected compact Lie group, the level consists of an integer for each connected, simple component.

This topological obstruction can also be seen in the representation theory of the [[affine Lie algebra]] symmetry of the theory.  When each level is a positive integer the affine Lie algebra has unitary highest weight [[representation theory|representations]] with highest [[weight (representation theory)|weight]]s that are dominant integral.  Such representations are easier to work with as they decompose into finite-dimensional subalgebras with respect to the subalgebras spanned by each [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]], the corresponding negative root and their commutator, which is a [[Cartan matrix|Cartan generator]].

Often one is interested in a WZW model with a noncompact simple Lie group ''G'', such as [[SL2(R)|SL(2,ℝ)]] which has been used by [[Juan Maldacena]] and [[Hirosi Ooguri]] to describe [[string theory]] on a three-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Maldacena | first1 = J. | last2 = Ooguri | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1063/1.1377273 | title = Strings in AdS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the SL(2,R) WZW model. I: The spectrum | journal = Journal of Mathematical Physics | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 2929 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = hep-th/0001053 |bibcode = 2001JMP....42.2929M }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[universal cover]] of the group SL(2,ℝ).  In this case, as π&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SL(2, ℝ)) = 0, there is no topological obstruction and the level need not be integral.  Correspondingly, the representation theory of such noncompact Lie groups is much richer than that of their compact counterparts.

===Generalizations===
Although in the above, the WZW model is defined on the [[Riemann sphere]], it can be generalized so that the field γ lives on a compact [[Riemann surface]].

==Current algebra==
The [[current algebra]] of the WZW model is a [[Kac–Moody algebra]]. The stress energy tensor is given by the Sugawara construction.

===Coset construction===

Taking the quotient of two WZW models gives a new conformal field theory whose central charge is the difference of the two original ones.
