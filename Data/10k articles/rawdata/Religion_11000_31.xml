[[File:Creti Venus appearing to Aeneas.jpg|thumb|''Venus appearing to Aeneas and Achates'' by [[Donato Creti]]  (turn of the 17/18th c.)]]
In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', '''Achates''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀχάτης, "good, faithful Achates", ''fidus Achates'' as he was called) was a close friend of [[Aeneas]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidFasti3.html Ovid. ''Fasti 3.603.''] Translated by Frazer, James George. Loeb Classical Library Volume. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; his name became a by-word for an intimate companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27564131|title=The King of Pain: Aeneas, Achates and Achos in Aeneid I|author=Sergio Casali|periodical=The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series |volume=58 |issue=1|date=May 2008|pages=181–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Achates accompanied Aeneas throughout his adventures, reaching [[Carthage]] with him in disguise when the pair were scouting the area, and leading him to the Sibyl of [[Cumae]].  [[Virgil]] represents him as remarkable for his fidelity, and a perennial type of that virtue. However, despite being Aeneas's most important [[Troy|Trojan]], he is notable for his lack of character development.  In fact, he has only four spoken lines in the entire epic. Aeneas, surrounded by only a shadowy cast of allies, is thus emphasised as the lone protagonist and at the same time cut off from help on his quest.&lt;ref&gt;R. Deryck Williams, ''Aeneas and the Roman Hero''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhagavatī''' ([[Devanagari]]: भगवती, [[IAST]]: Bhagavatī), is a word of [[Sanskrit]] origin, used in India as a polite form to address or as an honorific title for female deities in [[Hinduism]].

The male equivalent of Bhagavatī is [[Bhagavān]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Hardy (1990), The World's Religions: The Religions of Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415058155}}, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Caldwell (1998), Bhagavati, in Devi: Goddesses of India (Editors: John Stratton Hawley, Donna Marie Wulff), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, pages 195-198&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Bhagavati" can be used instead of [[Devi]] or [[Ishvari]].

In the [[Hindu calendar]], '''Chaturdashi''' is the 14th day ([[Tithi]]) of the waxing phase or waning phase of the moon. This is the day prior to [[new moon]] (''[[Amavasya]]'') or [[full moon]] (''[[pournami (festival)|Pournami]]''). It has a great significance to Bengalis, as goddess Tara appeared to rishi vasistha on this tithi.

== Etymology ==
''Chaturdasi'' means 14, wherein ''Chatur'' means four and ''Dasi'' means 10. It is taken from the Sanskrit.

== Festivals ==
* The day before [[Diwali]] is [[Naraka Chaturdashi]]. It is before the ''Amavasya'' in the month of ''[[Asvina]]''.
* [[Maha Shivaratri]] or [[Maagha Bahula Chaturdashi]]. It is before the [[Amavasya]] in the month of ''[[Maagha]]''.
* [[Anant Chaturdashi]] is performed in the bright fortnight, [[Shukla Paksha]] of [[Bhadrapad]].
* [[Vaikuntha Chaturdashi]], [[shukla paksha]] chaturdashi of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]]  the [[Hindu month|month]] (November–December).
* Tara puja is performed on Aswin chaturdashi, before laxmi puja.
* [[Chachor of Narapora]] or ''Holika Dahan'' is celebrated in Vasant Chaturdashi before [[Holi]].

The University of Glasgow, from their ''Printing in England from William Caxton to Christopher Barker, An Exhibition: November 1976 &amp;ndash; April 1977''&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/printing/ University of Glasgow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826042352/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/printing/ |date=August 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had this to say about Christopher's life and work:

{{Quotation| An outstanding figure in the printing trade towards the end of the sixteenth century was Christopher Barker, a shrewd businessman who managed to acquire the most lucrative of all patents, namely the Bible patent. Born around 1529, Barker was a wealthy member of the Drapers’ Company with powerful friends at court, for he was closely connected with the Walsingham family. He is thought to have been the grand nephew of Sir Christopher Barker, a former Garter King of Arms, which would explain his wealth, since the various properties of Sir Christopher ultimately passed into the possession of his nephew, Edward Barker, thought to have been the printer’s father.

Barker became interested in the printing trade and is first heard of as a publisher in 1569. In 1576 he started on his career as a Bible printer, having obtained a privilege to print the Geneva version of the Bible in England. In 1577 he purchased from Sir Thomas Wilkes, Clerk of the Privy Council, an extensive patent which included the Old and New Testament in English, with or without notes, of any translation. The full patent granted to Barker the office of royal printer of all statutes, books, bills, Acts of Parliament, proclamations, injunctions, Bibles, and New Testaments, in the English tongue of any translation, all service books to be used in churches, and all other volumes ordered to be printed by the Queen or Parliament.

Barker’s business continued to thrive and from 1588 onwards he conducted it mainly through his deputies, George Bishop and Ralph Newbery. On the disgrace of Wilkes in 1589, Barker managed to obtain a renewal of his exclusive patent with reversion for life to his son Robert. Father and son lived in London at Bacon House in Noble Street, Aldersgate. Christopher Barker also had a house at Datchet, to which he retired after 1588, and there he died in 1599. He and his deputies had supplied the country with about seventy editions of the Scriptures between 1575 and 1599 and they were accurate and well printed. He was succeeded in the post of royal printer by his son Robert.}}

The '''Church of the Larger Fellowship''' (CLF) provides a ministry to isolated [[Unitarian Universalists]] (UUs). Its mission also includes growing Unitarian Universalism by supporting small congregations and new UUs around the world. The CLF also offers resources to Unitarian Universalists active in local congregations.

The CLF provides an outreach ministry, which includes the Church of the Younger Fellowship (a ministry for young adults), the CLF's Military Ministry and a Prison Ministry. The CLF also provides email list communities, discussions, and web-based education materials. CLF members have access to a lending library of books, CDs, videotapes, and sermons; lifespan religious education curricula and self-study guides; and the monthly distribution of sermons and other worship material through its worship publication, Quest. The CLF also podcasts sermons and readings from Quest and offers online courses on its website.

==History==
Founded in 1944 as a part of the [[American Unitarian Association]]'s Extension Department, the CLF was incorporated in 1970 as an independent congregation, and its polity is the same as any other congregation's. The CLF is financed by its membership.

==Church-on-Loan program==
The CLF Church-on-Loan program provides worship and program materials to small, mostly lay-led UU congregations that enroll in the program.

==Church of the Younger Fellowship==
In 2005, the [[Church of the Younger Fellowship]] (CYF) was established and run by young adults to help connect Unitarian Universalists (ages 18-35).

==Military Ministry==
The CLF Military Ministry is the newest outreach program for the CLF.   Working with UU military chaplains and chaplain candidates, and with the support of the UU Funding Program's Fund for Unitarian Universalism, the CLF created a new website by and for UUs in the military.

==Prisoner Ministry==
The CLF Ministries to prisoner members provides a Unitarian Universalist church home for incarcerated UUs.

===Letter-Writing Ministry===
CLF's Letter-Writing Ministry matches CLF prisoner-members with non-incarcerated Unitarian Universalists to exchange letters.

'''Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler''' (25 June 1884 – 11 January 1979) was a German-born art historian, art collector, and one of the most notable [[France|French]] [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. He became prominent as an art gallery owner in [[Paris]] beginning in 1907 and was among the first champions of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement in art.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=John Richardson (art historian) |first=John |last=Richardson |title=A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel, 1907-1916 |page=36 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |date= 1991 |isbn=978-0-307-26665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kahnweiler's family moved from [[Rockenhausen]], a small village in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], to [[Mannheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], where Kahnweiler was born in 1884. His upbringing and education at a German [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] prepared him well for his life as an art connoisseur and pragmatic businessman. Early employment in the family business of [[Stockbroker|stock brokerage]] in Germany and Paris gave way to an interest in art collecting while Kahnweiler was still in his twenties. He opened his first small art gallery (4 by 4 meters) in Paris in 1907 at 28 rue Vignon. There was a family precedent for such an enterprise, since his uncle, who ran a famous stock brokerage house in [[London]], was a major art collector of traditional English art works and furniture.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

==Art dealer==
[[File:Picasso Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1910.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1910, ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'', oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Kahnweiler is considered to have been one of the greatest supporters of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] art movement through his activities as an art dealer and spokesman for artists. He was among the first people to recognize the importance and beauty of Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and immediately wanted to buy it along with all of Picasso's works. Picasso wrote of Kahnweiler, "What would have become of us if Kahnweiler hadn't had a business sense?" Kahnweiler's appreciation of Picasso's talents was especially gratifying to the artist, since he was largely unknown and destitute at the time when many of his most famous works were created.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

In his gallery, Kahnweiler supported many of the great artists of his time who found themselves without adequate recognition and little or no interest among collectors. Initial purchases included works by [[Kees van Dongen]], [[André Derain]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and several other artists of the same generation. To use his own word, Kahnweiler wanted to "defend" great artists, but only those who had no dealers and whose talents he was convinced of. Rather than exhibiting appealing works by established artists from the past and present, Kahnweiler championed burgeoning artists who had come from all over the globe to live and work in [[Montparnasse]] and [[Montmartre]] at the time. Thus [[Paul Cézanne]], although a great artist, was considered too old to be represented, and his work was already represented by the dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] in any case.&lt;ref name= "JR" /&gt;

[[File:Kees van Dongen, c.1907-08, Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Kees van Dongen]], c.1907-08, ''Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler'', oil on canvas, Musée du Petit Palais, Geneva]]
Along with such men as [[Alfred Flechtheim]], [[Paul Cassirer]], [[Daniel Wildenstein]], [[Léonce Rosenberg]] and [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Kahnweiler was one of the influential art connoisseurs of the 20th century. As a businessman, Kahnweiler pioneered many new methods of working with artists and art dealing; these are now established practices in the industry.

In 1907, when there were only half a dozen viable galleries in Paris, he made contracts with artists to buy all of their work in order to free them from financial worries and permit them to concentrate on their creative work. He met with them daily to discuss their work, photographed each work they produced (he felt it imperative to have a record), held exhibitions of their work and promoted their work internationally. Since he considered himself friends with many of them, he co-owned little sailing boats with his artists.

As part of his activities in promoting the work of emerging artists, Kahnweiler sponsored the first exhibition of the work of [[Georges Braque]]. He encouraged the practice of publishing ''Beaux Livres'' (beautiful books), in which a contemporary artist would illustrate a work of a contemporary writer. He expanded his presentations by bringing together artists, writers and poets to produce their works as a joint project in more than 40 books. Picasso, for example, illustrated the works of [[Max Jacob]]. As a publisher of art with literary works, he had no equal, and was the first to sponsor publications by Max Jacob, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Masson]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and many others. In doing so, he launched many literary careers.

Kahnweiler's entrepreneurial abilities were so acute that by the 1950s his art gallery was in the top 100 companies in France in terms of turnover from export.

==Art history==
Although the financial support for artists was an important contribution to art history, he was also a significant figure for his work as an art historian and eyewitness to the emergence of Cubism during the period 1907–1914. When working in Paris, his spare time was devoted to reading and understanding the [[history of art]] and [[aesthetics]]. He also spent his time visiting the city's museums and art galleries. Besides the museums in Paris, he took trips around the European continent to see what was being shown in museums and art galleries outside France. He gave his first interview on Cubism in 1912, and it was actual historical events that led to his career as a historian. There is a view that Kahnweiler's sensibility was such that his gallery, and the way he styled and developed it, was as much a Cubist gallery as were the paintings by Picasso and the other Cubist painters. The gallery had a clear [[aesthetic]] position, uncompromising integrity, financial stability and creative development. During the years 1907-1914 his gallery was a central cradle for Cubism, not only to see the works but where one also met the artists, discussed art and where artists discussed each other's works.

Concurrently, the primary means for avant-garde painters and sculptors to show their works to a wider audience remained the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]]. Kahnweiler forbade his 'gallery Cubists' from exhibiting at these major Salons,&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2010"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN9MriMKsE Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''Modern and Contemporary'' 439, Metzinger - ''Tea Time'' (''Woman with a Teaspoon''), 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; and by doing so actually removed them from the public view. For the general public, Cubism was more associated with the 'Salon Cubists', such as [[Jean Metzinger]],&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2010" /&gt; [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="Edwards, Wood"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=TU0KwJuBvAsC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=kahnweiler+gallery+cubists+vs+salon+cubists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH2On2m9zTAhUH8RQKHfhJDpwQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=kahnweiler%20gallery%20cubists%20vs%20salon%20cubists&amp;f=false Steve Edwards, Paul Wood, ''Art of the Avant-gardes''], Yale University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0300102305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and World War II==
[[File:Juan Gris Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1921.jpg|thumb|right|Pencil drawing of Kahnweiler by [[Juan Gris]], 1921, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]
The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 not only ruptured the Cubist experiments in art, but also forced Kahnweiler to live in exile in [[Switzerland]]; due to his German citizenship, he was considered an [[Alien (law)|alien]] under French law. Many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state, and as a result, Kahnweiler's collection was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] between 1921 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gee, Dealers, Critics and Collectors of Modern Painting; Aspects of the Parisian Art Market Between 1910 and 1930, Courtauld PhD Dissertation 1977, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll18/id/45980 Kahnweiler collection: Catalogue des tableaux, aquarelles, gouaches et dessins. Part II,  Hôtel Drouot, Paris, November 17-18, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of exile (until 1920), Kahnweiler studied and wrote works such as the ''Der Weg Zum Kubismus'' and ''Confessions esthétiques''. Writing becoming a passion he continued over his lifetime, and he authored hundreds of books and major articles. The second period of enforced writing came during a period of internal exile caused by the events of [[World War II]].  As a [[Jew]], the [[Nazi]]s forced him to flee Paris. He remained in France in hiding. "Under the clouds from the [[gas chamber]]s," as he put it, he wrote his seminal work on [[Juan Gris]].

==At the end==
Kahnweiler was very prolific as an author, but never produced a full autobiography. There was, however, a series of interviews first aired on French television, then published and translated as a book under the title ''Mes galleries et mes peintres'' ("my galleries and my painters". For his 80th birthday, a ''[[Festschrift]]'' was published with contributions by the world's leading philosophers, art historians, and artists, all of whom emphasized the vital importance of his unique contribution to art history – an importance still not yet fully appreciated, probably due to the fact that he has been viewed mostly as an art dealer and not as an [[art historian]]. This situation has been aggravated because some of his major works on [[aesthetics]] were either never translated into English or badly translated. The omission of key elements of a proper understanding of Cubism and focus on small and sensational elements of his complex relationship with Picasso has led to a flawed understanding of the ideas he put forward in these writings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Although revered by artists for his business and aesthetic sense and respected by art dealers and art historians, the true impact of his life and work has yet to be recognized, despite a recent biography by [[Pierre Assouline]]. He died in 1979 in Paris aged 94.

==Biography==
Tomaselli was born on October 29, 1969 in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. He expressed interest in becoming a horror filmmaker while he was still a child due to his enjoyment of films such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[Don't Look Now]]'',&lt;ref name=HN.n&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Dai|title=Interview: Dante Tomaselli (Horror, Satan’s Playground, Desecration)|url=http://horrornews.net/38643/interview-dante-tomaselli-horror-satans-playground-desecration/|publisher=HorrorNews.net|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he would watch with his mother at local theaters.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Matthew|title=Film out of bounds: essays and interviews on non-mainstream cinema worldwide|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786429704|pages=112–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpsLAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Desecration%22+Tomaselli&amp;dq=%22Desecration%22+Tomaselli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9Z_9UsrBOOqW0QGX2IDgDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied filmmaking at [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Pratt Institute]] and later transferred to the [[New York School of Visual Arts]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]] degree in Advertising.&lt;ref name=HA&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies Brown|first=Phil|title=Dante Tomaselli (Interview)|url=http://www.horror-asylum.com/interview/dantetomaselli/interview.asp|publisher=Horror Asylum|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he released his first film, ''[[Desecration (film)|Desecration]]'', which he based on an earlier-made 23-minute [[short film|short]].&lt;ref name=HA /&gt; On January 14, 2014, Tomaselli released his first audio CD of electronic horror music, ''Scream in the Dark'', through Elite Entertainment and MVD Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingold|first=Michael|title=Dante Tomaselli wants you to "SCREAM IN THE DARK"|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/dante-tomaselli-wants-you-to-scream-in-the-dark/|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomaselli is [[gay]] and was involved with a project called ''[[Gay of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="fang2014"/&gt;

==Themes and influences==
Tomaselli heavily utilizes themes of Catholicism and Christianity in his work, which is inspired partly by his Catholic upbringing as a child&lt;ref name=HN.n /&gt; though he is critical of the concept of [[religion]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="fang2014"/&gt; Other factors that influenced his work include Tomaselli's relation to Sole and [[surrealism]], as well as severe nightmares he had as a child, which he has tried to work into his films.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; Some critics mistakenly attribute directors such as [[Dario Argento]] and [[Lucio Fulci]] as influences due to some similarities between their work, but Tomaselli stated in an interview with author Matthew Edwards that he did not view those directors' work until his early twenties.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception to Tomaselli's films is usually very polarized, with some criticizing the films as lacking a linear plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertrand|first=Merle|title=Desecration (review)|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/498/|publisher=Film Threat|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horror (review)|url=http://movies.amctv.com/movie/2002/Horror|publisher=AMC|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have praised the films for this feature and remarked on the variety of filmgoers' reactions by saying that the movies would not appeal to all viewers and especially not to those that favor more mainstream fare or do not prefer surreal films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=Horror (review)|url=http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=9534&amp;reviewer=128|publisher=EfilmCritic|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DESECRATION (review)|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/desecration.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=14 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100336/http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/desecration.php|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''G. O. Mebes''' (Gregory Ottonovich Mёbes, 1868 ([[Riga]], [[Latvia]]) - 1930([[Ust-Sysolsk]], [[Russia]])), was a leader of Russian [[Freemasonry]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://russianmasonry.ru/ Freemasonry]&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 200 years of existence at that time, and the founder of ‘The Initiation School of Western Esoterism’. In his external life, he occupied the position of professor of French and Mathematics in two of the best schools in [[Saint Petersburg]]. He was appreciated and well known among the members of the society in the capital city. However, very few knew of his School. Only those who were invited by him were allowed into the School.

==Initiation School of Western Esoterism==
The School had an ‘external circle’, attended by all of his students, as well as some ‘internal groups’ formed accordingly to the evolutionary level of the disciples, their individual aspirations and capabilities.

In 1912, foreseeing what perhaps was the storm about to reach Russia, G. O. Mebes agreed that his disciples publish the lessons about the 22 Major Arcana of [[Tarot]]. The book came out under the title of ''The Course of Encyclopedia of Occultism'', which was completely justified because through the explanation of the Arcana, which are faces of the Truth, he introduced all of the ramifications and aspects of occultism. The first edition was quickly sold out.

In late 1917, when the new [[Soviet Union|soviet regime]] started to persecute religion and spiritualism, the School of G.O. Mebes became clandestine, but its works never stopped.

In 1926, due to imprudence of one of the students, the School and the domicile of its members were invaded by soviet authorities, the documents destroyed and those who were linked the School were arrested.
G. O. Mebes was deported to a [[gulag]] in the [[Solovetsk islands]], in the [[White Sea]], sub-Arctic region. He died a few years later.

==Legacy==

In 1937, the ''Encyclopedia'' was considered as a classic of occultism, it was again published in [[Shanghai, China]].
Before that, in the second decade, in [[Tallinn, Estonia]], the Russian [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosopher]] Catarina Sreznewska-Zelenzeff, who was getting ready to leave Europe and move to [[Brazil]], received from her friend, Nina Rudnikoff, disciple of G. O. Mebes, a precious material about the Minor Arcana of Tarot. Nina, escaping from Russia, saved all her notes taken during her studies at the School. Having known that Catarina was going to travel to Brazil, Nina gave her the notes taken from the lessons that had been ministered by Mebes to the internal circle groups of the School. She also asked her to transfer her notes to ‘someone dignified’, asking her that take that with her and, eventually, transfer the material to someone else ‘dignified’ so that the lessons could be preserved.

Years later, in Brazil, in a very strange coincidence, Catarina met Nadia, widow of Gabriel Iellatchitch, another disciple and great friend of Mebes. Both ladies decided to live together. Right after that, Nadia’s brother, Alexandre Nikitin-Nevelskoy, who had a profound knowledge of esoterism and was also a follower of Mebes’ School, came from [[Chile]] to live with them. By putting his notes together and with the help of the two ladies, Alexandre reestablished the course of the Minor Arcana of Tarot in its entirety. Therefore, Nina’s wish came true because the material was safe and not only transmitted to ‘someone dignified’ but also organized by someone competent, who belonged to the same egregoric (see [[egregore]]) chain. This allowed the work to be translated to Portuguese.

Some of the copies of the ''Encyclopedia'' reached [[Brazil]] and were translated by Marta Pécher,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubedotaro.com.br/site/r64_3_menores_gom.asp clube do taro (in Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt; who was deeply impressed by the content of the book. She also tried to reach contact with old disciples of Mebes, and finally knew one of his direct disciples, who died in Chile. With some help, she began the translation to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and published the book under the title ''Os arcanos Maiores do Tarô''  (The Major Arcana of Tarot). This book was edited by Editora Pensamento, in Brazil. Following the symbolism he explains in his book, some tarot cards have been created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green-door.narod.ru/gomtarot.html Green Door--flagged as possibly infected as of 20 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; These cards  are very rich in symbolism, as Mebes knew [[Kabbalah]] as well as the numeric meaning of every arcana.

==Influences==
Mebes' work also influenced the writer [[Mouni Sadhu]], who admitted that his own book, ''The Tarot'', was based on that of Mebes,&lt;ref&gt;Sadhu, M, 1962, The Tarot.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot'' of [[Valentin Tomberg]]&lt;ref&gt;''Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot'' (a study of the [[Tarot of Marseilles]]) published [[Anonymity|anonymously]] in [[French language|French]] in 1980 (with a foreword by a Catholic theologian and priest, [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]).

The '''goliards''' were a group of [[clergy]], generally young, in Europe who wrote [[satire|satirical]] [[Latin]] [[poetry]] in the 12th and 13th centuries of the Middle Ages. They were chiefly clerics who served at or had studied at the [[university|universities]] of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and England, who protested the growing contradictions within the church through song, poetry and performance. Disaffected and not called to the religious life, they often presented such protests within a structured setting associated with carnival, such as the [[Feast of Fools]], or church liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown ed., ''A Companion to Chaucer'' (2008), p. 94.&lt;!--Author's name, title of essay in this collection, editor's first name, inclusive page numbers of the contribution, place of publication, name of publisher, ISBN are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The derivation of the word is uncertain. It may come from the Latin ''gula,'' gluttony.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Ward, "Circa 1175–1195: The Archpoet and Goliard Poetry", in ''A New History of German Literature'', edited by D. E. Wellbery, Judith Ryan, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Anton Kaes, Joseph Leo Koerner, and Dorothea E. von Mücke, pp. 66–71 (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London: Belknap Press of the Harvard University Press, 2004), citation on p. 66. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01503-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also originate from a mythical "Bishop Golias," a [[medieval Latin]] form of the name [[Goliath]], the [[giant (mythology)|giant]] who fought King [[David]] in the [[Bible]]—thus suggestive of the monstrous nature of the goliard. Another source may be ''gailliard,'' a "gay fellow."&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown ed., ''A Companion to Chaucer'' (2008), p. 94.&lt;!--Author's name, title of essay in this collection, editor's first name, inclusive page numbers of the contribution, place of publication, name of publisher, ISBN are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars believe the term ''goliard'' is derived from a letter between [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]] and Pope [[Innocent II]], in which Bernard referred to [[Pierre Abélard]] as Goliath, thus creating a connection between Goliath and the student adherents of Abélard. By the 14th century, the word goliard became synonymous with minstrel, and no longer referred to a particular group of clergy.&lt;ref name=eb-g&gt;"Goliard." ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 3 Oct. 2014 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/238063/goliard&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the goliardic tradition==
The goliardic class is believed to have arisen from the need of younger sons to develop means of support. The medieval social convention of [[primogeniture]] meant that the eldest son inherited title and estate.{{sfn|Goodrum|1995|p=9}} This practice of bestowing the rights of inheritance upon the eldest son left younger sons to seek other means by which to support themselves. Often, these younger sons went, or were sent, to the universities and monasteries of the day, where theology and preparation for clergy careers were a major focus.{{sfn|Goodrum|1995|p=9}} Many felt no particular affinity for religious office,{{sfn|Goodrum|1995|p=9}} and often could not secure an office even if they desired one because of an overabundance of those educated in theology.{{sfn|Zeydel|1966|p=15}} Consequently, over-educated, under-motivated clerics often adopted not the life of an ordered monk, but one mainly intent on the pursuit of carnal pleasures.

==Goliardic poetry==
The goliards, as scholars, often wrote their poetry in Latin.&lt;ref name=eb-gs&gt;"Goliard Songs." ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 3 Oct. 2014 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1557536/goliard-songs&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As a kind of traveling entertainer, the goliards composed many of their poems to be sung.{{sfn|Zeydel|1966|p=14}}&lt;ref name=eb-gs/&gt; These poems, or lyrics, focus on two overarching themes: depictions of the lusty lifestyle of the vagrant and satirical criticisms of society and the church.&lt;ref&gt;John Addington Symonds, ''Wine, Women, and Song: Students' Songs of the Middle Ages'' (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2002), p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressing their lusty lifestyle, the goliards wrote about the physicality of love, in contrast to the chivalric focus of the [[troubadour]]s.{{sfn|Goodrum|1995|p=10}} They wrote drinking songs, and reveled in riotous living.&lt;ref name=eb-g/&gt; Their satirical poems directed at the church were inspired by their daily worlds, including mounting corruption in monasteries and escalating tensions among religious leaders.{{sfn|Zeydel|1966|p=16}} As a result of their rebellious writings against the church, the goliards were eventually denied the privileges of the clergy.&lt;ref name=eb-g/&gt; Their strained relationship with the church, along with their vagabond lifestyle, also contributed to many poems describing the complaints of such a lifestyle.&lt;ref name=eb-g/&gt; One of the largest and most famous collections of goliardic poetry is the ''[[Carmina Burana]].''

This belief, however, that the goliards were the authors of vast parts of this satirical and worldly poetry that originated in the twelfth and early thirteenth century, is criticized by recent historical and philological research, especially because most traceable goliardic poets were an integral part of church hierarchy, often worked as teachers in the secular clergy and had neither any communality nor a single provable point of contact with the historical goliards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2018/13626/|title=Die mittellateinische Goliardendichtung und ihr historischer Kontext : Komik im Kosmos der Kathedralschulen Nordfrankreichs. (With an English Summary)|last=Weiß|first=Marian|year=2018|website=|pages=197-215, 387-388|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "goliardic poets" on the one hand and "goliards" on the other hand need to be strictly distinguished.

Instead it has been argued that the cathedral schools of northern France were the decisive historical context of goliardic poetry, defining it as follows: "Based on the manuscript attribution of medieval poetry with Golias and goliardus, the High and Late Middle Ages understood “goliardic poetry” to be the rhymed secular Latin poetry of the High Middle Ages, whose primary purpose was a comical one. This comical intent was evident in theme and plot, but could mostly be found on the poetological meta-layers of language, intertext and semantics. Goliardic poetry was written in a time frame between circa 1115 and 1255 in the “school system” of secular clergy between Loire and Somme, and mainly in the cathedral schools of that region and their cosmos, but was read for a longer timeframe, also being received in wider geographical and institutional spaces. Goliardic poetry was turned into revolutionary hedonistic scandal poetry by archivists of the early modern era and research since the middle of the 19th century, which understood the thematic focus as the experience poetry of socially low-ranking clerical vagrants (goliards) instead of viewing its omnipresent comedy as role poetry enriched with moralising and sometimes pedagogical and didactical elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2018/13626/|title=Die mittellateinische Goliardendichtung und ihr historischer Kontext : Komik im Kosmos der Kathedralschulen Nordfrankreichs. (With an English Summary)|last=Weiß|first=Marian|year=2018|website=|page=393|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satirical poets==
The satires were meant to mock and lampoon the church. For example, at [[Saint Rémy de Provence|St. Remy]], the goliards went to mass in procession, with each trailing a herring on a string along the ground. The game was to step on the herring in front and keep your own herring from being trod upon. In some districts, goliards staged a [[Feast of the Ass|celebration of the ass]], in which a donkey dressed in a silly costume was led to the [[chancel]] rail where a [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] chanted a song of praise. When he paused, the audience would respond: "He Haw, Sire Ass, He haw!". The University of Paris complained: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Priests and clerks.. dance in the choir dressed as women... they sing wanton songs. They eat black pudding at the altar itself, while the celebrant is saying Mass. They play dice on the altar. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes.  They run and leap throughout the church, without a blush of their own shame. Finally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby carriages and carts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in infamous performances, with indecent gestures and with scurrilous and unchaste words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=G. G. Coulton |author-link1=G. G. Coulton |year=1949 |title=Medieval Panorama |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-aRYk3mRD3wC&amp;pg=PA607&amp;dq=%22cense+with+stinking+smoke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cense%20with%20stinking%20smoke%22&amp;f=false |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=606–607 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The goliards used sacred sources such as texts from the [[Mass (liturgy)|Roman Catholic Mass]] and Latin [[hymn]]s and played upon them to secular and satirical purposes in their poems (such as in the [[Drinkers Mass]]). The [[jargon]] of [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosophy]] also is frequently featured in their poems, either for satirical purposes, or because these concepts were familiar parts of the writers' working vocabulary. Their satires were almost uniformly directed against the church, attacking even the pope.

==Significance==
The word "goliard" outlived the original meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Great Big God''' is a Children's Christian music series from [[Vineyard Records UK]].

== History ==
In 2000, [[Nigel Hemming (Musician and Songwriter)|Nigel Hemming]] was approached by [[Vineyard Records UK]] to co-produce the first [[Vineyard Churches UK and Ireland|Vineyard UK]] children’s worship album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song entitled 'Great Big God', written by Nigel and Jo Hemming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://songselect.ccli.com/Songs/3373437/great-big-god|title=SongSelect by CCLI|website=songselect.ccli.com|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recorded and became the title track of the first album to be released under the brand ('''Great Big God''' – released in September 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following Easter, the song was chosen for use in the all age worship slot at [[Spring Harvest]], a national worship and teaching event in UK, and was featured on the live recording, ''Spring Harvest - Kids Praise 2002''.

Since the launch of the album in 2001 Great Big God as a series has grown and to date six albums, a DVD and three-disc best of compilation CD have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the series has been noted by many Christian music reviewers. For example, in February 2006 [[Cross Rhythms]] said that the "''Great Big God'' CDs have been amongst the most popular British-made children's worship albums of recent years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Great_Big_God/Backing_Tracks/13706/|title=Review: Backing Tracks - Great Big God {{!}} Cross Rhythms|website=www.crossrhythms.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Cross Rhythms again reiterated the popularity of the series saying "Great Big God CDs and DVDs...have been hugely popular with both parents and kids".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Great_Big_God/Great_Big_God_Live/77983/|title=Review: Great Big God Live - Great Big God - DVD {{!}} Cross Rhythms|website=www.crossrhythms.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''HaZvi''''' ({{Lang-he|הצבי}}, also ''Hatzevi'', literally 'The Gazelle') was a [[Hebrew-language]] newspaper published in [[Jerusalem]] from 1884 to 1914 by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], a leading pioneer of the [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revival of Hebrew]] as a spoken tongue.

==History==
The first issue of ''HaZvi'' was published on October 24, 1884. It began as a weekly paper and eventually developed into a daily.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel,'' Eliezer Ben Yehuda, pp. 123-124, Herzl Press &amp; Magraw Hill, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, the paper had a peak circulation of 1,200 copies, 500 distributed in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1074225.html 'Jews, the poet Bialik will come today' Haaretz, March 27, 2009]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''HaZvi'' revolutionized Hebrew newspaper publishing in Jerusalem by introducing secular issues and techniques of modern [[journalism]], especially after [[Itamar Ben-Avi]], Ben-Yehuda's son, joined the paper. Influenced by the French press, Ben-Avi brought in sensational headlines and a style of reporting that differed from newspapers of the old school. ''HaZvi '' became the organ of the [[New Yishuv]] (pre-state Jewish community), as the first Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. The paper included translations of French literature (previously only German literature had appeared in translation) and original Hebrew prose. The need for Hebrew words to report the daily news prompted Ben-Yehuda to begin his lifelong project of compiling a Hebrew dictionary. All this fit in with the [[Hebraist]] ideology that was on the rise.&lt;ref name="judaica"&gt;Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Newspapers, Hebrew,'' vol. 12, Keter Books, Jerusalem, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ha'Aor.jpg|thumb|''HaOr'' front page]]
In 1908, the name of the paper was changed to ''HaOr'' ({{rtl-lang|he|האור}} 'The Light') due to licensing restrictions.&lt;ref name="judaica" /&gt;

The paper was banned by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government during the [[First World War]] due to its proposals for a [[Jewish homeland]].

'''''Hortus conclusus''''' is a [[Latin]] term, meaning literally "enclosed garden". At their root, both of the words in ''hortus conclusus'' refer linguistically to enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, ''A History of Garden design'', (New York:Praeger) 1963:17.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hortus conclusus'' is both an [[emblem|emblematic attribute]] and a title of the [[Virgin Mary]] in [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] poetry&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Stewart, ''The Enclosed Garden: The Tradition and Image in Seventeenth-Century Poetry'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press) 1966, discussed late sixteenth and seventeenth-century poetry in English; its four first chapters trace the ''hortus conclusus'' theme in European literatures and the visual arts.&lt;/ref&gt; and art, suddenly appearing in paintings and manuscript illuminations about 1330 &lt;ref&gt; Michelle P. Brown, "The World of the Luttrell Psalter" British Library 2006,&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Brian E.

Macdougall, editor, ''Medieval Gardens'', Dumbarton Oaks Colloquium '''9''') 1986, traced the sudden development about 1400 of painted images of the Virgin Mary in a ''hortus conclusus''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a genre of actual garden that was enclosed both symbolically and as a practical concern, a major theme in the [[history of gardening]].&lt;ref&gt;Rob Aben and Saskia de Wit, ''The Enclosed Garden: History and Development of the Hortus Conclusus and its Re-Introduction into the Present-Day Urban Landscape'' (Rotterdam) 1999.

==The Virgin Mary as ''hortus conclusus''==
[[Image:Fra Angelico 043.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Annunciation]]'' - [[Convent of San Marco]], [[Florence]]]]

The term ''hortus conclusus'' is derived from the [[Vulgate]] Bible's ''[[Canticle of Canticles]]'' (also called the ''Song of Songs'' or ''Song of Solomon'') 4:12, in Latin: "''Hortus conclusus soror mea, sponsa, hortus conclusus, fons signatus''" ("A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html The whole text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140849/http://193.8.230.138/etexts/www/Bible/Song_of_Solomon.html |date=2011-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the shared linguistic culture of Christendom, expressed in [[homily|homilies]] expounding the ''Song of Songs'' as [[allegory]] where the image of King [[Solomon]]'s nuptial song to his bride was reinterpreted as the love and union between Christ and the Church, the mystical marriage with the Church as the [[Bride of Christ]]. 
[[File:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus|''Madonna on a Crescent Moon in ''Hortus Conclusus]] by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter.]]
The verse "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee" (4.7) from the ''Song'' was also regarded as a scriptural confirmation of the developing and still controversial doctrine of Mary's [[Immaculate Conception]] - being born without [[Original Sin]] ("macula" is Latin for spot).

[[Christian]] tradition states that [[Jesus Christ]] was conceived to Mary [[Virgin birth of Jesus|miraculously]] and without disrupting her virginity by the [[Holy Spirit]], the third person of the [[Holy Trinity]]. As such, Mary in late medieval and Renaissance art, illustrating the long-held doctrine of the [[Perpetual virginity of Mary]], as well as the Immaculate Conception, was shown in or near a walled garden or yard. This was a representation of her "closed off" womb, which was to remain untouched, and also of her being protected, as by a wall, from sin.  In the [[Grimani Breviary]], scrolling labels identify the emblemmatic objects betokening the Immaculate Conception: the enclosed garden (''hortus conclusus''), the tall cedar (''cedrus exalta''), the well of living waters (''puteus aquarum viventium''), the olive tree (''oliva speciosa''), the fountain in the garden (''fons hortorum''), the rosebush (''plantatio rosae'').&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Husband, reporting the exhibition and its catalogue in ''The Burlington Magazine'', '''125''', No. 967 (October 1983:643).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all actual medieval ''horti conclusi'' even strove to include all these details, the olive tree in particular being insufficiently hardy for northern European gardens.

The enclosed garden is recognizable in [[Fra Angelico]]'s ''Annunciation'' (''illustration, above left''), dating from 1430-32.

Two pilgrimage sites are dedicated to Mary of the Enclosed Garden in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Flanders|Flemish]] cultural area. One is the statue at the hermitage-chapel in [[Warfhuizen]]: "[[Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen|Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden]]". The second, "Onze Lieve Vrouw van Tuine" (literally "Our Lady of the Garden"), is venerated at the cathedral of [[Ypres]].

==Actual gardens==
[[File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpg|thumb|left|Hortus conclusus  depicted by Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins]]
All gardens are by definition enclosed or bounded spaces, but the enclosure may be somewhat open, and consist of columns, low hedges or fences. An actual [[walled garden]], literally surrounded by a wall, is a subset of gardens. The meaning of ''hortus conclusus'' suggests a more private style of garden.

In the [[history of gardens]] the High Medieval ''hortus conclusus'' typically had a well or fountain at the center, bearing its usual symbolic freight (see "[[Fountain of Life]]") in addition to its practical uses. The convention of four paths that divided the square enclosure into quadrants, was so strong that the pattern was employed even where the paths led nowhere. All medieval gardens were enclosed, protecting the private precinct from public intrusion, whether by folk or by stray animals. The enclosure might be as simple as [[Wattle-and-daub|woven wattle]] fencing or of stout or decorative masonry; or it might be enclosed by [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]]work tunneled pathways in a secular garden or by an arcaded [[cloister]], for communication or meditative pacing.

The origin of the [[cloister]] is in the Roman colonnaded [[peristyle]], as every garden history notes; the ruined and overgrown [[Roman villa]]s that were so often remade as the site of [[Benedictine monastery|Benedictine monasteries]] had lost their planted garden features with the first decades of abandonment: "gardening, more than architecture, more than painting, more than music, and far more than literature, is an ephemeral art; its masterpieces disappear, leaving little trace."&lt;ref&gt;Clifford 1963, ''eo. loc.''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though "when, in 1070, the [[Montecassino|abbey of Cassino]]&lt;ref&gt;The site was that of a Roman imperial villa, as was the site of Benedict's monastery at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], occupying Nero's former villa.&lt;/ref&gt; was rebuilt," [[Georgina Masson]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;Masson, ''Italian Gardens'' (New York: Abrams) 1961:46.&lt;/ref&gt; "the garden was described as 'a paradise in the Roman fashion'", it may have been merely "the aura of the great classical tradition" alone that had survived. The ninth-century idealised [[plan of Saint Gall]] (''illustration'') shows an arcaded cloister with a central well and cross paths from the centers of each range of arcading, but when a consciously patterned garden was revived for the medieval cloister, the patterning came through [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] and its hybrid culture that adapted many Islamic elements, in this case the enclosed North African courtyard gardens, ultimately based on the [[Persian garden]] tradition.

The practical enclosed garden was laid out in the treatise by [[Pietro Crescenzi]] of Bologna, ''Liber ruralium commodorum'', a work that was often copied, as the many surviving manuscripts of its text attest, and often printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Late medieval paintings and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations in manuscripts]] such as for ''[[The Romance of the Rose]]''— where the garden in the text is largely allegorical— often show a turfed bank for a seat as a feature of the ''hortus conclusus''. Only in the fifteenth century, at first in Italy, did some European gardens begin to look outward.
[[Image:Kölner Maler um 1430 001.jpg|thumb|upright0.1|''Virgin and Child with saints and donor family'', Cologne, c. 1430]]
Sitting, walking and playing music were the activities most often portrayed in the numerous fifteenth-century paintings and illuminated manuscripts, where strenuous activities were inappropriate. In Rome, a late fifteenth-century [[cloister]] at San Giovanni dei Genovesi was constructed for the use of the Genoese ''[[Nation|natio]]'', an ''Ospitium Genoensium'', as a plaque still proclaims, which provided shelter in cubicles off its vaulted encircling arcades, and a meeting place and shelter reuniting those from the distant home city.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Lotz, "Bramante and the Quattrocento Cloister" ''Gesta'' '''12'''.1/2 (1973):111-121) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat earlier, Pietro Barbo, who became [[Pope Paul II]] in 1464, began the construction of a ''hortus conclusus'', the Palazzetto del Giardino di San Marco, attached to the Venetian Cardinals' Roman seat, the Palazzo Venezia.&lt;ref&gt;It was dismantled and re-erected in 1910 to make space for [[Piazza Venezia]].&lt;/ref&gt; It served as Paul's private garden during his papacy; inscriptions stress its secular functions as ''sublimes moenibus hortos...ut relevare animum, durasque repellere curas'', a garden of sublime delights, a retreat from cares, and praise it in classicising terms, as the home of the [[dryad]]s, suggesting that there was a central grove of trees, and mentioning its snowy-white stuccoed porticoes. An eighteenth-century engraving shows a tree-covered central mount, which has been recreated in the modern replanting, with box-bordered cross and saltire gravelled paths.&lt;ref&gt;''Hinc hortos dryadumque domos et amena vireta/ Porticibus circum et niveis lustrata columnis''Lotz 1973 ''eo. loc.'' and figs 10 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Farnese Gardens]] (''Orti Farnesiani sul Palatino''—or "Gardens of Farnese upon the Palatine") were created by [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]] in 1550 on Rome's northern [[Palatine Hill]], for Cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] (1520–89). These become the first private [[botanical garden]]s in Europe (the first botanical gardens of any kind in Europe being started by Italian universities in the mid-16th century, only a short time before). Alessandro called his summer home at the site ''Horti Farnesiani'', probably in reference to the ''hortus conclusus.'' These gardens were also designed in the Roman peristylium style with a central fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theromanforum.com/?p=160 History of the Farneses and the garden.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Again in the age of the automobile, the enclosed garden that had never disappeared in [[Islam]]ic society, became an emblem of serenity and privacy in the Western world.

==In art==
[[Image:Unicorn annunciation.jpg|thumb|Hunt of the Unicorn Annunciation (ca. 1500) from a Netherlandish Book of Hours. In this example [[Gideon]]'s fleece is worked in as well, and the altar at the rear has [[Aaron's rod]] that miraculously flowered in the centre. Both are [[Typology (theology)|types]] for the Annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 54&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''hortus conclusus'' was one of a number of depictions of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages developed to be more informal and intimate than the traditional hieratic enthroned Virgin adopted from Byzantine icons, or the [[Coronation of the Virgin]]. The subject began as a specific metaphor for the [[Annunciation]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; but tended to develop into a relaxed ''[[sacra conversatione]]'', with several figures beside the Virgin seated, and less specific associations.  Germany and the Netherlands in the 15th century saw the peak popularity of this depiction of the Virgin, usually with Child, and very often a crowd of angels, saints and donors, in the garden - the garden by itself, to represent the Virgin, was much rarer. Often walls, or [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellises]] close off the sides and rear, or it may be shown as open, except for raised banks, to a landscape beyond. Sometimes, as with a [[Gerard David]]'s  ''The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor'' (Below) the garden is very fully depicted; at other times, as in [[engraving]]s by [[Martin Schongauer]], only a wattle fence and a few sprigs of grass serve to identify the theme. Italian painters typically also keep plants to a minimum, and do not have grass benches. A sub-variety of the theme was the German "Madonna of the Roses", sometimes attempted in sculptured [[altarpiece]]s. The image was rare in Orthodox [[icon]]s, but there are at least some Russian examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www2/art/images/icon18.jpg Russian example], [[Tretyakov Gallery]] Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of depiction, not usually compatible with correct perspective, concentrates on showing the whole wall, and several garden structures or features that symbolize the mystery of Christ's conception, mostly derived from the ''Song of Songs'' or other Biblical passages, as interpreted by theological writers. These may include one or more temple or church-like buildings, an [[Ivory Tower]] (SS 7.4), an open-air altar with [[Aaron's rod]] flowering, surrounded by the bare rods of the other tribes, a gatehouse "tower of David, hung with shields" (SS 7.4),&lt;ref&gt;"Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.&lt;/ref&gt; with the gate closed, the [[Ark of the Covenant]], a well (often covered), a fountain, and the morning sun above (SS 6.10).&lt;ref&gt;"Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"&lt;/ref&gt;
This type of depiction usually shows the Annunciation, although sometimes the child Jesus is held by Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,pp 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; The miniature at right shows a relatively simple example; below a large Spanish altarpiece is able to combine many of the usual features (others no doubt contained in the many chapels) with correct perspective.

A rather rare, late 15th century, variant of this depiction was to combine the Annunciation in the ''hortus conclusus'' with the ''Hunt of the [[Unicorn]]'' and ''Virgin and Unicorn'', so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] and whether this meaning is intended in many ''prima facie'' secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel [[Gabriel]] is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The [[Council of Trent]] finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction,&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 52-4 &amp; figs 126-9, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}, [http://www.sagen.at/fotos/data/603/medium/Maria_Gail_HortusConclusus_Detail.jpg another image]&lt;/ref&gt; partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal. In the 16th century the subject of the ''hortus conclusus'' drifts into the open air ''[[Sacra Conversazione]]'' and the Madonnas in a landscape of [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Raphael]], where it is hard to say if an allusion is intended.

An exhibition of later medieval visual representations of ''hortus inclusus'' was mounted at [[Dumbarton Oaks]], Washington DC;&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition catalogue, Marilyn Stokstad and Jerry Stannard, ''Gardens of the Middle Ages'', Dumbarton Oaks and Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas (University of Kansas) 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition drew a distinction between "garden representations as thematic reinforcements and those that seemingly treat the garden as a subject in itself"; in reviewing it Timothy Husband, warned against uncritical interpretation of the refined detail in manuscript illuminations' "seemingly objective representation". "Late medieval garden imagery, by subjugating direct observation to symbolic or allegorical intention, reflects more a state of mind than reality," &lt;ref&gt;Husband 1983:644.&lt;/ref&gt; if a disjunct can be detected where the objects of the world shimmered with pregnant allegorical meaning. South Netherlandish illuminations and painting appear to document the "turf benches, fountains, raised beds, 'estrade'&lt;ref&gt;An ''estrade'' tree was pruned into a series of diminishing horizontal tiers like a sweetmeat stand, the French ''estrade'' coming from Spanish ''estrado'', denoting the carpeted and raised section of a room (cf ''OED'', ''s.v.'' "estrade", "estrado").&lt;/ref&gt; trees, potted plants, walkways, enclosing walls, [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellises]], [[Acacia|wattle]] fences and [[Pergola|bowers]]" familiar to contemporary viewers, but assembled into an illusion of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Husband, ''eo. loc.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern cultural references==
The concept for the 2011 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was the hortus conclusus, a contemplative room, a garden within a garden. Designed by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and with a garden created by Piet Oudolf, the Pavilion was a place abstracted from the world of noise and traffic and the smells of London – an interior space within which to sit, to walk, to observe the flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2011/04/serpentine_gallery_pavillion_2011_zumthor.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky: compiled from information supplied by her relatives and friends''''' is a book originally published in 1886 in London;{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{sfn|Theosopedia}} it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]], the first biographer of [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|H. P. Blavatsky]] (née Hahn).{{sfn|Cranston|1993|p=18}} He describes the many unusual incidents in her life, beginning from her childhood in Russia and asserts that she has been with "an early connection with the [[Plane (esotericism)|supernatural world]];" he says about her short unlucky marriage and "decade of extensive global travels," about her period of learning in Tibet, and the "criticism she received about some of her [[Paranormal|'phenomena']] and practices."{{sfn|Cambridge Books}}{{refn|group=note|"His (A.

== From history of compilation ==
Washington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship, and over a decade (1879–89), she led with them the correspondence and has supplied to the author the materials for her biography.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}{{refn|group=note|"Much of this biography had been derived from Blavatsky herself."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=19}}}} The book was "an attempt to reestablish" Blavatsky's reputation after the attacks of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] contained in [[Hodgson Report]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=33}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=19}} Sinnett long continued correcting often distorted information about the time and place of the events in the book, having arrived to Blavatsky in Würzburg for it. Subsequently, she continued to send him additional information, which pop up in her memory.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Epilogue}} Sinnett wrote: "In consultation we decided that ''Memoirs'' would be too comprehensive a title for the book and agreed on the word ''Incidents'' instead."{{sfn|Sinnett|1922|p=84}} In her letter to the author Blavatsky stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Do whatever you like. Publish the memoirs, write what you think best and proper.

=== Childhood ===
Helena told her biographer about a strange event that happened to her in early childhood. She wanted to get a better look at a portrait hanging high on the wall. She made up a pyramid out of two small tables and one chair, and tried to get to the portrait. What happened next, she does not know, because she lost consciousness at the moment when her building swayed and began to crumble. When she regained consciousness, she saw herself completely intact on the floor, and tables and chair were again in their usual places. Nevertheless, "the mark of her small hand remained imprinted on the dusty wall high up beside the picture."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=34|Cranston|1993|2p=30|Сенкевич|2012|3pp=75, 119}}

The author tells about another case where Helena miraculously survived: "A horse bolted with her — she fell, with her foot entangled in the stirrup, and before the horse was stopped she ought, she thinks, to have been killed outright but for a strange sustaining power she distinctly felt around her, which seemed to hold her up in defiance of gravitation." She was then fourteen years old.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=34|Cranston|1993|2p=30|Сенкевич|2012|3p=78}} Sinnett informs that, according to her earliest memories, she occasionally saw near herself her protector. From early childhood, this form has prevailed in her imagination. He was always the same, his features never changed. "In after life she met him as a living man, and knew him as though she had been brought up in his presence."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=35|Kuhn|1992|2p=47}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alexander Senkevich|Senkevich]] wrote that after a few years "she will find him in the London crowd, and he will become her [[Mahatma|Master]]."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=78}} According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], "in August 1851 she (Blavatsky) first met with her [[Morya (Theosophy)|'Master']]."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=4}} Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}}

A certain seer told about Helena's future:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This little lady is quite different from all of you. There are great events lying in wait for her in the future. I feel sorry in thinking that I will not live to see my predictions of her verified; ''but they will all come to pass''!"{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=30|Сенкевич|2012|2p=73}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. III}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Failed marriage ===
According to Helena Hahn's aunt, the reason for this marriage was frivolous nature of her niece. Her governess has said that her character is bad, and hardly there is a man who would be willing to marry her. To enhance the impact of her words the governess added that "even the old man she had found so ugly, and had laughed at so much, calling him 'a plume-less raven' — that even he would decline her for a wife! That was enough: three days after she made him (Mr. Blavatsky) propose, and then, frightened at what she had done, sought to escape from her joking acceptance of his offer. But it was too late."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1pp=39–40|Kuhn|1992|2p=49|Сенкевич|2012|3p=124}}
Helena's aunt has described:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"At the altar, she heard the priest saying to her: 'Thou shalt honour and obey thy husband', and at this hated word 'shalt,' her young face — for she was hardly seventeen — was seen to flush angrily, then to become deadly pale. She was overheard to mutter in response, through her set teeth — 'Surely, I shall not.'"&lt;br/&gt;[Sinnett continues:] "And surely she has not. Forthwith she determined to take the law and her future life into her own hands, and — he left her 'husband' for ever, without giving him any opportunity to ever even think of her as ''his wife.''"{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=40|Kuhn|1992|2p=49|Сенкевич|2012|3p=126}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sinnett says that Mr. Blavatsky himself was ready to agree in the divorce. He tried to get a formal divorce on the reason that "his marriage had never been more than a form, and that his wife had run away; but Russian law at the time was not favourable to divorce, and the attempt failed."{{sfn|Sinnett|1913|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. IV}}

Next Blavatsky (Hahn) has left Russia and voyaged "ten long years in strange and out-of-the-way places — in Central Asia, India, South America, Africa, and Eastern Europe."{{sfn|Sinnett|1913|p=40}}

=== Occult phenomena in Russia ===
Blavatsky's [[siddhi|unusual psychic abilities]], that had manifested even in her childhood and adolescence, during her travel significantly increased and determined, and she returned to Russia, having many [[occult]] powers.{{sfn|Sinnett|1913|p=59}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XIX}}
In the town of [[Pskov|Pskoff]] Blavatsky had performed occult phenomena under follows classification:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Direct and perfectly clear written and verbal answers to mental questions — or "thought-reading".{{sfn|Melton|2001e}}
#Prescriptions for different diseases, in Latin, and subsequent cures.{{sfn|Melton|2001a}}
#Private secrets, unknown to all but the interested party, divulged, especially in the case of those persons who mentioned insulting doubts.
#Change of weight in furniture and of persons at will.{{sfn|Melton|2001c}}{{refn|group=note|"The perfections ([[siddhi]]s) are attained through birth, drugs (oadhi), spells ([[mantra]]s), austerity (tapas), or concentration ([[samadhi]])."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=339}}}}
#Letters from unknown correspondents, and immediate answers written to queries made, and found in the most out-of-the-way mysterious places.
#Appearances and [[Apport (paranormal)|''apport'']] of objects unclaimed by any one present.{{sfn|Melton|2001}}
#Sounds as of musical notes in the air wherever Mme. Blavatsky desired they should resound.{{sfn|Sinnett|1913|pp=66–67}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XIX}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that the theosophical phenomena were the following: "knocking at will, tingling of invisible bells, the carrying and 'materialization' of all sorts of objects, and above all, 'precipitation' of letters sent by 'astral' means."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One time Blavatsky had caused raps inside the glasses of a skeptical professor with such force that they were knocked from his nose. In reply to a somewhat frivolous lady who had asked what is the best conductor for the production of such raps, the table spelt out 'gold', and the next minute this lady rushed out of the room with her hands inflicted on her mouth, as she had felt the raps on her gold artificial teeth.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=65|Cranston|1993|2p=67|Melton|2001b|3p=1288}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XVI}}

Blavatsky has transformed weight of small table so that Leonid Hahn, her brother, couldn't lift it. Then she recovered it to a normal weight, and Leonid raised the table as a feather.{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=70|Cranston|1993|2p=69|Сенкевич|2012|3pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XVI}} Sinnett informs, according to Jelihowsky's narrative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"At one moment as we sat at supper in the dining-room, there were loud accords played on the piano which stood in the adjoining apartment, and which was closed and locked, and so placed that we could all of us see it from where we were through the large open doors. Then at the first command and look of Mme. Blavatsky there came rushing to her through the air her tobacco-pouch, her box of matches, her pocket-handkerchief, or anything she asked, or was made to ask for."{{sfn|Sinnett|1913|p=83}}{{sfn|Melton|2001d}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XIX}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mediums and mediumship ===
Sinnett tells that Blavatsky has tried with the most prominent [[mediumship|mediums]] to call and "communicate with those dearest to her, and whose loss she had deplored, but could never succeed." She said to him that "she often saw, to her disgust, how her own recollections and brain-images were drawn from her memory and disfigured in the confused amalgamation that took place between their reflection in the medium's brain, which instantly sent them out, and the shells which ''sucked them in'' like a sponge and objectivised them."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1pp=102–103|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2pp=28–29}} Next Sinnett transmits the following words by Blavatsky:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even the [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialized]] form of my uncle at the [[Eddy Brothers|Eddys]] was the picture; it was I who sent it out from my own mind, as I had come out to make experiments without telling it to anyone. It was like an empty outer envelope of my uncle that I seemed to throw on the medium's [[astral body]]. I saw and followed the process, I knew Will Eddy was a genuine medium, and the phenomenon as real as it could be, and therefore, when days of trouble came for him, I defended him in the papers."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=103|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2p=29}}{{refn|group=note|When a professor George Bird published in the newspaper ''[[Daily Graphic]]'' article in which Eddy brothers were declared frauds, Blavatsky sent to this newspaper her response to Bird.{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=253}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Jelihowsky, Blavatsky claimed that she is "no medium, but only a mediator between mortals and beings we knew nothing about."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=61|Kuhn|1992|2p=63}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XIX}} In one of her letters to relatives Blavatsky informed that the last remnant of her psycho-physical helplessness has leaved out her and will not return any more. In connection with her mediumship, Sinnett  argues that "there, ''where a less strong nature would have been surely wrecked in the struggle, her indomitable will found somehow or other the means of subjecting the world of the invisibles — to the denizens of which she has ever refused the name of 'spirits' and souls — to her own control.''"{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=120|Kuhn|1992|2p=70}}{{sfn|Neff|2013|loc=Ch. XIX}}{{refn|group=note|Washington wrote that Blavatsky's ability to see the features of conventional mediums has allowed to oppose her might to their charlatanism, inadequacy or inactivity.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 2}}}}

== Criticism ==
Although Blavatsky helped to the author by providing information, in Sinnett's book there is a "number of errors of fact which have been pointed out by later writers."{{sfn|Theosopedia}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Vsevolod Solovyov|Solovyov]] wrote concerning Sinnett's book following: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the sake of inflation of Blavatsky's fame Sinnett published a book entitled ''Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky.'' The book portrays, ''on the foundation of the most precise evidences,'' the life of Helena Petrovna. Well, it is not difficult to prove that this book is mainly a collection of stories about something that never happened."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|Kalnitsky wrote that, like a charismatic and debatable person, Blavatsky instigated intensive response, both positive and negative, and following opinions have often issued superfluous contempt or "uncritical idolisation." However, separately from such secondary opinions, an even more problematical challenge is that "she herself was consistently revising, retelling, and reinterpreting the narrative of her life, often intentionally exaggerating, omitting, changing, or disguising facts and details for her own private reasons."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=178}}}}{{refn|group=note|[[René Guénon|Guénon]] wrote that Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme. Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Lavoie claimed: "Much of this biography had been derived from Blavatsky herself; however, Sinnett's history should not be discounted merely on these grounds or for the fact that he was a follower of Blavatsky. Sinnett's personal writings remain remarkably critical of Blavatsky."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=19}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Solovyov stated that from the analysis of the phenomena performed by Blavatsky, which made [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Hodgson]], "we can conclude, with which 'serious and honest' ''the researcher'' we deal in the face of Mr. Sinnett, this 'famous apostle' of the modern theosophy and main defender of H. P. Blavatsky."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=158}} Solovyov also stated that the theosophical "Universal Brotherhood" is only a "funny bunch of systematic deceptions, as say the modern Frenchmen – ''rien qu'une fumisterie.''" He wrote that the conclusions of the SPR about "Blavatsky's ''phenomena'' make superfluous the assumption that, in addition to the tricks, she could to demonstrate for the benefit of the theosophy some really exceptional psychic abilities."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|p=175}} Hodgson in his report argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Sinnett treats with scorn the supposition that Madame Blavatsky could have produced either the 'raps' or the 'astral bells' by means of any machine concealed about her person; but I cannot help thinking that the latter sounds at least might have been produced in this way. Madame Coulomb asserts that they were actually so produced, by the use of a small musical-box, constructed on the same principle as the machine employed in connection with the trick known under the name 'Is your watch a repeater?' and she produced garments which she asserted had belonged to Madame Blavatsky, and showed me stains resembling iron-mould on the right side, slightly above the waist, which she affirmed had been caused by contact with the metal of the machine."{{sfn|Hodgson|1885|p=263}}{{sfn|Соловьёв|1893|pp=149–150}}{{refn|group=note|However Washington wrote: "She (Mme. Coulomb) was a haughty, vengeful and quarrelsome bitch, and a petty thief who was not above siphoning off the housekeeping money. As for Alexis, he lived completely under the thumb of his sharp-tongued and ambitious wife."{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=79}} Also [[Alexander Senkevich|Senkevich]] wrote: "Mme. Coulomb was trying to blackmail the members of the Council of governors in [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]] by some notes incriminated to Blavatsky. She demanded money, threatening with the publication of these notes."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=411}}}}{{refn|group=note|H. P. Blavatsky "was a powerful rapping medium."{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1288}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, according to Goodrick-Clarke, "a thorough analysis of the Hodgson Report by [[Vernon Harrison]] of the SPR effectively demolished both the Coulomb accusations and the conclusions of the Report."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=14}}

== New editions and translations ==
The book was reprinted several times and has been translated into French.{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{refn|group=note|"37 editions published between 1886 and 2013 in English and French and held by 356 WorldCat member libraries worldwide."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}} Second edition of the book was published in 1913 in abridged form.{{refn|group=note|[[Howard Murphet|Murphet]] stated that 2nd edition of the ''Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky'' "is abridged, with many important items eliminated."{{sfn|Murphet|1988|p=272}}}}

'''Itzhak "Ben" Bentov''' (also ''Ben-Tov'') ({{lang-he|'''יצחק בנטוב'''}}) (August 9, 1923 – May 25, 1979) was a Czechoslovakia-born [[Israeli American]] scientist, inventor, [[mysticism|mystic]] and author. His many inventions, including the steerable [[Cardiac catheterization|cardiac catheter]], helped pioneer the [[biomedical engineering]] industry.&lt;ref name="mars"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/medical-devices-and-disruptive-technology-the-case-of-boston-scientific |title=Medical devices and disruptive technology: Boston Scientific |work=MaRS Discovery District |date=February 8, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an early exponent of what has come to be referred to as [[consciousness]] studies and authored several books on the subject.

==Early life==

Bentov was born in [[Humenné]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1923. During World War II, his parents were killed in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref name="journey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journey into the Heart: A Tale of Pioneering Doctors and Their Race to Transform Cardiovascular Medicine Hardcover |author1=David Monagan |author2=David O. Williams, MD. |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m04e-NHGFUcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Medi-Tech+Itzhak+Bentov#v=onepage&amp;q=Medi-Tech%20Itzhak%20Bentov&amp;f=false |location=New York  |page=106 |isbn=978-1592402656 |accessdate=January 17, 2015|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He narrowly escaped being sent to the camps and moved to [[Mandate Palestine|British Palestine]], first living on the [[Shoval]] kibbutz in the [[Negev]].&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Books/A-someone-to-love |title=A 'someone' to love |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |author=Barbara Hollander |date=December 12, 2005|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite not having a university degree,&lt;ref name="secrets" /&gt; Bentov joined the Israeli Science Corps, which [[David Ben-Gurion]] incorporated into the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] one month before Israel declared statehood in 1948. The Science Corps became a military branch known by the [[Hebrew abbreviations|Hebrew acronym]] [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems#History|HEMED]]. Bentov designed Israel's first rocket for the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|War of Independence]]. HEMED was forced to make improvised weapons as there was a worldwide embargo on selling weapons to the Jewish state.&lt;ref name="secrets" /&gt;

Bentov immigrated to the United States in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&amp;dat=19771022&amp;id=f-kgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Mm4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5054,4560029  |title=Spiritual Frontiers Hears Itzhak Bentov|work=[[The Day (New London)|The Hour]] |date=October 22, 1977 |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in Massachusetts. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Index to Petitions and Records of Naturalizations of the U.S. and District Courts for the District of Massachusetts, 1907-1966|volume= M1545 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions==

Bentov began with a workshop in the basement of a Catholic church in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="mars"/&gt; In 1967, he built the steerable heart catheter and attracted the attention of businessman [[John Abele]], with whom Bentov founded the Medi-Tech corporation in 1969.&lt;ref name="abele"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://medcitynews.com/2010/06/boston-scientifics-beginning-through-john-abeles-eyes |title=Boston Scientific's beginning, through John Abele's eyes |work=MedCity News |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abele later recalled of Bentov's workshop,

{{quote|He had the most amazing collection of tools. He had a chemistry lab, he had an electronics lab, he had a miller so he could mill and shape steel or wood or plastic, he had an extruder so he could work with polymers. He would literally make his own polymers or at least mix different polymers in order to get what he wanted. As a result, he was kind of a renaissance person, technologically as well as intellectually.|author=[[John Abele]]&lt;ref name="abele" /&gt;}}

In 1979, Abele and [[Peter Nicholas (businessman)|Peter Nicholas]] looked to grow the successful business and established [[Boston Scientific]] as a holding company to purchase Medi-Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/about-us/history.html |title=About Us: History |publisher=[[Boston Scientific]]  |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentov was the holder of numerous patents. In addition to the steerable cardiac catheter, his inventions ranged included diet spaghetti, automobile brake shoes, EKG electrodes and pacemaker leads.&lt;ref name="journey" /&gt;

==Spirituality==

Bentov was extremely fascinated by [[consciousness]], in particular how it related to physiology. In his 1977 book, ''Stalking the Wild Pendulum: On the Mechanics of Consciousness'', he wrote that "consciousness permeates everything."

{{quote|He was a very inventive person, but also a person who was not the type you would normally think would be an inventor. He was a very spiritual person, he did meditation, he was a very soft-spoken person. He was interested in how the brain worked and actually attached electrodes to his head which were connected to a function generator in which he could change the wave shape and the power and learned about how the brain interprets these different frequencies.&lt;ref name="abele" /&gt;|author=John Abele}}

Bentov's invention was a seismographic device to record the heartbeat, in particular the aorta's reverberations. [[Marc Seifer]] described the results: "During normal breathing, the reverberations in the aorta arc out of phase with the heartbeat and the system is inharmonious. However, during meditation and when the breath is held, the echo off the bifurcation of the aorta (where the aorta forks at the pelvis to go into each leg) is in resonance with the heartbeat and the system becomes synchronized, thus utilizing a minimum amount of energy. This resonant beat is approximately seven cycles per second, which corresponds not only to the alpha rhythm of the brain but also to the low-level magnetic pulsations of the Earth."&lt;ref name="seifer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Transcending the Speed of Light: Consciousness, Quantum Physics, and the Fifth Dimension |author=Marc Seifer Ph.D. |date=2008 |isbn=1594772290|publisher=[[Inner Traditions – Bear &amp; Company]] |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Bentov was killed on May 25, 1979, as a passenger aboard [[American Airlines Flight 191]] that crashed at [[O'Hare International Airport]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Sunday Herald|title=Jumbo Jet Crashes On Take Off |date=May 27, 1979|agency=[[UPI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments after takeoff, an engine detached from the plane and tore off part of the wing, sending the plane down. The crash killed all 271 passengers and crew on board and two people on the ground.  It is the deadliest single plane crash on U.S. soil to date.

Bentov's daughter, English professor [[Sharona Ben-Tov Muir]], wrote a memoir about her father, ''The Book of Telling: Tracing the Secrets of My Father's Lives'' in 2005. It was not until after his death that she learned about his life in the Israeli Defense Forces and that he had created Israel's first rocket. Searching for answers as to why he never discussed this part of his life, Muir traveled to Israel and researched his years there.&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;

[[File:Acharya KundaKunda.jpg|thumb|[[Kundakunda]], one of the most revered [[Digambara monk]]]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Jain monasticism''' refers to the order of [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s in the [[Jain community]]. The term ''nirgrantha'' ("bondless") was used for Jain monks in the past. The monastic practices of two major sects (''[[Digambara]]'' and ''[[Śvētāmbara]]'') vary greatly, but the major principles of both are identical.

==Terminology==
''Digambaras'' use the word ''{{IAST|muṇi}}'' for male monastics and ''[[aryika]]'' for female monastics. ''[[Digambara monk]]s'' are also called ''nirgrantha'' (without bonds).{{sfn|B.K. Jain|2013|p=62}} Buddhist texts refer to [[Mahavira]], the last ''[[Tirthankara]]'', as ''Nigaṇṭha  Jñātaputta''. ''Nigaṇṭha'' means "without knot, tie, or string"; ''Jñātaputta'' (son of ''Natas'') refers to his clan of origin, ''Jñāta'' or ''Naya'' ([[Prakrit]]).{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}} ''[[Śvētāmbara]]s'' use the word ''sadhvi''s for female monastics.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152}}

== History ==
{{Main|Jain schools and branches}}
[[File:Acharya5.jpg|thumb|alt=Monk sitting cross-legged on the floor|[[Vidyasagar (Jain monk)|Vidyasagar]], a prominent Digambara monk]]
Historians believe that a united Jain ''[[Sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]'' (community) existed before 367 BCE, about 160 years after the ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (liberation) of Mahavira. The community then gradually divided into two [[Religious denomination|denominations]]: the ''Digambara'' and the ''Śvētāmbara''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=45}}

''Acharya'' [[Kundakunda]] is the most revered ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|acharya]]'' (preceptor) of the [[Jain cosmology#Time cycle|''Duḥṣamā'' period]] of the present ''avasarpiṇī'' (descending) era.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=vi}}

[[File:Mahavratas.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of an ascetic sitting under a tree, with the five Great Vows on its branches|The five Great Vows of Jain ascetics]]
Five ''mahāvratas'' (Great Vows), from Mahavira's teachings, are followed by all Jain ascetics. Although Jain householders are also required to observe them, ascetics are bound more strictly.&lt;ref name=pshah&gt;Pravin Shah, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism] Jainism Literature Center, Harvard University Archives (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digambara monks ==
{{Main|Digambara monk}}
''Digambara'' monks follow 28 ''vratas'' (vows): five ''mahāvratas'' (Great Vows); five ''samitis'' (regulations); the five-fold control of the senses (''pañcendriya nirodha''); six ''Şadāvaśyakas'' (essential duties), and seven ''niyamas'' (restrictions).{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=196-197}}

== Initiation ==
A ''Śvētāmbara'' initiation involves a procession in which the initiate symbolically disposes of his material wealth and makes donations. This is followed (or preceded) by another ritual in which the initiate receives an ''ogho'' (a small broom made of wool) from their mentor as a symbol of welcome into the monastic order.&lt;ref name="jainworld1"/&gt; The initiate then puts on monastic clothing and pluck out hairs by hand. Further rituals formally initiate them into the monastic order. The ''[[Śvētāmbara Terapanth]]'' sect requests written permission from a person's parents before initiating them into the ascetic order.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=155}}

==Rules of conduct==
[[File:Jain meditation.jpg|thumb|alt=Three women in white saris, meditating cross-legged on a floor|Jain nuns meditating]]
The earliest known texts often ask for ascetics to be in complete solitude, identifying the isolation of soul and non-soul. However, soon after Mahavira's death ascetics organized themselves into groups.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152}} A few examples of ascetics living in complete solitude are found in the ''Digambara'' sect.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=153}}

Jain ascetics are detached from social and worldly activities; all activities are aimed at self-purification for self-realization. They follow established guidelines for daily worship and austerity.&lt;ref name="jainworld1"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jainworld.com/societies/jain_monks_nuns.asp |title=Welcome to Jainworld - Jain Monks nuns, Sadhu, Shraman, Muni, Sadhvi, Shramani, Aryï¿½, Pranatipï¿½taviraman Mahavrat, Mrishavadaviraman Mahï¿½vrat, Adattadï¿½naviraman Mahavrat , Maithunaviraman Mahavrat, Parigrahaviraman Mahavrat |work=Jainworld.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monk's daily routine is broadly structured by three ideological formulae: the five great vows (''mahavrata''), the eight matrices of doctrine (''pravacana-matrka''), and the six obligatory actions (''avasyaka''). The first two are restrictions, and the third is positively framed in what the monk is encouraged to do daily.{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=101}}

Ascetics do not have a home or possessions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152}} They choose austerity, avoid services such as telephones and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Singhvi |first=Sushila |title=Jainism at a glance |url=http://www.jainstudy.org/jsc1.99-JainismAtAGlance.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175627/http://www.jainstudy.org/jsc1.99-JainismAtAGlance.htm |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks engage in activities such as meditation, seeking knowledge and acquiring self-discipline.{{sfn|Singh|2007|p=29}}

The ''[[Yati]]'' of the ''Śvētāmbara'' sect and the ''[[Bhattaraka]]'' of the Digambara Terapanth do not wander; they usually live in temples and perform daily rituals.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152}}

The monks rise before dawn, most around 5:00 a.m. but some as early as 2:00 a.m. In observance of ''utsarg-samiti'', defecation takes place in the open where feces not harm living creatures; urination is into a shallow pan, which is emptied onto a dry patch of ground.{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=101}}

In the ''Digambara'' tradition, an ascetic rises from ''kshullak'' (one who uses two pieces of cloth) through ''Ailak'' (uses one piece of cloth) to ''muni'' (or ''sadhu''). Over time a number of designations were mentioned in shastras, such as ''gani'', ''pannyas'' and ''pravartak''. The Śvētāmbara Terapanth sect has a new rank of junior monks, ''samana''.{{sfn|Singh|2007|p=119}}

==Attire and possessions==
[[File:Pichi kamandal shastra.jpeg|thumb|alt=Two whisks, two kettles with spouts and two open books|The three instruments of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'': ''pichi'', ''[[kamandalu]]'' and [[shastra]]s]]

''Śvētāmbara'' monastics wear white, seamless clothing.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=45}}

==Chaturmas==
{{Main|Chaturmas}}
''Chaturmas'' is the four-month monsoon period during which ascetics stay in one place to reduce the risk of accidentally killing insects and other small forms of life which thrive during the rains. This period is suitable for ''sravakas'' to renew their faith by listening to teachings of the ''[[dharma]]'', meditation and ''vartas'' (acts of self-control).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mehta |first=Makrand |title=Indian merchants and entrepreneurs in historical perspective: with special reference to shroffs of Gujarat, 17th to 19th centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lz3gNDMbWEC |year=1991 |publisher=Academic Foundation |isbn=81-7188-017-7 |p=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''Chaturmas'', the chief ''[[sadhu]]'' of each group gives a daily ''pravacana'' or ''vyakhyana'' (sermon) attended mostly by women and retired men but on special days by most of the lay congregation. During their eight months of travel, the ''sadhus'' give sermons whenever requested (most often when they arrive in a new village or town in their travels).{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=104}}

==Mahavira's asceticism==
The ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]'' describes Mahavira's asceticism in detail; from it, most of the ascetic practices (including the restraints and regulations) are derived:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] | title =The Kalpa Sūtra | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1884 | location =Oxford | language =English| url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/sbe2200.htm | series =[[Sacred Books of the East|Sacred Books of the East vol.22, Part 1]] | isbn =0-7007-1538-X }} ''Note: ISBN refers to the UK:Routledge (2001) reprint. URL is the scan version of the original 1884 reprint''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The Venerable Ascetic Mahavira for a year and a month wore clothes; after that time he walked about naked, and accepted the alms in the hollow of his hand. For more than twelve years the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira neglected his body and abandoned the care of it; he with equanimity bore, underwent, and suffered all pleasant or unpleasant occurrences arising from divine powers, men, or animals.|''Kalpa Sūtra'' 117}}

{{Quote|Henceforth the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira was houseless, circumspect in his walking, circumspect in his speaking, circumspect in his begging, circumspect in his accepting (anything), in the carrying of his outfit and drinking vessel; circumspect in evacuating excrement, urine, saliva, mucus, and uncleanliness of the body; circumspect in his thoughts, circumspect in his words, circumspect in his acts; guarding his thoughts, guarding his words, guarding his acts, guarding his senses, guarding his chastity; without wrath, without pride, without deceit, without greed; calm, tranquil, composed, liberated, free from temptations, without egoism, without property; he had cut off all earthly ties, and was not stained by any worldliness: as water does not adhere to a copper vessel, or [[collyrium]] to mother of pearl (so sins found no place in him); his course was unobstructed like that of Life; like the firmament he wanted no support; like the wind he knew no obstacles; his heart was pure like the water (of rivers or tanks) in autumn; nothing could soil him like the leaf of a lotus; his senses were well protected like those of a tortoise; he was single and alone like the horn of a rhinoceros; he was free like a bird; he was always waking like the fabulous bird Bharundal, valorous like an elephant, strong like a bull, difficult to attack like a lion, steady and firm like Mount Mandara, deep like the ocean, mild like the moon, refulgent like the sun, pure like excellent gold'; like the earth he patiently bore everything; like a well-kindled fire he shone in his splendour.|''Kalpa Sūtra'' 118}}

'''Kapadi''' is one of the minority [[Hindu]] community of [[India]], who are followers of '''Kapadi Sampradaya'''.

==History==

Origin of Kapadi community, according to the folklore, is associated with Lord [[Rama]]. The legend states that [[Rama]] visited Hinglaj (Sindh, now in Pakistan ), dressed as a Kapadi, to get rid of the sin of killing [[Ravana]], who was a [[Brahmin]] by birth.&lt;ref name=a&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d8yFaNRcYcsC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;dq=kapdi+community&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z7LSTYzpDIyHrAfQ44XCCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kapadi&amp;f=false] Gujarat, Part 1 By Kumar Suresh Singh, Rajendra Behari Lal, Anthropological Survey of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

This dress was given by Rama to one Laljusraj, who accompanied him on the trip. Laljusraj is said to be founder of Kapadi sect. It is believed that it is the same dress, that is preserved at [[Mekan Dada]] Temple at [[Dhrang]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oPUFiGRH07IC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=kapadi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2q_STbKOOZGJrAeU_-WqCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=kapadi&amp;f=false] Kutch in festival and custom By K. S. Dilipsinh&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapadi community are mainly found in [[Kutch]], Gujarat, where they are held in very high regards and there are many followers of this sect. Kapadi are considered to be descendant of [[Kshatriya]] princes.

A Kapadi priest or saint is called ''Dada'' as a mark of respect. In Kutch, Kapadi priests, hold the post of chief priest of temple of [[Ashapura Mata]] at [[Mata no Madh]], which is chief deity or [[Kuldevi]] of [[Jadeja]] rulers of Kutch. They are known as ''Rajabawa'', and were given villages as an estate by the rulers of Kutch.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Divisions of Kapadi Sect==

There are main four groups of [[Kapadi Sampradaya]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;
# Ramsnehi Kapadi - who worship [[Rama]] as their chief deity and are found in [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] &amp; [[Uttar Pradesh]]
# Ashapuri Kapadi - who worship [[Ashapura Mata]], and were originally located in Kutch but have now migrated to other areas.
# Sravani Kapadi - who are mainly found in [[Banaskantha]] district of [[Gujarat]]
# Mekapanthi Kapadi - who are followers of [[Mekan Dada]], and are the most recent sect of Kapadi community.

==Customs==

The community consider themselves at par with other upper caste community and this is accepted by others also.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;
[[File:Temple of Raja Kapadi Dada at Dabada Kutch.jpg|thumb|Temple of Shree Jai Raja Kapadi Dada, a saint of Kapadi community, housing his [[Samadhi]] at Village Dabada in [[Kutch]]. Note mention of [[Om|Aum]] and ''Jee Naam'', religious symbol of [[Kapadi Sampradaya]] embedded on the main gate written in [[Gujarati script]] and [[Saffron (color)|deep saffron]] color.]]

The dead among Kapadi are given [[samadhi]]. Only ''Raja Bawa''s are cremated.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

The agriculture is main occupation of Kapadi community, others being involved in small business and jobs.

'''Leon Heyke''' ([[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]: ''Léón Heyke'') (October 10, 1885&amp;mdash;October 15, 1939) was a [[Roman Catholic]] priest, theologian, educator, poet and Kashubian-Polish activist.

==Biography==
Heyke was born October 10, 1885 in the [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] village of [[Cierżnia]], in [[Wejherowo County]].

Father Heyke was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on March 13, 1910 in [[Pelplin]]. In 1913 he completed his doctorate in theology with a dissertation on the letters of [[John the Evangelist|Saint John]]. During this time he traveled widely throughout [[Kashubia]], particularly through the northern part, gathering information about Kashubian culture and language. Although he was associated with the [[Society of Young Kashubians]] from its start,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czetnica.org/kaszebsko-leteratura/leon-heyke/ ]{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he gradually distanced himself from the Society's cultural objectives and focused on his priestly vocation and his poetry, which he published under the [[nom de plume]] Stanisław Czernicki.

When Poland regained its freedom after the [[First World War]], Father Heyke was based from 1920 to 1935 in [[Kościerzyna]], where he served as chaplain and teacher of religion and French at the National [[Gymnasium (school)|Gimnazjum]]. He resumed his prolific publication of poetry and historical works, preferring to emphasize northern variants of the Kashubian language.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Treder,"The Kashubian Language and its Dialects: The Range of Use," in Cezary Obracht-Prondzyński and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz (eds), The Kashubs: Past and Present (Bern: Peter Lang, 2011), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he became known as one of the leading Kashubian activists. Among other things, he was the featured speaker at the 1931 dedication of the monument to [[Hieronim Derdowski]] in [[Wiele, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Wiele]].

After the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Father Heyke attempted to join the Polish Army as a chaplain. However, he was arrested by the Germans in the town of [[Wda, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Wda]] and executed with other clergy and intellectuals on October 15 in the [[Szpęgawski Forest]] near [[Starogard Gdański]].

Although Father Heyke's works were rarely published during the period of Communist rule, his life and writings now enjoy their proper place in Kashubian culture. In 2005 the Kashubian Institute of Gdańsk sponsored a conference on Father Heyke entitled ''Świętopełk literatury kaszubskiej'' ("Swiantopolk of Kashubian Literature"), a reference to the revered Kashubian historical figure [[Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania]]. The conference proceedings have been published under the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.czec.pl/index.php?p839,leon-heyke-swietopelk-literatury-kaszubskiej# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033756/http://www.czec.pl/index.php?p839,leon-heyke-swietopelk-literatury-kaszubskiej# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malidoma Patrice Somé''' (born 1956) is a [[West Africa]]n writer and workshop leader, primarily in the field of spirituality. Born in a [[Dagaaba people|Dagara]] community in Dano, [[Burkina Faso]], he was raised by Jesuits from the age of four. He currently lives on the West Coast of the United States.

==Background==
At age four, Somé was abducted from his people, the Dagara by a missionary Jesuit priest, and taken to a [[Jesuit]] [[boarding school]] where he was inflicted with a Western education by the priests.&lt;ref name="Wisdom"&gt;{{cite book|last=Somé|first=Malidoma Patrice|authorlink=Malidoma Patrice Some|title = The Healing Wisdom of Africa|publisher=Tarcher/Putnam|year= 1999|location=New York|url =   |isbn = 0-87477-991-X|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Encylopediacom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somé, Malidoma Patrice @ Enclyclopedia.com|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2871200066.html|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somé endured sixteen years of physical and emotional abuse by the priests, but he left the school when he was twenty to return to the village of his birth.&lt;ref Name="Encylopediacom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="water"&gt;{{cite book|last = Somé|first = Malidoma Patrice|authorlink = Malidoma Patrice Some|title = Of Water and Spirit: Ritual, Magic and Initiation in the Life of an African Shaman|publisher = Tarcher/Putnam|year = 1994|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-87477-762-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his return, integration into his [[Traditional African religion|traditional tribal religion]] and customs was difficult, due to his long absence from his culture and his apparent indoctrination into Christianity and a "white man's world".&lt;ref name="RelAndNat"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Bron|last2=Chester|first2=David|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1582#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=A&amp;C Black|accessdate=31 May 2015|year=2008|pages=1581–1582|ISBN=978-1847062734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elders from the village believed that Somé's [[Kinship|ancestral spirit]] had withdrawn from his body and that he had already undergone a type of rite of passage into manhood in the white world.&lt;ref name="RelAndNat"/&gt; Despite this, they agreed to let him undergo a belated manhood rite with a younger group in the tribe.

'''Mazhabi Sikhs''' (also known as Mazbhabi, Mazbhi, Majhabhi or Majabhi) are members of an [[Untouchability|untouchable]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] who have rejected Hinduism in favour of the [[Sikhism|Sikh faith]]. The word ''Mazhabi'' is derived from the [[Urdu language|Urdu]] term ''mazhab'' ([[Madhab|Mazhab]] means religion or sect), and can be translated as ''the faithful''. They live mainly in [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]].

The definition of Mazhabi today is somewhat blurred because of the influence of [[Balmiki sect|Valmikism]]. Mazhabis are best known for military service in the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]], [[British Indian Army]] and [[Independence of India|post-independence]] [[Indian Army]].

==Origins==
When [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], the [[Sikh gurus|ninth Sikh guru]], was killed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in Delhi, three lower caste recovered his dismembered body from a [[Muslim]] crowd and brought it back to his son, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. In recognition of their act, he admitted the [[Untouchability|untouchable]] into the [[Khalsa]] (the Sikh faith), giving them the name ''Mazhabi'' ("faithful").&lt;ref name="yong"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yong |first=Tan Tai |year=2005 |title=The Garrison State: The Military, Government and Society in Colonial Punjab, 1849–1947 |publisher=SAGE |page=73 |isbn=978-8-13210-347-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d5ZiMV7rqWUC&amp;pg=PA1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
Within the present-day Mazhabi community, one group calls itself the Ranghreta and claims a higher status on the grounds that one of their ancestors was [[Bhai Jiwan Singh|Bhai Jaita Ranghreta]], who carried the head of Tegh Bahadur from Delhi to Guru Gobind Singh in [[Anandpur Sahib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLeod |first=W.

The definition of ''Mazhabi'' today is somewhat blurred because of the influence of Valmikism. While Sikhism is in theory an egalitarian faith that takes no notice of caste, gender and other social demarcations, Fenech and Singh note that "there is often a level of hypocrisy between what is taught and what is actually put into practice." Mazhabis are discriminated against by Sikhs whose origins lie with higher-ranked castes and many [[Chuhra]]s have turned to Valmikism but are still referred to as Mazhabi. While young [[Valmiki caste|Valmikis]], who accept Valmiki as their guru, increasingly object to being labelled as Sikh, their elders are less concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Fenech |editor1-first=Louis E. |editor2-last=Singh |editor2-first=Pashaura |year=2014 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=356 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CzYeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356 |isbn=978-0-19100-412-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The vagueness of the Mazhabi-Valmiki relationship was exemplified by tribunal rulings in 1953 and 1955, where an election candidate variously declared himself as a [[Harijan]] Hindu, a Mazhabi Sikh, a Valmiki, and a Valmiki Hindu. The first ruling determined him to be Valmiki Hindu and the subsequent one decided he was Mazhabi Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marc |last=Galanter |title=Competing Equalities: Law and the Backward Classes in India |publisher=University of California Press |year=1984 |page=307 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/87180543/competing-equalities-law-and-the-backward-classes |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} At least one of their organisations, the Valmiki-Mazhabi Sikh Morcha, conflates the terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=12 Vakmiki-Mazhabi Sikh Morcha Members Injured in Police Action |work=Hindustan Times |date=31 July 2014 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-3388153601/12-vakmiki-mazhabi-sikh-morcha-members-injured-in |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazhabis who converted from Sikhism to Christianity under the influence of Christian missionaries in the later years of the [[British Raj]] are sometimes referred to as Christian Mazhabi Sikhs.&lt;ref name="ht20141203"&gt;{{cite news |title=Despite Akali Stand, RSS Set to Bring Back 30 Mazhabi Christians Back to Sikh Fold |work=Hindustan Times |date=3 December 2014 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-3539251631/despite-akali-stand-rss-set-to-bring-back-30-mazhabi |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also profess Hinduism but call themselves Mazhabi, as do a small number who follow the tenets of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="2011 census" /&gt;

==Military service==

===Before the British Raj era===
The Mazhabis were recruited to the army of Sandhanwalia [[Jat]] ruler [[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]] but as separate companies attached to regular [[battalion]]s rather than as part of an integrated force. This situation was forced upon him because high-caste Sikhs refused any closer connection. They served as [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]], operating mainly as a labour corps that worked on construction of roads, bridges and canals. They were not, however, mere labourers because it was expected that their infantry skills would enable them to defend themselves in the event of attack.&lt;ref name="yong" /&gt;

===British Raj===
The Mazhabis, whom historian Stephen Cohen says "had strong caste traditions of violence and aggressiveness and were classed as a criminal caste by the British",{{efn|H. Brereton, the Superintendent of [[Thuggee]] Investigations, said in 1852 that most of the Thuggees in Punjab were Mazhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Ex-Criminal Tribes of Punjab |first=Birinder Pal |last=Singh |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=43 |issue=51 |date=20–26 December 2008 |pages=58–65 |jstor=40278313 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} lost their military employment following the defeat of the Sikhs in the [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]]. Some eventually found employment as pioneers in the army of [[Gulab Singh]], the [[Maharaja]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Cohen |chapter=The Untouchable Soldier |title=Recruiting, Drafting, and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Karsten |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-13566-150-2 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fh_fAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, the British turned to them for help during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]], apparently to counteract the rebellious [[sepoy]]s of the [[Bengal Army]].&lt;ref name="yong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen162"&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Cohen |chapter=The Untouchable Soldier |title=Recruiting, Drafting, and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Karsten |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-13566-150-2 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fh_fAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Pioneer Sikh Regiment soon found itself helping to break the [[Siege of Delhi]], a second regiment was raised in 1858 and a third followed soon after.&lt;ref name="cohen162" /&gt; This military employment contributed to a gradual improvement in their social status and in 1911 their official classification in [[Gujranwala]] and [[Lyallpur]] was uplifted to that of "agricultural caste" by the British authorities.&lt;ref name="yong" /&gt; The British military classification system, which rated recruits according to their caste, continued to assert that Mazhabis were best suited as pioneers while, for example, [[Jat Sikh]]s should be infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Phoenix from the Ashes: The Indian Army in the Burma Campaign |first=Daniel |last=Marston |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-27598-003-0 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E-CPkbHvcZEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were deployed at the [[Siege of Lucknow]] and [[Capture of Lucknow]] during the 1857 Indian Rebellion.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It was calculated in 1898 that there were 2,452 Mazhabis in the army, along with 28,146 Jat Sikhs and 9,000 other Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Imperial Connections: India in the Indian Ocean Arena, 1860–1920 |first=Thomas R. |last=Metcalf |authorlink=Thomas R.

During [[World War I]] the single-battalion regiments of the Mazhabi Sikh Pioneers&amp;nbsp;– the [[23rd Sikh Pioneers|23rd]], [[32nd Sikh Pioneers|32nd]] and [[34th Sikh Pioneers|34th]] Pioneer Regiments&amp;nbsp;– were expanded to comprise three battalions each. These units served in Egypt, Europe, [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and performed well. The 1/34th Sikh Pioneers were awarded the title of "Royal".&lt;ref name="sikhli.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sikhli.info/index.php/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415043655/http://sikhli.info/index.php/history |archivedate=2009-04-15 |title=The Story of the Renowned and the Redoubtable Sikh Light Infantry |publisher=The Sikh Light Infantry Regimental Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellinwood and Pradhan note that during the First World War, the Mazhabi Sikh soldiers were "estimated" to have reached a "remarkably high standard".
The Sikh Pioneer regiments, which were practically the only military employer of the Mazhabis, were disbanded in December 1932. The cause was mainly advances in road-building techniques and the need to economise. Most of their recruits were released from the army, the only means by which they had been able to advance themselves in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=M &amp; R: A Regimental History of the Sikh Light Infantry 1941–1947 |first=John Dugdall |last=Hookway |year=2012 |edition=2nd |origyear=1999 |pages=15–17 |url=https://archive.org/stream/MRARegimentalHistory/MR#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mazhabi Sikh [[platoon]] did replace [[Rajput]]s as the Indian Platoon of the [[Welch Regiment]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Cyril Ernest Napier |last1=Lomax |authorlink1=Cyril Lomax |first2=John |last2=De Courcy |year=1952 |title=The History of the Welch Regiment, 1919–1951 |publisher=Western Mail &amp; Echo |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|The [[Sikh Light Infantry]] march past during the Republic day parade in New Delhi, India]]

The Mazhabi Sikhs, together with the Ramdasia, were recruited to the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] regiment (SLI) after its formation in 1941.&lt;ref name="wilkinson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Army and Nation: The Military and Indian Democracy Since Independence |first=Steven I. |last=Wilkinson |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-67472-880-6 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B-qaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Sikh Light Infantry has always been a "single class" regiment in the parlance adopted from the British Raj era. This means that it recruits only from one demographic, which in this instance means the Mazhabi and Ramdasia Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Army and Nation: The Military and Indian Democracy Since Independence |first=Steven I. |last=Wilkinson |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-67472-880-6 |pages=39–41 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B-qaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the SLI was initially called the Mazhabi &amp; Ramdasia Sikh Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Cohen |chapter=The Untouchable Soldier |title=Recruiting, Drafting, and Enlisting: Two Sides of the Raising of Military Forces |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Karsten |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-13566-150-2 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fh_fAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA170}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Despite unwillingness among some policy makers, the British had to abandon their traditional distinction between martial and non-martial races during the Second World War. This was necessitated by the need for more recruits than could be supplied by those communities upon which they usually relied, such as the Jat Sikhs, [[Dogra]]s and [[Punjabi Muslims|Punjabi Musalman]]s. In addition, indiscipline among Jat Sikhs caused by their concerns regarding a post-war division of India was another reason to prefer recruitment of new classes. While recruitment from the pre-war martial classes was still pre-eminent, that from newly recognised classes such as the Mazhabis and Ramdasias became significant. Mazhabis were even recruited into units such as the [[13th Frontier Force Rifles]], which previously would not have contemplated them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Phoenix from the Ashes: The Indian Army in the Burma Campaign |first=Daniel |last=Marston |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-27598-003-0 |pages=218–220, 236 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E-CPkbHvcZEC&amp;pg=PA218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After independence of India===
When India became independent in 1947, the British Indian Army became the Indian Army. This, like its predecessor, relies on the martial race theory for much of its recruitment and thus there is a grossly disproportionate number of Sikhs within its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kaushik |last=Roy |chapter=Indian Society and the Soldier |pages=66–67 |title=Handbook of Indian Defence Policy: Themes, Structures and Doctrines |editor-first=Harsh V. |editor-last=Pant |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-31738-009-2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xG4CwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mazhabi Sikhs and Ramdasias continued their service with the SLI in the new army.&lt;ref name="wilkinson" /&gt; The SLI has served in almost all of the post-1947 conflicts involving India, including the wars with Pakistan in [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1971|1971]], the [[Hyderabad Police Action]] of 1948 and the [[Sino-Indian War|Chinese aggression in 1962]]. It has also served in [[Sri Lanka]], where the 1st, 7th, 13th and 14th Battalions have contributed towards peace-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Story of The Sikh Light Infantry  |publisher=The Sikh Review |url=http://www.sikhreview.org/november1995/chivalry.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020531202833/http://www.sikhreview.org/november1995/chivalry.htm |archivedate=2002-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mazhabi Sikh soldiers have a reputation for their loyalty and reliability. During [[Operation Blue Star]] in 1984, when the Indian Army entered the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], Jat Sikh soldiers broke out in mutiny against their officers in the [[Sikh Regiment]] and Punjab regiments A total of 2,000 Sikh personnel took part in the mutinies. In the most sensational case 1,400 mainly Jat Sikhs deserted after killing their commanding officer and armed themselves. A significant number of those were also new recruits who were incited easily into mutiny and some were forced at gun point to take part in the mutinies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Ron E. |editor-last=Hassner |year=2013 |chapter=India |first=Amit |last=Ahuja |title=Religion in the Military Worldwide |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=171 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ffE0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171 |isbn=978-1-10751-255-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2016}} Despite that, the Indian Army officers were correct when they expressed confidence to journalists that the Mazhabi Sikhs of the Sikh Light Infantry would not mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Army and Nation: The Military and Indian Democracy Since Independence |first=Steven I. |last=Wilkinson |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-67472-880-6 |page=221 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B-qaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, [[Khalistani groups|Sikh militants]] had stepped up their attacks on law enforcement as well as civilians, including minority groups. The Punjab had now reached a state of emergency and [[Director General of Police]], [[Kanwar Pal Singh Gill]], responded by raising Mazhabi Sikhs as "Special Police Officers". This tactic was designed both for community protection and to dull any incentive for Mazhabis to join with the militants, although in fact Mazhabis had often been victims of attacks by those people. Their loyalty was to the government and was never questioned.&lt;ref name="journals.hil.unb.ca"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/4293/4888 |title=Counter-Insurgency in India: Observations from Punjab and Kashmir |journal=Journal of Conflict Studies |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly unemployed people, they were provided with guns by the state and were literally given a licence to kill. Gill received heavy criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/police-chief-k.p.s.-gill-turns-the-tide-in-punjab-with-controversial-and-ruthless-methods/1/302060.html |title=Police chief K.P.S. Gill turns the tide in Punjab with controversial and ruthless methods |work=India Today |date=1993-04-15 |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the brutality and ruthlessness of his tactics but the Sikh militants were neutralised. A large number of these special police officers were said to have been used during the February 1992 elections. An open season was declared on Sikh terrorists and the police were able to use whatever means deemed necessary to achieve victory. Major Sikh militant leaders were targeted, and many did not survive.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a83b1c.html |title=Punjab Human Rights Update |publisher=UNHCR |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social status==

===Discrimination within the Sikh community===
Most of them live in separate clusters in villages. As the 19th century drew to a close, untouchables such as the Mazhabis were still denied equal access to the [[gurdwara]] (places of worship) by their fellow Sikhs and during the early years of the 20th century members of the [[Arya Samaj]] tried to capitalise on this in their attempts to reconvert those groups to Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lions of the Punjab: Culture in the Making |first=Richard Gabriel |last=Fox |publisher=University of California Press |year=1985 |pages=111, 173 |isbn=978-0-52005-491-2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9hTMjozGUlsC&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Sikhism's egalitarian tenets, the [[Singh Sabha movement]] also viewed them as being inferior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="Nation-state" and Minority Rights in India: Comparative Perspectives on Muslim and Sikh Identities |first=Tanweer |last=Fazal |edition=Revised |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-31775-179-3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1WwtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite initially being established in 1873 in part with the aim of eradicating untouchability.&lt;ref name="ram"/&gt;

The British Raj system of land allocation in the Punjab also worked against the Mazhabis. As land in the new canal colonies was made available for cultivation, the Raj allocated it to people on the basis of the scale of existing landholdings, which meant that dominant landholding communities such as the Jats received most of the {{convert|4000000|acre|ha}} that became available between 1885–1940 while outcastes were excluded entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="Nation-state" and Minority Rights in India: Comparative Perspectives on Muslim and Sikh Identities |first=Tanweer |last=Fazal |edition=Revised |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-31775-179-3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1WwtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Until 1952, Dalits were prohibited by law from buying land in Punjab.&lt;ref name="ram" /&gt;}}

During the numerous discussions, conferences and proposals that preceded Indian independence, the Mazhabis sought to obtain an autonomous region within [[Partition of India|partitioned Punjab]] which they proposed to be called "Mazbhistan". This was one of many instances reflecting the lack of coherence among adherents of Sikhism at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Self and Sovereignty: Individual and Community in South Asian Islam Since 1850 |first=Ayesha |last=Jalal |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-13459-938-7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=az6CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436 |page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jat Sikhs continue to look down upon the Mazhabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_7-9-2004_pg3_2 |title=400 years of Guru Granth Sahib |first=Ishtiaq |last=Ahmed |date=7 September 2004 |work=Daily Times |quote=Unfortunately Sikhism did not succeed in eliminating caste prejudices. Most Jat Sikhs look down upon the inferior castes and the former untouchable ranks, known as Mazhabi Sikhs. Still the egalitarian message of Sikhism is undeniable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are also considered to be of lower status by the other Dalit communities, being the Ramdasia and [[Ravidasia]].&lt;ref name="ram"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Untouchability in India with a Difference: Ad Dharm, Dalit Assertion, and Caste Conflicts in Punjab |first=Ronki |last=Ram |journal=Asian Survey |volume=44 |issue=6 |date=November–December 2004 |pages=895–912 |doi=10.1525/as.2004.44.6.895 |jstor=10.1525/as.2004.44.6.895 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Both the Ramdasia and the Ravidassia are converts from the [[Chamar]] caste.&lt;ref name="ram" /&gt;}}  The internal division between Jat Sikh and Mazhabi still broadly follows the economic distinction between farmer and landless labourer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian A. |last=Talbot |chapter=Politics and Religion in Contemporary India |title=Politics and Religion in the Modern World |editor-first=George |editor-last=Moyser |publisher=Routledge |year=1991 |page=139 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/103911813/politics-and-religion-in-the-modern-world |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is land-ownership rather than varna's stress on occupational status that defines discrimination within the Sikh communities of the Punjab, and Ronki Ram notes that the nature of untouchability itself in Punjab differs from the rest of India because it is "related more to prejudice than pollution". Many Mazhabi are still exploited in low-status jobs, they are often forced to live in less desirable areas of villages, cannot use the gurdwaras frequented by higher-caste Sikhs and must use special cremation grounds.&lt;ref name="ram"/&gt;{{efn|As of 2003, around 10,000 of the 12,780 villages in Indian Punjab had separate gurdwaras for Dalit Sikhs.&lt;ref name="ram"/&gt;}}

===Politics===
The outcome of the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] (SGPC) elections in December 1954 favoured [[Punjabi Suba]], a Jat Sikh-dominated movement. Akali Dal, a religio-political party founded in 1920 and dominated by Jat Sikhs,&lt;ref name="ram"/&gt; won all 111 seats that it contested and Khalsa Dal&amp;nbsp;– a new party created with government support&amp;nbsp;– managing to win only three of the 132 in which it put forward a candidate. The campaign saw the Arya Samaj and [[Jan Sangh]], who were both opposed to Punjabi Suba and believed in Hindu supremacy, stressing a fear of Sikh domination. They encouraged Hindu Punjabis to lie by claiming [[Hindi]] to be their first language even when it was almost always in fact [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. This attempt to cause a division along religious lines had the tacit support of the government and its impact echoed down the years.&lt;ref name="martha_crenshaw_context"/&gt; In 2005, 56 expelled employees of the SGPC abandoned Sikhism and alleged that they were being discriminated against because they were Mazhabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=56 Sacked S.G.P.C. Employees Give Up Sikh Religion |first=Vishal |last=Rambani |work=The Hindustan Times |date=17 April 2005 |url=http://www.sikhtimes.com/news_041705a.html |accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report published in ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' on 16 March 1966, a spokesperson for the Federation of Mazhabi Sikhs stated that "the Sikh Scheduled Castes had been reduced to a position of mere serfs by the Sikh landlords who would literally crush the Mazhabi Sikhs if Punjabi Suba was formed." The federation offered support for Arya Samaj and Jan Sangh in opposition to the Punjabi Suba.&lt;ref name="martha_crenshaw_context"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Terrorism in India: Identity, Culture, and Territorial Claims |title=Terrorism in context |editor-first=Martha |editor-last=Crenshaw |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-271-01015-1 |page=377 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nFyZaZGthgC&amp;pg=PA377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sikh leaders recognise the contribution of the Mazhabis and Ravidasias to the community and have tried to include them in their organisations, not least because of the size of their population, both groups still feel alienated because of discrimination by higher-caste Sikhs, especially the Jats. It is because of this that they have turned to political parties such as the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] rather than maintaining past associations with Sikh politics through the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] (SAD)  and SGPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joginder |last=Singh |chapter=Sikhs in Independent India |editor1-last=Fenech |editor1-first=Louis E. |editor2-last=Singh |editor2-first=Pashaura |year=2014 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=84–85 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CzYeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84 |isbn=978-0-19100-412-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-day conversions===
In 2014, both the SAD and the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) voiced their opposition to Christian Mazhabi people being reconverted to the Sikh faith in a ceremony organised by the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS). [[Parkash Singh Badal]], then [[List of Chief Ministers of Punjab (India)|Chief Minister of Punjab]] and an SAD elder, said that such conversions are "unfortunate and against the basic tenets of Sikhism as Sikh gurus sacrificed their lives resisting conversion", while [[Amarinder Singh]] of the INC considered the move by the [[Hindutva]]-centric RSS to be "forced conversion". The RSS said that it was not sponsoring conversion to Hinduism but rather to Sikhism and that the SGPC had been lax in stemming the tide of poor Sikh families switching to Christianity.&lt;ref name="ht20141203" /&gt; It was claimed by an RSS colleague, Ram Gopal, that 2,470 people had already been converted in the year prior to the controversy being commented upon and that the SGPC had initially supported the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SGPC Supported Ghar Wapsi Programme Initially: Ram Gopal |work=Hindustan Times |date=2 January 2015 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-3541935211/sgpc-supported-ghar-wapsi-programme-initially-ram |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also protests by Christians, who claimed that the conversions were an attempt by the RSS to drive a wedge between their religion and Sikhism where previously there had been a harmonious relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Christians Protest, Lambast Ghar Wapsi Agenda of RSS |work=Hindustan Times |date=4 January 2015 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-3543744271/christians-protest-lambast-ghar-wapsi-agenda-of-rss |via=[[Questia]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reservation===
The [[Government of India]] recognises Mazhabi Sikh as a [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|Scheduled Caste]] as part of their official [[affirmative action]] program.&lt;ref name="2011 census" /&gt;

==Demographics==
Between 30,000-40,000 Mazhabi Sikhs were reported to be congregated at [[Govindghar]] in an attempt to reach India during the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. This was one of many examples of the mass migrations that took place across the border in both directions as communities found themselves in the midst of violence driven by religious differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Last Journey: Exploring Social Class in the 1947 Partition Migration |first=Ravinder |last=Kaur |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=41 |issue=22 |date=3–9 June 2006 |pages=2221–2228 |jstor=4418295 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2011}}, there were 2,633,921 Mazhabis in the Indian state of Punjab, of whom 2,562,761 declared themselves to be Sikh, 71,000 as Hindu and 160 as Buddhists.

The '''Museum of World Religions''' ('''MWR'''; {{zh|c=世界宗教博物館|p=Shìjiè Zōngjiào Bówùguǎn}}) is a [[museum]] in [[Yonghe District]], [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Reis Habito, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/buddhist-christian_studies/v022/22.1habito_m.html The Taipai, Taiwan, Museum of World Religions], ''[[Buddhist-Christian Studies]]'', [http://uhpjournals.wordpress.com/2002/11/30/buddhist-christian-studies-vol-22-2002/ Volume 22], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was founded by Venerable [[Hsin Tao]] (心道), a Buddhist monk,  and set up through the Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation. The museum building was designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raany.com/html/proj_03/portProj_WorldReligion.html Museum of World Religions: Project Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704082335/http://www.raany.com/html/proj_03/portProj_WorldReligion.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]] Incorporated.&lt;/ref&gt; the designer of major American museums including the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington DC]] and the expansion of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="HDS"&gt;[http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/article_archive/museum.html Two HDS Staff On Hand for Opening of Museum of World Religions in Taipei] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705091958/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/article_archive/museum.html |date=2008-07-05 }}, [[Harvard Divinity School]], [[Harvard University]], United States, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum of World Religions was opened in 2001 by Hsin Tao. Further elaborate opening ceremonies were held on September 11 and in November 2002 with many religious leaders and others from around the world, including the President [[Chen Shui-bian]].&lt;ref name="HDS" /&gt; The Taiwanese architect and educator [[Han Pao-teh]] was the first curator.

The museum presents exhibits on ten different major [[Major religious groups|world religions]]. It also features a model called "Avatamsaka World" illustrating the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].

==Transportation==
The museum is accessible within walking distance North West from [[Yongan Market Station]] of the [[Taipei Metro]].

'''''Nostra aetate''''' ({{lang-la|In our Time}}) is the '''Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions''' of the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Passed by a vote of 2,221 to 88 of the assembled [[bishop]]s, this declaration was promulgated on 28 October 1965, by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Pope Paul VI]]|date=28 October 1965|title=Declaration on the relation of the church to non-christian religions&amp;nbsp;— ''Nostra aetate''|location=Holy See|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html|accessdate=25 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John XXIII]] had originally conceived it as an expression of the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jews. Over the course of several substantial revisions, the focus of the document was broadened to address relationships with several faiths. Opposition from conservative elements in the Church was overcome and support gained from Jewish organisations.&lt;ref&gt;P.

==Evolution of the text==
[[File:CardinalBea.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], credited with drafting ''Nostra aetate'' and guiding it in numerous meetings through various obstacles during the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Bea was the first President of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]].]]


===''Decretum de Iudaeis''===
&lt;!-- text merged from Decretum de Iudaeis --&gt;
The first draft, entitled ''Decretum de Iudaeis'' ("Decree on the Jews"), was completed in November 1961, approximately fourteen months after Pope John XXIII tasked Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], a Jesuit and biblical scholar, with its composition. This text was not submitted to the Council, which opened on 11 October 1962. It read:
{{Quote|The Church, the Bride of Christ, acknowledges with a heart full of gratitude that, according to God's mysterious saving design, the beginnings of her faith and election go as far back as to the Israel of the Patriarchs and Prophets. Thus she acknowledges that all Christian believers, children of Abraham by faith (see Gal 3:7), are included in his call. Similarly, her salvation is prefigured in the deliverance of the Chosen People out of Egypt, as in a sacramental sign (Liturgy of the Easter Vigil). And the Church, a new creation in Christ (see Eph 2:15), can never forget that she is the spiritual continuation of the people with whom, in His mercy and gracious condescension, God made the [[Old Covenant]].

The Church, in fact, believes that Christ, who "is our peace," embraces Jews and Gentiles with one and the same love and that He made the two one (see Eph 2:14). She rejoices that the union of these two "in one body" (Eph 2:16) proclaims the whole world's reconciliation in Christ. Even though the greater part of the Jewish people has remained separated from Christ, it would be an injustice to call this people accursed, since they are greatly beloved for the sake of the Fathers and the promises made to them (see Rom 11:28). The Church loves this people. From them sprang Christ the Lord, who reigns in glory in heaven; from them sprang the Virgin Mary, mother of all Christians; from them came the Apostles, the pillars and bulwark of the Church (1 Tim 3:15).

Furthermore, the Church believes in the union of the Jewish people with herself as an integral part of Christian hope. With unshaken faith and deep longing the Church awaits union with this people. At the time of Christ's coming, "a remnant chosen by grace" (Rom 11:5), the very first fruits of the Church, accepted the Eternal Word. The Church believes, however, with the Apostle that at the appointed time, the fullness of the children of Abraham according to the flesh will embrace him who is salvation (see Rom 11:12, 26). Their acceptance will be life from the dead (see Rom 11:15).

As the Church, like a mother, condemns most severely injustices committed against innocent people everywhere, so she raises her voice in loud protest against all wrongs done to Jews, whether in the past or in our time. Whoever despises or persecutes this people does injury to the Catholic Church.}}

===Second draft===
The first draft was then reworked as a supplementary fourth chapter of a "Decree on Ecumenism". Debate on this document, "On the Attitude of Catholics Toward Non-Christians and Especially Toward Jews", although distributed to the Council's Second Session on 8 November 1963, was postponed until the Third Session. This draft was notable for addressing the [[Jewish deicide|"deicide" charge against the Jews]] directly, saying "it is wrong to call them an accursed people, ... or a deicidal people". The text read:

{{Quote|Now that we have dealt with the principles of Catholic ecumenism, we do not wish to pass over in silence the fact that the same principles should be applied, taking differences in condition duly into account, in the matter of speaking and cooperation with people who are not Christians, who, nevertheless, worship God, or at least in a spirit of good will conscientiously endeavor to observe the moral law innate in human nature.

This applies especially in the case of the Jews, who as a people are connected with the Church of Christ in a special relationship.

The Church of Christ acknowledges with a grateful heart that the beginnings of the faith and of its election, along with the saving mystery of God, can already be found among the Patriarchs and Prophets. For all the believers in Christ, the sons of Abraham according to the faith (cf. Gal. 3:7), are included in the vocation of that same Patriarch and that the salvation of the Church is mystically prefigured in the exodus of the Chosen People from the land of bondage. The Church, a new creature in Christ (cf. Eph. 2:15), cannot forget that it is a continuation of that people with whom of old God, out of his ineffable mercy, was pleased to make his Old Covenant.

In addition the Church believes that Christ, our Peace, embraced both Jews and Gentiles in a single love and made them one (cf. Eph. 2:14) and by the union of both is one body (cf. Eph. 2:17) announced the reconciliation of the entire world in Christ. Although a large part of the Chosen People is still far from Christ, yet it is wrong to call them an accursed people, since they remain very dear to God because of the Fathers and the gifts given them (cf. Rom.11:28), or [to call them] a deicidal people, since the Lord, by his passion and death, washes away the sins of all men, which were the cause of the passion and death of Jesus Christ (cf. Luke 23:34; Acts 3:17; 1 Cor. 2:8) The death of Christ is not to be attributed to an entire people then alive, and even less to a people today. Therefore, let priests be careful not to say anything, in catechetical instruction or in preaching, that might give rise to hatred or contempt of the Jews in the hearts of their hearers. Nor does the Church forget that Christ Jesus was born of that people according to the flesh, that the Virgin Mary, the Mother of Christ, was thus born, that thus were born the Apostles, the foundation and pillars of the Church.

Therefore, since the Church has so much of a common patrimony with the Synagogue, this Holy Synod intends in every way to promote and further mutual knowledge and esteem obtained by theological studies and fraternal discussions; and, moreover, as it severely reproves injuries to people anywhere, even more so does it, with maternal heart, deplore and condemn hatred and persecution of Jews, whether committed of old or in our own times.}}

=== The third draft ===

The third draft, "On the Jews and Non-Christians", took the form of an appendix to the "Schema on Ecumenism". It deleted the word "deicidal" and added material on other religions, especially [[Muslim]]s. In presenting the document to the Council on 28 September 1964, Cardinal Bea encouraged the Council Fathers to strengthen it. They discussed this draft on 28 and 29 September.

{{Quote|(On the inheritance common to Christians and Jews.)&lt;br&gt;
The Church of Christ gladly acknowledges that the beginnings of its faith and election, in accordance with God's mystery of salvation, are to be found already among the Patriarchs and Prophets. Indeed, all Christians believe that, as sons of Abraham by faith (cf. Gal 3 7) they are included in this Patriarch's vocation and that the salvation of the Church is mystically prefigured in the exodus of the chosen people from the land of bondage. Nor can the Church as a new creation in Christ (cf. Eph. 2, 15) and as the people of the [[New Covenant]] ever forget that it is a continuation of that people with whom God in his ineffable mercy once designed to enter into the Old Covenant and to whom he chose to entrust the revelation contained in the Books of the Old Testament.

Moreover, the Church does not forget that from this Jewish people were born Christ, the Virgin Mary, as well as the apostles, the foundation and the pillars of the Church.

Further, the Church was always mindful and will never overlook Apostle Paul's words relating to the Jews, to whom belong "the adoption as sons and the glory, and the covenants and the giving of the law, and the worship, and the promises" (Rom. 9, 4).

Since such is the inheritance accepted by Christians from the Jews, this Holy Council is resolved expressly to further and to recommend mutual understanding and appreciation, to be obtained by theological study and fraternal discussion and, beyond that, just as it severely disapproves of any wrong inflicted upon human beings everywhere, it also deplores and condemns hatred and maltreatment of Jews.

It is also worth remembering that the union of the Jewish people with the Church is a part of the Christian hope. Accordingly, and following the teaching of Apostle Paul (cf. Rom. 11, 25), the Church expects in unshakable faith and with ardent desire the entrance of that people into the fullness of the people of God established by Christ.

Everyone should be careful, therefore, not to present the Jewish people as a rejected nation, whether it in catechetical instruction, in preaching of God's Word or in daily conversation. Neither should anything be said or done that could alienate human minds from the Jews. Equally, all should be on their guard not to impute to the Jews of our time that which was perpetrated in the Passion of Christ.

(All people have God as Father.)&lt;br&gt;
The Lord Jesus has clearly confirmed that God is the Father of all humanity, as this was already stated in the Writings of the Old Testament and is suggested by reason itself. But we surely cannot appeal or pray to God as the Father of all, if we deny brotherly behavior to some people who are all created in the image of God. The attitude of humanity toward God as Father and the attitude of individuals to their brothers and sisters are so closely connected that any negation of human brotherhood carries with it or leads to the negation of God himself for whom there can be no favoritism (cf. 2 Par. 18, 7; Rom. 2, 11; Eph. 6, 9; Col. 3, 25; 1 Pet. 1, 17). The First Commandment is in fact so interwoven with the second that we cannot be forgiven our offenses unless we ourselves wholeheartedly forgive those who have offended us. Indeed, it was said already in the Old Law: "Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why do each of us deal treacherously with his brother?" (Mal. 2, 10); the same is even more clearly reaffirmed in the New Law: "He that does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? And this is the commandment we have from God, that he who loves God loves his brother also." (1 Jn. 4, 20-21.)

Impelled by such love for our brothers, let us consider with great diligence views and doctrines which, though in many points are different from ours, in so many others, however, carry the ray of that truth which gives light to every person born into this world. Thus we embrace also, and first of all, the Moslems who worship one personal and recompensing God and who in religious feeling as well as through many channels of human culture come near to us.

(Any kind of discrimination is to be condemned.)&lt;br&gt;
In consequence, any theory or practice which leads to discrimination among individuals or between nation and nation, insofar as human dignity and the rights flowing therefrom are concerned, is devoid of foundation.

It is imperative, therefore, that all people of good will and Christians in particular abstain from any discrimination or abuse of human beings on grounds of their race, color, social status or religion. On the contrary, this Holy Council solemnly entreats believing Christians "to maintain friendly relations among the gentiles" (1 Pet. 2, 12) and if possible and insofar as it depends on them, to maintain peace with all people (cf. Rom. 12, 18); it enjoins them, moreover, to love not only the neighbor, but even the enemies, should they think they have any, so that they should be in truth the sons of the Father who is in heaven and who makes his sun rise over all (cf. Mt. 5, 44-45).}}

====Discussion of the third draft ====
The publicly recorded debate on the third draft took place on 28 September 1964 and on the following days. Since the Vatican Council archives are still "substantially inaccessible", it is difficult to measure the impact of the public and the behind-the-scenes initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Vatican II'', p.&amp;nbsp;141-42&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included Cardinals [[Joseph Ritter]] of St. Louis, [[Richard Cushing]] of Boston, [[Albert Gregory Meyer|Albert Meyer]] of Chicago, and [[Lawrence Shehan]] of Baltimore, Lercaro of Bologne, Liénart of Lille, König of Vienna, and Léger of Montreal, and [[Franjo Šeper]] of Zagreb, as well as a number of lesser prelates.&lt;ref&gt;See Oestereicher, pp.&amp;nbsp;195ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardinal Cushing=====
The language suggested by Cardinal Cushing of Boston was echoed in the final version the Council approved:

{{quote|1. We must cast the Declaration on the Jews in a much more positive form, one not so timid, but much more loving. ... For the sake of our common heritage we, the children of Abraham according to the spirit, must foster a special reverence and love for the children of Abraham according to the flesh. As children of Adam, they are our kin, as children of Abraham they are Christ's blood relatives. 2. So far as the guilt of Jews in the death of our Saviour is concerned, the rejection of the Messiah by His own, is according to Scripture, a mystery—a mystery given us for our instruction, not for our self-exaltation. ... We cannot sit in judgement on the onetime leaders of Israel—God alone is their judge. Much less can we burden later generations of Jews with any burden of guilt for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, for the death of the Saviour of the world, except that universal guilt in which we all have a part. ... In clear and unmistakable language, we must deny, therefore, that the Jews are guilty of our Saviour's death. We must condemn especially those who seek to justify, as Christian deeds, discrimination, hatred and even persecution of Jews. ... 3. I ask myself, Venerable Brothers, whether we should not humbly acknowledge before the whole world that, toward their Jewish brethren, Christians have all too often not shown themselves as true Christians, as faithful followers of Christ. How many [Jews] have suffered in our own time? How many died because Christians were indifferent and kept silent? ... If in recent years, not many Christian voices were raised against those injustices, at least let ours now be heard in humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|pp=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Archbishop Heenan=====
[[John Carmel Heenan]] of Westminster said:

{{quote|In this century, the Jews have endured grievous, indeed, inhuman sufferings. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who on the cross forgave [His Actual] persecutors, I humbly ask that our Declaration publicly acknowledge that the Jewish people, as such, is not guilty of the Lord's death. It would doubtless be unjust were one to blame all the Christians of Europe for the murder of six million Jews in Germany and Poland in our own day. In the same way, I maintain that it is unjust to condemn the whole Jewish people for the death of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Bishop Leven=====
Auxiliary Bishop of San Antonio [[Stephen Leven]] objected to text's failure to address the charge of deicide, which some thought "unworthy of a Conciliar document". He said: "we have to deal here with not with a philosophical entity, but with an infamous abuse that was invented by Christians for the sole purpose of bringing shame and disgrace upon Jews. For hundreds of years, and even in our own century, Christians have flung the word 'deicide' into the faces of Jews in order to justify all kinds of excesses, even murder. ... We must remove this word from the vocabulary of Christians, so that it can never again be turned against the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardinal Meyer=====
Cardinal Meyer said: "Following the teaching of Scripture, St. Thomas makes two points: [1] No single individual Jew of Christ's time was subjectively guilty of deicide, since all acted in ignorance of Christ's divinity. This must be said explicitly in our text. [2] The bulk of Jews should be acquitted of any formal guilt because they followed their leaders out of ignorance. As proof of this St. Thomas refers to St. Peter: 'I know that you acted in ignorance' (Ac 3:17). Finally it must be also said where the real guilt of the torment of Christ lies: 'He died for us and for our salvation'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicene Creed]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Archbishop O'Boyle=====
Archbishop [[Patrick O'Boyle]] of Washington said: "The word 'conversion' awakens in the hearts of Jews memories of persecutions, sufferings, and the forced denials of all truths that a Jew loves with sincerity and good faith. So a Jew, when he hears that Catholics are seeking to further his 'conversion', thinks of the reintroduction of that type of proselytism that for centuries assaulted his rights and personal dignity. ... It would be better if we were to express our hope for the turning of the Jews [to Christ] in such a way that they, too, can perceive with respect its honesty and our humble recognition that the mystery of salvation does not depend on us, but upon God's transcendent act." He offered the following text: "Furthermore, it is worthy of remembrance that the union of the Jewish and Christian people is part of Christian Hope. With Unshaken faith and deep longing the Church awaits that union which God will bring about in His own time and in a way still hidden in His wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|pp=199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardinal Ritter=====
Cardinal Joseph Ritter of St. Louis suggested the following text:
{{quote|For this reason, all must take care that they in no way present the Jewish people as rejected or deicidal, or throw blame for all the crimes committed during the Passion of Christ upon the whole people then living and, ''a fortiori'', upon the Jews of our own time. All these [evil deeds] are really the responsibility of all sinful people and especially of Christians who have fallen into sin. The [[Catechism of the Council of Trent]] recalls this truth in all bluntness: the guilt of the Crucifixion rests above all upon those who repeatedly relapse into sin. For as our sins brought Christ  the Lord to death upon the Cross, so those who wallow in sin and vice in fact crucify the Son of God anew insofar as depends on them and hold Him up to contempt (see Heb. 6:6).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The fourth draft ===
The critical paragraphs read: 

{{Quote|3. About the Muslims&lt;br&gt;
The Church regards Muslims with esteem: they adore the one God, living and enduring, the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth who has spoken to people; they strive to obey wholeheartedly His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham did, to whose faith they happily link their own.

Though Muslims do not acknowledge the divinity of Jesus, they revere Him as a Prophet. They also honor Mary, His Virgin-Mother; at times they call on her with devotion. Furthermore, they await the day of judgment when God will reward all those who have risen.

Furthermore, as they worship God through prayer, almsgiving, and fasting, so they seek to make the moral life—be it that of the individual or that of the family and society—conform to His Will.

In the course of centuries, however, not a few quarrels and hostilities have arisen between Christians and Muslims. Hence this Sacred Synod urges all not only to forget the past but also to work honestly for mutual understanding and to further as well as guard together social justice, all moral goods, especially peace and freedom, so that all of humanity may benefit from their endeavor.

4. About the Jews&lt;br&gt;
As this Sacred Synod searches into the mystery of the Church, it remembers the bond that ties the people of the New Covenant to Abraham's stock.

With a grateful heart, the Church of Christ acknowledges that, according to God's saving design, the beginnings of her faith and her election were already among the patriarchs, Moses, and the prophets. She professes that all who believe in Christ—Abraham's sons according to faith—were included in the same patriarch's call, likewise that her salvation is mystically foreshadowed by the chosen people's exodus from the land of bondage.

The Church, therefore, cannot forget that she received the revelation of the Old Testament from the people with whom God in His ineffable mercy concluded the Ancient Covenant. Nor can she forget that she feeds upon the root of that cultivated olive tree into which the wild shoots of the Gentiles have been grafted (cf. Rom. 11, 17–24). Indeed, the Church believes that by His cross Christ our Peace reconciled the Jews and Gentiles, making both one (cf. Eph. 2, 14, 16).

The Church keeps ever in mind the words of the Apostle about his kinsmen: "Theirs is the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. Theirs are the patriarchs, and of them is the Christ according to the flesh," the Son of Mary the Virgin (Rom. 9, 4–5). No less does she recall that the Apostles, the Church's foundation stones and pillars, as well as most of the early disciples who proclaimed Christ's Gospel to the world, sprang from the Jewish people.

Even though a large part of the Jews did not accept the Gospel, they remain most dear to God, according to the Apostle, for the sake of the patriarchs, since Gods gifts and call are irrevocable (cf. Rom. 11, 28 f.). In company with the prophets and the same Apostle, the Church awaits that day, known to God alone, on which all peoples will address the Lord in a single voice and "serve Him shoulder to shoulder" (Soph. 3, 9; cf. Is. 66, 3, 9; cf. Is. 66, 23; Ps. 65, 4; Rom. 11, 11–32).

Since the spiritual patrimony common to Christians and Jews is of such magnitude, this Sacred Synod wants to foster and recommend that mutual knowledge and respect that are, above all, the fruit of biblical and theological studies as well as of fraternal dialogues. Moreover, this Synod, in her rejection of injustices of whatever kind and wherever inflicted upon people, and recalling our common patrimony, deplores and condemns hatred and persecutions of Jews, whether they arose in former or in our own days.

May all, then, see to it that in their catechetical work or in their preaching of the word of God they do not teach anything that could give rise to hatred or contempt of Jews in the hearts of Christians. May they never present the Jewish people as one rejected, cursed, or guilty of deicide. All that happened to Christ in His passion cannot be attributed to the whole people then alive, much less to that of today. Besides, the Church has always held and holds now that Christ underwent His passion and death freely, because of the sins of all people and out of infinite love. Therefore, Christian preaching is to proclaim the Cross of Christ as a sign of God's all-embracing love and as the fountain from which every grace flows.}}

== ''Nostra aetate'' ==
# Introduction
# Hindus, Buddhists, and other religions
# Muslims
# Jews
# Conclusion
# Interfaith Dialogue 

The Declaration begins by describing the unity of the origin of all people, and the fact that they all return to God; hence their final goal is also one. It describes the eternal questions which have dogged men since the beginning, and how the various religious traditions have tried to answer them.

It mentions some of the answers that some [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]], and members of other faiths have suggested for such philosophical questions. It notes the willingness of the Catholic Church to accept some truths present in other religions in so much as they reflect Catholic teaching and may lead souls to Christ.

Part three goes on to say that the [[Catholic Church]] regards the Muslims with esteem, and then continues by describing some of the things [[Islam]] has in common with [[Christianity]] and Catholicism: worship of One God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, Merciful and Omnipotent, Who has spoken to men; the [[Muslims]]' respect for [[Abraham]] and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], and the great respect they have for [[Jesus]], whom they consider to be a Prophet and not God. The synod urged all [[Catholics]] and [[Muslims]] to forget the hostilities and differences of the past and to work together for mutual understanding and benefit.

Part four speaks of the bond that ties the people of the 'New Covenant' ([[Christian]]s) to Abraham's stock ([[Jew]]s). It states that even though some Jewish authorities and those who followed them called for [[Jesus]]' death, the blame for this cannot be laid at the door of all those Jews present at that time, nor can the Jews in our time be held as guilty, thus repudiating an indiscriminate charge of [[Jewish deicide]]; 'the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God'. The Declaration also decries all displays of [[antisemitism]] made at any time by anyone.

{{quote|The Church keeps ever in mind the words of the Apostle about his kinsmen: "theirs is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the law and the worship and the promises; theirs are the fathers and from them is the Christ according to the flesh" (Rom. 9:4–5), the Son of the Virgin Mary. She also recalls that the Apostles, the Church's main-stay and pillars, as well as most of the early disciples who proclaimed Christ's Gospel to the world, sprang from the Jewish people.

True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. The Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures. All should see to it, then, that in catechetical work or in the preaching of the word of God they do not teach anything that does not conform to the truth of the Gospel and the spirit of Christ. Furthermore, in her rejection of every persecution against any man, the Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved not by political reasons but by the Gospel's spiritual love, decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone.}}

The fifth part states that all men are created in God's image, and that it is contrary to the mind of Christ to discriminate against, show hatred towards or harass any person or people on the basis of colour, race, religion, and condition of life.

== Post-Conciliar developments ==
''Nostra aetate'' was one of Vatican II's three declarations, the other documents consisting of nine decrees and four constitutions. It was the shortest of the documents and contained few, if any, references to the debates and the rationale that had gone into its making; therefore,  the changes to be brought about by the declaration on the Church's Relations with non-Christian Religions, ''Nostra aetate'', carried implications not fully appreciated at the time.

To flesh out these implications and ramifications, the Vatican's Commission on Interrelegious Relations with the Jews issued its ''Guidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate'' in late 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/relations-jews-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19741201_nostra-aetate_en.html GUIDELINES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE CONCILIAR DECLARATION "NOSTRA AETATE". Retrieved August 16, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by that same body's ''Notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in the Teaching and Catechesis of the Roman Catholic Church'' in 1985. These developments were paralleled by accompanying statements from the U.S. bishops.

The above-referenced statements by the Vatican's [[Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews|Commission for Interreligious Relations with the Jews]], as well as other developments, including the establishment of more than two dozen centers for Christian-Jewish understanding at Catholic institutions of higher learning in the United States along with the participation by rabbis in seminarian formation training, demonstrate how the church has embraced ''Nostra aetate''.

The significance of ''Nostra aetate'' as a new starting point  in the Church's relations with Judaism, in light of the foregoing, can be appreciated from the vantage point of the passage of forty years. The U.S. Congress passed a resolution acknowledging ''Nostra aetate'' at forty,&lt;ref&gt;US House Concurrent Resolution 260 {{USBill|109|HConRes|260|pipe=Recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, ''Nostra aetate'', and the continuing need for mutual interreligious respect and dialogue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington D.C. also noted this anniversary. This is in addition to the marking of the occasion at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Gregorian University]] itself and at major centers of Christian–Jewish understanding around the United States.

The Vatican's Commission for Religious Relations with Jews released a new document exploring the unresolved theological questions at the heart of Christian–Jewish dialogue. Entitled ''The Gifts and Calling of God are Irrevocable'', it marked the 50th anniversary of the ground-breaking declaration ''Nostra Aetate''.&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews|Vatican Commission for Religious Relations with Jews]] |date=10 December 2015 |title=''The Gifts and Calling of God are irrevocable''|location=Holy See|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-issues-new-document-on-christian-jewish-di|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Sotah''''' ({{lang-he|שוטה}} &lt;ref&gt;Spelled "שוטה" in [[Maimonides]]' manuscript (http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss/html/heb5703_h.htm). This spelling recurs in Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih|Yosef Qafeh]]'s editions of Maimonides' works.&lt;/ref&gt; / סוטה) is a woman suspected of [[adultery]] who undergoes the '''ordeal of bitter water''' or '''ordeal of jealousy''' as described and prescribed in the [[Priestly Code]], in the [[Book of Numbers]], the fourth book of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The term "Sotah" itself is not found in the Hebrew Bible but is [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] based on the verse "if she has strayed" (verb: שטה ''satah'') in Numbers 5:12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXTlobTJZ1UC&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1 |title=Writing the Wayward Wife: Rabbinic Interpretations of Sotah |last=Grushcow |first=Lisa J. |year=2006 |publisher=Brill |isbn=90-04-14628-8 |quote=The name sotah is derived from Num. 5:12 based on the word שטה to stray.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Scriptures: Proverbs, with commentary - Julius Hillel Greenstone, Jewish Publication Society of America - 1950 -  Page 42 "10.6; 21.10; Num. 5.18). turn] The word is used in connection with the woman suspected of infidelity (Num. 5), whence the technical term Sotah is derived, the name given to the treatise of the Mishnah and the Talmud dealing with this subject."&lt;/ref&gt; The process was a [[trial by ordeal]] administered to the wife whose husband suspected her of adultery but who had no witnesses to make a formal case ({{bibleverse||Numbers|5:11-31|HE}}). The ordeal is further explained in the [[Talmud]], in the [[Sotah (Talmud)|eponymous seventh tractate]] of ''[[Nashim]]''.

==Hebrew Bible==
The account of the ordeal of bitter water given in the Book of Numbers is as follows:
{{quotation|&lt;small&gt;19&lt;/small&gt; And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman: 'If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;20&lt;/small&gt; but if thou hast gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband--&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;21&lt;/small&gt; then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman--the LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy belly to swell;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;22&lt;/small&gt; and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to fall away'; and the woman shall say: 'Amen, Amen.'&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;23&lt;/small&gt; And the priest shall write these curses in a scroll, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness. &lt;small&gt;24&lt;/small&gt; And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.|Numbers 5|[[JPS 1917]].}}

== Jewish tradition ==

===Mishnah and Talmud===
According to the [[Mishnah]], it was the practice for the woman to first be brought to the [[Sanhedrin]], before being subjected to the ordeal. Repeated attempts would be made to persuade the women to confess, including multiple suggestions to her of possible [[Mitigation (law)|mitigating factors]]; if she confessed, the ordeal was not required.&lt;ref name="''Sotah''1:5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=adultery|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&amp;letter=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations require that the ordeal take place when the woman is brought to [[kohen|an Israelite priest]],&lt;ref name="num515"&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when she is brought ''before [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]''.&lt;ref name="num530"&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:30|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--keep these distinct - see section "Secular analysis" below for explanation--&gt; The Mishnah reports that, in the time of the [[Second Temple]], she was taken to the East Gate of the Temple, in front of the Nikanor gate.&lt;ref name="''Sotah''1:5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"/&gt;

The woman is required by the Biblical passage to have loosened hair during the ritual;&lt;ref name="num518"&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is often taken to be a symbol of the woman's supposed shame,&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Jealousy, Ordeal of|section=Jannaeus-Jerah}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Josephus]], it was merely the standard behaviour for anyone accused of any crime, when they appeared before the Sanhedrin.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', 14:49&lt;/ref&gt; The Mishnah also states that the garment she was wearing was ripped to expose her heart.  A rope was tied above her breasts so that her clothes did not completely fall off. The Mishnah, however, argues that the clothing on the woman's upper body was also stripped away, leaving her bare-breasted.&lt;ref name="''Sotah''1:5"&gt;Mishnah, ''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]'', 1:[[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Sotah/Chapter 1/5|5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===

====The ordeal====
This trial consisted of the wife having to drink a specific potion administered by the priest. The text does not specify the amount of time needed for the potion to take effect; 19th century scholars{{who|date=March 2012}} suspected it was probably intended to have a fairly immediate effect.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; The Mishnah mentions there could also be a suspension of the ordeal for one, two or three years, if she has an acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Sotah'', 3:[[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Sotah/Chapter 3/4|4]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] records the traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinical]] view: "Her belly swells first and then her thigh ruptures and she dies".&lt;ref name="Halacha 16-17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960640/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm|title=משנה תורה, ספר נשים: הלכות שוטה פרק ג הלכה טז-יז|trans-title=Mishneh Torah, Sefer Nashim: Sotah, Chapter Three, Halacha 16-17|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others maintain that since the word "thigh" is often used in the Bible as a [[euphemism]] for various reproductive organs, in this case it may mean the uterus, the placenta or an embryo, and the woman would survive.&lt;ref name=Bergant1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brewer1913/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYHNaY1oXQQC&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186 |title=Women and Jewish Law: The Essential Texts, Their History, and Their Relevance for Today |last=Biale |first=Rachel |publisher=Random House Digital |year=1995 |isbn=0805210490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nahmanides]] points out that of all the [[613 commandments]], it is only the ''sotah'' law that requires God's specific co-operation to make it work. The bitter waters can only be effective miraculously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/tp/i/m/48964791.html|title=GOD'S COOPERATION|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text specifies that the potion should be made from water and dust;&lt;ref name="num517"&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:17|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[masoretic text]], the water used for the potion must be ''holy water'', and the [[Targum]] interprets it as water from the ''[[Molten Sea]]'', but the [[Septuagint]] instead requires ''running water''.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; The passage argues that the curse was washed into the water;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:23|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is thought that this idea derives from a belief that the words of a curse exist in their own right.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; Others argue that the curse is a euphemism for a [[miscarriage]] or infertility.&lt;ref name=Bergant1992&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergant |first=Dianne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nj-AkOJ9wRQC&amp;pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=The Collegeville Bible Commentary: Based on the New American Bible: Old Testament |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1992 |isbn=0814622100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potion also had to be mixed in an earthenware vessel;&lt;ref name="num517" /&gt; this may have been because the potion was regarded as a taboo which could be spread by contact, and therefore also made the vessel taboo, necessitating its subsequent destruction (as do the [[Kosher food|biblical rules concerning taboo animals]], for any earthenware vessels into which such animals fall&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|11:33|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; However, the Talmud&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' [[s:he:סוטה ט א|9a]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rashi]] explain that this vessel is chosen to contrast the woman's predicament with her behavior. She gave the adulterer to drink choice wine in valuable goblets; therefore, let her drink bitter water in a worthless clay vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/torah/article/parshat_naso_4|title=Parshat Naso: Is the Sotah Presumed Guilty?|last1=Fox|first1=Bernie|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9933|title=Numbers 5:17|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides further writes: "When she dies, the adulterer because of whom she was compelled to drink will also die, wherever he is located. The same phenomena, the swelling of the belly and the rupture of the thigh, will also occur to him. All the above applies provided her husband never engaged in forbidden sexual relations in his life. If, however, her husband ever engaged in forbidden relations, the [bitter] waters do not check [the fidelity of] his wife."&lt;ref name="Halacha 16-17"/&gt;

====The offering====
The husband was required to make a [[korban|sacrifice]] to God, as part of the ritual, probably due to a general principle that no one should seek answers from God without giving something in return.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; This offering is required to be placed in the wife's hands,&lt;ref name="num518" /&gt; and is literally described as ''her offering for her'';&lt;ref name="num515" /&gt; scholars think that it is the man's offering, in relation to the ordeal of his wife, and that her holding of it is merely symbolic of this.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt;

The offering specified is one tenth of an [[ephah]] of [[barley]] meal, unaccompanied by oil or frankincense;&lt;ref name="num515" /&gt; this is the cheaper type of [[flour]], unlike the flour specified for all other biblical sacrifices.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; The specification is now thought to be a rare survival of an earlier period, in which there was no restriction on the types of flour which could be used for sacrifices,&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; although the Mishnah argues that it was a reference to the ''bestial'' nature of adultery, coarse flour being the ''food of beasts''.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Sotah'', 2:[[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Sotah/Chapter 2/1|1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False accusations ===
If the woman was unharmed by the bitter water, the rules regard her as innocent of the accusation.  The account in the Book of Numbers states that the man shall be ''free from blame'' (5:26). This is not to be confused with the [[Deuteronomic Code]], which pertains to when a man accuses his wife of pre-marital sex; when accusation is disproven, the husband is to be fined, and is no longer to have the right of divorcing the wife ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:13-19|}}) There is more reason to fine and whip the man who accuses his wife of pre-marital sex than the husband of the sotah woman. The man who accuses his wife of pre-marital sex has no proof about his wife when he accuses her, whereas by a Sotah woman, the husband initially warned her not to seclude herself with a particular man, which she thereafter did. Therefore, whether she is innocent of the accusation of adultery or not, she still has caused reasonable suspicion in the eyes of her husband.

The rabbinical interpretation of {{Bibleverse||Numbers|5:28|HE}} is that when a woman accused of adultery who was innocent drinks the bitter water, even if she was previously unable to conceive, she will now conceive and give birth to a male.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, ''Sotah'' [[s:he:סוטה כו א|26a]]; {{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960640/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm|title=משנה תורה, ספר נשים: הלכות שוטה פרק ג הלכה כב|author=Maimonides|authorlink=Maimonides|trans-title=Mishneh Torah, Sefer Nashim: Sotah, Chapter Three, Halacha 22|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cessation of the ordeal===
According to Mishnah, ''Sotah'', 9:[[s:Mishnah/Seder Nashim/Tractate Sotah/Chapter 9/9|9]] the practice was [[repeal|abolished]] some time during the first century CE under the leadership of [[Yohanan Ben Zakkai]].&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[ISBE]]|title=Adultery|url=http://gospelhall.org/bible/bible.php?search=ADULTERY&amp;dict=isbe|accessdate=June 4, 2013|quote=According to the Mishna (SoTah 9) this ordeal of the woman suspected of adultery was abolished by Johanan ben Zaccai (after 70 AD), on the ground that the men of his generation were not above the suspicion of impurity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even if it had not been abolished, the rite would have sunk into abeyance with the fall of the Temple (in approximately the year 70 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/rabbis/zakkai.htm|title=Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai|accessdate=May 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511060636/http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/rabbis/zakkai.htm|archivedate=2013-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), because, according to the Law, the ceremony could not be performed elsewhere.&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu" /&gt; Explanations in rabbinical literature vary concerning cessation of the practice. Yohanan Ben Zakkai stated:
{{quotation|When adulterers became many, the ordeal of the bitter water stopped, for the ordeal of bitter water is performed only in a case of doubt. But now there are many who see their lovers in public &lt;ref&gt;Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, Volume 1: European Association for Jewish Studies. Congress, Judith Targarona Borrás, Ángel Sáenz-Badillos - 1999 Page 271. "When adulterers became many, the ordeal of the bitter water stopped (DHD 'D PDA), for the ordeal of bitter water is performed only in a case of doubt. But now there are many who see their lovers in public"&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Rabbi [[Hanina of Sura]] said in [[Sotah (Talmud)|Talmud ''Sotah'']]: 
{{Quotation|Nowadays a man should not say to his wife, “Do not be secluded with so-and-so,” ... If she then secluded herself with the man, since we have not now the water for the suspected woman to test her, the husband forbids her to himself for all time. |[[Babylonian Talmud|B.T.]] ''Sotah'' 2c| [[Soncino family (printers)|Soncino]].}}

==Christian references==
Although, as with later Judaism, the actual ordeal was not practiced in Christianity it was referenced by Christian writers through the ages in relation to both the subject of adultery, and also the wider practice of [[trial by ordeal]]. Additionally some early Christian legends, such as the [[Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew]], embroider the life of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] with accounts including Mary (and even Joseph&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, chapter 12: "And again Joseph was summoned to the altar, and the water of drinking of the Lord was given him to drink.  And when any one that had lied drank this water, and walked seven times round the altar, God used to show some sign in his face.  When, therefore, Joseph had drunk in safety, and had walked round the altar seven times, no sign of sin appeared in him.  Then all the priests, and the officers, and the people justified him, saying:  Blessed art thou, seeing that no charge has been found good against thee. [...] Then Mary said, stedfastly and without trembling:  O Lord God, King over all, who knowest all secrets, if there be any pollution in me, or any sin, or any evil desires, or unchastity, expose me in the sight of all the people, and make me an example of punishment to all.  Thus saying, she went up to the altar of the Lord boldly, and drank the water of drinking, and walked round the altar seven times, and no spot was found in her." [[wikisource:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Apocrypha of the New Testament/The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew/Chapter 12|(Wikisource)]]&lt;/ref&gt;) undergoing a version of the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph B. Tyson, ''The New Testament and Early Christianity'' (1984), page 199: "They each highlight a certain portion or aspect of Jesus' history, such as his family, his childhood, his resurrection, or his teachings. [...] But Mary became pregnant, and Joseph was afraid that his neglect had allowed an adulterer to seduce her. So the priests gave both of them a trial by bitter water, a trial they survived."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion interpretation==
Several commentaries on the Bible maintain that the ordeal is to be applied in the case of a woman who has become pregnant, allegedly by her lover.&lt;ref name="Bergant1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]'' (1962 edition), Numbers 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a pregnancy on its own does not exclude the possibility that a married woman may have become pregnant to her lawful husband, presumably pregnancy was an indication of adultery if the husband claimed (truthfully or not) that there had been no circumstance under which she could have been impregnated by him. However, presuming the husband is being truthful as to his non-participation in conception, pregnancy due to non-consensual [[rape]] (as opposed to consensual [[adultery]]) is not taken into consideration.

One reading is that the ordeal results in a [[Uterine prolapse|prolapsed uterus]] if she is guilty.&lt;ref name="The Strange Case of the Suspected Sotah"&gt;Tikva Frymer-Kensky, in "Women in the Hebrew Bible", ed. Bach (1999, Routledge, New York and London, pages 463-474)&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpretations of the ordeal describe the bitter potion as an [[abortifacient]], which induces a purposeful [[abortion]] or miscarriage if the woman is pregnant with a child which her husband alleges is another man’s. If the fetus aborts as a result of the ordeal, this presumably confirms her guilt of adultery, otherwise her innocence is presumed if the fetus does not abort.&lt;ref name="Bergant1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brewer1913&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbY1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |page=46 |journal=The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures |title=The Ordeal in Numbers Chapter 5 |last=Brewer |first=Julius A. |volume=30 |number=1 |date=October 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grushcow 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RXTlobTJZ1UC&amp;pg=PA276 pp. 275–276]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berquist |first=Jon L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSEigoqDI10C&amp;pg=PA176 |pages=175–177 |title=Controlling Corporeality: The Body and the Household in Ancient Israel |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0813530164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Baruch A. |title=Numbers 1-20: a new translation with introduction and commentary |volume=4 |number=part 1 |publisher=Doubleday |year=1993 |isbn=0385156510 |pages=201–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snaith |first=Norman Henry |authorlink=Norman Snaith |title=Leviticus and Numbers |year=1967 |page=202 |publisher=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Dennis T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rus0KUTNUg4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36 |page=36 |title=Numbers: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1996 |isbn=0664237363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secular analysis ==
The text appears to suggest&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; first that the offering should occur before the ordeal, ({{bibleverse||Numbers|5:24-25|HE}}) and then that it should occur after it.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; ({{bibleverse||Numbers|5:26|HE}})

Due of the awkwardness of the idea that the wife has to drink the potion twice, secular [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] argue that either the first drinking must be a later addition to the text, or that the whole account of the ordeal must be spliced together from two earlier descriptions.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt;

Noting that there are two descriptions of the location for the ritual (in the presence of a priest,&lt;ref name="num515" /&gt; and ''before Yahweh'',&lt;ref name="num530" /&gt;) and two occasions on which the punishment for the woman is mentioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:21|}} and {{bibleverse||Numbers|5:27|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the division into two earlier documents, first suggested by [[Bernhard Stade]]&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Stade, ''[[Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft]]'' (commonly known, among theologians, as ''ZATW''), (1895), 15:166-178&lt;/ref&gt; is typically as follows: 
*one account is the ordeal and sacrifice ''before God'', in which the possible miscarriage/abortion results from drinking the potion&lt;ref name="CHBHex"&gt;Joseph Estlin Carpenter, and George Harford-battersby (and the Society of Historical Theology, Oxford), ''The Hexateuch'' (1900, republished 2003), volume 2, pages 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;
*the other is merely a condemnation by a priest, in which the women stands with hair loosened, her guilt is assumed, and divine intervention (due to the priest's involvement) will cause a miscarriage/abortion as punishment.&lt;ref name="CHBHex" /&gt;

Other secular Biblical scholars think that the ordeal is itself a fusion of two earlier rituals (pre-dating the original priestly text), one using water, and the other dust.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; The use of dust might be connected to [[necromancy]].&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; In other historic semitic cultures there are many instances in which ''holy water'' was regarded as taboo, and therefore that contact with it, or its consumption, was dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;William Robertson Smith, ''Lectures on the Religion of the Semites'' (2nd edition - 1894), 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern applications==
According to scholars such as Helena Zlotnick, after the ordeal of bitter water was no longer practiced it remained a reference point in the search for replacements for the test of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Zlotnick, ''Dinah's Daughters: Gender and Judaism from the Hebrew Bible to ... '' 2002 {{ISBN|0812217977}} Page 111. "The question that has never been asked by modern interpreters of the history of the ordeal of the bitter water is what replaced the ordeal after its abolition 41 In other words, what legal procedures were available to investigate and prosecute ...One underlying quest of this chapter is a search for the alternative that replaced the pre-70 procedures of detecting adulteresses, assuming that husbands did continue to suspect their wives of adultery and that sexual loyalty .."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar rituals ==

Trials by ordeal are found in other societies of the [[ancient Near East]] such as in the [[Laws of Hammurabi]] (§132).&lt;ref&gt;The New Oxford Annotated Bible Michael David Coogan, Marc Zvi Brettler, Carol Ann Newsom - 2007  Page 193. "A man who questions his wife's fidelity brings her to the sanctuary for an ordeal in which she drinks a mixture of water, dust, and ink to determine if she is culpable (cf. ... Ordeals to determine culpability are found in other societies of the ancient Near East (e.g., Hammurabi's Laws §132). ... aside to uncleanness while under your husband's authority, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic Muslim Arabic culture similarly had an adultery ordeal, although in scientific terms, compared to the Israelite ritual it relied more on nausea, than on directly poisoning the woman. In this Arabic ritual, the woman simply took oaths at [[Mecca]] attesting to her innocence, and asking the divinity to cause her to have a miscarriage/abortion, should she be lying;&lt;ref name="KitAdultMecca"&gt;''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', 1:156:3+&lt;/ref&gt; but, on the way to Mecca, she would be forced to travel on a camel, between two bags of dung.&lt;ref name="KitAdultMecca" /&gt;

Ordeals involving the risk of harm, including potential injury resulting from the drinking of certain potions, were common in antiquity;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; in parts of Europe, their judicial use even lasted until the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; Such ordeals were once believed to result in a direct decision by a deity, about the guilt or innocence of the party/parties undertaking the ordeal;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt; typically divine intervention was believed to prevent the innocent being harmed, or to ensure that the guilty were, although in the case of some &amp;ndash; [[witch ducking]], for example &amp;ndash; the innocent were more likely to come to harm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">'''Red-Letter Christians''' constitute a [[non-denominational]] movement within Christianity. Proponents of the movement believe that [[Christianity]], and especially [[evangelicalism]], has been exploited by both [[right-wing]] and [[left-wing]] [[politics|political]] movements and has become too [[partisan (political)|partisan]] and politicized. As a response this non-profit organization endeavors to create an evangelical movement that focuses on the [[Jesus#Teachings and preachings|teachings of Jesus Christ]], particularly in regard to [[social issues]]. The two most prominent figures associated with the movement are [[Jim Wallis]] and [[Tony Campolo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = official [[World Wide Web]] site | title = Red letter Christians | url = http://www.redletterchristians.org/start/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Red-Letter" refers to [[New Testament]] verses and parts of verses printed in red ink, to indicate the words attributed to Jesus without the use of quotations (see [[Red letter edition]]). While many Christians throughout [[church history]] have defined themselves as emphasizing the teachings of Jesus, this modern movement was initiated by Wallis and Campolo, who felt the [[Christian Right|religious right]] spend too much time on two issues: [[Christianity and abortion|abortion]] and [[Christianity and homosexuality|homosexuality]]. They believe Christians should be paying attention to Jesus words and example by promoting biblical values such as peace, building strong families, the elimination of poverty, and other important [[social justice]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.redletterchristians | title = About us: Red Letter Christians |publisher= Sojourners|dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916191546/http://www.sojo.net//index.cfm?action=about_us.redletterchristians |archive-date=16 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that these are the issues that Jesus spoke of directly, and therefore these issues should be social and political priorities. Other issues such as the question of homosexuality and abortion are viewed as important but over-emphasized by both [[liberal Christianity|liberals]] and [[Christian right|conservatives]].

According to Campolo, "The purpose of this gathering was not to create a religious left movement to challenge the religious right, but to jump-start a religious movement that will transcend partisan politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = What's a 'Red-Letter Christian'?| first = Anthony ‘Tony’ | last = Campolo|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/christianity/2006/02/whats-a-red-letter-christian.aspx|publisher=Beliefnet |date = 2006-02-27 | accessdate = 2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Campolo has released a book to help explain this, called ''Red Letter Christians, A Citizen's Guide to Faith and Politics'' (Regal Books, February 2008).

The major '''religion in Somalia''' is [[Islam in Somalia|Islam]]. There is  no [[Christian]] community living in [[Somalia]]. Additionally, some ethnic minorities in the southern part of the country practice [[Traditional African religion|traditional faiths]].

==State religion==

===Islam===
{{main|Islam in Somalia}}
[[File:Mosislsol2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Mosque of Islamic Solidarity]] in [[Mogadishu]] is the largest masjid in the Horn region.]]
Most residents of Somalia are [[Muslim]]s,&lt;ref name="Mepc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mepc.org/workshops/popstat.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214023655/http://www.mepc.org/workshops/popstat.asp|archivedate=2006-12-14 |title=Middle East Policy Council – Muslim Populations Worldwide |publisher=Mepc.org |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority belonging to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of [[Islam]] and the [[Shafi'i]] school of [[Islamic jurisprudence]], although some are adherents of the [[Shia]] Muslim denomination.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and customs of Somalia|publisher=Greenwood|year=2001|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Nu918tYMB8C|isbn=978-0-313-31333-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]], the mystical dimension of Islam, is also well-established, with many local ''jama'a'' (''[[Zaouia|zawiya]]'') or congregations of the various ''[[Tariqah|tariiqa]]'' or Sufi orders.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Lewis, ''Saints and Somalis: popular Islam in a clan-based society'', (The Red Sea Press: 1998), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Somalia|Provisional Constitution]] of Somalia defines Islam as the state religion of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and Islamic [[sharia]] as the basic source for national legislation. It also stipulates that no law that is inconsistent with the basic tenets of Shari'a can be enacted. Article 11 guarantees equal rights and freedom from persecution for all citizens before the law regardless of religion. Additionally, Article 17 protects freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution|url=http://unpos.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=RkJTOSpoMME=|accessdate=7 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122013/http://unpos.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=RkJTOSpoMME%3D|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam entered the region very early on, shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]. [[Zeila]]'s two-[[mihrab]] [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest [[mosque]] in the city.&lt;ref name="Btgpb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Phillip|title=Somaliland|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=1841623717|page=7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=M6NI2FejIuwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 9th century, [[Al-Yaqubi]] wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard.&lt;ref name="Encyamer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 25|year=1965|publisher=Americana Corporation|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP5LAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city,&lt;ref name="Encyamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewispohoa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar and Saho|year=1955|publisher=International African Institute|pages=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd0mAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the [[Adal Sultanate]] with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties, who also ruled over the similarly-established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the [[Benadir]] region to the south.&lt;ref name="Lewispohoa"/&gt;

In addition, the Somali community has produced numerous important Islamic figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Muslim learning and practice in the Horn of Africa, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and well beyond. Among these Islamic scholars is the 14th century Somali [[theologian]] and [[jurist]] [[Uthman bin Ali Zayla'i]] of Zeila, who wrote the single most authoritative text on the [[Hanafi]] school of Islam, consisting of four volumes known as the ''Tabayin al-Haqa’iq li Sharh Kanz al-Daqa’iq''.

==Minority religions==

===Christianity===
{{main|Christianity in Somalia}}
[[File:Mogadischu Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Mogadishu Cathedral]], the former seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio]].]]
[[Christianity]] is a minority religion in Somalia, with no more than 1,000 practitioners (about 0.01% of the population).&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/middleeast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14707279 |title=Almost expunged: Somalia's Embattled Christians |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2009-10-22 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to estimates of the [[Diocese of Mogadishu]] (the territory of which coincides with the country) there were only about 100 [[Catholic]] practitioners in Somalia in 2004.&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dmgds|Diocese of Mogadiscio|23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no [[Christian]]s in the Somali territories, with only about 100–200 followers coming from the schools and [[orphanage]]s of the few Catholic [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in the [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church'', Volume 14, (Robert Appleton company: 1913), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also no known Catholic missions in [[Italian Somaliland]] during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Henry Robinson, ''History of Christian Missions'', (READ BOOKS: 2007), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, during the reign of Somalia's then [[Marxism|Marxist]] government, church-run schools were closed and [[Missionary|missionaries]] sent home. There has been no [[archbishop]] in the country since 1989, and the [[cathedral]] in Mogadishu was severely damaged during the civil war.

According to the [[Pew Research Center]], less than 0.1% of Somalia's population in 2010 were adherents of [[Traditional African religion|traditional]] or [[folk religion]]s.&lt;ref name="Pew"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape, Religious groups 2010 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-full.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=27 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309232303/http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-full.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mainly consisted of some non-Somali ethnic minority groups in the southern parts of the country, who practice [[animism]].

{{nihongo|'''''Silence'''''|沈黙|''Chinmoku''}} is a 1966 novel of historical fiction by [[Japan]]ese author [[Shūsaku Endō]], published in English by [[Peter Owen Publishers]].  It is the story of a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary sent to 17th century Japan, who endures persecution in the time of [[Kakure Kirishitan]] ("Hidden Christians") that followed the defeat of the [[Shimabara Rebellion]].  The recipient of the 1966 [[Tanizaki Prize]], it has been called "Endo's supreme achievement"&lt;ref name=Reinsma&gt;[http://www.spu.edu/depts/uc/response/autumn2k4/silence.asp "Shusaku Endo's ''Silence''{{-"}}] by Luke Reinsma, ''Response'' of [[Seattle Pacific University]], Volume 27, Number 4, Autumn 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the twentieth century's finest novels".&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.baylor.edu/christianethics/SufferingarticleDewey.pdf |title=''We Have Never Seen His Face'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207082025/http://www3.baylor.edu/christianethics/SufferingarticleDewey.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(121&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} by Brett R. Dewey for the Center for Christian Ethics at [[Baylor University]], 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Written partly in the form of a letter by its central character, the theme of a silent [[Trinity|God]] who accompanies a believer in adversity was greatly influenced by the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Endō's experience of [[religious discrimination]] in Japan, [[racism]] in France, and a debilitating bout with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Dewey 2005, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
The young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Jesuit priest Sebastião Rodrigues (based on the historical Italian figure [[Giuseppe Chiara]]) travels to Japan to assist the local Church and investigate reports that his mentor, a Jesuit priest in Japan named Ferreira, based on [[Cristóvão Ferreira]], has committed [[apostasy]]. Less than half of the book is the written journal of Rodrigues, while the other half of the book is written either in the [[Third person narrative#Third-person view|third person]], or in the letters of others associated with the narrative. The novel relates the trials of Christians and the increasing hardship suffered by Rodrigues.

Rodrigues and his companion Francisco Garupe (also a Jesuit priest) arrive in Japan in 1639. There they find the local Christian population driven underground. To ferret out [[kakure kirishitan|hidden Christians]], security officials force suspected Christians to trample on a ''[[fumi-e]]'', a carved image of [[Christ]]. Those who refuse are imprisoned and killed by ''anazuri'' (穴吊り), which is by being hung upside down over a pit and slowly bled.

Rodrigues and Garupe are eventually captured and forced to swim as Japanese Christians lay down their lives for the faith. There is no glory in these martyrdoms, as Rodrigues had always imagined – only brutality and cruelty. Prior to the arrival of Rodrigues, the authorities had been attempting to force priests to renounce their faith by torturing them. Beginning with Ferreira, they torture other Christians as the priests look on, telling the priests that all they must do is renounce their faith in order to end the suffering of their flock.

Rodrigues' journal depicts his struggles: he understands suffering for the sake of one's own faith; but he struggles over whether it is self-centered and unmerciful to refuse to recant when doing so will end another's suffering. At the climactic moment, Rodrigues hears the moans of those who have recanted but are to remain in the pit until he tramples the image of Christ. As Rodrigues looks upon a ''fumi-e'', Christ breaks his silence: "You may trample. You may trample. I more than anyone know of the pain in your foot. You may trample. It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men's pain that I carried my cross." Rodrigues puts his foot on the ''fumi-e''.

An official tells Rodrigues, "Father, it was not by us that you were defeated, but by this mudswamp, Japan."&lt;ref name="Mathy"&gt;Francis Mathy, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], of [[Sophia University]], (1974), "Introduction", Endo Shusaku, ''Wonderful Fool'' (''Obaka San''), Tokyo: Tuttle, p. 6, {{ ISBN| 9780068598534}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''Silence'' received the [[Tanizaki Prize]] for the year's best full-length literature.  It has also been the subject of extensive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quodlibet.net/dewey-endo.shtml "Suffering the Patient Victory of God: Shusaku Endo and the Lessons of a Japanese Catholic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040213101831/http://www.quodlibet.net/dewey-endo.shtml |date=2004-02-13 }} by Brett R. Dewey, ''Quodlibet'': Vol 6 Number 1, January–March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In a review published by the New Yorker, [[John Updike]] called ''Silence'' "a remarkable work, a sombre, delicate, and startlingly empathetic study of a young Portuguese missionary during the relentless persecution of the Japanese Christians in the early seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Updike|first=John|date=1980|title=From Fumie to Sony|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1980/01/14/from-fumie-to-sony|journal=The New Yorker|volume=55.48|page=94|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William T. Cavanaugh|William Cavanaugh]] highlights the novel's "deep moral ambiguity" due to the depiction of a God who "has chosen not to eliminate suffering, but to suffer with humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_n5_v125/ai_20485535 "The god of silence: Shusaku Endo's reading of the Passion – critique of the Japanese novel 'Silence'"] by William T. Cavanaugh, ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'',  March 13, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

''Silence'' was not immediately successful among Japanese Catholics, who were among some of the novel's harshest critics. Instead, the novel's popularity was boosted by "left-wing college students" who saw a connection between the plight of Japanese Marxists in the circumstances of Rodrigues. The novel was notably compared to Graham Greene's ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'', leading Endo to be referred to as "the Graham Greene of Japan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffer|first=B.|date=2003|title=Shusaku Endo and Graham Greene: Cross-Cultural Influences in Literary Structure|url=|journal=Language &amp; Literature|volume=28|page=127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

=== Stage ===

Besides Endo's [[Play (theatre)|stage version]], ''The Golden Country'', there have been several adaptions.

=== Films ===

[[Masahiro Shinoda]] directed the 1971 film ''[[Silence (1971 film)|Silence]]'', an adaptation from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067755/ "Chinmoku (1971)"], [[Internet Movie Database]] (accessed 20 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was re-adapted by [[João Mário Grilo]] as ''[[Os Olhos da Ásia|The Eyes of Asia]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/10/silence-review-the-last-temptation-of-liam-neeson-in-scorseses-shattering-epic|title=Silence review: the last temptation of Liam Neeson in Scorsese's shattering epic|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|date=10 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, the novel was adapted into a film, also named ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'', directed by [[Martin Scorsese]], written by [[Jay Cocks]] and Scorsese, and starring [[Andrew Garfield]], [[Adam Driver]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Tadanobu Asano]] and [[Ciarán Hinds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490215/?ref_=nv_sr_2|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]] in Rome on November 29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/global/martin-scorsese-meets-pope-francis-talks-jesuit-history-prior-to-silence-screening-1201930025/|title=Martin Scorsese Meets Pope Francis and Talks Jesuit History Prior to 'Silence' Screening|author=Nick Vivarelli|date=30 November 2016|work=Variety|quote=On Tuesday, 'Silence' screened for roughly 300 Jesuit priests at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, in what amounted to the film's de facto world premiere. Attendees were able to discuss the film with Scorsese afterwards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===

Composer and poet [[Teizo Matsumura]] wrote the libretto and music for an opera with the same title, which was premiered at the [[New National Theatre]] in Tokyo in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nntt.jac.go.jp/english/opera/e20000464_opera.html "Tokyo NNT website"] (accessed 15 February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The novel inspired [[Symphony No. 3 (MacMillan)|Symphony no. 3, "Silence"]], composed in 2002 by Scottish musician [[James MacMillan (composer)|James MacMillan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.guardian.co.uk/live/story/0,,2276530,00.html "BBCSSO/Runnicles"] by Rowena Smith, ''[[The Guardian]], 28 April 2008''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Taisha-zukuri''' or '''Ōyashiro-zukuri'''|大社造|}} is the oldest [[Shinto shrine]] style. Named after [[Izumo Taisha]]'s ''[[honden]]'' (sanctuary), like [[Ise Shrine|Ise Grand Shrine]]'s ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' style it features a bark roof decorated with poles called ''[[chigi (architecture)|chigi]]'' and ''[[katsuogi]]'', plus archaic features like gable-end pillars and a single central pillar (''shin no mihashira'').&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto&lt;/ref&gt; The ''honden's'' floor is raised above the ground through the use of stilts (see photo).
Like the ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' and ''[[sumiyoshi-zukuri]]'' styles, it predates the arrival in Japan of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].

==History==
Ancient [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] were constructed according to the style of dwellings ([[Izumo Taisha]])&lt;ref name="YY"&gt;Young &amp; Young (2007:50)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ki33"&gt;Kishida (2008:33)&lt;/ref&gt; or storehouses ([[Ise Grand Shrine]]).&lt;ref name="YY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;Fletcher and Cruickshank (1996:724)&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings had [[gabled roof]]s, raised floors, plank walls, and were [[thatching|thatched]] with reed or covered with [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki cypress]] bark.&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt; Such early shrines did not include a space for worship.&lt;ref name="YY"/&gt; Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: ''taisha-zukuri'', ''[[shinmei-zukuri]]'' and ''[[sumiyoshi-zukuri]]''.&lt;ref name="ki34"&gt;Kishida (2008:34)&lt;/ref&gt; They are exemplified by [[Izumo Taisha]], [[Nishina Shinmei Shrine]] and [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]]&lt;ref name="ki35"&gt;Kishida (2008:35)&lt;/ref&gt; respectively and date to before 552.&lt;ref name="ki126"&gt;Kishida (2008:126)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of {{nihongo|''Shikinen sengū-sai|式年遷宮祭}}'', the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.

==Structure==
[[Image:Izumo-taisha scale model 121281969 6127ff6b17 o.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Reconstruction model of the ancient Izumo-taisha honden, based on remains of old pillars found on the site.]]
[[File:Izumooyashiro11.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Reconstruction of Izumo Taisha's ''honden'' somewhat later, during the [[Kamakura period]]]]
Izumo Taisha's ''honden'' over time has gone through profound changes that have greatly decreased its size and changed its structure.&lt;ref name="FK"&gt;Fujita, Koga (2008:24)&lt;/ref&gt; In its present form, it is a gabled building 2x2 ''ken''&lt;ref&gt;A ''ken'' is the distance between one supporting pillar and another, a quantity which can vary from shrine to shrine and even within the same building. In this case, a ''ken'' is 6.32 m, well above its standard value of just below 2 m.&lt;/ref&gt; in size, with an entrance on the gabled end (a characteristic called {{nihongo|''[[tsumairi]]-zukuri''|妻入造}}. Like Ise Grand Shrine's, it has purely ornamental poles called ''chigi'' (vertical) and ''katsuogi'' (horizontal) on a cypress bark-covered roof, plus archaic features like gable-end pillars and a single central pillar ({{nihongo|''shin no mihashira''|心の御柱}}).&lt;ref name="FK"/&gt; This pillar has a diameter of 10.9 cm, has no obvious structural role and is believed to have had a purely religious significance.&lt;ref name="jata "/&gt; The external stairway is covered by an independent bark-covered roof (see illustration in the gallery). 

[[File:IzumoTaisha Honden (detail).jpg|thumb|Izumo Taisha's ''honden'']]
The ''honden's'' interior is a square divided into four identical sections, each covered by 15 [[tatami]] (straw mats). The floor plan has therefore the shape of the Chinese character for {{nihongo|rice field|田}}, an element which suggests a possible connection with harvest propitiation rites.&lt;ref name="jata"/&gt;

Because its floor is raised above the ground, the ''honden'' is believed to have its origin in raised-floor granaries like those found in [[Toro (archaeological site)|Toro]], [[Shizuoka prefecture]].&lt;ref name="jata"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/taishazukuri.htm Taisha-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest extant example of ''taisha-zukuri'' is the ''honden'' at Kamosu Shrine in [[Matsue, Shimane|Matsue, Shimane prefecture]], built in 1582 and now declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]].&lt;ref name="FK"/&gt; Smaller than Izumo Taisha's, it nonetheless has thick supporting pillars. It is deeper, has a higher floor, and differs significantly from Izumo Taisha's. It probably represents an older style of construction.&lt;ref name="FK"/&gt;

The '''Tanti''' Community people are found across the northeastern portion of India.The greatest concentration is believed to be in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Kolkata as well as odisha .They are slightly less concentrated than some groups because their designation started with their occupation rather than a particular group.

== Origin ==
 
The word tanti is derived from the [[Hindi]] word tant, which means a loom. They were traditionally [[Weaving|weavers]], and are one of the many communities found in [[South Asia]], traditionally associated with this craft. According to their traditions, they were created by the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] from his tears. The community is found in south [[Bihar]], and district of [[Ranchi]] in [[Jharkhand]].&lt;ref name="H bengal"&gt;''People of India Bihar'' Volume XVI, Part Two, edited by S Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha, pp. 914-916, Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">The '''Mass of Saint-Sécaire''' is a ritual supposed to have been performed in [[Gascony]], [[France]]. The best-known account of the Mass is that of [[James George Frazer]] in his 1890 omnibus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, James ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 1890; Ch. IV: ''Magic and Religion''&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's description, in turn, was taken nearly verbatim from a less well-known French book published in 1883, ''Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne''&lt;ref&gt;Bladé, Jean-François. ''Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne'', 1883 ; ''Contes populaires de la Gascogne'', Paris, Maisonneuve, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; ("Fourteen Popular Superstitions of Gascony"), by [[Jean-François Bladé]] (Fr: [[:fr:Jean-François Bladé|Jean-François Bladé]]).

The ritual was a form of [[black mass]], a parody of the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and is notable for its unusual parody of the [[Eucharist]] as compared to other accounts of Black Masses. It was said to be employed as a method by which a wronged party could supernaturally avenge himself. Bladé's informant indicated that fear of the Mass was still prevalent at the time of their interview.

==Description==

According to the recorded account, the mass could only be said in a ruined or deserted church. At precisely the first stroke of 11 o’clock the corrupt [[Roman Catholic priest|priest]], with only his lover as attendant, would begin to recite the mass backwards, being sure to finish at precisely the last stroke of midnight. Among other details intended to parody the normal practice of the Mass, the [[Transubstantiation|host]] used would be triangular and black, rather than round and white, with three points instead of the usual four; the priest would not consecrate wine but instead drink water from a well into which an unbaptized infant had been thrown.  Bladé's informant also reported that the sign of the [[cross]] would be made by the priest with his left foot on the ground before him. At the very end the officiant would pronounce the name of a victim who, it was believed, would soon simply waste away and die, with no cause that could be understood by medicine.

[[Aleister Crowley]] wrote a short story about the Mass, entitled ''The Mass of Saint-Sécaire'', in his ''Golden Bough''-inspired series ''[[Golden Twigs]]''. First published in February 1918 in ''[[The International (journal)|The International]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luminist.org/bookstore/mass_of_saint_secaire.htm Luminist Publications: Visionary Fiction: The Mass of Saint Secaire by Aleister Crowley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it uses a working of the Mass of Saint-Sécaire to illustrate an aspect of Crowley's theory of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magical]] effects.  The Mass is also used as the basis of the [[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]] episode &lt;I&gt;The Secret Doctrine&lt;/I&gt; (first aired June 20, 1974).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1685">'''Trifolius''' was a Christian theologian of the sixth century. He is known for his ''Epistula ad beatum Faustum senatorem contra Ioannem Scytham monachum'' of 519/20, written to the [[Roman senator]] Faustus. It is a report on the beliefs of the [[Scythian monks]], putting those in the context of other views condemned as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]]. It played a part in the rejection of the [[Theopaschite doctrine]]. 

The "Scythian formula", according to Trifolius, was not to be found in the four [[Ecumenical council|Councils]], and had already been condemned by the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref name = "GH"&gt;Aloys Grillmeier, Theresia Hainthaler, ''Christ in Christian Tradition: From the Council of Chalcedon (451) to Gregory the Great (590-604) '' (1995 translation), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; The "formula" refers to ''Unus ex Trinitate passus est''.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the Trinity suffered"; Grillmeier and Hainthaler, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to what the Council of Chalcedon had held against Carosus and Dorotheus (who were [[Eutychians]]).

The '''Vision Serpent''' is an important creature in [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Maya mythology]], although the term itself is now slowly becoming outdated.

The [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] was a very important social and religious symbol, revered by the Maya. Maya mythology describes serpents as being the vehicles by which celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, cross the heavens. The shedding of their skin made them a symbol of rebirth and renewal.

They were so revered, that one of the main Mesoamerican deities, [[Quetzalcoatl]], was represented as a feathered serpent. The name means "beautiful serpent" (From Nahuatl, 'Quetzalli' means beautiful and 'coatl' meaning snake or serpent.).&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, p.79)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vision Serpent is thought to be the most important of the Maya serpents. "It was usually bearded and had a rounded snout. It was also often depicted as having two heads or with the spirit of a god or ancestor emerging from its jaws." During [[Maya bloodletting|Maya bloodletting rituals]], participants would experience visions in which they communicated with the ancestors or gods. These visions took the form of a giant serpent "which served as a gateway to the spirit realm." The ancestor or god who was being contacted was depicted as emerging from the serpent's mouth. The vision serpent thus came to be the method in which ancestors or Gods manifested themselves to the Maya. Thus for them, the Vision Serpent was a direct link between the spirit realm of the gods and the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel (1990, p.395)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vision Serpent goes back to earlier Maya conceptions, and lies at the
center of the world as they conceived it. "It is in the center axis atop the [[World Tree]]. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power."&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel (1990, p.68)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vision Serpent is prevalent in bloodletting ceremonies, in Maya religious practices, Maya jewelry, pottery and their architecture.

==Bloodletting rituals==
{{Main|Bloodletting in Mesoamerica}}
Many have attempted to explain the manifestation of the Vision Serpent in association with Maya bloodletting. One conclusion is "that massive blood loss causes the brain to release an abundance of natural endorphins, which are chemically related to opiates. As the body goes into shock, a hallucinatory vision occurs." Once the actual bloodletting was over, the blood soaked ceremonial papers were burned, releasing a column of smoke. The smoke provided the perfect medium for the Vision Serpent to appear. Every major political or religious event involved bloodletting because it provided a medium by which the gods could be called upon to witness and actually participate in the ceremony. Sometimes the spirits of ancestors were also called upon to give guidance. The Hauberg Stela (A. D. 199) from the Maya Lowlands "is one of the first dated monuments that depict the Vision Serpent's connection to bloodletting". [http://www.webwizzard.com/anahuac/cat003.html]

Lintel 25 depicts one of the bloodletting rituals. "One of [[Itzamnaaj B'alam II|Shield Jaguar]]'s wives, is seen gazing up towards an enormous bicephalous Vision Serpent. In her left hand, she holds a bowl containing a stingray spine, an obsidian lancet, and papers spattered with blood. The Vision Serpent appears to be emanating from the bowl. From the jaws of the Vision Serpent, spews forth an ancestral Tlaloc warrior complete with spear and shield".&lt;ref&gt;Graham &amp; von Euw (1977){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lintel 17 refers to "Bird Jaguars as Blood Lord of [[Yaxchilan]]" and shows him preparing to draw blood from his penis with a stingray spine. Opposite Bird Jaguar is Lady Balam-Ix, who proceeds to pass coarse rope through a gouge in her tongue. The blood is being collected in the vessel near Bird Jaguar's feet. The Vision Serpent's mouth is green and, the trickles of blood characteristic of bloodletting are red".&lt;ref&gt;Graham &amp; von Euw (1977){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lintel 15 depicts the appearance of this Vision Serpent. "The serpent can be seen rising out of the bowl with trickles of blood along a column of blood scrolls. This lintel shows the queen of Yaxchilan involved in a visionary experience following an elaborate bloodletting ceremony. She holds the ritual paraphernalia in her arms while the vision serpent rises from a bowl of blood stained paper."&lt;ref&gt;Graham &amp; von Euw (1977){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maya religious rites==
There was a Vision Serpent named Och-Kan, lord of [[Kalakmul|Kalak'mul]].

One of the most common rituals associated with the Vision serpent involved invoking ancestral spirits. Especially during coronation rites, the kings would contact the spirits for guidance and blessings. It is the Vision Serpent who provides the medium for contacting these deities.

It is believed that Lord Pakal's sarcophagus lid, which was located at [[Palenque]], is probably “the single most comprehensive image which relates the Vision Serpent to Maya religion.” It depicts the death of Pakal and his descent into the Underworld. “The bicepalous serpent bar is placed horizontally on the World Tree and is the [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for this transition. In the same way that the Vision Serpent represents a conduit between the physical world and the spirit realm of the ancestors, this bicephalous serpent bar represents a conduit between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead.” [http://www.webwizzard.com/anahuac/cat003.html]

==Maya jewelry and pottery==
A piece of Maya jewelry depicts an “[[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], bicephalous serpent.” It is believed to have been worn during a bloodletting ceremony. It clearly shows the arrival of an ancestor from the spirit realm.

The portrayal of the Vision Serpent was very prevalent in Maya pottery. Vessels used during bloodletting ceremonies, depict the Vision serpent. The vessels below are excellent examples. They are carved in stone and are “some of the earliest depiction of Vision Serpent [[iconography]]. Blood spews forth from the open jaws of the front head. Although the rear is not physically attached, it sits just above the serpent's tail and also represents blood”.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Miller (1992){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maya architectural motifs==
The Vision Serpent also finds a place in Maya architecture and is especially prominent in the decoration of pillars on the interior and exterior of Maya temples.

”In the palace at [[Labna]], serpents adorn the corners of the principle facade. Characteristic of the Vision Serpent, there appears to be either an anthropomorphic deity or the spirit of an ancestor emanating from the gaping jaws of the serpent's mouth”.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanoff (1973){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary observances==
Remnants of the Vision Serpent have survived until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S. Thompson noted in San Antonio, [[Belize]], that the [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] Maya still performed a ritual very similar to the [[vision quest]] of the classic Maya, although in a different context. The ritual marked the initiation of a new [[shaman]] for the village. The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan). It was through this experience that he completed his initiation rites and gained the knowledge that is needed to become a powerful shaman.

This is usually translated as "[[Great Spirit|The Great Spirit]]". However, according to [[Russell Means]], its meaning is closer to "Great Mystery" as Lakota spirituality is not [[monotheistic]].&lt;ref name="isbn 0-8263-1868-1"&gt;{{cite book |title= Before the great spirit: the many faces of Sioux spirituality |last= Rice |first= Julian |year= 1998 |publisher= University of New Mexico Press |isbn= 0-8263-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before their attempted conversion to Christianity, the Sioux used ''Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka'' to refer to an [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|organization of sacred entities]] whose ways were mysterious: thus, "The Great Mystery".&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Wheeler Bassett]], [[Frederick Starr]].

==Interpretations==
It is interpreted as the power or the sacredness that resides in everything, resembling some [[Animism|animistic]] and [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] beliefs. This term describes every creature and object as ''wakȟáŋ'' ("holy") or having aspects that are ''wakȟáŋ''.&lt;ref name="isbn 0-8263-1868-1" /&gt; The element ''Tanka'' or ''Tȟáŋka'' corresponds to "Great" or "large".

==Cognate terms in other languages==
[[Siouan languages|Siouan]]: Wakan Tanka or '''Wakan''' is also known as '''Wakanda''' in the [[Omaha-Ponca]], Ioway-Otoe-Missouri, Kansa and Osage languages;&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Drury|first=Nevill|title=The Watkins Dictionary of Magic|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FQ52Xjh1_hYC|accessdate=23 February 2018|date=19 December 2011|publisher=Duncan Baird|isbn=1780283628}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Wakatakeh''' in [[Quapaw language|Quapaw]]. In addition, there is [[Winnebago language|Ho-Chunk]] '''Mahanah''', [[Mandan language|Mandan]] '''Omahank''', and [[Tutelo language|Tutelo]] '''Mahomny'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Lakota form ''Wakan Tanka'' in particular has also occasionally been compared to names from more distant cultures:

The name Tangaroa appears to mean "the god on high" : he was the good deity of light (see Rongo) the patron of fair-haired persons, the sky god and food giver, who settled in Raro-tonga leaving the isle of Anau, or Mangaia, which represents the cradle of the Polynesian race and their mythical paradise. Tangaroa sprang from his mother's head, and was symbolised by sacred lingam stones (see Fiji) his color being red. His principal sons were Vaka (or Laka) and Ahu (or Tupo), of whom the first killed the latter, being jealous (as in the story of Kain and Abel) of his goodness and diligence : the myth seems to represent the war of light and darkness, as does that of Tangaroa and Rongo.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TDAV"&gt;Türk Dünyası Araştırmaları Vakfı (Turkish World Research Foundation), Tarih: Türk dünyası tarih ve kültür dergisi, Issues 190-195, 2002, page 5. quote: ''Bu sözün farklı coğrafi bölgelerde nasıl dönüştüğünü gösteren birkaç örnek vermek istiyorum: Buryatlar: Tengeri, Tatarlar: Tingir, Pasifik adalarındaki Polinezyalılar: Tangaroa, Kuzey Amerikan Kızılderililer: Tanka / Tangra.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''winged altarpiece''' (also ''folding altar'') or '''winged retable''' is a special form of [[altarpiece]] ([[reredos]], occasionally [[retable]]), common in Central Europe, in which the fixed [[shrine]] or ''corpus'' can be enclosed by two ([[triptych]]), four ([[pentaptych]]) or more ([[polyptych]]) movable wings. The technical terms are derived from {{lang-grc|τρίς}}: ''trís'' or "triple"; πέντε: ''pénte'' or "five"; πολύς: ''polýs'' or "many"; and πτυχή: ''ptychē'' or "fold, layer".&lt;ref name="GEMOLL"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Wilhelm Gemoll|Title=Griechisch-Deutsches Schul- und Handwörterbuch |Publisher=G. Freytag Verlag/Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky|PublicationPlace=München/Wien|Year=1965|Date=  1965|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the winged altar can display different scenes on weekdays, Sundays or holidays, based on the motifs and type of decoration (painted panels or [[relief]]s), it is also called a liturgical altar. An [[altarpiece]] is often mounted on the altar shrine, but more usually it has a carving (carved altar). Above the retable may be found the crowning or superstructure,  [[pinnacle]]s and flowers of the cross. [[Relic]]s can be housed below it, in a [[reliquary]] in the [[predella]] lying on the [[altar stone]].

His teachings challenged the existing traditions of the [[Indo-Iranians#Religion|Indo-Iranian religion]] and later developed into the religion of [[Zoroastrianism|Mazdayasna or Zoroastrianism]]. He inaugurated a movement that eventually became the dominant religion in [[Ancient Persia]]. He was a native speaker of [[Avestan language|Old Avestan]] and lived in the eastern part of the [[Iranian Plateau]], but his exact birthplace is uncertain.&lt;ref name= "West Birthplace-Surname"&gt;{{harvnb |West |2010 |p= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Boyce|1996 |pp= 3–4}}

There is no scholarly consensus on when he lived.&lt;ref name= "WestDate13"&gt;{{harvnb |West |2013 |pp= 89–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, approximating using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence allows for dating to somewhere in the second millennium BCE. This is done by estimating the period in which the [[Avestan language|Old Avestan language]] (as well as the earlier [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] and [[Proto-Iranian language|Proto-Iranian]] languages and the related [[Vedic Sanskrit]]) were spoken, the period in which the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]] was practiced, and correlation between the burial practice described in the [[Gathas]] with the archeological [[Yaz culture]].

Most of his life is known from these texts.&lt;ref name= "West Birthplace-Surname" /&gt; By any modern standard of historiography, no evidence can place him into a fixed period, and the historicization surrounding him may be a part of a trend from before the 10th century that historicizes legends and myths.{{Sfn |Stausberg |Vevaina|Tessmann |2015 |pp= 60–61}}

==Name and etymology==
Zoroaster's name in his native language, [[Avestan]], was probably ''Zaraϑuštra''. His English name, "Zoroaster", derives from a later (5th century BCE) [[Greek language|Greek]] transcription, ''Zōroastrēs'' ({{lang|grc|Ζωροάστρης}}),&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1977_133_135"&gt;{{harvnb|Schlerath|1977|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; as used in [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]]'s ''[[Xanthus (historian)#Lydiaca|Lydiaca]]'' (Fragment 32) and in [[Plato]]'s ''[[First Alcibiades]]'' (122a1). This form appears subsequently in the Latin ''{{lang|la|Zōroastrēs}}'' and, in later Greek orthographies, as Ζωροάστρις ''Zōroastris''. The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of Avestan ''zaraϑ-'' with the Greek ζωρός ''zōros'' (literally "undiluted") and the Avestan ''-uštra'' with ἄστρον ''astron'' ("[[star]]").

In Avestan, ''Zaraϑuštra'' is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian ''*Zaratuštra-''; The element half of the name (''-uštra-'') is thought to be the Indo-Iranian root for "camel", with the entire name meaning "he who can manage camels".&lt;ref name = "Schmitt_2003"/&gt;{{Ref label|ushtra_camel|a|none}}
Reconstructions from later Iranian languages—particularly from the [[Iranian languages#Middle Iranian languages|Middle Persian]] (300 BCE) ''Zardusht'',{{explain|date=October 2015}} which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian texts—suggest that ''*Zaratuštra-'' might be a [[Indo-European ablaut#Zero grade|zero-grade]] form of ''*Zarantuštra-''.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt_2003"/&gt;
Subject then to whether ''Zaraϑuštra'' derives from ''*Zarantuštra-'' or from ''*Zaratuštra-'', several interpretations have been proposed.{{Ref label|name_contra|b|none}}

If ''Zarantuštra'' is the original form, it may mean
"with old/aging camels",&lt;ref name = "Schmitt_2003"/&gt; related to [[Avestan language|Avestic]] ''zarant-''&lt;ref name = "Schlerath_1977_133_135"/&gt; (''cf.'' [[Pashto]] ''zōṛ'' and [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] ''zœrond'', "old"; Middle Persian ''zāl'', "old"):&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horn, Grundriß der neupersischen Etymologie, Strassburg 1893&lt;/ref&gt;
* "with angry/furious camels": from Avestan ''*zarant-'', "angry, furious".&lt;ref name="Mayrhofer_1977_43_53"&gt;{{harvnb|Mayrhofer|1977|pp=43–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "who is driving camels" or "who is fostering/cherishing camels": related to Avestan ''zarš-'', "to drag".&lt;ref name="Bailey_1953_40_42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|1953|pp=40–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mayrhofer (1977) proposed an etymology of "who is desiring camels" or "longing for camels" and related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''har-'', "to like", and perhaps (though ambiguous) also to Avestan ''zara-''.&lt;ref name = "Mayrhofer_1977_43_53"/&gt;
* "with yellow camels": parallel to younger Avestan ''zairi-''.&lt;ref name="Markwart_1930_7ff"&gt;{{harvnb|Markwart|1930|pp=7ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of the ''-ϑ-'' ({{IPA|/θ/}}) in Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' was for a time itself subjected to heated debate because the ''-ϑ-'' is an irregular development: As a rule, ''*zarat-'' (a first element that ends in a [[dental consonant]]) should have Avestan ''zarat-'' or ''zarat̰-'' as a development from it. Why this is not so for ''zaraϑuštra'' has not yet been determined. Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that Avestan ''zaraϑuštra'' with its ''-ϑ-'' was linguistically an actual form is shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis.&lt;ref name="Schmitt_2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmitt|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All present-day, Iranian-language variants of his name derive from the Middle Iranian variants of ''Zarϑošt'', which, in turn, all reflect Avestan's fricative ''-ϑ-''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In [[Middle Persian]], the name is 𐭦𐭫𐭲𐭥𐭱𐭲 ''Zardu(x)št'',&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;p. 98 http://www.rabbinics.org/pahlavi/MacKenzie-PahlDict.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ''Zarhušt'',&lt;ref&gt;p.384 https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfMMP&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Middle Persian|Manichaean Middle Persian]] ''Zrdrwšt'',&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; in [[Persian language#Early New Persian|Early New Persian]] ''Zardušt'',&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and in modern (New [[Persian language|Persian]]), the name is زرتشت ''Zartosht''.

==Date==
There is no consensus on the dating of Zoroaster, the Avesta gives no direct information about it, while historical sources are conflicting. Some scholars base their date reconstruction on the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]] and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]],&lt;ref name="Boyce Intro"/&gt; and thus it is considered to have been some place in northeastern Iran and some time between 1500 and 500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=3, 189–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|Vevaina|Tessmann|2015|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShahbaziAb"&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=25–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Lincoln|1991|pp=149–150}}: "At present, the majority opinion among scholars probably inclines toward the end of the second millennium or the beginning of the first, although there are still those who hold for a date in the seventh century."&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Mary Boyce]] (who dated Zoroaster to somewhere between 1700–1000 BCE) used linguistic and socio-cultural evidence to place Zoroaster between 1500 and 1000 BCE (or 1200 and 900 BCE).&lt;ref name="West Dating"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShahbaziAb"/&gt; The basis of this theory is primarily proposed on linguistic similarities between the [[Avestan language|Old Avestan language]] of the Zoroastrian [[Gathas]] and the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] of the [[Rigveda]] (c. 1700–1100 BCE), a collection of early Vedic hymns. Both texts are considered to have a common archaic Indo-Iranian origin. The Gathas portray an ancient [[Stone Age|Stone]]-[[Bronze Age#Iranian Plateau|Bronze Age]] bipartite society of warrior-herdsmen and priests (compared to Bronze [[Trifunctional hypothesis|tripartite society]]; some conjecture that it depicts the [[Yaz culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=[[J. P. Mallory]]|author2=[[Douglas Q. Adams]]|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=310–311, 653|isbn=978-1-884964-98-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and thus it is implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could have been composed more than a few centuries apart. These scholars suggest that Zoroaster lived in an isolated tribe or composed the Gathas before the 1200–1000 BCE migration by the Iranians from the steppe to the [[Iranian Plateau]].&lt;ref name="Boyce Background96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|pp=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West Dating"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|2008|p=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortfall of the argument is the vague comparison, and the archaic language of Gathas does not necessarily indicate time difference.&lt;ref name="WestDate13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"/&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; propose a period between 7th and 6th century, for example, c. 650–600 BCE or 559–522 BCE.&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShahbaziAb"/&gt; The latest possible date is the mid 6th century, at the time of [[Achaemenid Empire]]'s [[Darius I]], or his predecessor [[Cyrus the Great]]. This date gains credence mainly on the thesis that certain figures must be based on historical facts,&lt;ref name="ShahbaziAb"/&gt; thus some have related the mythical [[Vishtaspa]] with Darius I's father Vishtaspa (or [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] in Greek) with the account on Zoroaster's life. However, in the Avesta it should not be ignored that Vishtaspa's son became the ruler of the Persian Empire, Darius I would not neglect to include his patron-father in the [[Behistun Inscription]]. A different proposed conclusion is that Darius I's father was named in honor of the Zoroastrian patron, indicating possible Zoroastrian faith by [[Arsames]].&lt;ref name="West 2010 6"&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical scholarship in the 6th to 4th century BCE believed he existed six thousand years before [[Xerxes I]] invasion of Greece in 480 BCE ([[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hermippus]]), which is a possible misunderstanding of the Zoroastrian four cycles of 3000 years i.e. 12,000 years.&lt;ref name="WestDate13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|Vevaina|Tessmann|2015|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=285–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is recorded by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], and variant readings could place it six hundred years before Xerxes I, somewhere before 1000 BCE.&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"/&gt; However, Diogenes also mentions [[Hermodorus|Hermodorus's]] belief that Zoroaster lived five thousand years before the [[Trojan War]], which would mean he lived around 6200 BCE.&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"/&gt; The 10th-century [[Suda]], provides a date of "500 years before [[Plato]]" in the late 10th century BCE.&lt;ref name="WestDate13"/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] cited Eudoxus who also placed his death six thousand years before Plato, c. 6300 BCE.&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"/&gt; Other pseudo-historical constructions are those of [[Aristoxenus]] who recorded Zaratas the [[Chaldea]]ean to have taught [[Pythagoras]] in [[Babylon]],&lt;ref name="WestDate13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuplin2007"/&gt; or lived at the time of mythological [[Ninus]] and [[Semiramis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pliny the Elder, there were two Zoroasters. The first lived thousands of years ago, while the second accompanied Xerxes I in the invasion of Greece in 480 BCE.&lt;ref name="WestDate13"/&gt; Some scholars propose that the chronological calculation for Zoroaster was developed by Persian [[magi]] in the 4th century BCE, and as the early Greeks learned about him from the Achaemenids, this indicates they did not regard him as a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, but as a remote figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later pseudo-historical and Zoroastrian sources (the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', which references a date "258 years before Alexander") place Zoroaster in the 6th century BCE,{{Ref label|name_contra|d|none}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|Vevaina|Tessmann|2015|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with the accounts by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] from 4th century CE. The traditional Zoroastrian date originates in the period immediately following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 330 BCE.&lt;ref name="NigosianDate"/&gt; The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rulers who gained power following Alexander's death instituted an "Age of Alexander" as the new calendrical epoch. This did not appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an "Age of Zoroaster". To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which they accomplished by (erroneous, some even identified Cyrus with Vishtaspa&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;) counting back the length of successive generations, until they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived "258 years before Alexander".&lt;ref name="WestDate13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shahbazi_1977_25_26"&gt;{{harvnb|Shahbazi|1977|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century Arabic and Pahlavi texts of Zoroastrian tradition,{{Ref label|258Masudi|c|none}} like the 10th century [[Al-Masudi]] who cited a prophecy from a lost Avestan book in which Zoroaster foretold the Empire's destruction in three hundred years, but the religion would last for a thousand years.&lt;ref name="West 2010 6"/&gt;

The birthplace of Zoroaster is also unknown, and the language of the Gathas is not similar to the proposed north-western and north-eastern regional dialects of Persia. It is also suggested that he was born in one of the two areas and later lived in the other area.&lt;ref name="NigosianPlace"&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yasna'' 9 and 17 cite the Ditya River in [[Airyanem Vaejah|Airyanem Vaējah]] ([[Middle Persian]] ''Ērān Wēj'') as Zoroaster's home and the scene of his first appearance. The [[Avesta]] (both Old and Younger portions) does not mention the Achaemenids or of any West Iranian tribes such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], or even [[Parthia]]ns. The ''[[Fravashi|Farvardin Yasht]]'' refers to some Iranian peoples that are unknown in the Greek and Achaemenid sources about the 6th and 5th century BCE Eastern Iran. The ''[[Vendidad]]'' contain seventeen regional names, most of which are located in north-eastern and eastern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''Yasna'' 59.18, the ''zaraϑuštrotema'', or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood, is said to reside in 'Ragha' ([[Badakhshan]]).&lt;ref name="West Birthplace-Surname"/&gt; In the 9th- to 12th-century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition, this 'Ragha' and with many other places appear as locations in Western Iran. While the land of Media does not figure at all in the Avesta (the westernmost location noted in scripture is [[Arachosia]]), the ''[[Bundahishn|Būndahišn]]'', or "Primordial Creation," (20.32 and 24.15) puts Ragha in [[Medes|Media]] (medieval [[Ray, Iran|Rai]]). However, in Avestan, Ragha is simply a toponym meaning "plain, hillside."&lt;ref name="Gershevitch_1964_36_37"&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|1964|pp=36–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these indications in [[Middle Persian]] sources that are open to interpretations, there are a number of other sources. The Greek and Latin sources are divided on the birthplace of Zarathustra. There are many Greek accounts of Zarathustra, referred usually as Persian or Perso-Median Zoroaster; [[Ctesias]] located him in [[Bactria]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] placed him among Ariaspai (in [[Sistan]]),&lt;ref name="West Birthplace-Surname"/&gt; [[Cephalion (historian)|Cephalion]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] suggest east of [[greater Iran]] whereas [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Origen]] suggest west of Iran as his birthplace.&lt;ref name="NigosianPlace"/&gt; Moreover, they have the suggestion that there has been more than one Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;William Enfield,  Johann Jakob Brucker,  Knud Haakonssen, ''The History of Philosophy from the Earliest Periods: Drawn Up from Brucker's Historia Critica Philosophia'', Published by Thoemmes, 2001, {{ISBN|1-85506-828-1}}, pages: 18, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in post-Islamic sources [[Al-Shahrastani|Shahrastani]] (1086–1153) an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] writer originally from Shahristān, present-day [[Turkmenistan]], proposed that Zoroaster's father was from [[Atropatene]] (also in Medea) and his mother was from [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a serious blow for the various regions who all claimed that Zoroaster originated from ''their'' homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached there.&lt;ref name="cf_Boyce_1975_2_26"&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=2–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cf_Gronke_1993_59_60"&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Gronke|1993|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also Arabic sources of the same period and the same region of historical Persia consider [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] as the birthplace of Zarathustra.&lt;ref name="NigosianPlace"/&gt;

By the late 20th century, most scholars had settled on an origin in eastern [[Greater Iran]]. Gnoli proposed [[Sistan]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Baluchistan]] (though in a much wider scope than the present-day province) as the homeland of Zoroastrianism; Frye voted for [[Bactria]] and [[Chorasmia]];&lt;ref name="Frye_1992_8"&gt;{{harvnb|Frye|1992|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khlopin suggests the Tedzen Delta in present-day [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref name="Khlopin_1992_107_110"&gt;{{harvnb|Khlopin|1992|pp=107–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sarianidi considered the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] region as "the native land of the Zoroastrians and, probably, of Zoroaster himself."&lt;ref name="Sarianidi_1987_54"&gt;{{harvnb|Sarianidi|1987|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyce includes the [[steppe]]s to the west from the [[Volga River|Volga]].&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_1"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval "from Media" hypothesis is no longer taken seriously, and Zaehner has even suggested that this was a Magi-mediated issue to garner legitimacy, but this has been likewise rejected by Gershevitch and others.

The 2005 ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' article on the history of Zoroastrianism summarizes the issue with "while there is general agreement that he did not live in western Iran, attempts to locate him in specific regions of eastern Iran, including Central Asia, remain tentative".&lt;ref name="Malandra_2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Malandra|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Iranianhistory-tekyemoaven.jpg|thumb|life|The rings of the ''[[Fravashi]]''.]]
Zoroaster is recorded as the son of Pourušaspa of the Spitaman or Spitamids (Avestan ''spit'' mean "brilliant" or "white"; some argue that Spitama was a remote progenitor) family,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dugdōw,&lt;ref name="NigosianPlace"/&gt; while his great-grandfather was Haēčataspa. All the names appear appropriate of the nomadic tradition, as his father's means "possessing gray horses" (with the word ''aspa'' meaning horse), while his mother's is "milkmaid". According to the tradition, he had four brothers, two older and two younger, whose names are given in much later [[Pahlavi literature|Pahlavi]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His training for the priesthood probably started very early, around seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a priest probably around the age of fifteen, and according to the Gathas, he gained knowledge from other teachers and personal experience from traveling when he left his parents at twenty years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of thirty, he experienced a revelation during a spring festival; on the river bank he saw a shining Being, who revealed himself as [[Vohu Manah]] (Good Purpose) and taught him about [[Ahura Mazda]] (Wise Spirit) and five other radiant figures. Zoroaster soon became aware of the existence of two primal Spirits, the second being [[Angra Mainyu]] (Hostile Spirit), with opposing concepts of [[Asha]] (truth) and [[Druj]] (lie). Thus he decided to spend his life teaching people to seek Asha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received further revelations and saw a vision of the seven [[Amesha Spenta]], and his teachings were collected in the [[Gathas]] and the [[Avesta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught about [[free will]],&lt;ref name="Hinnel 1997"&gt;{{Citation|last=Hinnel|first=J|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed the use of the hallucinogenic [[Haoma]] plant in rituals, [[polytheism]], over-ritualising religious ceremonies and animal sacrifices, as well an oppressive class system in Persia which earned him strong opposition among local authorities.&lt;ref name="BBCZoroaster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/history/zoroaster_1.shtml|title=Religions: Zoroaster|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, at the age of about forty-two, he received the patronage of queen Hutaosa and a ruler named [[Vishtaspa]], an early adherent of [[Zoroastrianism]] (possibly from [[Bactria]] according to the [[Shahnameh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1996|pp=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroaster's teaching about individual judgment, [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]], the [[resurrection]] of the body, the [[Last Judgment]], and everlasting life for the reunited soul and body, among other things, became borrowings in the [[Abrahamic religions]], but they lost the context of the original teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tradition, he lived for many years after the Vishtaspa conversion, managed to establish a faithful community,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married three times. His first two wives bore him three sons and three daughters.

==Philosophy==
In the Gathas, Zoroaster sees the human condition as the mental struggle between ''[[aša]]'' (truth) and ''druj'' (lie). The cardinal concept of ''aša''—which is highly nuanced and only vaguely translatable—is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of [[Ahura Mazda]] (who is ''aša''), creation (that is ''aša''), existence (that is ''aša'') and as the condition for free will.

The purpose of humankind, like that of all other creation, is to sustain ''aša''. For humankind, this occurs through active participation in life and the exercise of constructive thoughts, words and deeds.

Elements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their influence on [[Judaism]] and [[Middle Platonism]] and have been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"&gt;{{Citation|title="Philosophy", ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''|author=Blackburn, Simon|year=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the classic Greek philosophers, [[Heraclitus]] is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster's thinking.&lt;ref name="August Gladisch"&gt;{{Citation|title=Herakleitos Und Zoroaster: Eine Historische Untersuchung|author=August Gladisch |year=1859|page=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|250 px|Detail of [[The School of Athens]] by [[Raphael]], 1509, showing Zoroaster (left, with star-studded globe).]]
In 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, S. (2005). p 409, The Oxford dictionary of philosophy. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, H., Frankfort, H. A. G., Wilson, J. A., &amp; Jacobsen, T. (1964). Before Philosophy. Penguin, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Zarathustra's impact lingers today due in part to the system of rational ethics he founded called Mazda-Yasna. The word ''Mazda-Yasna'' is [[Avestan]] and is translated as "Worship of Wisdom" in English. The encyclopedia [[Natural History (Pliny)]] claims that Zoroastrians later educated the Greeks who, starting with [[Pythagoras]], used a similar term, philosophy, or "love of wisdom" to describe the search for ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|title=Pliny Natural History Vol 8; Book XXX|last=Jones|first=W.H.S.|date=1963|website=|publisher=Heinemann|access-date=December 28, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|archivedate=January 1, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoroaster emphasized the freedom of the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept ''[[aša]]'', or arta (the divine order), and shun ''druj'' (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force ''[[aša]]'' or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zarathustra|title=Zarathustra {{!}} Iranian prophet|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islam===

{{further|Daeva|Jinn|Ifrit|Iblis|Angra Mainyu}}

A number of parallels have been drawn between Zoroastrian teachings and Islam. Such parallels include the evident similarities between [[Amesha Spenta]] and the archangel [[Gabriel]], and the mention of [[Thamud]] and the [[Iram of the Pillars]] in the [[Quran]]. These may also indicate the vast influence of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] on the development of either religion.&lt;ref name="Hinnel 1997"/&gt;

The [[Sabaeans]], who believed in [[free will]] coincident with Zoroastrians, are also mentioned in the Quran.&lt;ref name="Hinnel 1997"/&gt;

Accessed on 31 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the Greeks of classical antiquity, [[Islam]]ic tradition understands Zoroaster to be the founding prophet of the Magians (via Aramaic, Arabic ''[[Majus]]'', collective ''Majusya''). The 11th-century Cordoban [[Ibn Hazm]] (Zahiri school) contends that ''Kitabi'' "of the Book" cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander. Citing the authority of the 8th-century [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]], the 9th- and 10th-century Sunni historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] (i.648)&lt;ref name="apud_Büchner_1936_105"&gt;Qtd. in {{harvnb|Büchner|1936|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that Zara&lt;!-- with 'a' --&gt;dusht bin Isfiman (an [[Arabic]] adaptation of "Zarathustra Spitama") was an inhabitant of Israel and a servant of one of the disciples of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]. According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf. [[Elisha]]'s servant [[Gehazi]] in Jewish Scripture).

The apostate Zaradusht then eventually made his way to [[Balkh]] (present day Afghanistan) where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. [[Vishtaspa]]), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians&lt;!--Madjusya--&gt;. Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681–683&lt;ref name="apud_Büchner_1936_105"/&gt;) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been [[Sabians|''Sabi''s]]) to the Magian religion.&lt;ref name="apud_Büchner_1936_105"/&gt;

The 12th-century [[heresiology|heresiographer]] [[al-Shahrastani]] describes the Majusiya into three sects, the ''Kayumarthiya''&lt;!--(an otherwise undocumented sect that&amp;nbsp;– per Sharastani&amp;nbsp;– seems to have had a stronger doctrine of Ahriman's "non-reality")--&gt;, the ''[[Zurvanism|Zurwaniya]]'' and the ''Zaradushtiya'', among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: "They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform." (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5–7. 50–54) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other "People of the Book".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Though the name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: "And We did send apostles before thee: there are some of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee." (40 : 78). Accordingly, the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion. James Darmesteter remarked in the translation of [[Zend Avesta]]: "When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta." (Introduction to Vendidad. p.&amp;nbsp;69.)

'''Shi'a view'''

During the reign of the seventh [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph, [[Al-Ma'mun]], Imam [[Ali al-Ridha]], the great grandson of [[Muhammad]] and a prominent Islamic scholar of his time, was summoned in court to debate with the high priests, scholars, philosophers, and theologians to test his knowledge on religion and jurisprudence. Among the summoned scholars was a Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Ridha questioned the priest on his beliefs saying,“Tell me about Zoroaster, whom you claim is a prophet; what is your evidence for his Prophethood?” to which the response was “We did not see him, but the tales of our ancestors informed us that he had legalized for us what no other person before had made legal.” Imam Al-Ridha responded “This is the case with all other nations. Tales had come to them about what the prophets had accomplished, what [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and Muhammad had all brought them, so why did you not believe in any of these prophets, having believed in Zoroaster, through the tales that came to you about him, informing that he brought forth what others did not?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of Imam Ali Bin Musa Al-Rida|last=Al Qarashi|first=Baqir Sharif|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|year=2001|isbn=978-9644383298|location=Qum|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya view====
[[Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadi Muslims]] view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and describe the expressions of Ahura Mazda, the god of goodness, and Ahraman, the god of evil, as merely referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to exercise free will. [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' views Zoroaster as Prophet of God and describes such the expressions to be a concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_5.html|title=Zoroastrianism|website=www.alislam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Manichaeism===
[[Manichaeism]] considered Zoroaster to be a figure (along with [[Jesus]] and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) in a line of prophets of which [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (216–276) was the culmination.&lt;ref name="Widengren_1961_76"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroaster's ethical dualism is—to an extent—incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil.&lt;ref name="Widengren_1961_43-45"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=43–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Manicheanism also incorporated other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zoroaster's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Widengren_1961_44-45"&gt;{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1972_21"&gt;{{harvnb|Zaehner|1972|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Bahá'í Faith===
Zoroaster appears in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as a "[[Manifestation of God]]", one of a line of prophets who have progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity. Zoroaster thus shares an exalted station with [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Krishna]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], the [[Báb]], and the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="Taherzadeh_1976_3"&gt;{{harvnb|Taherzadeh|1976|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, saw Bahá'u'lláh as the fulfillment of a post-Sassanid Zoroastrian prophecy that saw a return of Sassanid emperor [[Bahram I|Bahram]]:&lt;ref name="Buck_1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shoghi Effendi also stated that Zoroaster lived roughly 1000 years before Jesus.{{Ref label|Effendi_1000BC|e|none}}

Deriving from that image, and reinforcing it, was a "mass of literature" attributed to him and that circulated the [[Mediterranean]] world from the 3rd century BCE to the end of antiquity and beyond.&lt;ref name = "Beck_491"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|2003|loc=para. 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of that literature was predominantly [[Greek language|Greek]], though at one stage or another various parts of it passed through [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[coptic language|Coptic]] or [[Latin]]. Its ethos and cultural matrix was likewise Hellenistic, and "the ascription of literature to sources beyond that political, cultural and temporal framework represents a bid for authority and a fount of legitimizing "alien wisdom". Zoroaster and the magi did not compose it, but their names sanctioned it."&lt;ref name="Beck_491"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=491}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The attributions to "exotic" names (not restricted to magians&lt;!--cf Arnaldo Momigliano /Alien Wisdom/, Cambridge UP, 1975 --&gt;) conferred an "authority of a remote and revelatory wisdom."&lt;ref name="Beck 1991 p=493"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the named works attributed to "Zoroaster" is a treatise ''On Nature'' (''Peri physeos''), which appears to have originally constituted four volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The framework is a retelling of Plato's [[Myth of Er]], with Zoroaster taking the place of the original hero. While [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] imagined [[Pythagoras]] listening to Zoroaster's discourse, ''On Nature'' has the sun in middle position, which was how it was understood in the 3rd century. In contrast, Plato's 4th-century BCE version had the sun in second place above the moon. Ironically, [[Colotes]] accused [[Plato]] of plagiarizing Zoroaster,&lt;ref name="Nock_1929_111"&gt;{{harvnb|Nock|Stuart|Reitzenstein|Schaeder|1929|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingstone_2002_144_145"&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|2002|pp=144–145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] wrote a text titled ''Zoroaster'' based on his perception of "Zoroastrian" philosophy, in order to express his disagreement with Plato on [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Livingstone_2002_147"&gt;{{harvnb|Livingstone|2002|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to substance and content in ''On Nature'' only two facts are known: that it was crammed with astrological speculations, and that [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity (''Ananké'')]] was mentioned by name and that she was in the air.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;!-- 530 --&gt;&lt;!--WHAT IS THIS 530?--&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] names Zoroaster as the inventor of magic (''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' 30.2.3). "However, a principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds." That "dubious honor" went to the "fabulous magus, [[Ostanes]], to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed."&lt;ref name="Beck_2003_para7"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|2003|loc=para. 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny calls him the inventor of magic, the Roman does not provide a "magician's persona" for him.&lt;ref name = "Beck_2003_para7"/&gt; Moreover, the little "magical" teaching that is ascribed to Zoroaster is actually very late, with the very earliest example being from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=522}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Association with astrology according to Roger Beck, were based on his [[Babylon]]ian origin, and Zoroaster's Greek name was identified at first with star-worshiping (''astrothytes'' "star sacrificer") and, with the ''Zo-'', even as the ''living'' star.&lt;ref name="Beck_523"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=523}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=March 2017}} Later, an even more elaborate mythoetymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (''zo-'') flux (''ro-'') of fire from the star (''astr-'') which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him.&lt;ref name="Beck_523" /&gt;{{verification needed|date=March 2017}}

The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was {{anchor|Zaratras}}Zaratras&lt;ref name=PlutarchMoraliaBrenk&gt;{{cite book|author = Brenk, Frederick E. | date = 1977 | title = In Mist Apparelled: Religious Themes in Plutarch's Moralia and Lives, Volumes 48-50 | page = 129 | series = Mnemosyne, bibliotheca classica Batava [Vol. 48: Supplementum] | location = Leiden, NDL | publisher = Brill Archive | isbn = 9004052410 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004052410 | access-date = March 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

While the division along the lines of Zoroaster/astrology and Ostanes/magic is an "oversimplification, the descriptions do at least indicate what the works are ''not''"; they were not expressions of Zoroastrian doctrine, they were not even expressions of what the Greeks and Romans "''imagined'' the doctrines of Zoroastrianism to have been" [emphases in the original].&lt;ref name="Beck 1991 p=493" /&gt; The assembled fragments do not even show noticeable commonality of outlook and teaching among the several authors who wrote under each name.&lt;ref name="Beck_495"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=495}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "...[The lack of commonality, it] must be emphasized, between ''and among'' the several authors who wrote under the name of the former and the several who wrote under the name of the latter."&lt;ref name="Beck_495"/&gt; --&gt;

Almost all Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha is now lost, and of the attested texts—with only one exception—only fragments have survived. Pliny's 2nd- or 3rd-century attribution of "two million lines" to Zoroaster suggest that (even if exaggeration and duplicates are taken into consideration) a formidable pseudepigraphic corpus once existed at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. This corpus can safely be assumed to be pseudepigrapha because no one before Pliny refers to literature by "Zoroaster",&lt;ref name = "Beck_526"/&gt; and on the authority of the 2nd-century [[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]] and from a 6th-century commentator on Aristotle it is known that the acquisition policies of well-endowed royal libraries created a market for fabricating manuscripts of famous and ancient authors.&lt;!-- "This, says Galen, was the origin of much of the spurious literature still in circulation in his day. It cannot of course be proved, but it seems not unlikely that Zoroaster, bearing as fabled and antique a name as one might wish, and moreover never having written any real books against which to test the false, would have been an ideal author for the inventions of these entrepreneurs of the book trade."--&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck_526"&gt;{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=526}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception to the fragmentary evidence (i.e. reiteration of passages in works of other authors) is a complete Coptic [[Tract (literature)|tractate]] titled ''Zostrianos'' (after the first-person narrator) discovered in the [[Nag Hammadi library]] in 1945. A three-line cryptogram in the colophones following the 131-page treatise identify the work as "words of truth of Zostrianos. God of Truth [''logos'']. Words of Zoroaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sieber|1973|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Invoking a "God of Truth" might seem Zoroastrian, but there is otherwise "nothing noticeably Zoroastrian" about the text and "in content, style, ethos and intention, its affinities are entirely with the congeners among the [[Gnostic]] tractates."&lt;ref name="Beck_495"/&gt;

Another work circulating under the name of "Zoroaster" was the ''Asteroskopita'' (or  ''Apotelesmatika''), and which ran to five volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The title and fragments suggest that it was an astrological handbook, "albeit a very varied one, for the making of predictions."&lt;ref name="Beck 1991 p=493"/&gt; A third text attributed to Zoroaster is ''On Virtue of Stones'' (''Peri lithon timion''), of which nothing is known other than its extent (one volume) and that pseudo-Zoroaster ''sang'' it (from which Cumont and Bidez{{who|date=March 2017}} conclude that it was in verse).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} Numerous other fragments preserved in the works of other authors are attributed to "Zoroaster," but the titles of those books are not mentioned.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}}

These pseudepigraphic texts aside, some authors did draw on a few genuinely Zoroastrian ideas. The ''Oracles of Hystaspes'', by "[[Vishtaspa|Hystaspes]]", another prominent magian pseudo-author, is a set of prophecies distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real Zoroastrian sources.&lt;ref name="Beck 1991 p=493"/&gt; Some allusions are more difficult to assess:{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} in the same text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster,{{clarify|date=March 2017}} Pliny states that Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} although in an earlier place, Pliny had sworn in the name of [[Hercules]] that no child had ever done so before the 40th day from his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, VII, I.{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of Zoroaster's laughter (like that of "two million verses"{{cite quote|date=March 2017}}) also appears in the 9th– to 11th-century texts of genuine Zoroastrian tradition, and for a time it was assumed{{weasel inline|date=March 2017}} that the origin of those myths lay with indigenous sources.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} Pliny also records that Zoroaster's head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid upon it, a presage of his future wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, VII, XV.{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranians were however just as familiar with the Greek writers, and the provenance of other descriptions are clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} For instance, Plutarch's description of its dualistic theologies reads thus: "Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the siege of Troy. He used to call the one [[Ahura Mazda|Horomazes]] and the other [[Angra Mainyu|Areimanius]]".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's ''Isis and Osiris'', 46–7.{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoroaster was known as a sage, magician, and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Although almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late 18th century, his name was already associated with lost ancient wisdom.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Statements by Sir [[Thomas Browne]] as early as 1643 are the earliest recorded references to Zoroaster in the English language.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]] promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational [[Deism]], preferable to [[Christianity]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Zoroaster was the subject of the 1749 opera, ''[[Zoroastre]]'', by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. With the translation of the [[Avesta]] by [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Abraham Anquetil-Duperron]], Western scholarship of Zoroastrianism began.{{according to whom|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s novel ''[[:de:Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober|Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober]]'' (1819), the mage Prosper Alpanus states that Professor Zoroaster was his teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelhaldane.com/kleinzaches.htm |title=Klein Zaches Genannt Zinnober |publisher=Michaelhaldane.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his seminal work ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra)]]'' (1885) the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] uses the native Iranian name Zarathustra which has a significant meaning{{Ref label|Ashouri_2003|f|none}} as he had used the familiar Greek-Latin name in his earlier works.&lt;ref name="eiashouri"&gt;{{harvnb|Ashouri|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Nietzsche invents a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against [[morality]].{{Ref label|nieztsche|g|none}} [[Richard Strauss]]'s Opus 30, inspired by Nietzsche's book, is also called ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]''.{{when|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Iconography==
Although a few recent depictions of Zoroaster show the prophet performing some deed of legend, in general the portrayals merely present him in [[White clothing (religious)|white vestments]] (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a ''[[barsom|baresman]]'' (Avestan; [[Middle Persian]] ''barsom''), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the [[Avesta]]. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the ''varza''—usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head—that priests carry in their installation ceremony&lt;!-- the bares*num*--&gt;. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to make a point.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Zoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Stausberg_2002_I58"&gt;{{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=I.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common variant of the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this depiction at [[Taq-e Bostan]], a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of [[Ardashir I]] or [[Ardashir II|II]]. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a ''baresman'' in hand and with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|gloriole]] around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly thought to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of [[Mithra]]. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 [[The School of Athens]]. In it, Zoroaster and [[Ptolemy]] are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
