'''Adarsana''' refers to the real non-seeing of objects which already exist; it refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things. This term figures prominently in the [[Yoga]] school of thought, and in [[Jain philosophy]].

==Meaning==
'''Adarsana''' or ''adarshan'' in [[Sanskrit]] as an adjective means latent or invisible, and as a noun it means non-vision, disregard, non-appearance, neglect, latent condition disappearance, not-seeing. It also means ''agyan'' and ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]''. Vaidyanath Shastri citing Sl. 2.25 and Sl. 3.55 of Vyasa Bhashya writes that by understanding the non-seeing of objects that exist one understands the seeing of those objects and comes to know about the reality of them. ''Darsana'' means seeing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasana-tattva-viveka|author=Vaidyanath Shastri|publisher=Urmila Devi Shastri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb0MAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;dq=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-wdIUfb0MIrUrQeoroHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Pāṇini|Panini]], in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] (Sutra 1.1.60 and 61), has given its meaning as - disappearance, invisibility, elision of an object, which fact is denoted by ''luk'', ''shlu'' and ''lup''; ''lup'' refers to real non-seeing which already exists. In other words, Adarsana refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtadhyayi of Panini|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSDakY97XckC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ARtIUZaNDIaNrgfb_4HADg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ayurveda]], the term, ''adarsana'', means visual errors and blindness that results in not seeing the objects that already exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ayurveda Kriya Sarira|author=Yogesh Chandra Mishra|publisher=Chaukhmaba Publications|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WvHFWXI2aEC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ARtIUZaNDIaNrgfb_4HADg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Puranas]], ''Adarsana'' is the mind-born mother it is so said because the act of seeing and the act of not seeing or non-seeing is an activity of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bal Ramayan|author=Krishnadutta Bharadwaj|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmqe3AGz5fUC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;lr=&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
The term, ''adarsana'', as a technical term in [[Yoga]] referring to ignorance or absence of knowledge, figures prominently in the discussions pertaining to the ''Sadhanapada'' of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. [[Patanjali]] systemised the [[Yoga]] [[philosophy]] or Yoga- darsana propounded by Acarya [[Hiranyagarbha]] which is the practical application of [[Samkhya]] principles earlier systemised through twenty two sutras by [[Kapila]]. ''Vyasa-bhasya'' which is Vyasa’s commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali has been commented upon by [[Vachaspati Misra]] and Vigyanabhikshu. Vyasa states that liberation consists precisely in the cessation of the mind which cessation occurs by the disappearance of the cause of misconception or ''adarsana'' while adding that correct vision of reality ([[darsana]]) stops or sublates misconception which is the cause of bondage. Vyasa explains that ''adarsana'' is the particular conjunction of ''avidya'' in relation to the inward individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Silence Unheard|author=Yohanan Grinspon|publisher=SUNY Press|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1EQrFx0zCIC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa in his commentary on Sadhanapada of Yoga Sutras elaborately discusses and explains the concept of adarsana. Therefore, ''Adarsana'' or wrong conception or contrary knowledge is that contact of the [[Purusa]] with the [[Guna]]s in which the ''Gunas'' serve as objects of ''Purusa''. The modification of the mind in the shape of experience of pleasure and pain is ''adarsana''. ''Adarsana'' ceases on attainment of discriminative knowledge that gradually leads to ''[[Kaivalya]]'' or liberation. It is also known as the power which manifests as knowing (''darsana''), or as the characteristic of both the knower (''Purusa'') and the knowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Darsana of Patanjali|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyB4NbDYQ18C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application as per Yoga School of thought==
The Yoga School of [[Hindu]] Philosophy considers ''Adarsana'' as the sway i.e. proneness to ''Gunas'', which sway lasts till the ''Gunas'' are activeand that it is non-production of the primary mind. The primary mind is that which ceases to function after presenting the objects of experience and discernment to the owner, the Seer. The mind that ceases to function when right knowledge and aversion to objects of enjoyment through renunciation takes place is the primary mind. This school of thought also views ''Adarsana'' as the existence of experience and liberation in a latent state as the latency of ''Avidya'' or wrong knowledge or want of discrimination which is the cause of alliance of ''[[Buddhi]]'' and ''[[Purusa]]'' and its co-existing ''adarsana''.  ''Adarsana'' is ''[[Pradhana]]'' which has a dual nature i.e. it is static and also fluctuating and it is the cognitive faculty because ''Pradhana'' has the tendency to fluctuate and which tendency is stored as potential energy, ''adarsana''. Thus, this school considers ''Adarsana'' to be the characteristic of both ''Pradhana'' and ''Purusa'' as a particular form of cognition, as all knowledge except discriminatory knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali|publisher= SUNY Press|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ndiC9MpMYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa in his commentary on [[Yoga Sutra]] II.23 tells us that ''adarsana'' is the failure to see or ignorance (''avidya''). Patanjali in his ''Yoga Sutra'' II.24 does explain that the cause of identification (''samyoga'') of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the experiencer, with ''[[Prakrti]]'', the object of experience, i.e. bondage, is ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana|author=Ian Wicher|publisher=SUNY Press|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''adarsana'' ceases, the alliance of ''[[Buddhi]]'' and ''[[Purusa]]'' that causes misery ceases and there is complete cessation of bondage for all time, the state of aloofness of ''Purusa'' and non-occurrence of future contact with the ''Gunas'' ensues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali|publisher= SUNY Press|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ndiC9MpMYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view==
But, [[Dharmakirti]], the [[Buddhist]] philosopher, states that pervasion cannot be founded on the observation of ''[[darsana]]'' (co-presence) or the observation of ''adarsana'' (co-absence) which is the view held also by the [[Caravaka]]s and the [[Jain]]s, because identity and causation are the only acceptable grounds of pervasion, unless two things are related in one of these ways, there can be no necessity and no pervasion, and non-difference implies essential identity in spite of the difference in cognitive contents of the two expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Definition and Induction|author=Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0reCO392BAC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxtJUYPUB8rhrAeD5YC4DQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain belief==

In [[Jainism]], the term, ''adarsana'', indicates the condition of mental unease and the suffering of loss of faith resulting from the failure in achieving the desired highest goal after long ''[[sadhana]]'', ''[[tapas]]'' etc., which negative feeling does not affect one who has transcended anger, violence, jealousy, waywardness, bad or evil intentions, untruth, and who is disciplined and adopting the ''Brahmacharya Dharma'' has forsaken his household or family-life, all desires for possession of things and readily donates whatever is possessed by him. The overcoming of this negative feeling is called ''Adarsana-vijay''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pracheen Bharatiya Dharm Evam Darshan|author=Shivswaroop Sahay|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQXqEUyr6t4C&amp;pg=PT199&amp;dq=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-wdIUfb0MIrUrQeoroHoCQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other application==
According to [[Baudhayana]], [[Aryavarta]] lies west of Kalakavana, east of Adarsana, south of the [[Himalayas]] and north of the [[Vindhyas]]. Dharamsutra II.2.16 speaks of ''Vinasana'' as Adarsana, the western boundary of Aryavarta &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Ancient Geography Vol. 1|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43Fzt-G_-XYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhlJUcahDcWPrgebuIGgCA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

[[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] defines '''''arhat''''' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pali]]: '''''arahant''''') as one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Arhat (Buddhism)'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=67}} Other Buddhist traditions have used the term for people far advanced along the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|path of Enlightenment]], but who may not have reached full [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102}}

The understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries, and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions. A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]]. The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], [[Kāśyapīya]], [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Ekavyāvahārika]], [[Lokottaravāda]], [[Bahuśrutīya]], [[Prajñaptivāda]], and [[Caitika]] schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra''. 2008. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist teachings]] urge followers to take up the path of a [[bodhisattva]], and to not fall back to the level of arhats and [[śrāvaka]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"/&gt; The arhats, or at least the senior arhats, came to be widely regarded{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as "moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way".{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102}}

Mahayana Buddhism regarded a group of [[Eighteen Arhats]] (with names and personalities) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as [[Maitreya]], and other groupings of 6, 8, [[Sixteen Arhats|16]], 100, and 500 also appear in tradition and [[Buddhist art]], especially in East Asia.{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102-119}} They can be seen as the Buddhist equivalents of the Christian saints, [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] or early disciples and [[leader]]s of the faith.{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102-119}}

==Etymology and translations==
[[File:Gohyaku rakan.jpg|thumb|''Gohyaku rakan'' - five hundred statues depicting arhats, at the Chōkei temple in Toyama]]

===Etymology===
Pāḷi ''arahant'' is a present participle coming from the verbal root √arh "to deserve",&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, D. W. ''Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language''&lt;/ref&gt; cf. ''arha'' "meriting, deserving"; ''arhaṇa'' "having a claim, being entitled"; ''arhita'' (past participle) "honoured, worshipped".&lt;ref&gt;''Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used in the ''Ṛgveda'' with this sense of "deserving".&lt;ref&gt;RV 1.4.47, 2.5.51&lt;/ref&gt;

A common folk etymology derives the word from ''ari'' (enemy) and ''hanta'' from the root √'''''han''''' (cf: Hunter) "to strike, to kill"; hence the translation "foe-destroyer". Professor Richard Gombrich has argued that the present participle is "jarring" and seems out of place when there is an adjective from the same root (''arha''). Since Jains used two Prakrit forms of the word ''arahanta'' and ''arihanta'', the folk etymology may well be the correct etymology. Gombrich argues that this stems from the same metaphor as the Jain title ''jina'' "conqueror", whence ''jaina'' "related to the conqueror", i.e. Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gombrich, 2009, ''What the Buddha Thought'', Equinox: London, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===
The term ''arhat'' is often rendered in English as ''arahat''.

The term ''arhat'' was transliterated into some East Asian languages phonetically, for example, the Chinese ''āluóhàn'' (Ch. 阿羅漢), often shortened to simply ''luóhàn'' (Ch. 羅漢).  This may appear in English as ''luohan'' or ''lohan''.  In Japanese the pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is ''rakan'' (Ja. 羅漢) or ''arakan'' (Ja. 阿羅漢).

The [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] term for ''arhat'' was translated by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, ''dgra bcom pa'', means "one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions".&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel. ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School''. Snow Lion Publications. 1998. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Tibetan translators also understood the meaning of ''arhat'' to be ''ari-hanta''.

==Attainments==
A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]].  The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as being imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect believed that "the Buddha and those of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|Two Vehicles]], although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths."&lt;ref&gt;《異部宗輪論述記》：謂佛雖在僧中所攝，然別施佛果大，非僧（果大）。於窣堵波興供養業獲廣大果。佛與二乘解脫雖一，而聖道異。無諸外道能得五通。阿羅漢身皆是無漏。餘義多同大眾部執。&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mahīśāsaka]] and the [[Theravada]] regarded arhats and buddhas as being similar to one another. The 5th century Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] regarded arhats as having completed the path to enlightenment.{{refn|group=note|Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism: "When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Prebish and [[Damien Keown]] (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', pp 36&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the [[Pāli Canon]] portrays the Buddha declaring himself to be an arahant.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''Arahants, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Buddha is the first of the arahants, while those who reach the goal by following his path also become arahants. In the verse of homage to the Buddha, it is said: "Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ... — The Blessed One is an arahant..." Shortly after his enlightenment, while walking to Benares to meet the five monks, a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he was. The Buddha replied: "I am the arahant in the world, I am the supreme teacher" (MN 26/I 171). So the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahant."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''nirvāṇa'' is "the ultimate goal", and one who has attained nirvana has attained arahantship:{{refn|group=note|"From the perspective of the Nikāyas, the ultimate goal – the goal in strict doctrinal terms – is nirvāṇa, and the goal in human terms is arahantship, the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present life."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} Bhikkhu Bodhi writes, "The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;

The Mahayana discerned a hierarchy of attainments, with ''samyaksambuddha''s at the top, [[mahāsattva]]s below that, [[pratyekabuddha]]s below that and arhats further below.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; "But what was it that distinguished the ''bodhisattva'' from the ''sravaka'', and ultimately the ''buddha'' from the ''arhat''? The difference lay, more than anywhere else, in the altruistic orientation of the ''bodhisattva''."{{sfn|prebish|Keown|2004|page=88}}

==Meaning of Arhat==
===In the early Buddhist schools===
In pre-Buddhist India, the term arhat, denoting a saintly person in general, was closely associated with miraculous power and asceticism. The Buddhists drew a sharp distinction between their Arhat and Indian holy men in general, in Buddhism these miraculous powers were no longer central to arhat identity or to his mission.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kieckhefer, George D. Bond. "Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions" 1988. pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of views on the relative perfection of arhats existed amongst the early Buddhist schools. In general, Mahāsāṃghikas such as the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins,&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"/&gt; Bahuśrutīyins,&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture''. 2005. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Prajñaptivādins, and Caitikas&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt; schools, advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Caitikas, for example, advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva (''bodhisattvayāna'') over that of the arhat (''[[śrāvakayāna]]''), and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance.&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt;

According to [[A.K. Warder]], the Sarvāstivādins held the same position as the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarding arhats, considering them to be imperfect and fallible.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt; In the Sarvāstivādin ''Nāgadatta Sūtra'', the demon [[Mara (demon)|Māra]] takes the form of Nāgadatta's father, and tries to convince Nāgadatta, who was a [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī,]] to work toward the lower stage of arhatship rather than striving to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksaṃbuddha).
{{quote|Māra therefore took the disguise of Nāgadatta's father and said thus to Nāgadatta: "Your thought is too serious. [[Buddhahood]] is too difficult to attain. It takes a hundred thousand nayutas of [[crore|koṭi]]s of [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]s to become a Buddha. Since few people attain Buddhahood in this world, why don't you attain Arhatship? For the experience of Arhatship is the same as that of [[nirvana|nirvāṇa]]; moreover, it is easy to attain Arhatship.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109"&gt;Kalupahana, David. ''Buddhist Thought and Ritual''. 2001. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In her reply, Nāgadatta rejects arhatship as a lower path, saying, "A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior."&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109"/&gt;

The Kāśyapīya school also held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt; The Kāśyapīyins believed that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their "perfection" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt;

===In Theravāda Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, an arahant is a person who has eliminated all the unwholesome roots which underlie [[Samyojana|the fetters]] – who upon their death will not be reborn in any world, since the bonds (fetters) that bind a person to the [[samsara]] have been finally dissolved. In the [[Pali Canon]], the word ''[[tathagata]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for arahant, though the former usually refers to the Buddha alone.{{refn|group=note|Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind''. Curzon Press 1995, p. 227: {{quote|Before focusing on key passages on the tathagata, it is first necessary to clarify which persons the word refers to. The Buddha often used it when talking of himself as an enlightened being, rather than as the individual Gotama. In general, "tathagata" is used specifically of the Buddha, the one who discovers and proclaims the path to nibbana (A.II.8–9, S.III.65-6), with the "tathagata, Arahat, perfectly and completely enlighteneed one" being contrasted with a "disciple of the tathagata" (D.II.142). Nevertheless, "tathagata" is sometimes used of any Arahat. S.V.327, for example, discusses the "dwelling of a learner" and that of a tathagata, and explains the second by describing the qualities of an Arahat. At M.I.139–140 and 486-7, moreover, there is a switching between talk of a "tathagata" and of "a monk whose mind is freed thus", as if they were simple equivalents. Tathagata literally means "thus-gone" or "thus-come", probably meaning one who is "attained-to-truth" or "whose-nature-is-from-truth".}}}}

After attainment of Nibbana, the [[five aggregates]] (physical forms, feelings/sensations, perception, mental formations and consciousness) will continue to function, sustained by physical bodily vitality. This attainment is termed ''the nibbana element with a residue remaining''.  But once the Arahant pass-away and with the disintegration of the physical body, the five aggregates will cease to function, hence ending all traces of existence in the phenomenal world and thus total release from the misery of samsara. It would then be termed ''the nibbana element without residue remaining''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=16 March 2009|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330082958/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html| archivedate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parinibbana occurs at the death of an Arahant.

In Theravada Buddhism the Buddha himself is first identified as an arahant, as are his enlightened followers, because they are free from all defilements, without greed, [[hatred]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|ignorance]] and [[tanha|craving]]. Lacking "assets" which will lead to future birth, the arahant knows and sees the real here and now. This virtue shows stainless purity, true worth, and the accomplishment of the end, [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike/message/17|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of the roles of arahants, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, Nathan Katz writes that, there is a tendency in the Theravāda school to exclude laypeople from the possibility of achieving arahantship.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Natha. ''Buddhist Images of Human Perfection''. 1982. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While in the ''Sutta Piṭaka'', ''arhattā'' was open to all, both in principle and in fact, there was a growing tendency among later Theravāda ''saṅghikas'' to restrict ''arhattā'' to those wearing the robe. Earlier we indicated a ''Milindapañha'' verse which held that while ''arhattā'' might be attainable by a layperson, within one day of its attainment he would have to either enter the ''saṅgha'' or die.}}

In the Pali canon, [[Ananda|Ānanda]] states that he knows [[bhikkhu|monastics]] to achieve nibbana in one of four ways:{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Ānanda's teaching on achieving arhantship can be found in [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.170.  Translations for this sutta can be found in Bodhi (2005) pp. 268–9, 439, and Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bodhi (2005), p. 268, translates this fourth way as: "a monk's mind is seized by agitation about the teaching."  Thanissaro (1998) gives a seemingly contrary interpretation of: "a monk's mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma [Comm: the corruptions of insight] well under control."  Thus, it appears possible to interpret the excitation (Pali: ''uddhacca'', see [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3582.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921–25]) as either something that the future arahant uses to ''impel'' their pursuit of the path or something that the future arahant ''controls'' in order to pursue the path.}}

* one develops [[Vipassana|insight]] preceded by [[Samatha|serenity]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|samatha-pubbaṇgamaṃ vipassanaṃ}}''),
* one develops serenity preceded by insight (''{{IAST|vipassanā-pubbaṇgamaṃ samathaṃ}}''),
* one develops serenity and insight in a stepwise fashion (''{{IAST|samatha-vipassanaṃ yuganaddhaṃ}}''),
* one's mind becomes seized by excitation about the [[dhamma]] and, as a consequence, develops serenity and abandons the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s (''{{IAST|dhamma-uddhacca-viggahitaṃ mānasaṃ hoti}}'').

For those that have destroyed greed and hatred (in the sensory context) with some residue of delusion, are called ''[[anagami]]'' (non-returner). Anagamis will not be reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the [[Pure Abodes]], where only anagamis live. There, they will attain full enlightenment.

The Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of the path to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Keown and Prebish (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p. 36: "When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha."}}

===In Mahāyāna Buddhism===
[[File:Luóhàn at British Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], around 1000, one of a famous [[Yixian glazed pottery luohans|Group of glazed pottery luohans from Yixian]]]]

Mahayana Buddhists see Gautama Buddha himself as the ideal towards which one should aim in one's spiritual aspirations. A hierarchy of general attainments is envisioned with the attainments of arhats and pratyekabuddhas being clearly separate and below that of samyaksambuddha or [[tathāgata]]s such as Gautama Buddha.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the goal of becoming a fully enlightened buddha, the path of a śrāvaka in being motivated by seeking personal liberation from saṃsāra is often portrayed as selfish and undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. Sarup &amp; Son. 2008. p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; There are even some Mahāyāna texts that regard the aspiration to arhatship and personal liberation as an outside path.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of aspiring for arhatship, Mahayanins are urged to instead take up the path of the bodhisattva and to not fall back to the level of arhats and śrāvakas.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"/&gt; Therefore, it is taught that an arhat must go on to become a bodhisattva eventually. If they fail to do so in the lifetime in which they reach the attainment, they will fall into a deep [[samadhi|samādhi]] of emptiness, thence to be roused and taught the bodhisattva path, presumably when ready. According to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', any true arhat will eventually accept the Mahāyāna path.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahāyāna teachings often consider the śrāvaka path to be motivated by fear of saṃsāra, which renders them incapable of aspiring to buddhahood, and that they therefore lack the courage and wisdom of a bodhisattva.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Novice bodhisattvas are compared to śrāvakas and arhats at times. In the ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'', there is an account of sixty novice bodhisattvas who attain arhatship despite themselves and their efforts at the bodhisattva path because they lacked the abilities of [[prajnaparamita]] and [[skillful means]] to progress as bodhisattvas toward complete enlightenment (Skt. ''{{IAST|Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi}}''). This is because they are still viewed as having innate attachment and fear of saṃsāra. The ''[[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81 Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}]]'' compares these people to a giant bird without wings that cannot help but plummet to the earth from the top of [[Sumeru]].&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"/&gt;

Mahayan Buddhism has viewed the śrāvaka path culminating in arhatship as a lesser accomplishment than complete enlightenment, but still accords due respect to arhats for their respective achievements. Therefore, buddha-realms are depicted as populated by both śrāvakas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"/&gt; Far from being completely disregarded, the accomplishments of arhats are viewed as impressive, essentially because they have transcended the mundane world.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John. ''A Concise Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism''. Snow Lion Publications. 2008. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese Buddhism]] and other East Asian traditions have historically accepted this perspective, and specific groups of arhats are venerated as well, such as the [[Sixteen Arhats]], the [[Eighteen Arhats]], and the Five Hundred Arhats.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, Denise. ''The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History and Meaning''. Shambhala. 2009. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The first famous portraits of these arhats were painted by the Chinese monk [[Guanxiu]] ({{zh|c=貫休|p=''Guànxiū''}}) in 891 CE. He donated these portraits to Shengyin Temple in Qiantang (modern [[Hangzhou]]), where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect.&lt;ref name="Early Text Painting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Texts on Painting|author=Susan Bush and Ilsio-yen Shih|publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|year=1985|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, the path to arhatship and the path to complete enlightenment are seen as having common grounds. However, a distinctive difference is seen in the Mahāyāna doctrine pushing emotional and cognitive non-attachment to their logical consequences. Of this, Paul Williams writes that in Mahāyāna Buddhism, "Nirvāṇa must be sought without being sought (for oneself), and practice must be done without being practiced. The discursive mode of thinking cannot serve the basic purpose of attainment without attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''autonomous building''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, [[gas grid]], municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and in some cases, [[public road]]s.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced [[environmental impact]]s, increased security, and lower [[costs of ownership]]. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)

Most of the research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.

British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] have said that, as of 2002, &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a "house with no bills" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vale |first= Brenda and Robert |authorlink= Brenda and Robert Vale |title= The New Autonomous House|year= 2000|publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|location= London |isbn=0-500-34176-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
In the 1970s, a group of activists and engineers calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of "[[bioshelter]]" projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the "New Alchemy Institute".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html "New Alchemy Institute"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818015757/http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html |date=2006-08-18 }} (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.

[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an [[Earthship]], featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]

The 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berm]]s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].

1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.

==Advantages==

As an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.

Autonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.

Autonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.

An autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.

==Disadvantages==

First and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.

Living within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.

An autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.

[[Brenda and Robert Vale|The Vales]], among others, have shown that living off-grid can be a practical, logical lifestyle choice&amp;mdash;under certain conditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Systems==
This section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.

===Water===
[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic [[rainwater harvesting]] system]]
[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]

There are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.

[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.

The classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.

However drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.

In regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use [[rainwater harvesting]], with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/ WHO | Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.

In many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155419/http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a "roof cleaner" tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[water chlorination|chlorinated]], though [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.

In the classic Roman house ("Domus"), household water was provided from a cistern (the "impluvium"), that was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward facing roof-opening (the "compluvium"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jefferey|title=The Roman House (Domus)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/roman-domestic-architecture-domus|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vitruvius|translator-last1=Morgan|translator-first1=Morris Hickey|title=The Ten Books of Architecture|date=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=6.3|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Vitruvius__the_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.

Reducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.

It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.

[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).

New technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.

===Sewage===
{{see also|Anaerobic digestion}}
====Resource====

[[Image:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]
[[Composting toilet]]s use bacteria to decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste.  Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of "[[humanure]]" for growing food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is microbial and viral contamination.  In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months.  To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[composting toilet]] for references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free [[reclaimed water]] can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].

Electric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.

[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission.

A big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.

Another method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.

====Waste====

Sewage handling is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.

The standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.

Septic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|vacuum truck]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.

However, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.

Composting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.

Incinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.

Traditional methods of sewage handling include [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.

===Storm drains===

Drainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.

Typically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.

Autonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:

If a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.&lt;ref&gt;Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], "Natural Capitalism," ch. 5, pp83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett&lt;/ref&gt; One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.

A [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.

===Electricity===
[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof in Manchester, UK]]
[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]

{{Further|Zero emissions|Zero-energy building}}Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. [[LED light]]s, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sunfrost rates {{convert|15|cuft|L|abbr=on}}. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic brand (formerly Servel brand) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.

Using a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.

However, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, [[wind turbine|wind generator]]s can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.

The main advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.&lt;ref name="Gipe"&gt;Paul Gipe, "Wind Power for Home and Business"&lt;/ref&gt;

During times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).&lt;ref name="Gipe"/&gt;

A grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single-wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).

In areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a "[[regenerative fuel cell]]", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.

[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.

[[Microbial fuel cell]]s and [[thermoelectric generator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biolite Portable Stoves|url=https://www.bioliteenergy.com/collections/stoves|website=bioliteenergy.com|publisher=Biolite|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firebee:Charge your USB Device!|url=http://firebeecharger.com/|website=firebeecharger.com|publisher=Firebee|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.

===Heating===
[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]

Most autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].

[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.

The basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.

A recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system "[[Annualized geo solar]] heating" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;Stephens, Don. September 2005. [http://www.greenershelter.com/TokyoPaper.pdf "'Annualized Geo-Solar Heating' as a Sustainable Residential-scale Solution for Temperate Climates iwht Less than Ideal Daily Heating Season Solar Availability."] ("Requested Paper for the Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, Tokyo, Japan"). Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.

In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.

A more modest "daily solar" design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.

In all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.

[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Stephens"/&gt; in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.

Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.

An increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813123637/http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf |date=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.

Electric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.

===Water heating===

{{Further|Solar hot water}}

[[Hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water.  They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.

Current practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a [[water heater#Tankless heaters|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.

[[Solar water heater]]s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.

The basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.

[[Cogeneration]] systems produce hot water from [[waste heat]].  They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.

Heat recycling, [[cogeneration]] and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.
Some authorities advocate replacing [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] with [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.

===Cooling===

Annualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.

Less dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.

Another trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a [[whole-house fan]] and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.

If a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the "dome effect."  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 °C}} ({{nowrap|15 °F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.

Refrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an "[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.

Cogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].

A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's [[diesel exhaust]] was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.

A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50&amp;nbsp;°F (28&amp;nbsp;°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.

If enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].

===Food production===

Food production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;[http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217004825/http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html |date=February 17, 2010 }}. Retrieved 2010-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

possibly requiring the use of organic farming and [[aeroponics]]. Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include [[urban agriculture|urban gardening]] (indoors and outdoors). [[Grow house|Indoor cultivation]] may be set up using [[hydroponics]], while outdoor cultivation may be done using [[permaculture]], [[forest gardening]], [[no-till farming]], and [[do nothing farming]].

[[Greenhouse]]s are also sometimes included.&lt;ref name="publications"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The PEI Ark was a greenhouse with fishponds and living quarters.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are also outfitted with irrigation systems or [[heat sink]]-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down).&lt;ref name="publications"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The PEI Ark used its fishponds as both thermal mass and water storage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Balangiga bells''' are three [[church bells]] taken by the [[United States Army]] from the town church of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] in the [[Philippines]] as [[war trophies]] after reprisals following the [[Balangiga massacre]] in 1901 during the [[Philippine-American War]]. One church bell is in the possession of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Camp Red Cloud]], their base in [[South Korea]],&lt;ref name="nene"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Voluntary Return of One Balangiga Bell by US Seen |url=http://www.nenepimentel.org/news/20031002_Balangiga.asp |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517125827/http://www.nenepimentel.org/news/20031002_Balangiga.asp |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solving"&gt;{{cite web | last =Borrinaga | first =Rolando | title =Solving the Balangiga bell puzzle | url=http://www.geocities.com/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html | accessdate = 2008-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022080959/http://geocities.com/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while two others are on a former base of the [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|11th Infantry Regiment]] at [[F.

The recovery of the bells had been sought by various individuals representing the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines]], the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] and the residents of Balangiga since the late 1950s. These efforts however, have been met with frustration until recently. As of November 2018, all three church bells are in the process of being repatriated back to the Philippines from the United States and South Korea.&lt;ref name=chua/&gt;

==Balangiga massacre==
{{Main|Balangiga massacre}}
On September 28, 1901, Filipino militants from the village of Balangiga ambushed Company C of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]], while they were at breakfast, killing an estimated 48 and wounding 22 of the 78 men of the unit, with only four escaping unhurt. The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition. An estimated 20 to 25 of the villagers had died in the fighting, with a similar number of wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bautista |first=Veltisezar |title=The Balangiga, Samar, Massacre |url=http://www.filipinoamericans.net/balangiga_massacre.shtml |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226150445/http://www.filipinoamericans.net/balangiga_massacre.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reprisal, General [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered that Samar be turned into a "howling wilderness" and that any Filipino male above ten years of age capable of bearing arms be shot. From the burned-out Catholic town church, the Americans looted three bells which they took back to the United States as [[war booty]]. The [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]], however, maintains that the single bell in their possession was presented to the regiment by villagers when the unit left Balangiga on April 9, 1902.&lt;ref name="robson"&gt;{{cite news | last =Robson | first =Seth | title =Book casts doubt on bell's history | pages = | publisher =[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] | date = 2004-07-07 |

Waller was acquitted of the charges. Smith was found guilty, admonished and retired from service, but charges were dropped shortly after. He was later hailed as a war hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Philippine Insurrection, 1899-1902: A Working Bibliography | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/p/pi2.asc|website=Ibiblio.org | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bells==
After Balangiga became a separate parish on September 27, 1859, the town probably took four years to raise funds to acquire its first church bell. It was cast circa-1863 and bears what was initially believed to be an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[emblem]]; latter sources state that the bells are [[Franciscans|Franciscan]].&lt;ref name=chua/&gt; It has a mouth diameter of {{fraction|31|1|4}} inches and height of 30 inches. It is inscribed with a name, R. San Francisco, who was probably the parish priest at that time.&lt;ref name=solving1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html|title=Solving the Balangiga bell puzzle|work=Banner article in the INQUIRER Visayas section, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Aug. 11, 2001, p.

Banner article in the INQUIRER Visayas section, Philippine Daily Inquirer, August 11, 2001, p. A14.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town may have acquired its second bell, cast circa-1889 and having a mouth diameter of {{fraction|27|3|4}} inches and height of {{fraction|27|1|2}} inches, in 1889 through the initiative of Fr. Agustin Delgado, whose name is inscribed on the bell.&lt;ref name=solving1 /&gt;

The third and smallest bell may have been acquired in 1895, through the initiative of Fr. Bernardo Aparecio. This is the bell now kept by the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]] in [[Camp Red Cloud]], [[South Korea]]. Estimates of its size deduce a 23–24 inch height and a mouth diameter of about 20 inches. It bears the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] emblem.&lt;ref name="solving"/&gt;

===Removal to the United States===
After the Balangiga incident, the town was recaptured on September 29, 1901 by 55 men of Company G, 9th Infantry. That unit departed the town the same day, and was replaced by 132 men from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment which garrisoned the town until relieved on October 18, 1901. When the 11th Infantry departed, they brought home the [[war trophies]]. These
included two of the bells removed from the burnt-down Balangiga Church, and a [[cannon]] from the plaza in front of the church. The bells were taken because one had been used by the insurgents to signal the attack on Company C, 9th Infantry.&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

The 11th Infantry redeployed to [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D.A. Russell]] in [[Wyoming]], arriving on March 23, 1904. On May 16, 1905, the Cheyenne Daily Leader newspaper reported that the cannon had been mounted on the parade ground near the flagpole along with other relics from the Philippines "...to include the famous bell which gave the signal for the massacre of a whole company. Two large bells three feet tall and a seven-foot cannon were proudly displayed in front of the flagpole on the parade ground of the fort".&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

A sign was installed over one of the bells that said;
{{quote|This bell hung in the church at Balangiga, Samar, PI, and rung the signal for the attack on Company C, 9th U.S. Infantry, Sept 29 [28], 1901. Taken by Company L, 11th Infantry and detachment of Company K, 11th Infantry, the first units to reach the scene after the massacre.&lt;ref name=annals&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofwyom59121987wyom|title=The F.E. Warren Air Force Base War Trophies from Balangiga, P.I|author=Gerald M. Adams|journal=Annals of Wyoming|volume=59|issue=1|date=Spring 1987|pages=29&amp;ndash;38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The sign above the bell erroneously credited units of the 11th Infantry with being the first to reach Balangiga after the battle. After further research, the sign was changed in 1911 giving proper credit to Company G, 9th Infantry, for recapturing Balangiga.&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

In 1927, Fort Russell was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. On 7 October 1949, it became [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]]. 

In 1967, a curved red brick wall was constructed in the Warren AFB trophy park for the bells, with a bronze plaque on the wall between the bells telling the story of the massacre at Balangiga. {{as of|1987}}, a faint inscription was visible on the back of both bells, reading:
{{center|&lt;poem&gt;USED BY {{sic|PHILIP|PINOS}}

OF COMPANY "C" NINTH INFANTRY

28TH SEPTEMBER 1901&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

{{as of|2001}}, a glass case housed the bells along with the 400-year-old British [[Falconet (cannon)|Falcon cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mead |first=Griver |title=For Whom the Bells Toll |pages= |publisher=AsianWeek.com |date=2001-10-11 |url=http://asianweek.com/2001_10_05/news_bells.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827192806/http://www.asianweek.com/2001_10_05/news_bells.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Fact Sheets:F.E.

The third church bell which was in the possession of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]] is kept at the 2nd Infantry Division Museum in [[Camp Red Cloud]], [[Uijeongbu]]. It had previously been displayed at the unit's [[Camp Hovey]] headquarters.&lt;ref name="robson"/&gt;

==Recovery attempts==
In the mid-1990s, during the term of [[Fidel Ramos]] as Philippine President, attempts were initiated by his government to recover one or more of the bells from [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=The Saga of the Balangiga Bells |url=http://davinci.rodal-intl.org:8020/rudy/filipinas/balangiga.html |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121143002/http://davinci.rodal-intl.org:8020/rudy/filipinas/balangiga.html |archivedate=2010-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Bells of Balangiga Revisited | url=http://www.philnews.com/2005/da.html |website=Philnews.com| accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government has been adamant that the bells are US government property, that it would take an [[Act of Congress]] to return them and that the Catholic Church has no say in the matter. For their part the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] hold the position that the bells are inappropriate as trophies of war.&lt;ref name="cbcp"/&gt;

In 2002, the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]] approved Senate Resolution No. 393, authored by [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.]], urging the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Arroyo]] administration to undertake formal negotiations with the United States for the return of the bells.&lt;ref name="nene"/&gt;

In 2005, the bishop of [[Borongan]], [[Samar]], Bishop Leonardo Medroso and Balangiga parish priest Saturnino Obzunar wrote an open letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]], requesting them to facilitate the return of the bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pilapil | first =Jaime | title =Balangiga bells to be returned to RP soon | pages = | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date = 2005-11-14 | url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news03_nov14_2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Wyoming Veterans’ Commission favored the return of the Filipino-American War relics, however, [[Wyoming]] Governor [[Dave Freudenthal]] stated that he disagreed with the Commission and opposed returning the bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lariosa |first=Joseph |title=US vets group wants to return Balangiga Bells to RP |pages= |publisher=The Filipino Express |date=2005-04-14 |url=http://www.filipinoexpress.com/19/16_news.html |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316202735/http://www.filipinoexpress.com/19/16_news.html |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2005, United States Congressman [[Bob Filner]] had introduced H.Res.313, urging the President to authorize the transfer of ownership of one of the bells to the people of the Philippines. The resolution died on January 3, 2007, with the ''sine die'' adjournment of the [[109th United States Congress]].

On September 26, 2006, United States Congressman Bob Filner, Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and Congressman [[Ed Case]] co-sponsored House Concurrent Resolution No. 481 urging the president of the United States to authorize the return of the church bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Sampayan | first =Sonny | title =Bells of Balangiga Resolution filed in U.S. Congress | pages = | publisher =Samar News.com | date = 2006-09-29 | url =http://www.samarnews.com/news_clips5/news85.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313233923/http://www.samarnews.com/news_clips5/news85.htm| archivedate= 13 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution died on January 3, 2009, with the ''sine die'' adjournment of the [[110th United States Congress]].

The townspeople of Balangiga asked the United States to return their church bells after receiving relief from the U.S. military subsequent to [[Typhoon Haiyan]] hitting the town in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters please bells"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-philippines-typhoon-usa-idUSBRE9AK1CO20131121 | title=Please can we have our bells back?

In his second [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] on July 24, 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] demanded the bells' return, citing ownership of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2017/07/24/duterte-us-return-balangiga-bells-554668 |title=Duterte to US: Return Balangiga bells |work=Sunstar Philippines |location=Manila |publisher=Sunstar Philippines |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.philippinerevolution.info/statements/20170801-balangigas-lasting-relevance-of-peoples-uprising-will-haunt-duterte|title= Balangiga’s lasting relevance of people’s uprising will haunt Duterte|publisher=Sunstar Philippines|date=August 1, 2017|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He however did not raise the issue in a bilateral meeting with US President [[Donald Trump]] held in November 2017 during the [[2017 ASEAN Summits|31st ASEAN Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ranada | first =Pia | title =Duterte doesn't raise Balangiga bells with Trump | publisher =[[Rappler]] | date = 14 November 2017 | url =https://www.rappler.com/nation/188423-duterte-balangiga-bells-trump-bilateral-meeting-asean-summit-2017 | accessdate = 25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 two US lawmakers, [[Randy Hultgren]] and [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern]], objected to the bells being returned to the Philippines due to the current human rights record established by Duterte's [[Philippine Drug War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Cabico | first =Gaea Katreena | title =US solons object return of Balangiga bells to Philippines due to human rights concerns | publisher =[[The Philippine Star]] | date = 7 February 2018 | url =https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/07/1785490/us-solons-object-return-balangiga-bells-philippines-due-human-rights-concerns | accessdate = 12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential repatriation ==
In August 2018, the [[Embassy of the United States, Manila| US Embassy in the Philippines]] issued a statement that the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] had notified the [[United States Congress]] that it plans to return the bells to the Philippines at an unspecified date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Morales | first =Neil Jerome | title =U.S. to return colonization era church bells to the Philippines | publisher =[[Reuters]] | date = 12 August 2018 | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-bells/u-s-to-return-colonization-era-church-bells-to-the-philippines-idUSKBN1KW0FT | accessdate = 12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Dr. Rolando Borrinaga of the Philippines' [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] stated that the two bells at the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base will be turned over to Philippine representatives on 15 November 2018. The third bell in South Korea is also ready for repatriation.&lt;ref name=abs&gt;{{cite news | last=Tagala | first=Don | title =Balangiga Bells to begin journey home to Philippines | publisher =[[ABS-CBN News]] | date = 12 November 2018 | url =https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/12/18/us-to-return-balangiga-bells-to-philippines | accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bells in Wyoming will then be shipped to [[Philadelphia]] for restoration work before being sent to South Korea, where they will join the third bell.

The successful campaign to return the bells came about due to the support of veterans organizations, including the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] and the [[American Legion]], according to Dr. Borrinaga.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Breast pain''' is the symptom of discomfort in the [[breast]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iddon |first1=J |last2=Dixon |first2=JM |title=Mastalgia. |journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |date=13 December 2013 |volume=347 |pages=f3288 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f3288 |pmid=24336097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain that involves both breasts and which occurs repeatedly before the [[menstrual period]] is generally not serious.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHS2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Breast pain |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-pain/ |website=NHS |accessdate=30 October 2018|date=2017-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain that involves only one part of a breast is more concerning.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; It is particular concerning if a hard [[breast mass|mass]] or [[nipple discharge]] is also present.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes may be related to the [[menstrual cycle]], [[birth control pills]], [[hormone therapy]], or [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salzman |first1=B |last2=Fleegle |first2=S |last3=Tully |first3=AS |title=Common breast problems. |journal=American Family Physician |date=15 August 2012 |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=343–9 |pmid=22963023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain may also occur in those with large breasts, during [[menopause]], and in early [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In about 2% of cases breast pain is related to [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=Maz2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mazza |first1=Danielle |title=Women's Health in General Practice |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0729578714 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_Q7IO4ACO1cC&amp;pg=PA189 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis involves [[breast examination|examination]], with [[medical imaging]] if only a specific part of the breast hurts.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Otherwise treatments may include [[paracetamol]] or [[NSAIDs]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; A well fitting [[bra]] may also help.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In those with severe pain [[tamoxifen]] or [[danazol]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; About 70% of women have breast pain at some point in time.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt; Breast pain is one of the most common breast symptom, along with [[breast mass]]es and nipple discharge.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

==Causes==
Cyclical breast pain is often associated with [[fibrocystic breast changes]] or [[duct ectasia]] and thought to be caused by changes of prolactin response to [[thyrotropin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1159/000180038| last1 = Dogliotti| first1 = L| last2 = Faggiuolo| first2 = R| last3 = Ferusso| first3 = A| last4 = Orlandi| first4 = F| last5 = Sandrucci| first5 = S| last6 = Tibo| first6 = A| last7 = Angeli| first7 = A| title = Prolactin and thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in premenopausal women with fibrocystic disease of the breast| journal = Hormone Research| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 137–44| year = 1985| pmid = 3922866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF01658413| last1 = Dogliotti| first1 = L| last2 = Orlandi| first2 = F| last3 = Angeli| first3 = A| title = The endocrine basis of benign breast disorders| journal = World Journal of Surgery| volume = 13| issue = 6| pages = 674–9| year = 1989| pmid = 2696218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with [[menstruation]] and/or [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS).&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

Noncyclical breast pain has various causes and is harder to diagnose. Noncyclical pain has frequently its root cause outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in [[puberty]] (both in girls and boys), in [[menopause]] and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include [[alcoholism]] with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), [[mastitis]] and medications such as [[digitalis]], [[methyldopa]] (an [[antihypertensive]]), [[spironolactone]], certain [[diuretic]]s, [[oxymetholone]] (an [[anabolic steroid]]), and [[chlorpromazine]] (a [[typical antipsychotic]]).&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Also, [[shingles]] can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

===Breast cancer===
Some women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear [[breast cancer]]. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer. The great majority of breast cancer cases do not present with symptoms of pain, though breast pain in older women is more likely to be associated with cancer.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cash2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Cash | first = Jill | title = Family practice guidelines | publisher = Springer Publishing | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780826197825 }}, [Electronic book] Section I Guidelines, Chapter Thirteen: Gynecologic Guidelines-Breast Pain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = medline/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis involves [[breast examination]], with [[medical imaging]] if only a specific part of the breast hurts.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Medical imaging by [[ultrasound]] is recommended for all ages, well in those over 30 it is recommended together with [[mammography]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

Ruling out the other possible causes of the pain is one way to differentiate the source of the pain. Breast pain can be due to:

{{div col end}}

Diagnostic testing can be useful. Typical tests used are [[mammogram]], [[excisional biopsy]] for solid lumps, [[fine-needle aspiration]] and biopsy, [[pregnancy test]], [[ultrasonography]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

==Treatment==
In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; Otherwise treatments may include [[paracetamol]] or [[NSAIDs]].&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt; A well fitting [[bra]] may also help.&lt;ref name=NHS2018/&gt; In those with severe pain [[tamoxifen]] or [[danazol]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2012/&gt;

[[Bromocriptine]] may be used aswell.&lt;ref name="SchuilingLikis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kerri Durnell Schuiling|author2=Frances E. Likis|title=Women's Gynecologic Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj_ourS3PBMC&amp;pg=PA381|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-5637-6|pages=381–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spironolactone, low dose [[oral contraceptives]], and low-dose [[estrogen]] have helped to relieve pain. Topical anti-inflammatory medications can be used for localized pain. [[Vitamin E]] is not effective in relieving pain nor is [[evening primrose oil]]. [[Vitamin B6|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[vitamin A]] have not been consistently found to be beneficial. [[Flaxseed]] has shown some activity in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia.&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

Pain may be relieved by the use of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or, for more severe localized pain, by [[local anaesthetic]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;&lt;ref name = medline/&gt; Pain may be relieved by reassurance that it does not signal a serious underlying problem, and an active life style can also effect an improvement.&lt;ref name=BMJ2013/&gt;

Information regarding how the pain is real but not necessarily caused by disease can help to understand the problem. Learning [[breast self-examination]] helps to orient the woman to normal and expected texture and structure of the breast and nipple. [[Yearly breast exams]] may be suggested. [[Counseling]] can also be to describe changes that vary during the monthly cycle. Women on hormone replacement therapy may benefit from a dose adjustment. Another non-pharmacological measure to help relieve symptoms of pain may be to use good bra support. Breasts change during adolescence and menopause and refitting may be beneficial. Applying heat and/or ice can bring relief. Dietary changes may also help with the pain. [[Methylxanthine]]s can be eliminated from the diet to see if a sensitivity is present. Some clinicians recommending a reduction in [[salt]], though no evidence supports this practice.&lt;ref name=Cash2013/&gt;

[[Image:Tawa chakana qillqana.svg|thumb|right|Construction method]]
[[Image:CruzzersChakana.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''chakana''' (or '''Inca Cross''') is a stepped cross made up of an equal-armed cross indicating the cardinal points of the compass and a superimposed square. The square is suggested to represent the other two levels of existence. The three levels of existence are ''Hana Pacha'' (the upper world inhabited by the superior gods), ''Kay Pacha'', (the world of our everyday existence) and ''Ukhu'' or ''Urin Pacha'' (the underworld inhabited by spirits of the dead, the ancestors, their overlords and various deities having close contact to the Earth plane). The hole through the centre of the cross is the Axis by means of which the shaman transits the cosmic vault to the other levels.  It is also said to represent [[Cusco]], the center of the [[Incan Empire|Incan empire]], and the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] constellation.

==Composition==
The geometry of the symbol has a high degree of [[symmetry]]. The symbol can be drawn from a circle. A square is inscribed in the circle, with the corners tangent to the circle. This forms the "middle step" of the ladder. A smaller square (tilted 45 degrees) is made from the midpoints of the large square. Connecting the midpoints of the small square and extending the lines to the edge of the circle will form the arms of the cross, otherwise known as the "first" and "last" steps of the chakana. Lines are drawn from the points the lines exit the circle, to complete the cross. A small circle is made from the diameter of the cross lines. To proof the construction, a separate construction line is drawn from the point where the square corners with the cross rectangles to the same point on the opposite side. If the line is 27 degrees from the vertical, the chakana is properly drawn.

==Historical evidence==
The [[mestee]] historian [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega, ''el Ynga'']], reports about a  holy cross of white and red marble or [[jasper]], which was venerated in 16th-century [[Cusco]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. The cross had been kept in a royal house, in a sacred place or ''[[huaca|wak'a]]'', but the Incas did not worship it. They simply admired it because of its beauty. The cross was square (''quadrada''), measuring about two by two feet, its branches three inch wide, the edges carefully squared and the surface brightly polished.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Incas began to venerate the holy cross, after they heard how [[Pedro de Candia]] had miraculously defied a lion and a tiger holding a cross. When the Spaniards captured the city, they transferred the cross to sacristy of the newly built cathedral, where De la Vega saw it in 1560. He was surprised that the clergy had not decorated it with gold or gems.&lt;ref&gt;Garcillago de la Vega, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WcVoauZVaFEC&amp;pg=PA111 First part of the Royal Commentaries of the Yncas], 1869, repr. Cambridge 2010, vol. 1, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; As we know from Middle America, this may have been part of a deliberate strategy by [[Mendicant orders|mendicant friars]], trying to adapt to indigenous cultural codes. As a rule, the veneration of the holy cross was a carefully designed ecclesiastical enterprise, incorporating native symbols and reproducing them on sacral level. Most surviving Meso-American crosses do not predate the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mónica Domínguez Torres, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q_b3sg-tLvQC Military Ethos and Visual Culture in Post-Conquest Mexico], Burlington 2013, pp. 61-110&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing stories about indigenous crosses contributed to the idea of a [[Natural theology|'natural' religion]] that would have prepared the Indians for their inevitable conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ditchfield, ‘What Did Natural History Have to Do with Salvation? José de Acosta SJ (1540-1600) in the America's', in: Peter Clarke and Tony Claydon, God's Bounty? The Churches and the Natural World, Woodbridge, Suffolk and Rochester, NY 2010, pp. 144-168&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, this Andean "cross" has been documented in Tiwanaku architecture (Bolivia) dating back to 300 BC and AD 300. Other Andean cultures, Mapuche, whose presence in the Americas also predates Western presence and date back 600 t 500 BC.

==Controversy==

The "chakana" is an invented tradition. Although the Chakana as the 'Andean cross', presented as an Inca and pre-Inca symbol bearing cultural, spiritual, or mystical interpretations as expressed in this article, has wide popularity in contemporary Andean culture, its roots are no older than the late 20th century, and the popular version, than 2003. The current Chakana mythos as it impacts the New Age belief system and the Peruvian tourist-oriented economy initiates from the 2003 publication of the book Andean Awakening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MaryAnn Male Jorge Luis Delgado (Author) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Andean-Awakening-Publisher-Council-Books/dp/B004OP45GC/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412193531&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=jorge+luis+delgado |title=Andean Awakening Publisher: Council Oak Books: MaryAnn Male Jorge Luis Delgado: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by Jorge Luis Delgado, and Mary Anne Male. This is the source of the myth. They are followed by such authors as Mark Torra and Roger Calverley (CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/CHAKANA-Secret-Teachings-Ancient-Mystery-ebook/dp/B00FOXQZT8 |title=CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School eBook: Roger Calverley: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeoastronomer Carlos Milla Villena published his own, distinctly different speculative interpretations of the chacana as “andean, cross” in Génesis de la cultura andina,1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nVuAAAAMAAJ&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |title=Génesis de la cultura andina - Carlos Milla Villena - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.pe |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scientific, scholastic, and archaeological sources do not refer to or support the word chakana as the cross-and-box design - rather, it is in [[Runasimi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clacsnyublog.com/2011/03/08/runa-simi-pantachiqkunamanta-about-the-forgers-of-runa-simi/ |title=Runa Simi pantachiqkunamanta – About the Forgers of Runa Simi &amp;#124; CLACS @ NYU |publisher=Clacsnyublog.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional language of the Inca peoples, (modern Quechua), derived from chaka, 'bridge', and means 'to cross over', or 'a crossing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Earth-Sky-Cosmology-Monograph-ebook/dp/B00HEUJQ9U/ref=la_B001HCZIHA_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412197906&amp;sr=1-3 |title=At the Crossroads of the Earth and the Sky: An Andean Cosmology (Latin American Monographs: No. 55) - Kindle edition by Gary Urton. Politics &amp; Social Sciences Kindle eBooks @ |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among chroniclers such as the Jesuit missionary and naturalist José de Acosta, 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Acosta, Historia natural y moral de las Indias, Sevilla 1590, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; it is applied to the group of stars commonly identified as the Belt of Orion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/startable2.html |title=startab2 |publisher=Astronomy.pomona.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chroniclers do not refer to the chakana, or chacana, as the “andean cross,” or as reflecting a symbolical or semiotic tradition.

The twelve-cornered design itself occasionally appears in pre-contact artifacts such as textiles and ceramics from such cultures as the Wari, Ica, and Tiwanaku, but with no particular emphasis and no key or guide to a means of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tocapu.org/images/index.php |title=Images |publisher=tocapu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Andeans and Andeanists regard the imposition of this modern “invented tradition"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm &amp; Terence Ranger, ed. (1983). The Invention of Tradition. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521246458}}.&lt;/ref&gt;” as [[cultural appropriation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kareem |first=Nadra |url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/fl/What-Is-Cultural-Appropriation-and-Why-Is-It-Wrong.htm |title=What Is Cultural Appropriation and Why Is It Wrong? |publisher=Racerelations.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Peruvian author Tupaq Katari writes: “When I hear you foreigners, with ease and lightness talking of the Andean themes, this surprises me, since we here in Peru continually try to find details about our own history, which is very complex and you argue so lightness without a historical or experiential support of what are the Andes and its diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamanportal.org/article_details.php?id=891 |title=10th PACHAKUTI by Tupaq Katari / Shaman Portal |publisher=Shamanportal.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3262">The '''''corporate opportunity''''' doctrine is the legal principle providing that [[board of directors|directors]], officers, and controlling shareholders of a [[corporation]] must not take for themselves any business opportunity that could benefit the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;18B Am. Jur. 2d ''Corporations'' § 1536 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;  The corporate opportunity doctrine is one application of the [[fiduciary]] [[duty of loyalty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Application ==
The corporate opportunity doctrine does not apply to all fiduciaries of a corporation; rather, it is limited to directors, officers, and controlling shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine applies regardless of whether the corporation is harmed by the transaction; indeed, it applies even if the corporation benefits from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1538.&lt;/ref&gt;  The corporate opportunity doctrine only applies if the opportunity was not disclosed to the corporation.  If the opportunity was disclosed to the board of directors and the board declined to take the opportunity for the corporation, the fiduciary may take the opportunity for him- or herself.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1539.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the corporate opportunity doctrine applies, the corporation is entitled to all profits earned by the fiduciary from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1538, 1540.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the leading [[English law]] case of {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]|year=1942|court=UKHL|num=1}} it was held that "The rule of equity which insists on those who by use of a fiduciary position make a profit, being liable to account for that profit, in no way depends on fraud, or absence of ''[[bona fide]]s'' ... or whether the plaintiff has in fact been damaged or benefited by his action."

== Elements ==
A business opportunity is a corporate opportunity if the corporation is financially able to undertake the opportunity, the opportunity is within the corporation's line of business, and the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1536.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] has stated, "An opportunity is within a corporation's line of business . . . if it is an activity as to which the corporation has fundamental knowledge, practical experience and ability to pursue."&lt;ref&gt;''Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. v. Stewart'', 833 A.2d 961, 972-73 (Del. Ch. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''In re eBay, Inc. Shareholders Litigation'', investing in various [[securities]] was held to be in a line of business of eBay despite the fact that eBay's primary purpose is to provide an online auction platform.&lt;ref&gt;''In re eBay, Inc. S'holders Litig.'', 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 4 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Investing was in a line of business of eBay because eBay "consistently invested a portion of its cash on hand in marketable securities."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at *12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A corporation has an interest or expectancy in a business opportunity if the opportunity would further an established business policy of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;18B Am. Jur. 2d ''Corporations'' § 1542 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French - Casket with Scenes of Romances - Walters 71264 - Right.jpg|thumb|Ivory French casket with scenes of romances – possibly a courtship gift. Held in the [[Walters Art Museum]].]]'''Courtship''' is the period of development towards an [[intimate relationship]] wherein a couple get to know each other and decide if there will be an [[engagement]]. A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval.  Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it has been perceived that it is the role of a male to actively "court" or "woo" a female, thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a proposal of marriage.

== Duration ==
The average duration of courtship varies considerably throughout the world.  Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples. Courtship may be completely omitted, as in cases of some [[arranged marriage]]s where the couple do not meet before the wedding.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a poll of 3,000&lt;ref name=mc&gt;"[http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/181134/average-man-proposes-after-three-years.html  Average man proposes after three years]" ''Marie Claire'' 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; engaged or married couples resulted in an average duration between first meeting and accepted [[proposal of marriage]] of 2 years and 11 months,&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=99603&amp;in_page_id=8 Average man takes 3 years to propose] Metrosexual, Sunday, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with the women feeling ready to accept at an average of 2 years and 7 months.&lt;ref name=mc/&gt; Regarding duration between proposal and wedding, the UK poll above gave an average of 2 years and 3 months.&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;

== Traditions ==
[[Image:Youth and suitors.jpg|thumb|left|''Youth conversing with suitors''&lt;br&gt;from the ''Haft Awrang'' of [[Jami]], in the story ''A Father Advises his Son About Love.'']]The date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, but in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very specific formal rules.

In some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners and then allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited. In [[Japan]], there is a such type of courtship called [[Miai|Omiai]], with similar practices called "Xiangqin" (相親) in the [[Greater China Area]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite document|last=Thelmaw|first=Ritgerõ|date=September 2015|title=Courtship in Japan and Iceland|url=http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/22794/52148/1/Ritger%C3%B0_Thelmaw.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents will hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and [[résumé]]s of potential mates, and if the couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The matchmaker and parents will often exert pressure on the couple to decide whether they want to marry or not after a few dates.

[[Courtship in the Philippines]] is one known complex form of courtship. Unlike what is regularly seen in other societies, it takes a far more subdued and indirect approach.&lt;ref name="phrasebase.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrasebase.com/archive/tagalog/82-courtship-in-philippine-culture.html|title=COURTSHIP IN PHILIPPINE CULTURE - Sociology|website=www.phrasebase.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complex in that it involves stages, and it is considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see the male showing off by sending love letters and love poems, singing romantic songs, and buying gifts for the female. The parents are also seen as part of the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship may begin or before the female gives the male an answer to his advances.&lt;ref name="phrasebase.com" /&gt;

In more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the practice of arranged marriages&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in which partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents. Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which, in such cultures, may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.

Throughout history, courtship has often included traditions such as exchanging [[valentines]], written correspondence (which was facilitated by the creation of the postal service in the nineteenth century), and similar communication-based courting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Maurer | first = Elizabeth | title = "The History of Romance" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2017 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/history-romance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over recent decades, though, the concept of arranged marriage has changed or simply been mixed with other forms of dating, including Eastern and Indian ones; potential couples have the opportunity to meet and date each other before one decides on whether or not to continue the relationship.

==Modern people==
{{Main|Dating}}
In the earlier 1800s, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons. In more traditional forms of Christianity, this concept of courtship has been retained, with [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] defining courtship and distinguishing this concept from dating, stating that:&lt;ref name="PiperTaylor2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piper|first1=John|last2=Taylor|first2=Justin|title=Sex and the Supremacy of Christ|date=14 June 2005|publisher=Crossway|isbn=9781433517907|page=146}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Courtship ordinarily begins when a single man approaches a single woman by going through the woman's father, and then conducts his relationship with the woman under the authority of her father, family, or church, whichever is most appropriate. Courtship always has marriage as its direct goal...Dating, a more modern approach, begins when either the man or the woman initiates a more-than-friends relationship with the other, and then they conduct that relationship outside of any oversight or authority. Dating may or may not have marriage as its goal.&lt;ref name="PiperTaylor2005"/&gt;}}
[[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]] Patricia Bootsma delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in "courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors".&lt;ref name="Bootsma2015" /&gt; She further states that with courtship, "commitment happens before intimacy".&lt;ref name="Bootsma2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bootsma|first=Patricia|title=Raising Burning Hearts: Parenting and Mentoring Next Generation Lovers of God|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Forerunner Publishing|isbn=9781938060229|page=81}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, in the 1820s, the phrase "date" was most closely associated with prostitution. However, by the [[Jazz Age]] of the 1920s, dating for fun was becoming a cultural expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was usually more chaste than is seen today, since premarital sex was not considered the norm.

===Courtship in social theory===
Courtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity.  Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms.  Both Moore and Perper found that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women,&lt;ref&gt;Perper, T. (1985) ''Sex Signals: The Biology Of Love'', Philadelphia, ISI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = N | year = 1985 | title = Nonverbal courtship patterns in women: contact and consequences | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Monica_Moore3/publication/246974326_Nonverbal_courtship_patterns_in_women_Context_and_consequences/links/55c37d6e08aeb975674014ba/Nonverbal-courtship-patterns-in-women-Context-and-consequences.pdf | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 237–247 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(85)90016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond.

This is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of body language.&lt;ref&gt;Pease, A. and Pease, B. (2004) ''The Definitive Book Of Body Language'', London: Orion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are some feminist scholars, however, who regard courtship as a socially constructed (and male-led) process organised to subjugate women.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, J. &amp; Parkin, W. (1987) ''Sex at work: The power and paradox of organisation sexuality'', Brighton: Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R. W (1995) ''Gender and Power'', Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell reports, for example, that magazines about marriage and romantic fiction continue to attract a 98% female readership.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, W. (2000) ''Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say'', New York: Tarcher/Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic research into courtship processes inside the workplace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = C.

(2003) ''Why Men Marry Some Women and Not Others'', London: Element.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M., Abbott, M., Angleitner, A., Biaggio, A., Blanco-Villasenor, A., BruchonSchweittzer, M.

''Journal of Cross Cultural Psychology'', 21: 5-47.&lt;/ref&gt; continue to support a view that courtship is a social process that socialises '''both''' sexes into accepting forms of relationship that maximise the chances of successfully raising children.

=== Courtship in Australia ===
Courtship in Australia is generally reserved to those with religious affiliation. As a standard rule, dating is widely accepted; along with inter-racial relationships, gay/lesbian relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion.&lt;ref name="Putzi"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putzi|first=Sibylla|date=December 2008|title=A to Z World Lifecycles : 175 Countries: Birth, Childhood, Coming of Age, Dating and Courtship, Marriage, Family and Parenting, Work Life, Old Age and Death|url=http://site.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/lib/notredameaustralia/detail.action?docID=10305899|journal=World Trade Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of the Australian values are derived from British courtship culture; therefore, marriage practices are much the same. Modern western culture has taken over, leading to more and more people committing to partnerships through dating. Before entering marriage, a lot of Australian couples like to live with each other to get an idea of what married life would be like. This would not happen in a courtship as both people vow to chastity and often like to keep a chaperone around.&lt;ref name="Putzi" /&gt;

===Commercial dating services===            
As technology progressed the dating world followed. In a Time-line by Metro, a statistic [[Matchmaking|match-making]] business opened in 1941, the first reality TV dating show was developed in 1965 and by the 1980s the public was introduced to video dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulshine|first1=Molly|title=The 80s version of Tinder was 'video dating' — and it looks incredibly awkward|url=http://www.techinsider.io/found-footage-awkward-80s-video-dating-2015-12|website=Tech Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video Dating was a way for singles to sit in front of a camera and tell whomever may be watching something about themselves. The [[process of elimination]] was significant because now the viewer was able hear their voice, see their face and watch their body language to determine a [[physical attraction]] to the candidates.

In [[online dating]], individuals create profiles where they disclose personal information, photographs, hobbies, interests, religion and expectations. Then the user can search through hundreds of thousands of accounts and connect with multiple people at once which in return, gives the user more options and more opportunity to find what meets their standards. Online dating has influenced the idea of [[choice]]. In ''[[Modern Romance: An Investigation]]'', [[Aziz Ansari]] states that one third of marriages in the United States between 2005-2012 met through online dating services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-59420-627-6|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are hundreds of sites to choose from and websites designed to fit specific needs such as [[Match.com|Match]], [[Eharmony.com|Eharmony]], [[Okcupid.com|Okcupid]], [[Zoosk]], and [[ChristianMingle.com|Christianmingle]]. Mobile apps, such as [[Grindr]] and [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] allow users to upload profiles that are then judged by others on the service; one can either swipe right on a profile (indicating interest) or swipe left (which presents another possible mate).

Many animal species have mate-selection rituals also referred to as "courtship" [[anthropomorphic]]ally. Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching, vocalizations, or displays of beauty or fighting prowess. Most animal courtship occurs out of sight of humans and so it is often the least documented of animal behaviors. One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the [[bower bird]] whose male builds a "bower" of collected objects.

From the scientific point of view, courtship in the animal kingdom is the process in which the different species select their partners for reproduction purposes. Generally speaking, the male initiates the courtship and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his "performance".

===Sea turtles===
[[Image:Courtship of green turtles.jpg|thumb|250px|Courtship of [[green turtle]]s]]
All animals have different courtship rituals that reflect fitness, compatibility with others and ability to provide. Sea turtles court during a limited receptive time. During the courtship males will either
nuzzle the females head to show affection or by gently biting the back of her
neck.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=behavior|title=www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=behavior|website=www.conserveturtles.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may go on for long periods of time depending on if the female
responds to the male. If the female does respond, by not fleeing, the male will
attach himself onto the back of the female’s shell using his front flippers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He
will stretch his long tail under the back of the females shell to begin
copulation.

Courting can be competitive among males. The male
that has better endurance will win the female. To a female, endurance is a great
trait to be passed on to their offspring, the higher the endurance in the male
the higher the endurance will be in her offspring and the more likely they will
be to survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female Leatherback sea turtles will also choose many different
males to copulate with in order to diversify their offspring since it is known
that Leatherback sea turtles have female-biased offspring.

===Hippopotamus===
Hippopotamus are commonly misconceived as being
aggressive animals, when in actuality the mothers are very nurturing and
sensitive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hippoworlds.com/hippopotamus-reproduction/|title=Hippopotamus Reproduction - Hippopotamus Facts and Information|website=www.hippoworlds.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mating and birth both occur in the water for hippopotamus. This
because it gives them privacy when conceiving and it helps conserve energy
during birth. The female hippo normally averages around 5–6 years while males
are average an age of 7-8.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During mating season the male hippopotamus will find
a mate out of the herd, showing interest by smelling the female’s dorsal end.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Hippopotamus_amphibius/|title=Hippopotamus amphibius (hippopotamus)|website=Animal Diversity Web|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As
long as the male acts submissive during courting season the adults in the herd
will not interfere. Once the male finds the female he wants to mate with, he
begins provoking the female. He then will push the female into the water and
mounts her. In order to alert the herd or other animals that may be lurking
around the male will let a loud wheezing sound.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Preceding birth the female
exhibits aggressive behavior leaving the herd until after the birth of the
calf. Although hippopotamus can mate anytime of the year, the mating season
ranges from February to August. Because the energy cost is high, the female
generally only has one offspring in a two years span.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Honeybees===

The courtship behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types:
Apiary Vicinity Mating and Drone Assembly Mating respectively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/matingbehaviour.html|title=Mating Behaviour in Honey Bees|last=Cushman|first=Dave|website=www.dave-cushman.net|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apiary vicinity
mating usually takes place in weather that is cool and is more local to the
apiary from which the queen resides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The drones are in the same
apiary too but do not mean that it will lead to inbreeding. Drones assemble in
a bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queen
has flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sort
of fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upward
temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and inserts
his endophallus, ejaculating semen.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orkin.com/stinging-pests/bees/mechanics-of-honey-bee-mating/|title=Mechanics of Honey Bee Mating: Honey Bee Mating Habits|website=Orkin.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male honey bee will then pull away from the queen, but his endophallus will be ripped from his body and remain attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the endophallus that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will eventually ejaculate and lose his own.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The frequency of mating for the male
honey bees is seven to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones die
quickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since the
endophallus has been removed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The few that survive are usually ejected from
their nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating .

They only attend one mating flight
and queen stores up to 100 million sperm within her oviducts during this
flight, but only five to six million are stored in the spermatheca of the
queen.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only a few of this sperm are used by the queen at a time to fertilize
the eggs throughout her life. New queen generations will mate and produce their
colonies if the queen runs out of sperm in her lifetime. The sex of the
offspring is controlled by the honey bee queens as the eggs passing through the
oviduct can be determined whether they are fertilized or not by the queen.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Research has indicated that eggs that are fertilized develop into female workers and queens while the unfertilized eggs become drone honey bees. Female workers can lay infertile eggs but do not mate. The infertile eggs become male honey bees. The eggs of the queen are laid in oval-shaped structural cells that usually stick to the nest ceiling. Royal jelly is then filled with these cells to prevent larvae from falling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Soon-to-be workers are fed royal jelly during the first two days. The future queens are given royal jelly throughout the entire larval period. Each member colony development depends on
caste. For proper growth from eggs to adult, the male honey bees need 24 days,
21 for workers and only 16 for the queens.

[[File:Vishnu Avatars.jpg|thumb|300px|19th century painting of avatars of Vishnu by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]
{{Vaishnavism}}
'''Dashavatara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|æ|ʃ|ə|ˈ|v|æ|t|ə|r|ə}}; {{lang-sa|दशावतार}}, {{IAST|daśāvatāra}}) refers to the ten primary [[avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]], the Hindu god of preservation. Vishnu is said to descend in form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word ''Dashavatara'' derives from {{IAST|daśa}}, meaning 'ten', and avatar ({{IAST|avatāra}}), roughly equivalent to 'incarnation'.

The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, and no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard. However, most draw from the following set of figures, omitting at least one of those listed in parentheses: [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Vamana]], [[Parashurama]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Balarama]] or &lt;!-- WARNING: deletion of "Buddha" will be reverted right away --&gt;[[Gautama_Buddha_in_Hinduism|Buddha]], and [[Kalki]]. In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces Vishnu as the source of all avatars. Some traditions include a regional deity such as [[Vithoba]] or [[Jagannath]] in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha. All avatars have appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the [[Kali Yuga]].

==Description==
The list of avatars in the Dashavatara varies by region. The following table summarizes the position of avatars within the Dashavatara in many but not all traditions. A number in the table indicates the position of the corresponding avatar within the Dashavatara. Two or more numbers separated by commas indicate that the position of the corresponding avatar within the Dashavatara varies between traditions. Bracketed numbers indicate that the corresponding avatar is omitted in some traditions.

==Etymology==
The word ''Dashavatara'' derives from {{IAST|daśa}}, meaning 'ten' and avatar ({{IAST|avatāra}}), meaning 'incarnation'.

Number of occurrences of these avatars of lord Vishnu are one less than the total number of avatars in previous yuga.

[[Satya Yuga]] - Had 4 ([[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]])

[[Treta Yuga]] - Had 3 ([[Vamana]], [[Parshurama]], [[Rama]]) 

[[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara Yug]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;a- Had 2 ([[Krishna]], [[Balarama]])

[[Kali Yuga|Kali Yug]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;a- Had 1, Yet to have 1 ([[Lord Buddha]], [[Kalki]])

==List==

* '''[[Matsya]]''', the fish. Vishnu takes the form of a fish to save [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] from the [[Flood myth|deluge]] ([[Pralaya]]), after which he takes his boat to the new world along with one of every species of plant and animal, gathered in a massive cyclone.
* '''[[Kurma]]''', the giant tortoise. When the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[Asura|asuras]] were churning the [[Ocean of milk]] in order to get [[Amrita]], the nectar of immortality, the mount Mandara they were using as the churning staff started to sink and Vishnu took the form of a tortoise to bear the weight of the mountain.
* '''[[Varaha]]''', the boar. He appeared to defeat [[Hiranyaksha]], a demon who had taken the Earth, or [[Prithvi]], and carried it to the bottom of what is described as the cosmic ocean(much like in ether theory) in the story. The battle between Varaha and Hiranyaksha is believed to have lasted for a thousand years, which the former finally won. Varaha carried the Earth out of the ocean between his tusks and restored it to its place in the universe.
* '''[[Narasimha]]''', the half-man/half-lion. The ''[[rakshasa]] (Demon)'' [[Hiranyakashipu]], the elder brother of Hiranyaksha, was granted a powerful boon from [[Brahma]] that he could not be killed by man or animal, inside or outside a room, during day or night, neither on ground nor in air, with a weapon that is either living or inanimate. Hiranyakashipu persecuted everyone for their religious beliefs including his son who was a Vishnu follower.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p73"/&gt; Vishnu descended as an anthropomorphic incarnation, with the body of a man and head and claws of a lion. He disemboweled Hiranyakashipu at the courtyard threshold of his house, at dusk, with his claws, while he lay on his thighs. Narasimha thus destroyed the evil demon and brought an end to the persecution of human beings including his devotee Prahlada, according to the Hindu mythology.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah A. Soifer|title=The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YoydqgcseYC|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0800-1|pages=73–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vamana]]''', the dwarf. The fourth descendant of Hiranyakashyap, [[Bali (demon)|Bali]], with devotion and penance was able to defeat [[Indra]], the god of firmament. This humbled the other deities and extended his authority over the three worlds. The gods appealed to Vishnu for protection and he descended as a boy Vamana.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah A. Soifer|title=The Myths of Narasimha and Vamana: Two Avatars in Cosmological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YoydqgcseYC&amp;pg=PA33| year=1991| publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0800-1|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[yajna]] (यज्ञ) of the king, Vamana approached him and Bali promised him for whatever he asked. Vamana asked for three paces of land. Bali agreed, and the dwarf then changed his size to that of a giant ''Trivikrama'' form.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p33"/&gt; With his first stride he covered the earthly realm, with the second he covered the heavenly realm thereby symbolically covering the abode of all living beings.&lt;ref name="Soifer1991p33"/&gt; He then took the third stride for the netherworld. Bali realized that Vamana was [[Vishnu]] incarnate. In deference, the king offered his head as the third place for Vamana to place his foot. The avatar did so and thus granted Bali immortality and making him ruler of Pathala, the netherworld. This legend appears in hymn 1.154 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and other Vedic as well as Puranic texts.&lt;ref name="Doniger1988p28"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger| title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hwNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |year=1988 |publisher =Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-1866-4|page =28}}, [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_1/Hymn_154 Wikisource of Griffith's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Strides of Vishnu: Hindu Culture in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtLScrjrWiAC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971825-2|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Parashurama]]''', the warrior with the axe. He is son of [[Jamadagni]] and [[Renuka]] and received an axe after a penance to [[Shiva]]. He is the first Brahmin-Kshatriya in Hinduism, or warrior-saint, with duties between a [[Brahmin]] and a [[Kshatriya]]. King [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] and his army visited the father of Parashurama at his ashram, and the saint was able to feed them with the divine cow [[Kamadhenu]]. The king demanded the cow, but Jamadagni refused. Enraged, the king took it by force and destroyed the ashram. Parashurama then killed the king at his palace and destroyed his army. In revenge, the sons of Kartavirya killed Jamadagni. Parashurama took a vow to kill every Kshatriya on earth twenty-one times over, and filled five lakes with their blood. Ultimately, his grandfather, [[rishi]] Rucheeka, appeared before him and made him halt. He is a [[Chiranjivi]] (immortal), and believed to be alive today in penance at [[Mahendra Mountains|Mahendragiri]].

* '''[[Rama]]''', the prince and king of [[Ayodhya]]. He is a commonly worshipped avatar in [[Hinduism]], and is thought of as the ideal heroic man. His story is recounted in one of the most widely read scriptures of Hinduism, the ''[[Ramayana]]''. While in exile from his own kingdom with his brother [[Lakshman]] and the God [[Hanuman]], his wife [[Sita]] was abducted by the demon king of [[Lanka]], [[Ravana]]. He travelled to Lanka, killed the demon king and saved Sita.
* '''[[Balarama]]''', the elder brother of Krishna, is regarded generally as an avatar of [[Shesha]]. Balarama is included as the eighth avatar of Vishnu in the [[Sri Vaishnava]] lists, where Buddha is omitted and Krishna appears as the ninth avatar in this list.{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} He is particularly included in the lists where Krishna is removed and becomes the source of all.
*  '''[[Krishna]]'''{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} was the eighth son of [[Devaki]] and [[Vasudeva]]. A frequently worshipped deity in Hinduism, he is the hero of various legends and embodies qualities such as love and playfulness.
*'''[[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]]''': [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of Buddhism, is commonly included as an avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism. Buddha is sometimes depicted in Hindu scriptures as a preacher who deludes and leads demons and heretics away from the path of the [[Vedas|Vedic scriptures]], but another view praises him a compassionate teacher who preached the path of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence).{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}}{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}}&lt;ref&gt;Literature review of secondary references of Buddha as Dashavatara which regard Buddha to be part of standard list:

Various versions of the list of Vishnu's avatars exist.{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar,{{sfn|Wuaku|2013|p=148}} while others – such as the ''Yatindramatadipika'', a 17th-century summary of [[Sri Vaishnavism|Srivaisnava]] doctrine{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} – give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth.{{sfn|Carman|1994|p=211-212}} The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who don't accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu.{{sfn|Krishna|2009}}

===Buddha===
{{main|Buddha in Hinduism}}
The [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] was included as one of the avatars of Vishnu under [[Bhagavatism]] by the [[Gupta period]] between 330 and 550 CE. The mythologies of the Buddha in the [[Theravada]] tradition and of Vishnu in Hinduism share a number of structural and substantial similarities.{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-15}} For example, states Indologist John Holt, the Theravada cosmogony and cosmology states the Buddha covered 6,800,000 yojanas in three strides, including earth to heaven and then placed his right foot over Yugandhara – a legend that parallels that of the Vamana avatar in Hinduism. Similarly, the Buddha is claimed in the Theravada mythology to have been born when the ''dhamma'' is in decline, so as to preserve and uphold the ''dhamma''. These similarities may have contributed to the assimilation of the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu.{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-15}}

The adoption of [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] as an avatar in [[Bhagavatism]] was a catalyzing factor in Buddhism's assimilation into Vaishnavism's mythic hierarchy. By the 8th century CE, the Buddha was included as an avatar of Vishnu in several [[Puranas]].{{sfn|Holt|2013|pp=14-18}} This assimilation is indicative of the Hindu ambivalence toward the Buddha and Buddhism.{{sfn|Holt|2013|p=18}} Conversely, Vishnu has also been assimilated into Sinhalese Buddhist culture,{{sfn|Holt|2013|p=3}} and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] is sometimes called ''Buddha-Bhagavatism''.&lt;ref name="Budd"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hāṇḍā, Omacanda |title=Buddhist Art &amp; Antiquities of Himachal Pradesh: Up to 8th Century A.D. |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1994 |pages=40 |isbn=81-85182-99-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this period, the concept of Dashavatara was fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chandraiashistory.com/INDIAN%20HISTORY%202003.htm|title=(Prabha IAS-IPS Coaching Centre - Indian History 2003 exam - "The crystallization Of the Avatara Concept and the worship of the incarnations of Vishnu were features of Bhagavatism during the Gupta period"|publisher=Arumbakkam, Chennai|accessdate=1 January 2008|last=Indian|first=History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915213751/http://www.chandraiashistory.com/INDIAN%20HISTORY%202003.htm|archivedate=15 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krishna===

In traditions that emphasize the ''Bhagavata Purana'', Krishna is the original ''Supreme Personality of Godhead'', from whom everything else emanates. [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]]s worship Krishna as [[Svayam Bhagavan]], or source of the incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ulz9mO9cK54C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=balarama+ten+incarnations&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=lxv5w6dPK28A_5BQKGJ7-6ahjTw#PPA55,M1The Religion of the Hindus By Kenneth W Morgan, D S Sarma p.55]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vd-lKzyFg0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=balarama+ten+incarnations&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=uRPW5CwfXnT8jBEZYLNcjvO0mOE Iconography of Balarama By N.P.

Mahanubhavas also known as the Jai Kishani Panth, considers Lord Krishna as the supreme God and don't consider the list of Dashavatara while consider another list of Panchavatara (5 Avatars). &lt;ref name = "flood"&gt;{{cite book| author = Flood, Gavin D.| authorlink = Gavin Flood| title = An introduction to Hinduism| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge, UK| year = 1996| pages = 341| isbn = 0-521-43878-0| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gavin+flood&amp;sig=q_waAYpO_WokCivKS2OtlwsG2dw#PPA118,M1| accessdate = 2008-04-21}}"Early Vaishnava worship focuses on three deities who become fused together, namely Vasudeva-Krishna, Krishna-Gopala and Narayana, who in turn all become identified with Vishnu.

Thirty-nine avatars are mentioned in the [[Pañcaratra]] including the likes of [[Garuda]]{{sfn|Sullivan|2001|p=32}}. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrader|first=Friedrich Otto |title=Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya saṃhitā|publisher=Adyar Library|year=1916|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OlgLAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite these lists, the commonly accepted number of ten avatars for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Vibhuti Bhushan|title=Religious beliefs and practices of North India during the early mediaeval period, Volume 1|publisher=BRILL|year=1973|pages=4–5|isbn=978-90-04-03610-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nAQ4AAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary interpretation==
Some modern interpreters sequence Vishnu's ten main avatars in a definitive order, from simple life-forms to more complex, and see the Dashavataras as a reflection, or a foreshadowing, of the modern [[theory of evolution]]. Such an interpretation was first propounded by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]] in her 1877 opus ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', in which she proposed the following ordering of the Dashavataras:&lt;ref name="Nanda"&gt;{{cite book|first=Meera|last=Nanda| authorlink=Meera Nanda|chapter= Madame Blavatsky's children: Modern Hinduism's encounters with Darwinism|editor1=James R.

* Kalki - yet to happen and the savior, and is like Christian Advent, which Madame Blavatsky believed Christians "undoubtedly copied from the Hindus"&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown2007/&gt;

Blavatsky believed that the avatara-related Hindu texts were an allegorical presentation of Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref name="Brown2012p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Mackenzie Brown|title=Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDfgCgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-48467-4|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Orientalism#Orientalism and religion|Orientalist]]s and reformist Hindus in India picked up this idea to rationalize Hinduism as being consistent with modern science. [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]{{refn|Sen was a leader of the colonial era monotheistic [[Brahmo Samaj]] reform movement of Hinduism that adopted ideas from Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brahmo-Samaj Brahmo Samaj], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated in 1882,&lt;ref name="Nanda"/&gt;

{{quote|The Puranas speak of the different manifestations or incarnations of the Deity in different epochs of the world history. Lo! The Hindu Avatar rises from the lowest scale of life through the fish, the tortoise, and the hog up to the perfection of humanity. Indian Avatarism is, indeed, a crude representation of the ascending scale of Divine creation. Such precisely is the modern theory of evolution.}}

Similarly Aurobindo regarded "Avataric Evolutionism" as a "parable of evolution", one which does not endorse evolutionism, but hints at "transformative phases of spiritual progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Mackenzie Brown|title=Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDfgCgAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-48467-4|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nanda, the Dashavatara concept has led to some Hindus asserting that their religion is more open to scientific theories, and has not opposed or persecuted scientists midst them like the way Christianity and Islam has.&lt;ref name="Nandafull"&gt;{{cite book|first=Meera|last=Nanda| authorlink=Meera Nanda|chapter= Madame Blavatsky's children: Modern Hinduism's encounters with Darwinism|editor1=James R. Lewis|editor2=Olav Hammer|title=Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|date=19 November 2010|publisher=BRILL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQOJJiyOyH8C&amp;pg=279&amp;|isbn=90-04-18791-X|pages=279–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, adds Nanda, Hinduism has many cosmological theories and even the Vaishnava one with Dashavatara concept does not explicitly teach evolution of species, rather it states an endless cycles of creationism.&lt;ref name="Nandafull"/&gt;

The Dashavatara concept appealed to other scholars. [[Monier Monier-Williams]] wrote "Indeed, the Hindus were ... Darwinians centuries before the birth of Darwin, and evolutionists centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been accepted by the Huxleys of our time, and before any word like evolution existed in any language of the world."&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|first=C Mackenzie|last=Brown| chapter= Vivekananda and the scientific legitimation of Advaita Vedanta|editor1=James R. Lewis|editor2=Olav Hammer|title=Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|date=19 November 2010|publisher=BRILL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQOJJiyOyH8C&amp;pg=227&amp;|isbn=90-04-18791-X|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] suggested that Dashavatara gave a "rough idea" of vertebrate evolution: a fish, a tortoise, a boar, a man-lion, a dwarf and then four men (Kalki is not yet born).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cover Story: Haldane: Life Of A Prodigious Mind | journal=[[Science Reporter]] | year=1992 | volume=29 | pages=46 | publisher=Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nabinchandra Sen]] explains the Dashavatara with Darwin's evolution in his ''Raivatak''.&lt;ref name="Sen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amiya P. Sen|title=Explorations in Modern Bengal, C. 1800-1900: Essays on Religion, History, and Culture|year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=978-81-908918-6-8|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. D. Deshmukh]] also remarked on the "striking" similarity between Darwin's theory and the Dashavatara.&lt;ref name="Deshmukh1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chintaman Dwarkanath Deshmukh|title=Aspects of Development|page = 33|year=1972|publisher=Young Asia Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Vaishnava Hindus reject this "Avataric Evolutionism" concept. For example, ISKCON's Prakashanand states that this apologeticism degrades the divine status of Rama and Krishna, unduly sequences Rama as inferior to Krishna, both to the Buddha. Rama and Krishna are supremely divine, each right and perfect for the circumstances they appeared in, states Prakashanand.&lt;ref name="Brown2012p182"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

The algorithm was developed by [[Latanya Arvette Sweeney]] in 1997&amp;minus;98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Latanya Sweeney|title=Datafly: a system for providing anonymity in medical data|url=http://dataprivacylab.org/datafly/|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Sweeney, Datafly: a system for providing anonymity in medical data. Database Security, XI: Status and Prospects, T. Lin and S. Qian (eds), Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1998.[http://dataprivacylab.org/datafly/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymization is achieved by automatically generalizing, substituting, inserting, and removing information as appropriate without losing many of the details found within the data. The method can be used on-the-fly in [[Role-based access control|role-based]] security within an institution, and in [[batch processing|batch]] mode for [[Import and export of data|exporting data]] from an institution.
Organizations release and receive medical data with all explicit [[identifier]]s -- such as name -- removed, in the erroneous belief that [[Physician–patient privilege|patient confidentiality]] is maintained because the resulting data look anonymous. However the remaining data can be used to re-identify individuals by linking or matching the data to other databases or by looking at unique characteristics found in the [[field (computer science)|field]]s and [[row (database)|records]] of the [[database]] itself.

The Datafly algorithm has been criticized for trying to achieve anonymization by over-generalization. The algorithm selects the [[attribute (computing)|attribute]] with the greatest number of distinct [[value (computer science)|value]]s as the one to generalize first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li Xiong|title=Data Anonymization - Generalization Algorithms|url=http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lxiong/cs573_s12/share/slides/0131_generalization_slawek.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">In [[thought experiment]]s philosophers occasionally imagine entities with special abilities as a way to pose tough [[Philosophical skepticism|intellectual challenges]] or highlight apparent [[paradox]]es.  Examples include:
* [[Evil demon|Descartes’ malicious demon]] – Cartesian skepticism (also called methodological skepticism) advocates the doubting of all things that cannot be justified through logic. [[Descartes]] uses three arguments to cast doubt on our ability to know objectively: the [[dream argument]], the deceiving God argument, and the malicious demon argument. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dcarg.htm Important Arguments from Descartes' Meditations] by [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/ David Banach] Department of Philosophy, St. Anselm College (retrieved 8-24-2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Since our senses cannot put us in contact with external objects themselves, but only with our mental images of such objects, we can have no absolute certainty that anything exists in the external world. In the evil demon argument Descartes proposes an entity who is capable of deceiving us to such a degree that we have reason to doubt the totality of what our senses tell us.
* [[Laplace's demon]] is a hypothetical all-knowing being who knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, and therefore could use [[Newton's laws]] to reveal the entire course of cosmic events, past and future.  Based upon the philosophical proposition of [[causal determinism]].
* [[Maxwell's demon]] can distinguish between fast and slow moving molecules.  If this demon only let fast moving molecules through a trapdoor to a container, the temperature inside the container would increase without any work being applied.  Such a scenario violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].
* Morton's demon stands at the gateway of a person's senses and lets in facts that agree with that person's beliefs while deflecting those that do not. This demon is used to explain the phenomenon of [[confirmation bias]].
* In aphorism 341 of [[The Gay Science]], [[Nietzsche]] puts forth his [[eternal recurrence]] concept.  In it, he employs a demon with special metaphysical knowledge as an agent for forcing reevaluation of perspective on one's own life.
* The [[Darwinian Demon]] is a hypothetical organism which can simultaneously maximize all aspects of its fitness.

==Similar entities==
There are other creatures which feature in thought experiments about philosophy. One such creature is a [[utility monster]], a creature which derives much more utility (such as enjoyment) from resources than other beings, and hence under a strict utilitarian system would have more or all of the available resources directed to it. [[Newcomb's paradox]] supposes a being who is believed to be capable of predicting human behavior; [[Robert Nozick]] suggested a "being from another planet, with an advanced technology and science, whom you know to be friendly".&lt;ref name="nozick"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Nozick |title=Essays in Honor of Carl G.

{{Emotion}}

'''Fear''' is a feeling induced by perceived danger or [[threat]] that occurs in certain types of [[organisms]], which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in [[behavior]], such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a [[risk]] to body or life. The fear response arises from the [[perception]] of [[Risk|danger]] leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the [[fight-or-flight response]]), which in extreme cases of fear ([[horror and terror]]) can be a freeze response or [[paralysis]]. 
 
In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of [[cognition]] and learning. Thus fear is judged as [[rational]] or appropriate and [[irrational]] or inappropriate. An '''irrational fear''' is called a [[phobia]].

[[Psychologist]]s such as [[John B. Watson]], [[Robert Plutchik]], and [[Paul Ekman]] have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or [[innate]] emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as [[acute stress reaction]], [[anger]], [[angst]], [[anxiety]], fright, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], [[joy]], [[panic]], and [[sadness]]. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion [[anxiety]], which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Öhman, A. (2000). "Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives". In M. Lewis &amp; J. M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.). ''Handbook of emotions''. pp. 573–593. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=Olsson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Olsson | first1 = A. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = E. A. | doi = 10.1038/nn1968 | title = Social learning of fear | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 1095–1102 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17726475| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals’ fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, M.J. and Burrow, R., 2017. The function of fear in institutional maintenance: Feeling frightened as an essential ingredient in haute cuisine. Organization Studies&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Fear''' is a primeval emotion that humans have known since they were very young. Even as a child, humans typically have not experienced real fear at this age, but a child develops a fear of the monster in their closet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Many physiological changes in the body are associated with fear, summarized as the [[fight-or-flight response]]. An inborn response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate ([[hyperventilation]]), heart rate, vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blushing and sanskadania of the central vessels (pooling),  increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing "goose bumps", or more clinically, [[piloerection]] (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose ([[hyperglycemia]]), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and "butterflies in the stomach" ([[dyspepsia]]). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edmundson|first=Laurel Duphiney|title=The Neurobiology of Fear|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro00/web2/Edmundson.html|publisher=Serendip|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.

==Causes==
People develop specific fears as a result of learning. This has been studied in psychology as [[fear conditioning]], beginning with John B. Watson's [[Little Albert experiment]] in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a ball of cotton.

Fear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, he or she may develop a fear of wells, heights ([[acrophobia]]), enclosed spaces ([[claustrophobia]]), or water ([[aquaphobia]]). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps, the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.

Fear is affected by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared [[polio]], a disease that can lead to paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001402.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129024916/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001402.htm |archivedate=2017-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Display rules]] affect how likely people are to show the facial expression of fear and other emotions.

Although many fears are learned, the capacity to fear is part of [[human nature]]. Many studies {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} have found that certain fears (e.g. animals, heights) are much more common than others (e.g. flowers, clouds). These fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory. This phenomenon is known as [[preparedness (learning)|preparedness]]. Because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce, preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Öhman|first1=Arne|last2=Mineka|first2=Susan|title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning|journal=Psychological Review|date=2001|volume=108|issue=3|pages=483–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483|pmid=11488376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, different fears may be different [[adaptation]]s that have been useful in our evolutionary past. They may have developed during different time periods. Some fears, such as fear of heights, may be common to all [[mammal]]s and developed during the [[mesozoic]] period. Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all [[simian]]s and developed during the [[cenozoic]] time period. Still others, such as fear of mice and insects, may be unique to humans and developed during the [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] time periods (when mice and insects become important carriers of infectious diseases and harmful for crops and stored foods).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bracha | first1 = H. | title = Human brain evolution and the "Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008 | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 827–853 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16563589| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fear is high only if the observed risk and seriousness both are high, and it is low if risk or seriousness is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fear of Victimization: A Look at the Proximate Causes|journal= Social Forces |year=1983|volume= 61 |issue=4|pages= 1033–1043 | doi=10.1093/sf/61.4.1033|last1= Warr |first1= M. |last2= Stafford |first2= M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top 10 types in the U.S.===
In a 2005 [[Gallup Poll]] (U.S.), a national sample of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 were asked what they feared the most. The question was open-ended and participants were able to say whatever they wanted. The top ten fears were, in order: [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]], [[Fear of spiders|spiders]], [[Fear of death|death]], [[failure]], [[war]], [[Fear of crime|criminal]] or [[gang violence]], [[Fear of being alone|being alone]], the [[future]], and [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/15439/What-Frightens-Americas-Youth.aspx Gallup Poll: What Frightens America's Youth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121100308/http://www.gallup.com/poll/15439/What-Frightens-Americas-Youth.aspx |date=2008-11-21 }}, gallup.com (29 March 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an estimate of what people fear the most, book author Bill Tancer analyzed the most frequent online queries that involved the phrase, "fear of..." following the assumption that people tend to seek information on the issues that concern them the most. His top ten list of fears published 2008 consisted of [[Fear of flying|flying]], [[Acrophobia|heights]], [[Coulrophobia|clown]]s, [[Fear of intimacy|intimacy]], death, [[Social rejection|rejection]], [[Fear of people|people]], [[Ophidiophobia|snakes]], failure, and [[Driving phobia|driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Tancer, B. |title= ''Click: What millions of people are doing online and why it matters''|publisher= Hyperion |date=September 2, 2008| isbn= 978-1401323042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fear of death===
{{Main|Fear of death}}
Death anxiety is multidimensional; it covers "fears related to one's own death, the death of others, fear of the unknown after death, fear of obliteration, and fear of the dying process, which includes fear of a slow death and a painful death".&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=PS|title=Perceived self-efficacy domains as predictors of fear of the unknown and fear of dying among older adults|journal=Psychol Aging|date=September 2003|volume=18|issue=3|pages=474–86|pmid=14518809|doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.3.474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death anxiety is one's uncertainty to dying. However, there is a more severe form of having a fear of death, which is known as Thanatophobia, which is anxiety over death that becomes debilitating or keeps a person from living their life.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}

The [[Yale]] philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] examined fear of death in a 2007 Yale open course&lt;ref name="Kagan"&gt;[[Shelly Kagan|Kagan, Shelly]]. [http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-22 Lecture 22: Fear of Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309221733/http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-22 |date=2012-03-09 }} in [http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-1 PHIL 176: Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609203506/http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-1 |date=2017-06-09 }}. Yale Open Course 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; by examining the following questions: Is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response? What conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death? What is meant by fear, and how much fear is appropriate? According to Kagan for fear in general to make sense, three conditions should be met:
# the object of fear needs to be "something bad"
# there needs to be a non-negligible chance that the bad state of affairs will happen
# there needs to be some uncertainty about the bad state of affairs
The amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of "the bad". If the three conditions are not met, fear is an inappropriate emotion. He argues, that death does not meet the first two criteria, even if death is a "deprivation of good things" and even if one believes in a painful afterlife. Because death is certain, it also does not meet the third criterion, but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies ''may'' be cause to a sense of fear.&lt;ref name="Kagan" /&gt;

In a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men, aged 65–87, low [[self-efficacy]] predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. Fear of death was measured by a "Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale" which included the 8 subscales Fear of Dying, Fear of the Dead, Fear of Being Destroyed, Fear for Significant Others, Fear of the Unknown, Fear of Conscious Death, Fear for the Body After Death, and Fear of Premature Death. In [[hierarchical multiple regression]] analysis the most potent predictors of death fears were low "spiritual health efficacy", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low "instrumental efficacy", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.&lt;ref name="Fry"/&gt;

Psychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear; however, empirical research on this topic has been equivocal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. "Intrinsic religiosity", as opposed to mere "formal religious involvement", has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety.&lt;ref name="Fry"/&gt; In a 1976 study of people of various Christian denominations, those who were most firm in their faith, who attended religious services weekly, were the least afraid of dying. The survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and "religious concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/1384409|author=Kahoe, R. D., &amp; Dunn, R. F.|year = 1976|title=The fear of death and religious attitudes and behavior|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume = 14 |issue = 4|pages = 379–382|jstor =1384409|last2=Dunn}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=citation is not peer-reviewed|date=February 2014}}

In a 2006 study of white, Christian men and women the hypothesis was tested that traditional, church-centered religiousness and de-institutionalized spiritual seeking are ways of approaching fear of death in old age. Both religiousness and spirituality were related to positive psychosocial functioning, but only church-centered religiousness protected subjects against the fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1300/J496v18n02_08 | author = Wink, P. | year = 2006 | title = Who is afraid of death?

===Fear of the unknown===
{{See also|Xenophobia|Neophobia}}
Fear of the unknown or '''irrational fear''' is caused by negative thinking ([[worry]]) which arises from [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears, a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat. Many people are scared of the "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use '''F'''alse '''E'''vidence '''A'''ppearing '''R'''eal as a definition, alternatively therapists use it as acronym for '''F'''eeling frightened, '''E'''xpecting bad things to happen, '''A'''ctions and attitudes that can help, and '''R'''ewards and results in Rx programs like [[Coping Cat]]. Such fear can create [[comorbidity]] with the anxiety disorder umbrella.&lt;ref name="BarrettLewis2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Feldman Barrett|author2=Michael Lewis|author3=Jeannette M. Haviland-Jones|title=Handbook of Emotions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDBqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA751|year=2016|publisher=Guilford Publications|isbn=978-1-4625-2534-8|pages=751–773|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302032508/https://books.google.com/books?id=bDBqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA751|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. For example, "continuation of scholarly education" is perceived by many educators as a risk that may cause them fear and stress,&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burton, L.D.|year=2011|title= Fear|journal=Journal of Research on Christian Education|volume= 20|pages= 113–116|doi=10.1080/10656219.2011.592801|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research. That can lead to habits such as [[laziness]] and procrastination.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The ambiguity of situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety in addition to other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly, for example, in war-ridden places or in places of conflict, terrorism, abuse, etc. Poor [[parenting]] that instills fear can also debilitate a child's psyche development or personality. For example, parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fox, E.R.|title=Fear of the unknown|journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=7|issue=3|pages=22–25|year=1987|doi=10.1108/17578043200800026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing  a sense of [[equanimity]] to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and as an essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.

Often laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of [[fear conditioning|conditioned fear]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Maria|author2=LeDoux, Joseph|title=Differential Contribution of Dorsal and Ventral Medial Prefrontal|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|year=1995|volume=109|issue=4|pages=681–688|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.109.4.681|pmid=7576212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (''Rattus norvegicus'') to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cammarota|first=Martín|author2=Bevilaqua, Lia R. M., Kerr, Daniel, Medina, Jorge, H., Izquierdo, Iván|title=Inhibition of mRNA and Protein Synthesis in the CA1 Region of the Dorsal Hippocampus Blocks Reinstallment of an Extinguished Conditioned Fear Response|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=Feb 1, 2003|volume=23|issue=3|pages=737–741|pmid=12574401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. However the rats did show signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a [[conditioned response]], and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.

Species-specific defense reactions (SSDRs) or [[avoidance learning]] in nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, it is how animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight-or-fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression and freeze response to threats, which is controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Stephen|title=21st Century Psychology: A Reference Handbook, Vol. 1|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publication, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-4968-2|pages=282–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.

As with many functions of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robert|first=Patrick|title=The Amygdala and Its Allies|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html|website=2002|publisher=The Brain|accessdate=2 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074559/http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[amygdala]] communicates both directions between the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[hypothalamus]], the [[sensory cortex]], the [[hippocampus]], [[thalamus]], [[septum]], and the  [[brainstem]]. The amygdala plays an important role in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for [[associative learning]], and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2489204 | pmid=17880916 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.08.002 | volume=39 | issue=3 | title=Exploring human freeze responses to a threat stressor | journal=J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry | pages=292–304 | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = NB | last2 = Richey | first2 = JA | last3 = Zvolensky | first3 = MJ | last4 = Maner | first4 = JK| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracha|first=H.S.|journal= CNS Spectr|date=Sep 9, 2004|volume=9|pages=679–685|pmid=15337864|issue=9|title=Freeze, flight, fight, fright, faint: adaptationist perspectives on the acute stress response spectrum|doi=10.1017/s1092852900001954|url=http://cogprints.org/5014/1/2004_C.N.S_Five_Fs_of_FEAR%2D%2DFreeze_Flight_Fight_Fright_Faint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of [[S.M.

[[Robert C. Bolles]] (1970), a researcher at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools that were used to measure this tendency were out of touch with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolles|first=Robert|title=Species-Specific Defense Reactions and Avoidance Learning|journal=Psychological Review|year=1970|volume=77|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.1037/h0028589}}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Mary|author2=Masterson|title=Species-Specific Defense Reactions and Avoidance Learning|journal=The Pavolovian Journal of Biological Science|year=1982|volume=17|issue=5|pages=204–214|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03001275|doi=10.1007/BF03001275|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become "wild" again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, are seen to be more important in SSDRs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened. The wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species-specific defense reactions or behaviors. Bolles believed that SSDRs are conditioned through [[Pavlovian]] conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDRs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiein|first=Stephen|title=Biological Influences on Learning|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Mississippi State University|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072490462/student_view0/chapter10/chapter_outline.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080132/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072490462/student_view0/chapter10/chapter_outline.html|archivedate=2008-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael S.

* Sensory cortex organizes information for dissemination to the hypothalamus (fight or flight), amygdalae (fear), hippocampus (memory)

The brain structures that are the center of most neurobiological events associated with fear are the two [[amygdalae]], located behind the pituitary gland. Each amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning.&lt;ref name=Olsson/&gt; They are essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdalae generate the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Ben (2004).

Pathogens can suppress amygdala activity. Rats infected with the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within the body of the cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Pheromones and why fear can be contagious====
In threatening situations insects, aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, and mammals emit odorant substances, initially called alarm substances, which are chemical signals now called alarm [[pheromones]] ("Schreckstoff" in German). This is to defend themselves and at the same time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing, defensive behavior, or dispersion depending on circumstances and species. For example, stressed rats release odorant cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal.

After the discovery of pheromones in 1959, alarm pheromones were first described in 1968 in ants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moser | first1 = JC | last2 = Brownlee | first2 = RC | last3 = Silverstein | first3 = R | date = Apr 1968 | title = Alarm pheromones of the ant atta texana |journal = J Insect Physiol | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 529–35 | doi=10.1016/0022-1910(68)90068-1| pmid = 5649232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earthworms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ressler | first1 = RH | last2 = Cialdini | first2 = RB | last3 = Ghoca | first3 = ML | last4 = Kleist | first4 = SM | year = 1968 | title = Alarm pheromone in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris |journal = Science | volume = 161 | issue = 3841| pages = 597–9 | doi=10.1126/science.161.3841.597| pmid = 5663305 |bibcode = 1968Sci...161..597R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and four years later also found in mammals, both mice and rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rottman | first1 = SJ | last2 = Snowdon | first2 = CT | date = Dec 1972 | title = Demonstration and analysis of an alarm pheromone in mice |journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 483–90 | doi=10.1037/h0033703| pmid = 4649187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two decades identification and characterization of these pheromones proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals, including fish, but it was not until 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm pheromones was gleaned.

Earlier, in 1985, a link between odors released by stressed rats and [[pain perception]] was discovered: unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid-mediated analgesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fanselow | first1 = MS | year = 1985|pmid=3843728| title = Odors released by stressed rats produce opioid analgesia in unstressed rats |journal = Behav.

By using the [[Behavioural despair test|forced swimming test]] in rats as a model of fear-induction, the first mammalian "alarm substance" was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = EL | last2 = Bilitzke | first2 = PJ | date = Aug 1990 | title = A possible alarm substance in the forced swimming test |journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 233–9 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(90)90306-o| pmid = 2255725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, this "alarm substance" was shown to fulfill criteria for pheromones: well-defined behavioral effect, species specificity, minimal influence of experience and control for nonspecific arousal. Rat activity testing with the alarm pheromone, and their preference/avoidance for odors from cylinders containing the pheromone, showed that the pheromone had very low [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = EL | date = Oct 1991 | title = Alarm substance emitted by rats in the forced-swim test is a low volatile pheromone |journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 723–7 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(91)90009-d| pmid = 1775546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 a connection between alarm chemosignals in mice and their [[immune system|immune response]] was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cocke | first1 = R | last2 = Moynihan | first2 = JA | last3 = Cohen | first3 = N | last4 = Grota | first4 = LJ | last5 = Ader | first5 = R | date = Mar 1993 | title = Exposure to conspecific alarm chemosignals alters immune responses in BALB/c mice |journal = Brain Behav Immun | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 36–46 | doi=10.1006/brbi.1993.1004| pmid = 8471798 | title-link = BALB/c mice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pheromone production in mice was found to be associated with or mediated by the [[pituitary gland]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = EL | date = Jun 1994 | title = The pituitary mediates production or release of an alarm chemosignal in rats |journal = Horm Behav | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 139–45 | doi=10.1006/hbeh.1994.1011| pmid = 7927280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was demonstrated that rats' alarm pheromones had different effects on the "recipient" rat (the rat perceiving the pheromone) depending which body region they were released from: Pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat, e.g. caused sniffing or movement, whereas pheromone secreted from the rat's anal area induced [[autonomic nervous system]] stress responses, like an increase in core body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiyokawa Y|title=Alarm pheromones with different functions are released from different regions of the body surface of male rats|journal=Chem Senses|year=2004|volume=29|issue=1|pages=35–40|pmid=14752038|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjh004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831175230/|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones, it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiyokawa Y|title=Alarm pheromone increases defensive and risk assessment behaviors in male rats|journal=Physiol. Behav.|year=2006|volume=87|issue=2|pages=383–7|pmid=16337975|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.11.003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830233838/|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its acoustic [[startle reflex]] was enhanced.

It was not until 2011 that a link between severe pain, neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found: real time [[RT-PCR]] analysis of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of [[proinflammatory cytokines]] in deep brain structures, namely of [[IL-1β]], heteronuclear [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]] and [[c-fos]] mRNA expressions in both the [[paraventricular nucleus]] and the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]], and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma ([[corticosterone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arakawa H|title=The role of neuroinflammation in the release of aversive odor cues from footshock-stressed rats: Implications for the neural mechanism of alarm pheromones|pmid=20888127|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|year= 2011 |volume=36|issue=4|pages=557–68|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[emotion#neurocircuitry|neurocircuit]] for how rats perceive alarm pheromones was shown to be related to the [[hypothalamus]], [[brainstem]], and [[amygdala]]e, all of which are evolutionary ancient structures deep inside or in the case of the brainstem underneath the brain away from the cortex, and involved in the [[fight-or-flight response]], as is the case in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiyokawa Y|title=Mapping the neural circuit activated by alarm pheromone perception by c-Fos immunohistochemistry|journal=Brain Res.|year=2005|volume=1043|issue=1–2|pages=145–54|pmid=15862528|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2005.02.061|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131924/|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats has been used to evaluate the degree to which [[anxiolytic]]s can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this the change in the [[startle response#acoustic startle reflex|acoustic startle reflex]] of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely [[midazolam]], [[phenelzine]] (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), [[propranolol]], a nonselective [[beta blocker]], [[clonidine]], an [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor#agonist|alpha 2 adrenergic agonist]] or [[CP-154,526]], a [[corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Inagaki H|title=The alarm pheromone in male rats as a unique anxiety model: psychopharmacological evidence using anxiolytics|journal= Pharmacol Biochem Behav|year= 2010 |volume=94|issue=4|pages=575–9|pmid=19969015|doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2009.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty development of odor discrimination impairs the [[perception]] of pheromones and pheromone-related behavior, like [[aggression|aggressive behavior]] and mating in male rats: The enzyme [[MAPK7|Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7]] (MAPK7) has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains, but absent in most regions of adult rat brains. [[Conditional gene knockout|Conditional deletion]] of the MAPK7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone-mediated behaviors, including aggression and mating in male mice. These behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone, by physical immobility, by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression. Using mouse urine as a natural pheromone-containing solution, it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones, and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zou J|title= Conditional deletion of ERK5 MAP kinase in the nervous system impairs pheromone information processing and pheromone-evoked behaviors|journal= PLoS ONE|year= 2013 |volume=8|issue=10|pages=e76901|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0076901|pmid= 24130808|pmc= 3793934|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...876901Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, alleviation of an acute fear response because a friendly peer (or in biological language: an affiliative [[conspecific]]) [[tend and befriend|tends and befriends]] is called "social buffering". The term is in analogy to the 1985 "buffering" hypothesis in psychology, where [[social support]] has been proven to mitigate the negative health effects of alarm pheromone mediated distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310 |title=Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis |year=1985 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |last2=Wills |first2=Thomas A. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=310–57 |pmid=3901065}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a "social pheromone" is suggested by the recent discovery that olfactory signals are responsible in mediating the "social buffering" in male rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Yuji|last1=Takahashi|first2=Yasushi|last2=Kiyokawa|first3=Yuka|last3=Kodama|first4=Sayaka|last4=Arata|title=Olfactory signals mediate social buffering of conditioned fear responses in male rats|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|pages=46–51|volume=240|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.11.017|pmid=23183219|first5=Yukari|last5=Takeuchi|first6=Yuji|last6=Mori|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831133047/|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social buffering" was also observed to mitigate the conditioned fear responses of honeybees.  A bee colony exposed to an environment of high threat of predation did not show increased aggression and aggressive-like gene expression patterns in individual bees, but decreased aggression. That the bees did not simply [[habituation|habituate]] to threats is suggested by the fact that the disturbed colonies also decreased their foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rittschof CC|author2= Robinson GE|title= Manipulation of colony environment modulates honey bee aggression and brain gene expression|journal= Genes Brain Behav|year= 2013 |volume=12|issue=8|pages=802–11|doi=10.1111/gbb.12087|pmid= 24034579|pmc=3863782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists have proposed in 2012 that fear pheromones evolved as molecules of "keystone significance", a term coined in analogy to [[keystone species]]. Pheromones may determine [[species richness|species compositions]] and affect rates of energy and material exchange in an [[community(ecology)|ecological community]]. Thus pheromones generate structure in a [[food web]] and play critical roles in maintaining [[Ecosystem health|natural system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ferrer RP|author2=Zimmer RK|pmid=23111129|title=Community ecology and the evolution of molecules of keystone significance|journal= Biol Bull|year= 2012 |volume=223|issue=2|pages=167–77|doi=10.1086/BBLv223n2p167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fear pheromones in humans====
Evidence of chemosensory alarm signals in humans has emerged slowly: Although alarm pheromones have not been physically isolated and their chemical structures have not been identified in humans so far, there is evidence for their presence. [[Androstadienone]], for example, a steroidal, endogenous odorant, is a pheromone candidate found in human sweat, axillary hair and plasma. The closely related compound [[androstenone]] is involved in communicating dominance, aggression or competition; sex hormone influences on androstenone perception in humans showed a high testosterone level related to heightened androstenone sensitivity in men, a high testosterone level related to [[unhappiness]] in response to androstenone in men, and a high estradiol level related to disliking of androstenone in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lübke KT|author2= Pause BM|title=Sex-hormone dependent perception of androstenone suggests its involvement in communicating competition and aggression|journal= Physiol Behav|year= 2014|volume=123|pages=136–41|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.10.016|pmid= 24184511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German study from 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human sweat from a dozen people was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily distinguish exercise-induced sweat from room air, three could also distinguish exercise-induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat. The [[startle reflex|acoustic startle reflex]] response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by [[electromyograph]] analysis of the orbital muscle, which is responsible for the eyeblink component. This showed for the first time that fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient's "defensive behavior" prior to the subjects' conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prehn | first1 = A | last2 = Ohrt | first2 = A | last3 = Sojka | first3 = B | last4 = Ferstl | first4 = R | last5 = Pause | first5 = BM | year = 2006 | title = Chemosensory anxiety signals augment the startle reflex in humans |journal = Neurosci. Lett. | volume = 394 | issue = 2| pages = 127–30 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.10.012| pmid = 16257486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In analogy to the social buffering of rats and honeybees in response to chemosignals, induction of [[empathy]] by "smelling anxiety" of another person has been found in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prehn-Kristensen | first1 = A. | last2 = Wiesner | first2 = C. | last3 = Bergmann | first3 = T.O. | last4 = Wolff | first4 = S. | last5 = Jansen | first5 = O. | last6 = Mehdorn | first6 = H.M. | year = 2009 | title = Induction of empathy by the smell of anxiety |journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 6| page = e5987 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005987| author7 = and others | displayauthors = 6 | last8 = Pause | first8 = Bettina M. | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5987P | pmid=19551135 | pmc=2695008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2013 provided brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be [[gender-specific]]. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain [[MRI]]. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no significant differences were found in the [[olfactory bulb]], the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radulescu | first1 = AR | last2 = Mujica-Parodi | first2 = LR | date = Jul 2013 | title = Human gender differences in the perception of conspecific alarm chemosensory cues |journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 7| page = e68485 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068485|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...868485R | pmid=23894310 | pmc=3722227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[approach–avoidance conflict|approach-avoidance task]] was set up where volunteers seeing either an angry or a happy cartoon face on a computer screen pushed away or pulled toward them a joystick as fast as possible. Volunteers smelling anandrostadienone, masked with clove oil scent responded faster, especially to angry faces, than those smelling clove oil only, which was interpreted as anandrostadienone-related activation of the fear system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frey MC|title=Androstadienone in motor reactions of men and women toward angry faces|journal= Percept Mot Skills|year= 2012 |volume=114|issue=3|pages=807–25|pmid=22913022|doi=10.2466/07.16.22.28.PMS.114.3.807-825}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential mechanism of action is, that [[androstadienone]] alters the "emotional face processing". Androstadienone is known to influence activity of the [[fusiform gyrus]] which is relevant for [[face perception|face recognition]].

==Management==

===Pharmaceutical===
A drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobias via the amygdalae is the use of [[glucocorticoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sandi | first1 = C. | title = Healing anxiety disorders with glucocorticoids | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1103410108 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 16 | pages = 6343–6344 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21482789| pmc = 3080972|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.6343S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, glucocorticoid receptors in the central nuclei of the amygdalae were disrupted in order to better understand the mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning. The glucocorticoid receptors were inhibited using lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase injected into mice. Results showed that disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors prevented conditioned fear behavior. The mice were subjected to auditory cues which caused them to freeze normally. However, a reduction of freezing was observed in the mice that had inhibited glucocorticoid receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Psychology ===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] has been successful in helping people overcome their fear. Because fear is more complex than just forgetting or deleting [[memory|memories]], an active and successful approach involves people repeatedly confronting their fears. By confronting their fears in a safe manner a person can suppress the "fear-triggering memories" or stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=J. S. |last2=Tolin |first2=D.

[[Exposure therapy]] has known to have helped up to 90% of people with specific [[phobias]] to significantly decrease their fear over time.&lt;ref name=Travis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Travis | first1 = John  | year = 2004 | title = Fear not: Scientists are learning how people can unlearn fear | journal = Science News | volume = 165 | issue = 3 | pages = 42–44 | jstor =  4014925| doi = 10.2307/4014925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; 

Another psychological treatment is systematic desensitization, which is a type of behavior therapy used to completely remove the fear or produce a disgusted response to this fear and replace it. The replacement that occurs will be relaxation and will occur through conditioning. Through conditioning treatments, muscle tensioning will lessen and deep breathing techniques will aid in de-tensioning. 

=== '''Other Treatments''' ===
Other methods for treating or coping with one's fear was suggested by life coach Robin Sharma. A person could keep a journal in which they write down rational thoughts regarding their fears. Journal entries are a healthy method of expressing one's fears without compromising their safety or causing uncertainty. Another suggestion is a fear ladder. To create a fear ladder, one must write down all of their fears and score them on a scale of one to ten. Next, the person addresses their phobia, starting with the lowest number. 

Finding solace in religion is another method to cope with one's fear. Having something to answer your questions regarding your fears, such as, what happens after death or if there is an afterlife, can help mitigate one's fear of death because there is no room for uncertainty as their questions are answered. Religion offers a method of being able to understand and make sense of one's fears rather than ignore them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fearof.net/cure-your-fear-phobia-treatment/|title=Cure Your Fear - Phobia Treatment|work=FearOf.net|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[File:Guido Reni - Massacre of the Innocents detail3 - Pinacoteca Nazionale Bologna.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Guido Reni]] c. 1611]]

=== Death ===

The fear of the end of life and its existence is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing at the same time that social formation was changing. One can say{{by whom|date=October 2016}} that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.

When people are faced with their own thoughts of death, they either accept that they are dying or will die because they have lived a full life or they will experience fear. A theory was developed in response to this, which is called the Terror Management Theory. The theory states that a person's cultural worldviews (religion, values, etc.) will mitigate the terror associated with the fear of death through avoidance. To help manage their terror, they find solace in their death-denying beliefs, such as their religion. Another way people cope with their death related fears is pushing any thoughts of death into the future or by avoiding these thoughts all together through distractions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Jamie L.|last2=Pyszczynski|first2=Tom|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jeff|last4=Solomon|first4=Sheldon|date=August 2000|title=Fleeing the Body: A Terror Management Perspective on the Problem of Human Corporeality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0403_1|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=4|issue=3|pages=200–218|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0403_1|issn=1088-8683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are methods for one coping with the terror associated with their fear of death, not everyone suffers from these same uncertainties. People who have lived a full life, typically do not fear death because they believe that they have lived their life to the fullest.

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Fear of God|Religious paranoia|Category:Religion and death}}
Religions are filled with different fears that humans have had throughout many centuries. The fears aren't just metaphysical (including the problems of life and death) but are also moral. Death is seen as a boundary to another world. That world would always be different depending on how each individual lived their lives. The origins of this intangible fear are not found in the present world. In a sense we can assume that fear was a big influence on things such as morality. This assumption, however, flies in the face of concepts such as [[moral absolutism]] and [[moral universalism]] – which would hold that our morals are rooted in either the divine or natural laws of the universe, and would not be generated by any human feeling, thought or emotion. 

From a theological perspective, the word "fear" encompasses more than simple fear. Robert B. Strimple says that fear includes the ". . . convergence of awe, reverence, adoration. . .".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH01/03a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version, sometimes replace the word "fear" with "reverence".

Fear in religion can be seen throughout the years, however, the most prominent example would be The Crusades. Pope Urban II allowed for Christian mercenary troops to be sent on a mission in order to recover the Holy Lands from the Muslims. However, the message was misinterpreted and as a result, innocent people were slaughtered. Although the Crusades were meant to stay between the Muslims and the Christians, the hate spread onto the Jewish culture. Jewish people who feared for their lives, gave into the forced conversion of Christianity because they believed this would secure their safety. Other Jewish people feared betraying their God by conceding to a conversion, and instead, secured their own fate, which was death. It can also be argued that Christians feared their religion not being the primary religion, and this is why they committed mass murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-crusades/|title=How the Crusades Affected Medieval Jews in Europe and Palestine {{!}} My Jewish Learning|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manipulation ===
{{Further|Culture of fear|Fear mongering|Fear appeal|Psychological warfare|Tactics of terrorism#Fear|List of causes of death by rate}}
Fear may be politically and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which would otherwise be widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be widely supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. 

Fear can alter how a person thinks or reacts to situations because fear has the power to inhibit one's rational way of thinking. As a result, people who do not experience fear, are able to use fear as a tool to manipulate others. People who are experiencing fear, seek preservation through safety and can be manipulated by a person who is there to provide that safety that is being sought after. "When we're afraid, a manipulator can talk us out of the truth we see right in front of us. Words become more real than reality" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychopathsandlove.com/fear-and-manipulation/|title=Fear and Manipulation: Perfect Together {{!}} Psychopaths and Love|website=psychopathsandlove.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, a manipulator is able to use our fear to manipulate us out the truth and instead make us believe and trust in their truth. Politicians are notorious for using fear to manipulate the people into supporting their will. Through keywords and key phrases such as, "it is for your safety," or "it is for the safety of this country," politicians invoke fear within people that their safety is at stake, and people will ultimately follow in line in order for their safety to be restored. 

=== Fiction and mythology ===

''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'' is a German fairy tale dealing with the topic of not knowing fear.
Many stories also include characters who fear the antagonist of the plot. One important characteristic of historical and mythical [[hero]]es across cultures is to be fearless in the face of big and often lethal enemies.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Athletics ===
In the world of athletics fear is often used as a means of motivation to not fail.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D.E. 2001"&gt;Conroy, D.E., Poczwardowski, A. and Henschen, K.P. (2001). Evaluative criteria and consequences associated with failure and success for elite athletes and performing artists. Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 13, 300/322.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation involves using fear in a way that increases the chances of a positive outcome. In this case the fear that is being created is initially a cognitive state to the receiver.&lt;ref name="Lazarus, R.S. 1991"&gt;Lazarus, R.S. (1991). Emotion and Adaptation. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This initial state is what generates the first response of the athlete, this response generates a possibility of fight or flight reaction by the athlete (receiver), which in turn will increase or decrease the possibility of success or failure in the certain situation for the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Birney, R. C., Burdick, H., &amp; Teevan, R. C. (1969). ''Fear of failure''. Van Nostrand-Reinhold Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of time that the athlete has to determine this decision is small but it is still enough time for the receiver to make a determination through cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R. S. (1991). Emotion and adaptation. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the decision is made quickly, the decision is determined through past events that have been experienced by the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Duda, J. L. (1993). Goals: A social-cognitive approach to the study of achievement motivation in sport. In R. N. Singer, M. Murphey, &amp; L. K. Tennant (Eds.), Handbook of research on sport psychology (pp. 421–436). New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of these past events will determine how the athlete will make his cognitive decision in the spilt second that he or she has.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D.E. 2001"/&gt;

Fear of failure as described above has been studied frequently in the field of sport psychology. Many scholars have tried to determine how often fear of failure is triggered within athletes. As well as what personalities of athletes most often choose to use this type of motivation. Studies have also been conducted to determine the success rate of this method of motivation.

Murray's Exploration in Personal (1938) was one of the first studies that actually identified fear of failure as an actual motive to avoid failure or to achieve success. His studies suggested that inavoidance, the need to avoid failure, was found in many college-aged men during the time of his research in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H. (1938). Explorations in Personal. Oxford University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a monumental finding in the field of psychology because it allowed other researchers to better clarify how fear of failure can actually be a determinant of creating achievement goals as well as how it could be used in the actual act of achievement.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D. E. 2004"&gt;Conroy, D. E., &amp; Elliot, A. J. (2004). Fear of failure and achievement goals in sport: Addressing the issue of the chicken and the egg. ''Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping,'' ''17''(3), 271-285. doi:10.1080/1061580042000191642&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of sport, a model was created by R.S. Lazarus in 1991 that uses the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R.S. (1991). Emotion and Adaptation. Oxford University Press, New York:&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It holds that Fear of Failure results when beliefs or cognitive schemas about aversive consequences of failing are activated by situations in which failure is possible. These belief systems predispose the individual to make appraisals of threat and experience the state anxiety that is associated with Fear of Failure in evaluative situations.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D. E. 2004"&gt;Conroy, D. E., &amp; Elliot, A. J. (2004). Fear of failure and achievement goals in sport: Addressing the issue of the chicken and the egg. ''Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping,'' ''17''(3), 271-285. doi:10.1080/1061580042000191642&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lazarus, R.S. 1991"&gt;Lazarus, R.S. (1991). Emotion and Adaptation. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another study was done in 2001 by Conroy, Poczwardowski, and Henschen that created five aversive consequences of failing that have been repeated over time. The five categories include (a) experiencing shame and embarrassment, (b) devaluing one's self-estimate, (c) having an uncertain future, (d) important others losing interest, (e) upsetting important others.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D.E. 2001"/&gt; These five categories can help one infer the possibility of an individual to associate failure with one of these threat categories, which will lead them to experiencing fear of failure.

In summary, the two studies that were done above created a more precise definition of fear of failure, which is "a dispositional tendency to experience apprehension and anxiety in evaluative situations because individuals have learned that failure is associated with aversive consequences".&lt;ref name="Conroy, D. E. 2004"&gt;Conroy, D. E., &amp; Elliot, A. J. (2004). Fear of failure and achievement goals in sport: Addressing the issue of the chicken and the egg. ''Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping,'' ''17''(3), 271-285. doi:10.1080/1061580042000191642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inability to Experience Fear==

People who have damage to their [[amygdala]]e, which can be caused by a rare genetic disease known as [[Urbach–Wiethe disease]], are unable to experience fear. The disease destroys both amygdalae in late childhood. Since the discovery of the disease, there have only been 400 recorded cases. This is not debilitating; however, a lack of fear can allow someone to get into a dangerous situation they otherwise would have avoided. For example, people who possess a lack of fear would approach a known venomous snake while those who possess fear, would typically try to avoid it. Fear is an important aspect of a human being's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/16/377517810/world-with-no-fear|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-01-27|title=World With No Fear|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127000942/http://www.npr.org/2015/01/16/377517810/world-with-no-fear|archivedate=2015-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility of a lack of fear could be Antisocial Personality Disorder or more commonly known as sociopathy, which is a mental health condition where people often manipulate others. People who suffer from this disorder lack a physiological response and are capable of lying or not experiencing fear. When a person is approached by something they fear or has a phobia, the body will react in a way that conveys this fear. For example, a person who possesses Arachnophobia, or a fear of spiders, would experience a physical response such as, nausea, dizziness, or even shaking when approached by a spider. However, a person with Antisocial Personality Disorder lacks this capability and would not activate their "fight or flight" response to such fear. They also disregard the safety of others and will often put them at harm or in the way of harm. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/personality-disorders/antisocial-personality-disorder|title=Antisocial Personality Disorder {{!}} MentalHealth.gov|website=www.mentalhealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7861">'''Geometric mechanics''' is a branch of mathematics applying particular geometric methods to many areas of mechanics, from mechanics of particles and [[rigid body mechanics|rigid bodies]] to [[fluid mechanics]] to [[control theory]].

Geometric mechanics applies principally to systems for which the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] is a [[Lie group]], or a group of [[diffeomorphism]]s, or more generally where some aspect of the configuration space has this group structure. For example, the configuration space of a rigid body such as a satellite is the group of Euclidean motions (translations and rotations in space), while the configuration space for a liquid crystal is the group of diffeomorphisms coupled with an internal state (gauge symmetry or order parameter).

== Momentum map and reduction ==
One of the principal ideas of geometric mechanics is ''reduction'', which goes back to Jacobi's elimination of the node in the 3-body problem, but in its modern form is due to K. Meyer (1973) and independently J.E. Marsden and A. Weinstein (1974), both inspired by the work of Smale (1970).  Symmetry of a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian system gives rise to conserved quantities, by [[Noether's theorem]], and these conserved quantities are the components of the [[momentum map]] '''J'''.  If ''P'' is the phase space and ''G'' the symmetry group, the momentum map is a map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}:P\to\mathfrak{g}^*&lt;/math&gt;, and the reduced spaces are quotients of the level sets of '''J''' by the subgroup of ''G'' preserving the level set in question: for &lt;math&gt;\mu\in\mathfrak{g}^*&lt;/math&gt; one defines &lt;math&gt;P_\mu=\mathbf{J}^{-1}(\mu)/G_\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and this reduced space is a symplectic manifold if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a regular value of ''J''.

== Geometric integrators ==
One of the important developments arising from the geometric approach to mechanics is the incorporation of the geometry into numerical methods.
In particular symplectic and variational integrators are proving particularly accurate for long-term integration of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems.

== History ==
As a modern subject, geometric mechanics has its roots in four works written in the 1960s. These were by [[Vladimir Arnold]] (1966),  [[Stephen Smale]] (1970) and [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] (1970), and the first edition of Abraham and Marsden's ''Foundation of Mechanics'' (1967). Arnold's fundamental work showed that Euler's equations for the free rigid body are the equations for geodesic flow on the rotation group SO(3) and carried this geometric insight over to the dynamics of ideal fluids, where the rotation group is replaced by the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms.  Smale's paper on Topology and Mechanics investigates the conserved quantities arising from Noether's theorem when a Lie group of symmetries acts on a mechanical system, and defines what is now called the momentum map (which Smale calls angular momentum), and he raises questions about the topology of the energy-momentum level surfaces and the effect on the dynamics.  In his book, Souriau also considers the conserved quantities arising from the action of a group of symmetries, but he concentrates more on the geometric structures involved (for example the equivariance properties of this momentum for a wide class of symmetries), and less on questions of dynamics.

These ideas, and particularly those of Smale were central in the second edition of ''Foundations of Mechanics'' (Abraham and Marsden, 1978).

In [[philosophy]], a '''grouped event'''&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/events/ Events, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; is the experience of two or more events that occur in sequence or concurrently that can be subsequently categorized.

== Description ==
Grouped events can fall into categories depending upon whether the events are causal or acausal (noncausal), and are with or without meaning (significance). Causal&lt;ref name="dict1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/causality definition of causality at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; events are related as the subsequent event(s) are understood to be a consequence of the prior event(s).
Meaning&lt;ref name="dict2"&gt;
[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meaning definition of meaning at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; represents the purpose or significance of something.

Four categories are [[causality]], [[coincidence]], [[serendipity]], and [[synchronicity]].

'''Causality'''&lt;ref name="cause"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-process/ Causation, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; represents causal events grouped without meaning. These are common events.

'''Coincidence'''&lt;ref name="coinc"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/ Coincidence, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; represents acausal events grouped without meaning. These are less common events.

'''Serendipity'''&lt;ref name="seren"&gt;[http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/2/631 Serendipity: Anatomy of the Unsought Finding, Oxford Journals]&lt;/ref&gt; represents causal events grouped by meaning. These are rare events.

'''Synchronicity'''&lt;ref name="synch"&gt;[http://www.carl-jung.net/synchronicity.html What is Sychronicity?, Carl Jung Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; represents acausal events grouped by meaning. These events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect.

== Examples ==
A '''causality''' example is to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move. The result is expected and has no meaning.

A '''coincidence''' example is two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning. The result is unexpected, yet has no meaning (significance).

A '''serendipity''' example is finding something useful while looking for something else, such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick. The find was caused by the search, and because the find was useful, the event has meaning.

A '''sychronicity''' example is two friends who rarely visit libraries, without any planning, finding each other in a library on one day; and again without any planning, finding each other in a distant library on a later date. Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.

== Criticisms and interpretations ==
Determinism theory&lt;ref name="deter"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Causal Determinism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; argues against acausal events. However, the idea of causal determinism can neither be argued for nor against based on the scientific knoweldge at this point in time {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

Causality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale. (But not on the quantum scale, where random chance prevails.) However, even large-scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion; there is no general theory of causality in physics, and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. However, the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that entropy always increases with time, in any closed system) can be regarded as providing a direction for the "arrow of time" and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality. (See [[Causality (physics)]].)

Unlike causality, the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language/grammar and mathematics - both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups {{dubious|date=May 2016}}.

The outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance. Littlewood's Law&lt;ref name="littl"&gt;"Littlewoods's Miscellany", edited by B. Bollobás, Cambridge University Press; {{ISBN|0-521-33702-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month. Littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second, and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day.

== In popular culture ==
The 1993 book, [[The Celestine Prophecy]], by James Redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events. From the book's First Insight: "In each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences - sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny'.&lt;ref name="celes"&gt;"The Celestine Prophecy", by James Redfield; {{ISBN|0-446-51862-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a 1996 best seller, spent 165 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller list, and has now sold over 20 million copies.

The term '''''hamartia''''' derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν ''hamartánein'', which means "to miss the mark" or "to err".&lt;ref&gt;"Hamartia". ''Merriam-Webster.com''. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamartia: (Ancient Greek: ἁμαρτία) Error of Judgement or Tragic Flaw. "Hamartia". ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most often associated with [[Greek tragedy]], although it is also used in [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene J. "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" ''Laval théologique et philosophique''. 29.3 (1973) 243–255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Hamartia'' as it pertains to [[Play (theatre)|dramatic literature]] was first used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In [[tragedy]], ''hamartia'' is commonly understood to refer to the [[protagonist|protagonist’s]] error or '''tragic flaw''' that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal of their good fortune to bad.  

What qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a [[wrongdoing]]. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.

== In Aristotle's ''Poetics'' ==
[[File:6Parts Image.pdf|thumb|A list of 
the six parts of Aristotle's Greek tragedy]]
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|"Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure"—click to view a larger version]]
Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The source of ''hamartia'' is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by [[Aristotle]].

{{quote|Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents, i.e. the sort of thing they seek or avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of ''Poetics'', [[Francis Fergusson]] describes ''hamartia'' as the inner quality that initiates, as in [[Dante|Dante's]] words, a "movement of spirit" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.htmlThe Internet Classics Archive] by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Jules Brody, however, argues that "it is the height of [[irony]] that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of ''hamartia''.  Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, [[Immoral|moral deficiency]], or the like.  ''Hamartia'' is a morally neutral non-[[normative]] term, derived from the verb ''hamartano'', meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'.  And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite.  ''Hamartia'' may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information.  Finally, ''hamartia'' may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success."&lt;ref&gt;Jules Brody, "Fate, Philology, Freud," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 38.1 (April 2014): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Greek tragedy]], for a story to be "of adequate magnitude" it involves characters of high rank, [[reputation |prestige]], or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes ''hamartia'' as the quality of a [[tragic hero]] that generates that optimal balance.

{{quote|...the character between these two extremes&amp;nbsp;– that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Christian theology ==
{{Main |Hamartiology}}
''Hamartia'' is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the [[Septuagint]] and [[New Testament]]. The Hebrew (''chatá'') and its Greek equivalent (''àµaρtίa''/''hamartia'') both mean "missing the mark" or "off the mark".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2398&amp;t=KJV Strong's]'', bibclassic.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G266 Strong's]'', blueletterbible.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/miss+the+mark Legal Dictionary]'', thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are four basic usages for ''hamartia'': 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes used to mean acts of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] "by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions" as in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5:12, "all have sinned".&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes applied to the [[fall of man]] from original righteousness that resulted in humanity's innate propensity for sin, that is [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" in ''Laval théologique et philosophique.'' 29.3 (1973) 243-255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014 and&lt;br/&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as in Romans 3:9, everyone is "under the power of sin".&lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
# A third application concerns the "weakness of the flesh" and the free will to resist sinful acts. "The original inclination to sin in mankind comes from ''the weakness of the flesh''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Fifty Sermons Preached upon Several Occasions'' (J. Heptinstall for Henry Mortlock, 1707), 525. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=kSVWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22weakness+of+the+flesh%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s &lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes "personified".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Bromiley, ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'' (Eerdmans, 1985), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Romans 6:20 speaks of being enslaved to ''hamartia'' (sin).

== Tragic flaw, tragic error, and divine intervention ==
[[Aristotle]] mentions ''hamartia'' in ''Poetics''. He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (''hamartia''). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as ''tragic flaw'' or ''tragic error''.

===Critical argument for flaw===
[[Poetic justice]] describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol, 125&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of ''hamartia'' as a vice to be punished&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol,12,125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Rymer. (2014). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514581/Thomas-Rymer&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phèdre'', Racine's adaptation of Euripides' ''Hippolytus'', is an example of French Neoclassical use of ''hamartia'' as a means of punishing vice.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, B. ''The Wadsworth Anthology of Drama'' 5th ed. 444-463. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth. 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Jean. ''Phèdre'', Harvard Classics, Vol. 26, Part 3. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/26/3/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Racine]] says in his Preface to ''Phèdre'', as translated by R.C. Knight:

{{quote|The failings of love are treated as real failings. The passions are offered to view only to show all the ravage they create. And vice is everywhere painted in such hues, that its hideous face may be recognized and loathed.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen,446&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The play is a tragic story about a [[royal family]]. The main characters' respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Euripedes. ''Hippolytus'', Harvard Classics, 8.7. Web. 8 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/8/7/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical argument for error===
In her 1963 ''[[Modern Language Review]]'' article, ''The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?'', Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of ''Poetics'' regarding ''hamartia'' as both error and "defect in character". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a "natural" expression to describe a flaw in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Samuel H., Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, New York 41911&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's ''Shakespearean Tragedy'' of 1904 which she contends is misleading:

{{quote|...the comparatively innocent hero still shows some marked imperfection or defect, irresolution, precipitancy, pride, credulousness, excessive simplicity, excessive susceptibility to sexual emotion and the like...his weakness or defect is so intertwined with everything that is admirable in him...&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, A. C. 1851-1935. Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures On Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth. London: Macmillan and co., limited, 1904. Web, 13 Dec. 2014. http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000240890;view=1up;seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Oedipus the King]]''. 

Hyde observes that students often state "thinking too much" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. 

In ''[[Oedipus the King]],'' she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation.   
 
In his 1978 ''[[Classical World (journal)|Classical World]]'' article ''Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus'', Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place ''hamartia's'' definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, [[Atë]], or divine intervention, plays in ''hamartia''.  The Butcher translation of "Poetics" references ''hamartia'' as both a "single great error", and "a single great defect in character", prompting critics to raise arguments. 

Mid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Leon. "Hamartia, Ate, and Oedipus". ''The Classical World'', 72.1 (Sep., 1978), 3-12. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4348969&lt;/ref&gt; Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' ''hamartia'', "no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect."&lt;ref&gt;P. van Braam, "Aristotle's Use of Ἁμαρτία" ''The Classical Quarterly'', 6.4 (Oct., 1912), 266-272. London: Cambridge UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/635946&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. 

O. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results.&lt;ref&gt;Hey, O. "ἁμαρτία Zur Bedeutungsgeschichte des Wortes" ''Philologus'' 83 1-15, (1928). Web. 7 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of ''hamartia'' in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and [[Homer]]. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite ''hamartia'' as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, J.M. "Hamartia." Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy. Amsterdam, Adolf M. Hakkert, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical arguments on divine intervention===

J.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian ''hamartia''. Golden disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer observes that the Messenger in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' says, "He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by "dark powers" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. 

Dawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic ''[[dénouement]]'' can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. 

Golden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that ''hamartia'' principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from ''hamartia'', in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Helmholtz free energy''' is a [[thermodynamic potential]] that measures the useful [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] obtainable from a [[closed system|closed]] [[thermodynamic system]] at a constant [[temperature]] and [[volume]]. The negative of the change in the Helmholtz energy during a process is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which volume is held constant. If the volume were not held constant, part of this work would be performed as boundary work. This makes the Helmholtz energy useful for systems held at constant volume. Furthermore, at constant temperature, the Helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium.

In contrast, the [[Gibbs free energy]] or free enthalpy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential (especially in [[chemistry]]) when it is inconvenient for applications that do not occur at constant pressure.  For example, in [[explosives]] research Helmholtz free energy is often used, since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental [[equation of state|equations of state]] of pure substances.

The concept of free energy was developed by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], a German physician and physicist, and first presented in 1882 in a lecture called "On the thermodynamics of chemical processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = von Helmholtz, H. | date = 1882 | title = Physical memoirs, selected and translated from foreign sources | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the German word ''Arbeit'' (work), the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) recommends the symbol ''A'' and the name ''Helmholtz energy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gold Book | publisher = [[IUPAC]] | url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02772.html | accessdate = 2012-08-19 | doi=10.1351/goldbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physics]], the symbol ''F'' is also used in reference to ''free energy'' or ''Helmholtz function''.

==Definition==
The Helmholtz energy is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Ira. N. (1978). "''Physical Chemistry''" McGraw-Hill: University of Brooklyn.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A \equiv U- TS,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''A'' is the Helmholtz free energy ([[SI]]: [[joule]]s, [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS]]: [[erg]]s),
: ''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system (SI: joules, CGS: ergs),
: ''T'' is the absolute temperature ([[kelvin]]s) of the surroundings, modelled as a heat bath,
: ''S'' is the [[entropy]] of the system (SI: joules per kelvin, CGS: ergs per kelvin).

The Helmholtz energy is the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transformation]] of the internal energy ''U'', in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable.

==Formal development==
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] in a closed system provides
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q\ + \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy, &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the energy added as heat, and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work done on the system. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]] yields &lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt;. In case of a reversible change, the work done can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\delta W = -p\,\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt; (ignoring electrical and other non-''PV'' work):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\,\mathrm{d}S - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the product rule for differentiation to d(''TS'') = ''T'' d''S'' + ''S'' d''T'', it follows
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}(TS) - S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}(U - TS) = -S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of ''A'' = ''U'' − ''TS'' enables to rewrite this as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A = -S\,\mathrm{d}T - p\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Because ''A'' is a thermodynamic [[Functions of state|function of state]], this [[fundamental thermodynamic relation|relation]] is also valid for a process (without electrical work or composition change) that is not reversible, as long as the system pressure and temperature are uniform.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K. | year = 2014 | title = Expansion Work without the External Pressure, and Thermodynamics in Terms of Quasistatic Irreversible Processes | doi = 10.1021/ed3008704 | journal = J.

==Minimum free energy and maximum work principles==
The laws of thermodynamics are most easily applicable to systems undergoing reversible processes or processes that begin and end in thermal equilibrium, although irreversible quasistatic processes or spontaneous processes in systems with uniform temperature and pressure (u''PT'' processes) can also be analyzed&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014" /&gt; based on the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] as shown further below. First, if we wish to describe phenomena like chemical reactions, it may be convenient to consider suitably chosen initial and final states in which the system is in (metastable) thermal equilibrium. If the system is kept at fixed volume and is in contact with a heat bath at some constant temperature, then we can reason as follows.

Since the thermodynamical variables of the system are well defined in the initial state and the final state, the internal energy increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;, the [[entropy]] increase &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;, and the total amount of work that can be extracted, performed by the system, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, are well defined quantities. Conservation of energy implies

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_\text{bath} + \Delta U + W = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of the system is kept constant. This means that the volume of the heat bath does not change either, and we can conclude that the heat bath does not perform any work. This implies that the amount of heat that flows into the heat bath is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{bath} = \Delta U_\text{bath} = -(\Delta U + W).&lt;/math&gt;

The heat bath remains in thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T'' no matter what the system does. Therefore, the entropy change of the heat bath is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} = \frac{Q_\text{bath}}{T} = -\frac{\Delta U + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total entropy change is thus given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} + \Delta S = -\frac{\Delta U - T\Delta S + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath in the initial and the final states, ''T'' is also the temperature of the system in these states. The fact that the system's temperature does not change allows us to express the numerator as the free energy change of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_\text{bath} + \Delta S = -\frac{\Delta A + W}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the total change in entropy must always be larger or equal to zero, we obtain the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;W \leq -\Delta A.&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the total amount of work that can be extracted in an isothermal process is limited by the free-energy decrease, and that increasing the free energy in a reversible process requires work to be done on the system. If no work is extracted from the system, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta A \leq 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus for a system kept at constant temperature and volume and not capable of performing electrical or other non-''PV'' work, the total free energy during a spontaneous change can only decrease.

This result seems to contradict the equation d''A'' = −''S'' d''T'' − ''P'' d''V'', as keeping ''T'' and ''V'' constant seems to imply d''A'' = 0, and hence ''A'' = constant. In reality there is no contradiction: In a simple one-component system, to which the validity of the equation d''A'' = −''S'' d''T'' − ''P'' d''V'' is restricted, no process can occur at constant ''T'' and ''V'', since there is a unique ''P''(''T'', ''V'') relation, and thus ''T'', ''V'', and ''P'' are all fixed. To allow for spontaneous processes at constant ''T'' and ''V'', one needs to enlarge the thermodynamical state space of the system. In case of a chemical reaction, one must allow for changes in the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of particles of each type ''j''. The differential of the free energy then generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - p\,dV + \sum_j \mu_j\,dN_j,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; are the numbers of particles of type ''j'', and the  &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt; are the corresponding [[chemical potential]]s. This equation is then again valid for both reversible and non-reversible u''PT''&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr2014" /&gt; changes. In case of a spontaneous change at constant ''T'' and ''V'' without electrical work, the last term will thus be negative.

In case there are other external parameters, the above [[fundamental thermodynamic relation|relation]] further generalizes to

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - \sum_i X_i\,dx_i + \sum_j \mu_j\,dN_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are the external variables, and the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding [[generalized forces]].

==Relation to the canonical partition function==
A system kept at constant volume, temperature, and particle number is described by the [[canonical ensemble]]. The probability to find the system in some energy eigenstate ''r'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P_r = \frac{e^{-\beta E_r}}{Z},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \equiv \frac{1}{k T},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_r = \text{energy of eigenstate }r,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \sum_r e^{-\beta E_r}.&lt;/math&gt;

''Z'' is called the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system. The fact that the system does not have a unique energy means that the various thermodynamical quantities must be defined as expectation values. In the thermodynamical limit of infinite system size, the relative fluctuations in these averages will go to zero.

The average internal energy of the system is the expectation value of the energy and can be expressed in terms of ''Z'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;U \equiv \langle E \rangle = \sum_r P_r E_r = -\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the system is in state ''r'', then the generalized force corresponding to an external variable ''x'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X_r = -\frac{\partial E_r}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The thermal average of this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;X = \sum_r P_r X_r = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the system has one external variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then changing the system's temperature parameter by &lt;math&gt;d\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the external variable by &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; will lead to a change in &lt;math&gt;\log Z&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;d(\log Z) = \frac{\partial\log Z}{\partial\beta}\,d\beta + \frac{\partial\log Z}{\partial x}\,dx = -U\,d\beta + \beta X\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

If we write &lt;math&gt;U\,d\beta&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;U\,d\beta = d(\beta U) - \beta\, dU,&lt;/math&gt;

we get

:&lt;math&gt;d(\log Z) = -d(\beta U) + \beta\, dU + \beta X \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the change in the internal energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \frac{1}{\beta}\,d(\log Z + \beta U) - X\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

In the thermodynamic limit, the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] should hold:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\, dS - X\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This then implies that the entropy of the system is given by

:&lt;math&gt;S = k\log Z + \frac{U}{T} + c,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is some constant. The value of ''c'' can be determined by considering the limit ''T'' → 0. In this limit the entropy becomes &lt;math&gt;S = k \log \Omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground-state degeneracy. The partition function in this limit is &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0 e^{-\beta U_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground-state energy. Thus, we see that &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt; and that

:&lt;math&gt;A = -kT\log Z.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relating free energy to other variables ===

Combining the definition of Helmholtz free energy

:&lt;math&gt;A = U - T S&lt;/math&gt;

along with the fundamental thermodynamic relation

&lt;math&gt;dA = -S\,dT - P\,dV + \mu\,dN,&lt;/math&gt;

one can find expressions for entropy, pressure and chemical potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node70.html|title=4.3 Entropy, Helmholtz Free Energy and the Partition Function|website=theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial T} \bigg) \bigg|_{V,N}, \quad
P = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial V} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,N}, \quad
\mu = \bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial N} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,V}.&lt;/math&gt;

These three equations, along with the free energy in terms of the partition function,

:&lt;math&gt;A = -kT\log Z,&lt;/math&gt;

allow an efficient way of calculating thermodynamic variables of interest given the partition function and are often used in density of state calculations. One can also do [[Legendre transformation]]s for different systems.  For example, for a system with a magnetic field or potential, it is true that

:&lt;math&gt;m = -\bigg( \frac{\partial A}{\partial B} \bigg) \bigg|_{T,N}, \quad
V = \bigg ( \frac{\partial A}{\partial Q} \bigg) \bigg|_{N,T}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Bogoliubov inequality==
Computing the free energy is an intractable problem for all but the simplest models in statistical physics. A powerful approximation method is [[mean-field theory]], which is a variational method based on the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality can be formulated as follows.

Suppose we replace the real Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of the model by a trial Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;, which has different interactions and may depend on extra parameters that are not present in the original model. If we choose this trial Hamiltonian such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \langle H \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where both averages are taken with respect to the canonical distribution defined by the trial Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \tilde{A},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the original Hamiltonian, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the trial Hamiltonian. By including a large number of parameters in the trial Hamiltonian and minimizing the free energy, we can expect to get a close approximation to the exact free energy.

The Bogoliubov inequality is often formulated in a slightly different but equivalent way. If we write the Hamiltonian as

:&lt;math&gt;H = H_0 + \Delta H,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is exactly solvable, then we can apply the above inequality by defining

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{H} = H_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle_0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have defined &lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_0&lt;/math&gt; to be the average of ''X'' over the canonical ensemble defined by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; defined this way differs from &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; by a constant, we have in general

:&lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_0 = \langle X\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \big\langle H_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle \big\rangle = \langle H\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

holds. The free energy &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the model defined by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;\langle\Delta H\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This means that

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A} = \langle H_0\rangle_0 - T S_0 + \langle\Delta H\rangle_0 = \langle H\rangle_0 - T S_0,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq \langle H\rangle_0 - T S_0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===

For a classical model we can prove the Bogoliubov inequality as follows. We denote the canonical probability distributions for the Hamiltonian and the trial Hamiltonian by &lt;math&gt;P_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. From [[Gibbs' inequality]] we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\geq \sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(P_{r}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

holds. To see this, consider the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side. We can write this as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_{r}}{P_{r}}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(x\right)\geq 1 - \frac{1}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\frac{\tilde{P}_{r}}{P_{r}}\right)\geq \sum_{r}\left(\tilde{P}_{r} - P_{r}\right) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last step we have used that both probability distributions are normalized to 1.

We can write the inequality as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\right\rangle\geq \left\langle\log\left(P_{r}\right)\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the averages are taken with respect to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt;. If we now substitute in here the expressions for the probability distributions:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{r}=\frac{\exp\left[-\beta H\left(r\right)\right]}{Z}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}=\frac{\exp\left[-\beta\tilde{H}\left(r\right)\right]}{\tilde{Z}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle -\beta \tilde{H} - \log\left(\tilde{Z}\right)\right\rangle\geq \left\langle -\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Since the averages of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are, by assumption, identical we have:

:&lt;math&gt;A\leq\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have used that the partition functions are constants with respect to taking averages and that the free energy is proportional to minus the logarithm of the partition function.

We can easily generalize this proof to the case of quantum mechanical models. We denote the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\left|r\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We denote the diagonal components of the density matrices for the canonical distributions for &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; in this basis as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{r}=\left\langle r\left|\frac{\exp\left[-\beta H\right]}{Z}\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}=\left\langle r\left|\frac{\exp\left[-\beta\tilde{H}\right]}{\tilde{Z}}\right|r\right\rangle=\frac{\exp\left(-\beta\tilde{E}_{r}\right)}{\tilde{Z}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{E}_{r}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume again that the averages of H and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the canonical ensemble defined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\tilde{H}\right\rangle = \left\langle H\right\rangle \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle H\right\rangle = \sum_{r}\tilde{P}_{r}\left\langle r\left|H\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

The inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)\geq \sum_{r} \tilde{P}_{r}\log\left(P_{r}\right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

still holds as both the &lt;math&gt;P_{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P}_{r}&lt;/math&gt; sum to 1. On the l.h.s. we can replace:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(\tilde{P}_{r}\right)= -\beta \tilde{E}_{r} - \log\left(\tilde{Z}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

On the right-hand side we can use the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\exp\left(X\right)\right\rangle_{r}\geq\exp\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle_{r}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle Y\right\rangle_{r}\equiv\left\langle r\left|Y\right|r\right\rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;

for the expectation value of the operator Y in the state r. [[Jensen's inequality#Statistical physics|See here]] for a proof. Taking the logarithm of this inequality gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left[\left\langle\exp\left(X\right)\right\rangle_{r}\right]\geq\left\langle X\right\rangle_{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to write:

:&lt;math&gt;\log\left(P_{r}\right)=\log\left[\left\langle\exp\left(-\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right)\right\rangle_{r}\right]\geq\left\langle -\beta H - \log\left(Z\right)\right\rangle_{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the averages of H and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}&lt;/math&gt; are the same then leads to the same conclusion as in the classical case:

:&lt;math&gt;A\leq\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalized Helmholtz energy ==

In the more general case, the mechanical term (''p'' d''V'') must be replaced by the product of volume, [[Stress (physics)|stress]], and an infinitesimal strain:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the stress tensor, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the strain tensor. In the case of linear [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials that obey [[Hooke's law]], the stress is related to the strain by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl},&lt;/math&gt;

where we are now using [[Einstein notation]] for the tensors, in which repeated indices in a product are summed. We may integrate the expression for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the Helmholtz energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 A &amp;= \frac{1}{2}VC_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{kl} - ST + \sum_i \mu_i N_i \\
   &amp;= \frac{1}{2}V\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij} - ST + \sum_i \mu_i N_i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Application to fundamental equations of state ==

The Helmholtz free energy function for a pure substance (together with its partial derivatives) can be used to determine all other thermodynamic properties for the substance. See, for example, the equations of state for [[water]], as given by the [[IAPWS]] in their [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726024808/http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IAPWS95-Rev.pdf IAPWS-95] release.

iPawn was established with the purpose of utilizing the latest technologies and internet for the veteran [[pawnbroking]] industry and to serve as a  high-end pawn broker,&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2012/12/26/new-pawn-shops-court-high-end-borrowers/ |title=New pawn shops court high-end borrowers |author= Paul Tharp |date=26 December 2012 |work=nypost.com |publisher=New York Post |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivering a  simple, private way&lt;ref name='street'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11794952/1/online-pawn-a-booming-business-luring-upscale-customers.html |title=Online Pawn: a Booming Business Luring Upscale Customers |author= Laurie Kulikowski |date=2012-12-18 |work=Thestreet.com |publisher=The Street |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to get loans or sell high end goods through the internet. The idea came after learning about the high interest rates charged by pawn shops. The company launched its services to the public in July 2012. In March 2013 iPawn closed $4 million in its second round of financing from a group of angel investors led by Dr. Rafi Gridron.&lt;ref name='money'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pehub.com/2013/03/ipawn-raises-4m/ |title=iPawn Raises $4M |author=Staff |date=March 14, 2013 |work=PE Hub |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2014 iPawn announced the launch of a new brand called [[Worthy.com|Worthy]] dealing only in after-market sales.

== Brick &amp; Mortar Pawn Shop Vs. Online Pawn Shop ==
While services provided by a brick and mortar pawn shop are similar to those provided by the online ones, there are few main differences: most notably, the means by which services are rendered. In a brick and mortar pawn shop, the process of receiving a loan or selling a valuable is done in person&lt;ref name='mainstream'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nz.finance.yahoo.com/news/pawn-shops-mainstream-141414562.html |title=Pawn Shops Go Mainstream |author=Geoff Williams |date=14 March 2013 |work=U.S.News &amp; World Report |publisher=U.S. News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in an online pawn shop the process is conducted through the internet&lt;ref name='street' /&gt; and a courier of choice. The low inventory overhead results in the ability to provide higher value and lower interest rates. Another notable difference is the appraisal process of the submitted valuables: in a brick and mortar pawn shop, the appraisal is done in the local shop itself while in an online pawn shop, all items are shipped to a central facility where the appraisal is made.

== Licenses and Accreditation ==
iPawn is a licensed pawn shop certified by the Texas Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occc04.occc.state.tx.us/detail.asp?License_Number=62737 |title=OCCC License |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (OCCC). Additionally, iPawn holds a precious dealer certificate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/PreciousMetals/Reports/ActiveDealers.aspx |title=Active Precious Metal Dealers |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also granted by the Texas OCCC. iPawn is accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]].

== Partnerships ==
iPawn has partnered in 2012 with [[FedEx]] and ParcelPro to provide insured shipping services. iPawn also partnered with [[Delta Lloyd]] in the same year to provide insurance to its facilities.

== In the Media ==
In August 2013, [[MSN]] Money Watch discussed how iPawn caters to affluent individuals and families that don't need money immediately but want a more sizable  loan to help their cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/pawn-shops-go-mainstream |title=Pawn shops go mainstream |author= Geoff Williams |date=14 March 2013 |work=U.S.News &amp; World Report |publisher=U.S. News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an article published in July 2013, Reuters discusses the benefits of the purely online transactions carried out by iPawn, focusing on the desired discretion amidst the negative stigma of pawn shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/02/us-financing-pawnbrokers-idUSBRE9610QX20130702 |title=High-end pawn shops solve small business cash crunch |author=DEBORAH L. COHEN |date=2 July 2013 |work=Reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013,[[LearnVest]] brought into focus the story of a dentist who chose to use iPawn to sell family jewelry instead of a traditional bank loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnvest.com/2013/05/pawn-shops-go-upscale-is-this-a-good-way-to-score-extra-cash/ |title=Pawn Shops Go Upscale: Is This a Good Way to Score Extra Cash? |author=Stephanie Taylor Christensen |date=May 21, 2013 |work=Learnvest.com |publisher=Learnvest |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo]] New Zealand published an article in March 2013 shedding light on the new world of online pawn shops and what to expect when utilizing their services.&lt;ref name='mainstream' /&gt;

[[South Coast Today]] Describes in an article published January 2013 how small business are turning to pawn shops for short-term loans, a better suited alternative to traditional bank loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130118/SCBULLETIN/301280337 |title=Online pawn shops offer financing option for small business |author=Jennifer Lade |date=January 18, 2013 |work=Southcoast Business Bulletin |publisher=southcoasttoday.com |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2013, [[TIME]] Business and Finance discussed the reinvention of the pawn industry and its transition to the internet.&lt;ref name='time'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.time.com/2013/01/17/reinventing-the-pawn-shop/ |title=Reinventing the Pawn Shop |author=Sarah Max |date=Jan 17, 2013 |work=Time Business and Money |publisher=Time |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KETK [[NBC]] Sits down with iPawn COO in December 2012 to talk about bringing the pawn shop online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ketknbc.com/east-texas-live/etl-the-revolution-of-online-loans |title=ETL: The revolution of online loans |author=Angela Berry |date=December 13, 2012 |work=kektnbc.com |publisher=NBC |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, NuWire Investor provided a detailed layout of the upscale online pawn industry and its move away from the originally bad stigma attached to pawn shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/online-pawning-goes-uptown-60268.aspx |title=Online Pawning Goes Uptown |author=Laurie Kulikowski |date=December 21, 2012 |work=Nuwireinvestor.com |publisher=NuWire |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in December 2012, The [[New York Post]] wrote about the appeal of high-end online pawn shops from small business owners to wealthy celebrities.

[[File:ISO 7010 E001 new.svg|thumb|right|100px|The ISO symbol for "Exit".]]
'''ISO 7010''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[technical standard]] for graphical [[symbol]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s on [[Warning sign|hazard and warning signs]], including those indicating [[emergency exit]]s and safety signs. It uses colours and principles set out in [[ISO 3864]] for these symbols, and is intended to provide "safety information that relies as little as possible on the use of words to achieve understanding."&lt;ref name="ISO 7010:2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:7010:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 7010:2011 — Graphical symbols — Safety colours and safety signs — Registered safety signs|last=|first=|date=|website=ISO Online Browsing Platform (OBP)|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] specified by the [[United Nations]] to standardise [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] classification and labelling.

{{as of|2018|July}}, the latest version is ISO 7010:2011. This is under review to be replaced with new standard ISO/DIS 7010, which also incorporates water safety signs and beach safety flags previously specified in ISO 20712.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/72424.html|title=ISO/DIS 7010 — Graphical symbols — Safety colours and safety signs — Registered safety signs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iso.org|publisher=International Organization for Standization|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shape and colour of sign types==
ISO 7010 specifies five combinations of shape and colour to distinguish between the type of information presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d37iyw84027v1q.cloudfront.net/Common/ISO7010_Safetysigns_Guidebook_Europe_English.pdf|title=ISO 7010 Safety Signs Guide Book|last=|first=|date=2017-01-12|website=[[Brady Corporation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''internally displaced person''' ('''IDP''') is someone who is [[forced displacement|forced to flee]] his or her home but who remains within his or her country's borders. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internally Displaced Persons|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/internally-displaced-people.html|website=UNHCR|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often referred to as [[refugees]], although they do not fall within the [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definitions]] of a refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IJR Center|title=Who is a Refugee|url=http://www.ijrcenter.org/refugee-law/#Who_Is_a_Refugee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2014, it was estimated there were 38.2 million IDPs worldwide, the highest level since 1989, the first year for which global statistics on IDPs are available.  The countries with the largest IDP populations were [[Syria]] (7.6 million), [[Colombia]] (6 million), [[Iraq]] (3.6 million), the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (2.8 million), [[Sudan]] (2.2 million), [[South Sudan]] (1.6 million), [[Pakistan]] (1.4 million), [[Nigeria]] (1.2 million) and [[Somalia]] (1.1 million).&lt;ref name="UNHCRtrends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unhcr.org/556725e69.html |title=UNHCR – Global Trends –Forced Displacement in 2014 |publisher=UNHCR |date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and [[UNHCR]] support monitoring and analysis of worldwide IDPs through the Geneva-based [[Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/publisher/IDMC.html IDMC at the UNHCR website]: "At the request of the United Nations, the Geneva-based IDMC runs an online database providing comprehensive information and analysis on internal displacement in some 50 countries."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Whereas '[[refugee]]' has an authoritative definition under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]], there is no universal legal definition of internally displaced persons (IDP); only a regional treaty for African countries (see [[Kampala Convention]]). However, a United Nations report, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement'' uses the definition of: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border."&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| first=Francis | last=Deng| contribution=The guiding principles on internal displacement| title=E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.l, February 11. New York, NY: United Nations| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=United Nations| place=New York| pages=| date=| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://www.reliefweb.int/ocha_ol/pub/idp_gp/idp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement (coercion and the domestic/internal movement), it is important to note that, rather than a strict definition, the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles".&lt;ref&gt;KALIN, G. "Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Annotations." The American Society of International Law &amp; The Brookings Institution Project on Internal Displacement. Studies in Transnational Legal Policy, No. 32, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the document "intentionally steers
toward flexibility rather than legal precision"&lt;ref&gt;VINCENT, M, "IDPs: rights and status", Forced Migration Review, August 2000, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; as the words "in particular" indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence."&lt;ref&gt;MOONEY, E. "The Concept of Internal Displacement and the Case for Internally Displaced Persons as a Category of Concern." Refugee Survey Quarterly. (24) 3, 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied to IDPs.

==IDP populations==
It is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations aren't constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground.  Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate.&lt;ref name='IDMC 2006'&gt;{{cite book | last = IDMC | first = | authorlink = | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council |date=April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages = | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf  |format=PDF}}p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters.  [[Development-induced displacement|Development-induced]] IDPs often are not included in assessments. It has been estimated that between 70 and 80% of all IDPs are women and children.&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = IDMC | first = | authorlink = | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council |date=April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages = | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf  |format=PDF}}p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

50% of internally displaced people and refugees were thought to be in urban areas in 2010, many of them in protracted displacement with little likelihood of ever returning home. A 2013 study found that these protracted urban displacements had not been given due weight by international aid and governance as historically they had focused on rural cam displacement responses.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|first=Simone |last=Haysom|title= Sanctuary in the city? Reframing responses to protracted urban displacement, HPG Policy Briefs|url= http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7533-sanctuary-city-responses-protracted-urban-displacement|website=odi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues that this protracted urban displacement needs a fundamental change in the approach to those who are displaced and their host societies. They note that re-framing responses to urban displacement will also involve [[human rights and development]] actors and local and national governments. They call for a change in the narrative around the issue is needed to reflect ingenuity and fortitude displayed by displaced populations, the opportunities for self-sufficiency and safety represented by urban areas, and that the displaced can make a contribution to their host societies.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"/&gt;

===Notable IDP camps===
* There are many [[List of internally displaced persons camps in Nigeria|IDP camps in Nigeria]] and especially many [[Internally Displaced Person Camps in Borno|IDP camps in Borno State]].
* Until recently there were many [[Internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka#The camps|IDP camps in Sri Lanka]].

==Protection and assistance==
The problem of protecting and assisting IDPs is not a new issue.  In international law it is the responsibility of the government concerned to provide assistance and protection for the IDPs in their country.  However, as many of the displaced are a result of civil conflict and violence or where the authority of the central state is in doubt, there is no local authority willing to provide assistance and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. |title=The refugee in international law |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-826019-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that some 5 million IDPs in 11 countries are "without any significant humanitarian assistance from their governments."&lt;ref name="internal-displacement.org"/&gt; Under these circumstances rehabilitation policies on humanitarian grounds should be aimed at reducing inequality of opportunity among these vulnerable groups by integrating them into local social services and allowing them access to jobs, education, and healthcare opportunities; otherwise new conflicts might break out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Das|first1=Tuhin K.|last2=Haldar|first2=Sushil K.|last3=Das Gupta|first3=Ivy|last4=Kundu|first4=Sangeeta|title=Deprivation of Internally Displaced Persons: Case Studies in India|date=August 2016|publisher=Power Publishers|location=India|isbn=978-93-85892-71-4|pages=130|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international humanitarian institution which has the overall responsibility of protecting and assisting the refugees as well as the internally displaced. A number of  organizations have stepped into the breach in specific circumstances.

===UNHCR===
The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) was mandated by General Assembly Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950 to "lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection
of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems....guided by the 1951 United Nations [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and its 1967 Protocol."&lt;ref name='UNHCR Mission`'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/4565a5742.pdf |title=Mission Statement |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCR |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNHCR has traditionally argued that it does not have a "general competence for IDPs" even though at least since 1972 it had relief and rehabillatation programs for those displaced within a country.  However, in cases where there is a specific request by the UN Secretary General and with the consent of the State concerned it has been willing to respond by assisting IDPs in a given instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin-Gill, Guy S. |title=The refugee in international law |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-19-826019-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 it was helping some 5.6 million IDPs (out of over 25 million), but only about 1.1 million in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Cohen in {{cite book |author=Marsella, Anthony J. |title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year= 2007|pages= |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=YeSKaWWGGAAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=cohen&amp;sig=0nKLpuljq26B7RAl6qZqbYEvZ8Q#PPA15,M1|isbn=0-7391-1566-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strengthening Protection of IDPs: The UN's Role|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter–Spring 2006|first=Roberta|last=Cohen|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/2006/winter_humanrights_cohen/Cohen_2006_GJIA.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-23 }} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2005, the UNHCR signed an agreement with other humanitarian agencies. "Under this agreement, UNHCR will assume the lead responsibility for protection, emergency shelter and camp management for internally displaced people."&lt;ref name='UNHCR and IDPs'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/basics/BASICS/405ef8c64.pdf |title=Internally Displaced People Q&amp;A |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCR |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICRC===
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has a mandate of ensuring the application of [[International Humanitarian Law]] as it affects civilians in the midst of armed conflict.  They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes.  In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ICRC's overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations.
On the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/idp-icrc-position-030706/$File/2006_IDPs_EN_ICRCExternalPosition.pdf |format=PDF|title= ICRC Position on Internally Displaced Persons|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs "deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean-Daniel |last=Tauxe |title=We Should Have Humanitarian Access to Displaced Civilians |date=2000-03-01 |publisher= |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |work=International Herald Tribune |pages= |accessdate=2007-10-24 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125150508/http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |archivedate=November 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative approach===
The previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility  for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, [[Unicef]], [[WFP]], [[UNDP]], [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the International Organization for Migration [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], the ICRC and International [[NGOs]]. Coordination is the responsibility of the UN [[Emergency Relief Coordinator]] and the [[Humanitarian Coordinator]] in the country  concerned.&lt;ref name='IASC 2003'&gt;{{cite book| last =IASC| first =| authorlink =| title =Implementing the Collaborative Response to Situations of Internal Displacement| publisher =United Nations| date =September 2004| location =New York| pages =| url =http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/9251510E3E5B6FC3C12572BF0029C267/$file/Global_Overview_2006.pdf| doi =| id =| isbn =| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071029221242/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/9251510E3E5B6FC3C12572BF0029C267/$file/Global_Overview_2006.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-29| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are assisted by the Inter-Agency Displacement Division, which was created in 2004 and is housed in the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ([[OCHA]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reliefweb.int/idp/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The original collaborative approach has come under increasing criticism. Roberta Cohen reports: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting...There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests. In every new emergency, no one knows for sure which agency or combination thereof will become involved.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strengthening Protection of IDPs: The UN's Role|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|date=Winter–Spring 2006|first=Roberta|last=Cohen|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/articles/2006/winter_humanrights_cohen/Cohen_2006_GJIA.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-24 }}p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2005 there was an attempt to fix the problem by giving sectoral responsibilities to different humanitarian agencies, most notably with the UNHCR taking on the responsibility for protection and the management of camps and emergency shelters.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2006"/&gt; The ''Forced Migration Review" stated that the "abnegation of responsibility is possible because there is no formal responsibility apportioned to agencies under the Collaborative Response, and thus no accountability when agencies renege on their promises."&lt;ref&gt;DAVIES, A. and MURRAY, M.W., "Implementation of the Collaborative Response in Liberia", Forced Migration Review. IDP Supplement. October 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cluster approach==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of "clusters" at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’.

The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.

The clusters were originally concentrated on nine areas: 
# Logistics (WFP)
# [[Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)|Emergency Telecommunications Cluster]] (WFP)
# Camp coordination and management (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs and IOM for natural disaster-generated IDPs)
# [[Shelter Cluster|Shelter]] ([[IFRC]] for natural disasters; UNHCR for conflict situations)
# Health (WHO)
# Nutrition (UNICEF)
# Water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion (UNICEF)
# Early recovery (UNDP); and
# Protection (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs, UNHCR, UNICEF, and OHCHR for natural disaster generated IDPs).

IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.

The original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.

==International law==
Unlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see [[Kampala Convention]]). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Celik|first1=Ayse Betul|title=Transnationalization of Human Rights Norms and Its Impact on Internally Displaced Kurds|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 2005|volume=27|issue=3|pages=969–997|jstor=20069817|doi=10.1353/hrq.2005.0032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2617336|title=The New Refugees and the Old Treaty: Persecutors and Persecuted in the Twenty-First Century|first=Andrew I.|last=Schoenholtz|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed [[Francis Deng]] in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons.  Besides acting as an advocate for IDPs, Deng set out in 1994, at the request of the UN General Assembly to examine and bring together existing international laws which relating to the protection of IDPs.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Cohen in {{cite book |author=Marsella, Anthony J. |title=Fear of Persecution: Global Human Rights, International Law, and Human Well-Being |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year= 2007|pages= |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=YeSKaWWGGAAC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;vq=cohen&amp;sig=0nKLpuljq26B7RAl6qZqbYEvZ8Q#PPA15,M1|isbn=0-7391-1566-9 |oclc= |doi=}}p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this work was the document, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement''.&lt;ref name="Deng 1998"/&gt;

The Guiding Principles lay out the responsibilities of states before displacement – that is, to prevent displacement – during and after displacement. They have been endorsed by the UN General Assembly, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) and by the signatories to the 2006 [[Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region]], which include Sudan, DRC and Uganda.

The Guiding Principles, however, are non-binding. As Bahame Tom Nyanduga, Special Rapporteur on Refugees, IDPs and Asylum Seekers in Africa for the ACHPR has stated, "the absence of a binding international legal regime on internal displacement is a grave lacuna in international law."&lt;ref name='African IDPs'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The challenge of internal displacement in Africa|journal=Forced Migration Review|date=September 2004|first=Bahame Tom|last=Nyanduga|volume=21|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR21/FMR21full.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004 the Secretary-General of the UN showed the continuing concern of his office by  appointing Walter Kälin as his Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons.  Part of his mandate includes the promoting of the Guiding Principles.&lt;ref name='IDP Representative'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/idp/mandate.htm |title=Mandate |accessdate=2007-10-24 |publisher=UNHCHR |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807075712/http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/idp/mandate.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right of return ==
In so-called "post-conflict" situations, there has traditionally been an emphasis in the international community to seek to return to the pre-war status-quo.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Sara Pantuliano (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4409&amp;title=uncharted-territory-land-conflict-humanitarian-action Uncharted Territory: Land, Conflict and Humanitarian Action] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, opinions are gradually changing, because violent conflict destroys political, economic and social structures and new structures develop as a result, quite often irreversibly.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Furthermore, returning to the pre-war status-quo may actually be undesirable if pre-war structures led to the conflict in the first place, or prevented its early resolution. IDPs' and [[refugees]]' right of return can represent one of the most complex aspects of this issue.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Normally, pressure is applied by the [[international community]] and [[humanitarian organization]] to ensure displaced people are able to return to their areas of origin and the same property.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The UN Principles for Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and IDPs, otherwise known as the Pinheiro Principles, provides guidance on the management of the technical and legal aspects of housing, land and property (HLP) restitution.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; [[Restitution]] rights are of key importance to IDPs and refugees around the world, and important to try preventing aggressors benefiting from conflict.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, without a clear understanding of each local context, full restitution rights can be unworkable and fail to protect the people it is designed to protect for the following reasons, refugees and IDPs:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);
* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);
* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;
* death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land;
* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and
* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan)

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] stress the need for [[humanitarian organization]] to develop a greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have a knowledge in both humanitarian and land and property issues and so provide better advice to state actors seeking to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The ODI calls on humanitarian agencies to develop an awareness of sustainable reintegration as part of their emphasis on returning IDPs and refugees home.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Legal advice needs to be provided to all parties involved even if a framework is created in which to resolve these issues.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4449">'''Leveling''' is a social process in which the uniqueness of the individual is rendered non-existent by assigning equal value to all aspects of human endeavors, thus missing all the intricacies and subtle complexities of human identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, Hubert]]. ''Kierkegaard on the Internet: Anonymity Vrs. Commitment in the Present Age''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055423/http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_kierkegaard.html Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Leveling is highly associated with [[existentialism|existential]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, leveling was the process of suppressing individuality to a point where the individual's uniqueness becomes non-existent and nothing meaningful in his existence can be affirmed:

{{quote|Leveling at its maximum is like the stillness of death, where one can hear one's own heartbeat, a stillness like death, into which nothing can penetrate, in which everything sinks, powerless. One person can head a rebellion, but one person cannot head this leveling process, for that would make him a leader and he would avoid being leveled. Each individual can in his little circle participate in this leveling, but it is an abstract process, and leveling is abstraction conquering individuality.|Søren Kierkegaard|''The Present Age'', translated by Alexander Dru with Foreword by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], 1962, pp. 51–53&lt;!--as it appears in http://www.historyguide.org/europe/present_age.html--&gt;}}

However, Kierkegaard's idea of leveling wasn't one of making life meaningless but of making life equal because every single individual has equal access to the grace and gifts of God. He wasn't concerned with earthly and material goods.

{{quote|The more a person weans his soul from understanding the imperfect to grasping the perfect, the more he will appropriate the explanation of life that comforts while it is day and remains with him when night comes, when he lies forgotten in his grave and has himself forgotten what moth and rust have consumed and human sagacity has found out, and yet he will have a thought that can fill out the long interval for him, that will know nothing of the difference that troubled him but is aware only of the equality that is from above, the equality in love, which lasts and is the only thing that lasts, the equality that does not allow any human being to be another’s debtor, except as Paul says, in the one debt, the debt of loving one another. — ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' by Søren Kierkegaard, ed. by Howard Vincent Hong and Edna Hatlestad Hong, 1992, p. 158}}

[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] wrote of leveling: "by averageness and leveling down, everything gets obscured, and what has thus been covered up gets passed off as something familiar and accessible to everyone. ...by virtue of an insensitivity to all distinctions in level and genuineness, and in providing average intelligibility, opens up a standard world in which all distinctions between the unique and the general, the superior and the average, the important and the trivial have been leveled".&lt;ref name="Dreyfus"&gt;{{Cite book |title= Being-in-the-World A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time|last= Dreyfus |first= Hubert |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]]|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-262-54056-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger's view of important things becoming mundane and non-specific points towards [[Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] concept of [[master–slave morality]], in which the weak and disenfranchised reframe the positive traits of the strong and powerful as not worth pursuing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6700">'''Levinthal's paradox''' is a [[thought experiment]], also constituting a [[self-reference]] in the theory of [[protein folding]]. In 1969, [[Cyrus Levinthal]] noted that, because of the very large number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in an unfolded [[Peptide|polypeptide chain]], the molecule has an astronomical number of possible conformations. An estimate of 3&lt;sup&gt;300&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt; was made in one of his papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

For example, a polypeptide of 100 [[Amino acid|residues]] will have 99 [[peptide bond]]s, and therefore 198 different [[Dihedral angle#Dihedral angles of biological molecules|phi and psi]] bond angles. If each of these bond angles can be in one of three stable conformations, the protein may misfold into a maximum of 3&lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt; different conformations (including any possible folding redundancy). Therefore, if a protein were to attain its correctly folded configuration by sequentially sampling all the possible conformations, it would require a time longer than the age of the universe to arrive at its correct native conformation. This is true even if conformations are sampled at rapid ([[nanosecond]] or [[picosecond]]) rates. The "paradox" is that most small proteins fold spontaneously on a millisecond or even microsecond time scale. The solution to this paradox has been established by computational approaches to [[protein structure prediction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zwanzig R, Szabo A, Bagchi B |title=Levinthal's paradox |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |date=1992-01-01 |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=20–22 |pmc=48166 |pmid=1729690 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinthal himself was aware that [[Anfinsen's dogma|proteins fold spontaneously]] and on short timescales. He suggested that the paradox can be resolved if "protein folding is sped up and guided by the rapid formation of local interactions which then determine the further folding of the peptide; this suggests local amino acid sequences which form stable interactions and serve as [[nucleation]] points in the folding process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rooman, Marianne Rooman |author2=Yves Dehouck |author3=Jean Marc Kwasigroch |author4=Christophe Biot |author5=Dimitri Gilis |year=2002 |title=What is paradoxical about Levinthal Paradox? |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=327–329 |url=http://www.jbsdonline.com/full_text_PDFs/Sdc6igJmaYp-~Warqqdd82uzSIT.pdf |pmid=12437370 |doi=10.1080/07391102.2002.10506850 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the protein folding [[Reaction intermediate|intermediates]] and the partially folded [[transition state]]s were experimentally detected, which explains the fast [[protein folding]].

Levinthal also suggested that the native structure might have a higher energy, if the lowest energy was not kinetically accessible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13323">'''Lifestyle diseases''' are defined as diseases linked with the way people live their life. This is commonly caused by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[drug]] and [[smoking]] abuse as well as lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating.  Diseases that impact on our lifestyle are heart disease, stroke, obesity and type II diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38316|title=Lifestyle disease|website=MedicineNet|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[disease]]s that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer can include [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[asthma]], [[cancer]], [[chronic liver disease]] or [[cirrhosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[heart disease]], [[metabolic syndrome]], [[chronic renal failure]], [[osteoporosis]], [[stroke]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[obesity]] and [[vascular dementia]]. In the UK the death rate is four times higher from respiratory disease caused by an unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=‘Lifestyle diseases’ lead to higher mortality rates|url=http://journals.rcni.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/mhp2013.03.16.6.5.p10726|journal=Mental Health Practice|volume=16|issue=6|pages=5–5|doi=10.7748/mhp2013.03.16.6.5.p10726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases.

In many [[Western world|Western]] countries, people began to consume more meat, [[dairy products]], [[vegetable oils]], tobacco, sugary foods, [[Coca-Cola]], and [[alcoholic beverages]] during the latter half of the 20th century.

== Death statistics in Australia ==
In 2013 there were 147,678 deaths within Australia mostly from lifestyle diseases including smoking of tobacco, alcohol use and other drugs, violence and unhealthy weight have impacted on Australians' death rate. The leading cause of death of Australian males was heart disease with 11,016 deaths, followed by lung cancer with 4,995 deaths, and chronic pulmonary disease killing 3,572.   All these conditions were mainly attributed to smoking, alcohol abuse or unhealthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/male-health/health-status/|title=Health status (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]] was the leading cause of death in 8,750 women, mainly as a result of their lifestyle. Dementia and Alzheimer disease came second,  affecting 7,277 females and thirdly, cerebrovascular disease, killing 6,368. These top three causes of deaths could be minimized through lifestyle changes within the Australian population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/deaths/leading-causes-of-death/|title=Leading causes of death (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death statistics in the United States==

In 1900, the top three causes of death in the United States were [[pneumonia]]/[[influenza]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[diarrhea]]/enteritis. [[Communicable disease]]s accounted for about 60 percent of all deaths. In 1900, [[heart disease]] and [[cancer]] were ranked number four and eight respectively.  Since the 1940s, the majority of deaths in the United States have resulted from heart disease, cancer, and other [[degenerative diseases]]. And, by the late 1990s, degenerative diseases accounted for more than 60 percent of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/lead1900_98.pdf National Center for Health Statistics, National Office of Vital Statistics, 1947] for the year 1900 (page 67), for the year 1938 (page 55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle diseases have their onset later in an individual's life; they appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; 
was too short for degenerative diseases to occur, compared to a life expectancy at birth of 77.8 years in 2004. Also, [[survival rate|survivorship]] to the age of 50 was 58.5% in 1900, and 93.7% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
[[Disease prevention|Prevention]] is remedies or activities that aim to reduce the likelihood of a disease or disorder affecting people. Lifestyle diseases are preventable for children if parents set them on the correct path, as early life decisions and influences can impact people later on in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lifestyle diseases can be prevented through reduction in smoking of tobacco &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/australias-health/2014/preventing-ill-health/#t1|title=Preventing and treating ill health (AIHW)|website=www.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government has started this by introducing plain packaging for all tobacco products and increasing the prices of tobacco production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-prod-reg|title=Tobacco product regulation and disclosure|last=Ageing|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|website=health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overweightness and obesity can be prevented through a well balanced lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise.  Prevention can come about by a person undertaking 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily or by doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aihw.gov.au/male-health/lifestyle-factors/|title=Lifestyle factors (AIHW)|website=aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of moderate exercise includes a brisk walk, swim, [[Cycling|bike ride]] or it can also be everyday life activities  like mowing the lawn or [[house cleaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/physical_activity_intensity/en/|title=WHO {{!}} What is Moderate-intensity and Vigorous-intensity Physical Activity?|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, animals studies have suggested that early life exercise can reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falcão-Tebas|first=Filippe|last2=Kuang|first2=Jujiao|last3=Arceri|first3=Chelsea|last4=Kerris|first4=Jarrod P.|last5=Andrikopoulos|first5=Sofianos|last6=Marin|first6=Evelyn C.|last7=McConell|first7=Glenn K.|date=2018-11-08|title=Four weeks of exercise early in life reprograms adult skeletal muscle insulin resistance caused by paternal high fat diet|url=https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP276386|journal=The Journal of Physiology|language=en|doi=10.1113/jp276386|issn=0022-3751}}&lt;/ref&gt; All causes of lifestyle disease can be prevented through giving up smoking and other drugs, reducing ones intake of alcohol, processed meats (like bacon and sausages), red meats (like pork, beef and lamb), fatty foods and by engaging in daily exercise.

The '''monodomain model''' is a reduction of the [[bidomain model]] of the electrical propagation in myocardial tissue.
The reduction comes from assuming that the intra- and extracellular domains have equal anisotropy ratios.
Although not as physiologically accurate as the [[Bidomain|bidomain model]], it is still adequate in some cases, and has reduced complexity.

==Formulation==
The monodomain model can be formulated as follows&lt;ref name=KeenerSneyd&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Keener J, Sneyd J
 | year = 2009
 | edition = 2nd
 | title =  Mathematical Physiology II: Systems Physiology
 | publisher = Springer
 | isbn = 978-0-387-79387-0
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda} \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) = \chi \left( C_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + I_\text{ion} \right)
,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the intracellular conductivity tensor, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the transmembrane potential, &lt;math&gt;I_\text{ion}&lt;/math&gt; is the transmembrane ionic current per unit area, &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane conductivity per unit area, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the intra- to extracellular conductivity ratio, and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane surface area per unit volume (of tissue).

==Derivation==
The [[Bidomain|bidomain model]] can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) + \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v_e \right) &amp; = \chi \left( C_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + I_\text{ion} \right) \\
\nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) + \nabla \cdot \left( \left( \mathbf\Sigma_i + \mathbf\Sigma_e \right) \nabla v_e \right) &amp; = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming equal anisotropy ratios, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Sigma_e = \lambda\mathbf\Sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;, the second equation can be written
: &lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i\nabla v_e\right) = -\frac{1}{1+\lambda}\nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf\Sigma_i\nabla v\right) 
.&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this into the first bidomain equation gives
: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda} \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf\Sigma_i \nabla v \right) = \chi \left( C_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + I_\text{ion} \right)
.&lt;/math&gt;

== Separation of Motivational Intensity and Valence ==

In psychology, the term ''valence'' is used to describe stimuli, events, situations and emotional states that are intrinsically attractive (positively valenced) or intrinsically aversive (negatively valenced). The valence of a stimulus or event tells us whether we are likely to approach or avoid it. Valence, however provides no information about the strength of this tendency as it is either positive or negative. Instead, the strength of this association is quantified as the Motivational Intensity. By analogy, the valence of a stimulus or event is like the sign of a correlation coefficient and its motivational intensity is like the coefficient magnitude.

It has been suggested that valence ratings in normative data sets such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) might be used as proxies for motivational intensity.&lt;ref name=HJ2013/&gt; However, valence and motivational intensity do not always go hand in hand with one another. For example, viewing a positively valenced picture of a cute cat is associated with low motivational intensity because participants like it but are not intrinsically driven towards it. In contrast, viewing a positively valenced picture of a dessert is associated with high motivational intensity because participants want and desire it.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2008a | title = Approach-motivated positive affect reduces breadth of attention | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 476–482 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02112.x | pmid=18466409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valence and motivational intensity can be at odds with one another with negatively valenced stimuli as well.&lt;ref name="HJ2013"/&gt;

== Separation of Motivational Intensity and Arousal ==

Motivational intensity and arousal are related, but are considered to be separate ideas; arousal has implications for action, but motivational intensity does not and it is possible to experience high levels of arousal, but not experience motivational intensity (e.g., laughing).&lt;ref name="GHJ2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2013 | title = Does arousal per se account for the influence of appetitive stimuli on attentional scope and the late positive potential? | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 344–350 | doi = 10.1111/psyp.12023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants’ to view pictures and then complete an attention task. Half of the participants pedaled on a stationary bicycle (to induce high arousal), while others did not. Results demonstrated that there was no difference in performance on the attention task with high or low levels of arousal, but pictures high in motivational intensity narrowed attention, compared to pictures that were low in motivational intensity.&lt;ref name="GHJ2013" /&gt;

== Motivational Intensity, Valence and Attention ==

According to motivational intensity theory, high approach motivational intensity will narrow attention and conversely, low motivational intensity will broaden attention.&lt;ref name="HJ2013" /&gt; This theory is at odds with a more traditional explanation of the effects of affect on cognitive scope, which suggest that positive affect broadens attention and negative affect narrows attention, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | year = 2001 | title = The role of positive emotions in positive psychology: The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 218–226 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.56.3.218 | pmid=11315248 | pmc=3122271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement and Manipulation of Motivational Intensity ===

Motivational intensity has been experimentally measured and manipulated in a variety of contexts as highlighted below.

==== Film Clips ====

Gable and Harmon-Jones examined the effects of high and low motivational intensity on the scope of attention. Motivational intensity was manipulated using film clips. Half of the participants watched a film showing cats to induce low motivational intensity. Half of participants watched a film showing appetizing desserts to induce high motivational intensity.&lt;ref name="HJ2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Approach-motivated positive affect reduces breadth of attention | url = | journal = Psychol. Sci. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 476–482 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02112.x | pmid=18466409}}&lt;/ref&gt; After watching the film, participants completed a Kimchi and Palmer task to measure their scope of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimchi | first1 = R. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = S. E. | year = 1982 | title = Form and texture in hierarchically constructed patterns | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 521–535 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.8.4.521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that participants experienced narrowing attention following the high, but not the low motivational intensity film.&lt;ref name="HJ2008a"/&gt;

==== Goals ====

Hart and Gable examined the effect of low and high motivational intensity on positive affect. Participants were either asked to write about a positive event where someone was kind to them to induce low motivational intensity, write down a goal they want to accomplish and the steps it will take to accomplish it to induce high motivational intensity, or write about a typical day in their life, as a neutral control condition. Results indicated that high motivational intensity positive affect lead to more successful goal pursuit and occurred only when task goals were explicitly stated.  No effect occurred in the neutral condition, which suggests that motivational intensity alone did not impact goal pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = W. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | year = 2013 | title = Motivating goal pursuit: The role of affect motivational intensity and activated goals | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 922–926 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2013.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monetary Incentive ====

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2010a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010a | title = The effect of low versus high approach-motivated positive affect on memory for peripherally versus centrally presented information | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 599–603 | doi = 10.1037/a0018426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Attentional consequences of pre-goal and post-goal positive affects | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1358–1367 | doi = 10.1037/a0025611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have manipulated motivational intensity using a delayed monetary incentive paradigm. Gable and Harmon-Jones asked participants to respond to shapes that were presented on a computer screen. Half of the participants were told that participants could gain money when circles, but not squares appeared on the screen (pre-goal; high motivational intensity).  Half of the participants were not given this instruction.  Next, neutral words were presented either centrally or peripherally on the screen. Participants then completed a goal-related flanker task, where they were told that if they were faster than average on each trial, they could gain money on that trial (post-goal; low motivational intensity). Finally, participants’ memory for the words was tested.  Results suggested that compared to the neutral condition, high motivational intensity (i.e., pre-goal) lead to better memory for centrally presented information and low motivational intensity (i.e., post-goal) lead to better memory for peripherally presented information. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated using desirable (e.g., desserts) and neutral pictures.&lt;ref name="GHJ2010a"/&gt;
 
==== Pictures ====

Pictures varying in high and low motivational intensity have been used in a variety of different studies including time perception. Poole &amp; Gable asked participants to judge if pictures that were either high or low motivational intensity, appeared for long or short amount of time.&lt;ref name="PG2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poole | first1 = B. D. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | year = 2014 | title = Affective motivational direction drives asymmetric frontal hemisphere activation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 232 | issue = | pages = 2121–2130 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-014-3902-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures were high (e.g., pictures of desserts), or low (e.g., pictures of flowers) in motivational intensity or neutral images (e.g., geometric shapes) and have been used in previous experiments to induce motivational intensity.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2008b | title = Relative left frontal activation to appetitive stimuli: Considering the role of individual differences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 275–278 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010b | title = Late positive potential to appetitive stimuli and local attentional bias | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 441–446 | doi=10.1037/a0018425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Gable | first2 = P. A. | year = 2009 | title = Neural activity underlying the effect of approach-motivated positive affect on narrowed attention | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 406–409 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02302.x | pmid=19298263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results demonstrated that participants’ perception of time was shorter when high motivational intensity pictures were presented compared to low motivational intensity or neutral pictures.&lt;ref name="PG2014"/&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt; (Experiment 2) used a neutral picture (e.g. rocks) or a high motivational intensity picture (e.g., dessert) appeared followed by the Navon letter task &lt;ref name="Navon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navon | first1 = D | year = 1977 | title = Forest before trees: The precedence of global features in visual perception | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 353–383 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(77)90012-3 |url=http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/Navon_global_CP77.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; to measure attentional scope. Results indicted that participants’ attention was narrowed following the high motivational intensity pictures, compared to the low motivational intensity pictures.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt; (Experiment 3) first measured overall approach motivation of participants using Carver and White’s (1994) Behavioral Inhibition Scale and Behavioral Activation Scales. Participants were presented with the dessert pictures used in Experiment 2 to induce high motivational intensity and baby pictures to induce low motivational intensity. Results showed that participants with higher Behavioral Activation scores in the beginning of the experiment showed more evidence of attentional narrowing following high motivational intensity pictures of desserts.&lt;ref name="HJ2008a" /&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;  (Experiment 4) manipulated motivational intensity using pictures and participant’s expectancy to act. Participant’s viewed high motivational intensity pictures (e.g., desserts) or neutral pictures (e.g., paper plates) and half of the participants who viewed the high motivational intensity pictures of desserts were given the expectation that they would eat the desserts later, while the other half were not. Following the viewing of the pictures, participants completed the Navon letters task &lt;ref name="Navon" /&gt; to measure the scope of attention. Results suggested that participant’s attention narrowed the most when they viewed high motivational intensity pictures and were expected to consume them. This expectancy to consume the desserts showed further narrowing of attention than viewing high motivational intensity pictures alone.&lt;ref name="GHJ2008a" /&gt;

Gable and Harmon-Jones &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010c | title = The blues broaden, but the nasty narrows attentional consequences of negative affects low and high in motivational intensity | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 211–215 | doi = 10.1177/0956797609359622 | pmid=20424047}}&lt;/ref&gt; induced motivational intensity using photos from the International Affective Picture System.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, P. J., Bradley, M. M., &amp; Cuthbert, B. N. (2005). International affective picture system (IAPS): Affective ratings of pictures and instruction manual. NIMH, Center for the Study of Emotion &amp; Attention.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures were negative or neutral. One picture was presented followed by one trial of the Navon letters task &lt;ref name="Navon" /&gt; to measure scope of attention. Results showed participants attention was broadened following low motivational intensity pictures, compared to the neutral picture. Experiment 2 was identical to experiment 1, but pictures high motivational intensity negative pictures were used. Results showed a narrowing of attention following these type of pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P. | last2 = Harmon-Jones | first2 = E. | year = 2010c | title = The blues broaden, but the nasty narrows attentional consequences of negative affects low and high in motivational intensity | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 211–215 | doi=10.1177/0956797609359622 | pmid=20424047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu and Wang used the same high and low motivational intensity pictures used in previous studies along with neutral pictures to examine the effects of motivational intensity on cognitive flexibility. Results showed that low motivational intensity increased cognitive flexibility and high motivational intensity reduced flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y. | last2 = Wang | first2 = Z. | year = 2014 | title = Positive Affect and Cognitive Control Approach-Motivation Intensity Influences the Balance Between Cognitive Flexibility and Stability | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 1116–1123 | doi = 10.1177/0956797614525213 | pmid=24671575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuropsychological measures have been used in previous research to measure participant’s neurological responses while they view high and low motivational intensity pictures&lt;ref name="PG2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmon-Jones, E. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gable | first1 = P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">'''Moves management''' is a term used primarily with the [[non-profit sector]] in relationship to [[donor development]]. It refers to the process by which a prospective [[Donation|donor]] is moved from cultivation to solicitation. “Moves” are the actions an organization takes to bring in donors, establish relationships, and renew contributions. David Dunlop, the [[Cornell University]] senior development officer who developed the concept of moves management, described the idea as “changing people’s attitudes so they want to give.”&lt;ref name="Avectra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Orankashaw/the-new-model-of-moves-management-for-effective-fundraising|title=The New Model of Moves Management for Effective Fundraising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
An organization implementing moves management should have a system of policies, procedures, and practices that direct the actions of the organization towards bringing in donors, forging relationships, and generating major gifts. These systems should be focused on donors, rather than donations. They should also emphasize documenting the relationship between the donor and the organization.&lt;ref name="ProsperFundraising"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosperfundraising.com/pdf/moves_management.pdf|title=Moves Management: The Science of Fundraising}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Major Gifts: Moves Management Made Easy
"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/NonprofitWebinars/major-gifts-moves-management-made-easy|title=Major Gifts: Moves Management Made Easy
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Tracked==
Moves management requires a baseline of [[personally identifiable information]] for each donor. Because moves management attempts to leverage personal relationships with donors, an organization should be tracking the following:

*Donor's biographical information
*Donor's actions
*Donor's interests
*Donor's relationships
*Donor's giving history

Using this data and any other additional information in your information tracking system is the foundation for enhancing donor communication and improving solicitation strategies under the moves management philosophy.

==Social Data==
Moves management’s heavy focus on donor relationships has led to social data transforming the way organizations are able to interact with donors. Organizations have primarily begun incorporating social data into their moves management strategies in two ways: prospecting and engagement.

===Prospecting Uses===
The donor prospecting phase has been enhanced through the ability of [[Customer_relationship_management#Non-profit_and_membership-based|constituent relationship management]] (CRM) technology to import social data. This data also helps inform solicitation strategies, pipeline management, and overall outreach execution for the entire organization.

===Engagement Uses===
Donor engagement has benefitted from the use of social data by providing [[Fundraising#Professional_fundraisers|development officers]] with additional methods of communication. The variety of ways that social media is disseminated has created. CRM software is commonly used to parse the large quantities of social data to turn it into something that is actionable for development officers who are reaching out and nurturing donor relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4122">'''Name-dropping''' is the practice of naming or alluding to important people and institutions within a [[conversation]],&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{citation|title=It's Hard to Eradicate the Name-Dropping Pest|first=Leonard|last=Wibberley|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[narrative|story]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bibliographic name-dropping|first=Harry C.|last=Bauer|journal=Library Review|volume=17|issue=6|year=1960|pages=408–410|doi=10.1108/eb012326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[song]], [[online identity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Public displays of connection|first1=J.|last1=Donath|first2=D.|last2=Boyd|journal=BT Technology Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2004|pages=71–82|doi=10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047585.06264.cc}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or other communication.  The term often connotes an attempt to impress others; it is usually regarded negatively,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and under certain circumstances may constitute a breach of [[professional ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Yeah, I work with Beckham’: Issues of confidentiality, privacy and privilege in sport  psychology service delivery|first=Mark B.|last=Anderson|pages=3–13|journal=Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology Review|volume=1|issue=2|year=2005|url=https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005164006/https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-05|deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When used as part of a logical [[argument]] it can be an example of the [[false authority]] [[fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Understanding arguments|first1=Donald|last1=Evans|first2=Humphrey|last2=Palmer|publisher=Drake Educational Associates|year=1986|page=286}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'shout-out' can be regarded as a type of name-dropping where someone's name, or a list of names, is spoken out in order to direct attention towards these groups or individuals, often as a means of expressing [[wikt:kudos|kudos]] or making a referral.

==Purposes==
Name-dropping is used to position oneself within a [[social hierarchy]].  It is often used to create a sense of superiority by raising one's status.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise his or her own [[social status]] to a level closer to that of those whose names he or she has dropped, and thus elevate himself or herself above, or into, present company.

Name-dropping can also be used to identify people with a common bond.  By indicating the names of people one knows, one makes known his or her [[social circle]], providing an opportunity for others with similar connections to relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Name-Dropping|title=5 steps to professional presence: how to project confidence, competence, and credibility at work|first1=Susan|last1=Bixler|first2=Lisa Scherrer|last2=Dugan|publisher=Adams Media|year=2000|isbn=978-1-58062-442-8|pages=154–155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of [[appeal to authority]], name-dropping can be an important form of informal [[argument]]ation, as long as the name being dropped is of someone who is an expert on the subject of the argument and that person's views are accurately represented.

==Methods==
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Use of the first name may be effective, as in the case of "Kingsley" for [[Kingsley Amis]].&lt;ref name="Knack"&gt;Joseph Epstein, "A Nice Little Knack for Name Dropping" in ''Narcissus Leaves the Pool'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Name-dropping is also sometimes used in works of fiction to place a story in a certain historical timeframe, or to imply the involvement of a historical figure in the action (for example, in a story set during World War II, mentioning [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Winston Churchill]]). {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The '''Office of the Australian Information Commissioner''' (OAIC), known until 2010 as the '''Office of the Australian Privacy Commissioner''' is an independent [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] agency, acting as the [[national data protection authority]] for Australia, established under the ''Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010'',&lt;ref name="comlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2010A00052}}&lt;/ref&gt;  headed by the [[Australian Information Commissioner]].

The office has three primary functions:&lt;ref name="comlaw1"/&gt; 
* privacy functions, conferred by the ''Privacy Act 1988''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Privacy Act 1988|url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other laws 
* freedom of information functions, in particular, oversight of the operation of the ''[[Freedom of Information Act 1982]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freedom of Information Act 1982|url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (FOI Act) and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act
* government information policy functions, conferred on the Australian Information Commissioner under the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010.&lt;ref name="comlaw1"/&gt;

The office is an agency within the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]]'s portfolio. The office liaises with the Business and Information Law Branch, part of the Civil Law Division within the Civil Justice and Legal Services Group of the Attorney-General's Department. However, the office is an independent agency and reports directly to the Parliament of Australia, not to the Attorney-General.

== History ==
The first [[Australian Privacy Commissioner]] was appointed in 1989 to the former Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which was the national privacy regulatory body until 2010. Major changes to federal freedom of information (FOI) law made in 2010 established the present office as the body responsible for FOI, privacy, and information policy. The ''Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010''&lt;ref name="comlaw2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2010A00051}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed in May 2010, and came into effect from November 2010. This Act introduced fundamental changes to the way information held by government is managed and accessed by members of the public (see Freedom of Information).

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner was integrated into the office at this time.

== Structure ==
The office is headed by the Australian Information Commissioner. Despite their titles, all commissioners can exercise the privacy and freedom of information (FOI) functions. However, only the Information Commissioner may exercise the information policy functions.

== Responsibilities ==
The office’s responsibilities include:
* conducting investigations
* reviewing decisions made under the FOI Act
* handling complaints
* monitoring agency administration
* education and awareness programs
* providing advice to the public, government agencies and businesses.

== Freedom of Information ==
The office has freedom of information functions, including the oversight of the operation of the FOI Act and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act. If a person is dissatisfied with the result of an FOI request, they may seek review by the office. A person may also complain to the office if they are unhappy with the manner in which their request was handled by an agency.

The FOI Act has been a feature of Australia's legislative landscape since 1982. The purpose of the FOI Act was to open government activity to public scrutiny, so as to enhance accountability and encourage citizen engagement with public administration. In 2010, the Australian Parliament implemented wide-ranging open government reforms — the most significant FOI reforms in thirty years. The office was established and substantial changes were made to the FOI Act. These reforms simplified the process for accessing government information, tightened the exemptions to information release, strengthened independent oversight and review of FOI administration, promoted proactive publication of government information, and clearly stated the open government object of the FOI Act.

The object of the Act is 'to increase recognition that information held by the Government is to be managed for public purposes, and is a national resource'.&lt;ref name="comlaw2"/&gt; The Reform Act introduced a new scheme for the proactive publication of government information called the Information Publication Scheme, under which government agencies are required to provide certain operational information on their websites.

The office may initiate an own motion investigation (OMI). The office can also provide information and advice on FOI to individuals and agencies, via the [http://www.oaic.gov.au/about-us/contact-us OAIC enquiries line].

== Privacy ==
Privacy is one of three broad functions conferred on the office. The [[Legislature|legislative]] basis of these privacy functions is drawn primarily from the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act regulates how an individual's personal information is handled. For example, it covers: 
* how personal information is collected (e.g. the personal information a person provides when they fill in a form)
* how it is then used and disclosed
* its accuracy
* how securely it is kept
* a person’s general right to access that information.

The Act also covers more specific matters, such as: 
* the use of tax file numbers
* how credit worthiness information about a person is handled by credit reporting agencies and credit providers.

The office has a range of responsibilities under other laws, including laws relating to data matching, eHealth, spent convictions and tax file numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/law |title=Home - OAIC |publisher=Privacy.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office provides information and advice on privacy to individuals, businesses and agencies via the [http://www.oaic.gov.au/about-us/contact-us OAIC enquiries line].

Under the Privacy Act a person can make a complaint to the office about the handling of their personal information by Australian, ACT and Norfolk Island government agencies and private sector organisations covered by the Privacy Act. In some circumstances, the office may also initiate an OMI.

The office has the power to conduct privacy audits of Australian and ACT Government agencies, as well as some other organisations in certain circumstances.

The Privacy Advisory Committee (PAC) provides strategic advice on privacy, from a broad range of perspectives, to the Australian Information Commissioner. PAC was established under section 82 of the Privacy Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Privacy Act 1988|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712}}&lt;/ref&gt; All members except the Commissioner are appointed by Her Excellency the Governor-General. PAC consists of no more than six members and is convened by the Australian Information Commissioner.

== Information policy ==
The Information Commissioner reports to the Attorney-General on matters relating to Australian Government information management policy and practice, including FOI and privacy.

The Information Commissioner is assisted in this regard by an [http://www.oaic.gov.au/about-us/working-with-others/information-advisory-committee Information Advisory Committee] (IAC), comprising senior officers from key agencies and people from outside government who have suitable qualifications or experience.

The office has released a set of ''Principles on open public sector information''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles on open public sector information|url=http://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/information-policy-agency-resources/principles-on-open-public-sector-information}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and an accompanying report. The principles are based on the premise that public sector information is to be managed for public purposes as a national resource.

The office encourages agencies to embed the principles in their internal policies and procedures on information management. The intention is that by doing so they will help build a culture of proactive information disclosure and community engagement.

'''OpenCog''' is a project that aims to build an [[open source software|open source]] artificial intelligence framework. '''OpenCog Prime''' is an architecture for robot and virtual [[embodied cognition]] that defines a set of interacting components designed to give rise to human-equivalent [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) as an [[emergent phenomenon]] of the whole system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cybertechnews.org/?p=915 |title=OpenCog: Open-Source Artificial General Intelligence for Virtual Worlds {{!}} CyberTech News |date=2009-03-06 |access-date=2016-10-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306053354/http://www.cybertechnews.org/?p=915 |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCog Prime's design is primarily the work of [[Ben Goertzel]] while the OpenCog framework is intended as a generic framework for broad-based AGI research. Research utilizing OpenCog has been published in journals and presented at conferences and workshops including the annual [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence]]. OpenCog is released under the terms of the [[Affero General Public License|GNU Affero General Public License]].

OpenCog is in use by more than 50 companies, including [[Huawei]] and [[Cisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/07/singularitynet-talks-collaborative-ai-as-its-token-sale-hits-400-oversubscription/ |title=SingularityNET talks collaborative AI as its token sale hits 400% oversubscription |last=Rogers |first=Stewart |date=2017-12-07 |website=venturebeat.com |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

OpenCog was originally based on the release in 2008 of the source code of the proprietary "Novamente Cognition Engine" (NCE) of Novamente LLC. The original NCE code is discussed in the PLN book (ref below).  Ongoing development of OpenCog is supported by [[Artificial General Intelligence Research Institute]] (AGIRI), the [[Google Summer of Code]] project, [[Hanson Robotics]], [[SingularityNET]] and others.

== Components ==

OpenCog consists of:

* A [[graph database]], dubbed the [https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomspace AtomSpace], that holds "atoms" (that is, [[term (logic)|terms]], [[atomic formula]]s, [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] and [[relational model|relationships]]) together with their "values" ([[valuation (logic)|valuations]] or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]], which can be thought of as per-atom [[key-value database]]s). An example of a value would be a [[truth value]]. Atoms are globally unique, immutable and are indexed (searchable); values are fleeting and changeable.

* A collection of pre-defined atoms, termed [https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomese Atomese], used for generic [[knowledge representation]], such as [[conceptual graph]]s and [[semantic network]]s, as well as to represent and store the rules (in the sense of [[term rewriting]]) needed to manipulate such graphs.

* A collection of pre-defined atoms, that encode a [[type theory|type subsystem]], including [[type constructor]]s and [[function type]]s. These are used to specify the types of variables, terms and expressions, and are used to specify the structure of generic graphs containing variables.

* A collection of pre-defined atoms that encode both [[functional programming language|functional]] and [[imperative programming language|imperative]] programming styles.  These include the [[lambda abstraction]] for binding [[free variable]]s into [[bound variable]]s, as well as for performing [[beta reduction]].

* A collection of pre-defined atoms that encode a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] solver, built in as a part of a generic graph query engine, for performing graph and hypergraph pattern matching ([[graph isomorphism|isomorphic subgraph discovery]]).  This generalizes the idea of a structured query language ([[SQL]]) to the domain of generic graphical queries; it is an extended form of a graph [[query language]].

* A generic [[rule engine]], including a [[forward chaining|forward chainer]] and a [[backward chaining|backward chainer]], that is able to chain together rules. The rules are exactly the graph queries of the graph query subsystem, and so the rule engine vaguely resembles a [[query plan]]ner. It is designed so as to allow different kinds of [[inference engine]]s and [[reasoning system]]s to be implemented, such as [[Bayesian inference]] or [[fuzzy logic]], or practical tasks, such as [[constraint solver]]s or [[planning|motion planner]]s.

* An attention allocation subsystem based on economic theory, termed ECAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/ECAN | title = Economic Attention Allocation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsystem is used to control the combinatorial explosion of search possibilities that are met during inference and chaining.

* An implementation of a probabilistic [[reasoning system|reasoning engine]] based on [[probabilistic logic network]]s (PLN).  The current implementation uses the rule engine to chain together specific rules of [[logical inference]] (such as [[modus ponens]]), together with some very specific mathematical formulas assigning a probability and a confidence to each deduction. This subsystem can be thought of as a certain kind of [[proof assistant]] that works with a modified form of Bayesian inference.

* A probabilistic [[genetic programming|genetic program evolver]] called Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/MOSES|title=MOSES}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is used to discover collections of short Atomese programs that accomplish tasks; these can be thought of as performing a kind of [[decision tree learning]], resulting in a kind of [[random forest|decision forest]], or rather, a generalization thereof.

* A natural language input system consisting of [[Link Grammar]], and partly inspired by both [[ Meaning-Text Theory]] as well as Dick Hudson's [[word grammar|Word Grammar]], which encodes semantic and syntactic relations in Atomese.

* A natural language generation system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Natural_language_generation|title=Natural Language Generation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* An implementation of [[Psi-Theory]] for handling [[emotion]]al states, drives and urges, dubbed OpenPsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.opencog.org/w/OpenPsi|title=OpenPsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Interfaces to [[Hanson Robotics]] robots, including emotion modelling&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.hansonrobotics.com/w/Emotion_modeling&lt;/ref&gt; via OpenPsi.  This includes the [[Loving AI]] project, used to demonstrate meditation techniques.

== Organization and funding ==

In 2008, the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] (MIRI), formerly called Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), sponsored several researchers and engineers. Many contributions from the open source community have been made since OpenCog's involvement in the [[Google Summer of Code]] in 2008 and 2009. Currently MIRI no longer supports OpenCog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiverseaccordingtoben.blogspot.com/2010/10/singularity-institutes-scary-idea-and.html|author=Ben Goertzel|title=The Singularity Institute's Scary Idea (and Why I Don't Buy It)|work=The Multiverse According to Ben|date = 2010-10-29|accessdate = 2011-06-24|authorlink=Ben_Goertzel}}&lt;/ref&gt; OpenCog has received funding and support from several sources, including the Hong Kong government, [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], the [[Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhendricks/2013/10/02/science-funder-jeffrey-epstein-launches-radical-emotional-software-for-the-gaming-industry/|title=Science Funder Jeffrey Epstein Launches Radical Emotional Software |publisher= Forbes |date= Oct 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hanson Robotics]]. The OpenCog project is currently affiliated with [[SingularityNET]] and Hanson Robotics.

'''Parading on a donkey''' is a traditional [[psychological punishment]], consisting in a [[public humiliation]].

==Scope==

* In [[rural]] areas of [[India]], it is intended to humiliate those guilty of minor [[crime]]s, and usually meted out by village elders or the local [[panchayat]] system of justice. The guilty person's head is often shaved and a garland of used [[footwear]] hung around their neck before they are paraded around the village or town on a [[donkey]] while mocked by onlookers. 10th century inscriptions from [[Uttaramerur]] indicate that parading on donkey was a punishment for offences such as [[incest]], [[adultery]], [[theft]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="VKA_2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian History |editor=VK Agnihotri |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MazdaWXQFuQC&amp;pg=SL2-PA62 |publisher=Allied |isbn=978-81-8424-568-4 |year=2010 |edition=26th |pages=B–62–B–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], "Iranian authorities frequently parade youths, forced to sit backwards on donkeys, in their local neighbourhood so as to embarrass and humiliate them ... for petty crimes such as alcohol consumption, disregarding nightly curfews and disrespect towards security agents",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/irj00511.htm "Iran sentences three youth to flogging, jail"], in: ''Iran Focus'', 21 November 2005 (illustrated)&lt;/ref&gt; or if the court orders so through several neighbourhoods; this may be a prelude to subsequent [[flogging]] and/or jail terms; in the Western [[Ancien Régime]] tradition too (long continued, even in former colonies), criminals were often transported publicly to the place of their ordeal.
* In post-Renaissance [[France]] society ridiculed and humiliated husbands thought to be battered and/or dominated by their wives. A battered husband was trotted around town riding a donkey backwards while holding its tail.
* According to the Christian [[Gospels]], [[Jesus of Nazareth entered Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]] riding a donkey and being welcomed with palms by the locals, thus fulfilling a [[Biblical prophecy]]. In this case, the donkey parade was not a punishment but a messianic action in a modest variation as a symbol of meekness.
* The [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']] used to parade on a donkey across [[Red Square]] on [[Palm Sunday]].
* In the movie ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' the defeated Christian king [[Guy of Lusignan]] is paraded before Jerusalem on a donkey by the Muslim army commanded by [[Saladin]].

In [[projective geometry]], a '''plane at infinity''' is the [[hyperplane at infinity]] of a three dimensional [[projective space]] or to any [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] contained in the hyperplane at infinity of any projective space of higher dimension. This article will be concerned solely with the three-dimensional case.

==Definition==
There are two approaches to defining the ''plane at infinity'' which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3-space or an [[affine space|affine 3-space]].

If a projective 3-space is given, the ''plane at infinity'' is any distinguished [[projective plane]] of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|loc=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane. On the other hand, given an affine 3-space, the ''plane at infinity'' is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3-space in order to give it closure of [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence]] properties. Meaning that the points of the ''plane at infinity'' are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3-space will meet, and the [[line (geometry)|lines]] are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3-space will meet. The result of the addition is the projective 3-space, &lt;math&gt;P^3&lt;/math&gt;. This point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity, but does make it look "special" in comparison to the other planes of the space.

If the affine 3-space is real, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, then the addition of a [[real projective plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^2&lt;/math&gt; at infinity produces the real projective 3-space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Analytic representation==
Since any two projective planes in a projective 3-space are equivalent, we can choose a [[homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous coordinate system]] so that any point on the plane at infinity is represented as (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meserve|1983|loc=p. 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any point in the affine 3-space will then be represented as (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1). The points on the plane at infinity seem to have three degrees of freedom, but homogeneous coordinates are equivalent [[up to]] any rescaling:

: &lt;math&gt; (X : Y : Z : 0) \equiv (a X : a Y : a Z : 0) &lt;/math&gt;,

so that the coordinates (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0) can be [[Normalized vector|normalized]], thus reducing the degrees of freedom to two (thus, a surface, namely a projective plane).

''Proposition'': Any line which passes through the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] (0:0:0:1) and through a point (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1) will intersect the plane at infinity at the point (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).

''Proof'': A line which passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1) will consist of points which are [[homogeneous coordinates#Linear Combinations of Points Described with Homogeneous Co-ordinates|linear combinations]] of the two given points:
:&lt;math&gt; a (0:0:0:1) + b (X:Y:Z:1) = (bX :bY: bZ: a + b). &lt;/math&gt;
For such a point to lie on the plane at infinity we must have, &lt;math&gt; a + b = 0&lt;/math&gt;. So, by choosing &lt;math&gt; a = - b&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the point  
&lt;math&gt;(bX:bY:bZ:0) = (X : Y : Z : 0) &lt;/math&gt;, as required.  [[Q.E.D.]]

Any pair of parallel lines in 3-space will intersect each other at a point on the plane at infinity.  Also, every line in 3-space intersects the plane at infinity at a unique point.  This point is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the line.  To determine this point, consider a line parallel to the given line, but passing through the origin, if the line does not already pass through the origin. Then choose any point, other than the origin, on this second line.  If the homogeneous coordinates of this point are (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':1), then the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity through which the first and second line both pass is (''X'':''Y'':''Z'':0).

''Example'': Consider a line passing through the points (0:0:1:1) and (3:0:1:1).  A parallel line passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (3:0:0:1).  This second line intersects the plane at infinity at the point (3:0:0:0).  But the first line also passes through this point:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda (3:0:1:1) + \mu (0:0:1:1) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = (3 \lambda : 0 : \lambda + \mu : \lambda + \mu)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = ( 3 : 0 : 0 : 0) &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;\lambda + \mu = 0&lt;/math&gt;. ■

Any pair of parallel planes in affine 3-space will intersect each other in a projective line (a [[line at infinity]]) in the plane at infinity.  Also, every plane in the affine 3-space intersects the plane at infinity in a unique line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This line is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the plane.

==Properties==
Since the plane at infinity is a projective plane, it is [[homeomorphic]] to the surface of a "sphere modulo antipodes", i.e. a sphere in which [[antipodal point]]s are equivalent: S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/{1,-1} where the quotient is understood as a quotient by a group action (see [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5604">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''police power''' is the capacity of the [[U.S. state|states]] to [[Regulation|regulate]] behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the [[health]], [[safety]], [[Morality|morals]], and [[Common good|general welfare]] of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Police Power| encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica|url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060615/police-power| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that the Federal Government does not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.

Police power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and [[law enforcement|enforcement of law]]s. States have the power to compel [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the [[United States Constitution]] or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include [[Sanctions (law)|legal sanctions]], [[violence#Law|physical means]], and other forms of [[coercion]] and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.

== Origins ==

The authority for use of police power under American Constitutional law has its roots in [[English law#Common law|English]] and European common law traditions.&lt;ref name=Pox&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more fundamentally, use of police power draws on two (Latin) principles, ''[[sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas]]'' ("use that which is yours so as not to injure others"), and ''[[salus populi suprema lex esto]]'' ("the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law"), to justify restriction of individual liberties in order to protect the general welfare.&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; The concept of police power in America was further expanded in a series of notable court cases in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, including the landmark 1851 [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]], and the 1905 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]].

== Restrictions ==
{{Geographical imbalance|United States|section|date=July 2017}}
Due to the nebulous definition of the police power, restrictions on its use are few and far between. In Commonwealth v. Alger, Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] wrote that "It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of [the police power] than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to exercise."&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; However, according to historian Michael Willrich, "Shaw recognized certain constitutional restraints on police power, but they were few. Laws must apply equally to all under like circumstances... government interferences with individual rights must be 'reasonable' – they must have a clear relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. Beyond those outer limits... most courts stayed out of the way of state police power."&lt;ref name="Pox 302"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox |date=2012|publisher=Penguin |location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court cases have expanded somewhat on these restrictions by limiting the ability of states to infringe upon implied constitutional rights and by demanding a stricter standard of [[Legal burden of proof|reasonability]], but regulation of police power remains fairly minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Galva, Jorge E., Christopher Atchinson, and Samuel Levey. "Public Health Strategy and the Police Powers of the State." Public Health Reports 120.1 (2005): 20–27. National Center for Biotechnology Information. Web. 18 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of United States land-use planning authority ==
The police power is the basis for [[land-use planning]] authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]] was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Law of Zoning and Land Use Controls, Barlow Burke, Lexisnexis, Chapter 1, Published 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political freedom''' (also known as '''political autonomy''' or '''political agency''') is a central [[concept]] in history and political thought and one of the most important features of [[Democracy|democratic]] societies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?", ''Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought'', (New York: Penguin, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Political freedom was described as freedom from oppression&lt;ref&gt;Iris Marion Young, "Five Faces of Oppression", ''Justice and the Politics of Difference" (Princeton University press, 1990), 39–65.&lt;/ref&gt; or coercion,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Development as Freedom'' (Anchor Books, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; or the absence of life conditions of compulsion, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]], "Alienated Labour" in ''Early Writings''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although political freedom is often interpreted [[Negative liberty|negatively]] as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action,&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah Berlin]], ''Liberty'' (Oxford 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; it can also refer to the [[positive liberty|positive]] exercise of rights, [[Capability approach|capacities]] and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "What's Wrong With Negative Liberty?", ''Philosophy and the Human Sciences: Philosophical Papers'' (Cambridge, 1985), 211–229.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social [[conformity]], consistency, or inauthentic behaviour).&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, "[http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm Self-Reliance]"; Nikolas Kompridis, "Struggling Over the Meaning of Recognition: A Matter of Identity, Justice or Freedom?" in ''European Journal of Political Theory'' July 2007 vol. 6 no. 3 pp. 277–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]], which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the [[State (polity)|state]].

== Views ==
Various groups along the [[political spectrum]] naturally differ on what they believe constitutes true political freedom.

[[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of [[positive liberty]], or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.

[[Classical liberalism|Classical liberal]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] criticized this as a misconception of freedom: &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he use of "liberty" to describe the physical "ability to do what I want", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us [...] has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument[.] [T]he notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich August von Hayek, "Freedom and Coercion" in David Miller (ed), ''Liberty'' (1991) pp. 80, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Social anarchism|Anarcho-socialists]] see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one's labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by [[Right Libertarianism|capitalism]] as "selfish freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/faq/sp001547/secF2.html#secf22 "Anarchism FAQ"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalists]] see negative rights as a consistent system. [[Ayn Rand]] described it as "a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context". To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which by definition trump other moral considerations. Any alleged right which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services and so on) produced by people is in effect a purported right to enslave others.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Some notable philosophers, such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, "The Virtues of Acknowledged Dependence", ''Rational Dependent Animals: Why Humans Need the Virtues'' (Open Court, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', American economist [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; argues that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and [[economic freedom]]. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by [[Robin Hahnel]] in his article "Why the Market Subverts Democracy". Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedman’s understanding of economic freedom, i.e. that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights system—which Friedman fails to provide or specify directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahnel|first=R.|date=2009-03-01|title=Why the Market Subverts Democracy|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0002764208327672|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=52|issue=7|pages=1006–1022|doi=10.1177/0002764208327672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capitalism and Freedom|last=Friedman|first=Milton|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to political philosopher [[Nikolas Kompridis]], the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as [[autonomy]] or [[independence]] and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, "The Idea of a New Beginning: A Romantic Source of Normativity and Freedom" in ''Philosophical Romanticism'' (New York: Routledge, 2007), 32-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, "The Subject and Power" in Paul Rabinow and Nikolas S. Rose, eds., ''The Essential Foucault''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Jacques Rancière]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

[[Environmentalist]]s often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of [[ecosystem]]s. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create [[negative externalities]], which violates other groups' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, [[golf]] and [[urban sprawl]] has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and [[ecological conservation]] can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of [[PETA]] regarding [[fur]].

[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|John Dalberg-Acton]] stated: "The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Freedom and Other Essays|edition=|last=Acton|first=John D.|year=1907|publisher= Macmillan|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald C. MacCallum Jr.]] spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. It is triadic in relation to each other because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacCallum|first=Gerald|date=July 1967|title=Negative and Positive Freedom|url=http://mcv.planc.ee/misc/doc/filosoofia/artiklid/Gerald%20MacCallum%20-%20Negative%20and%20Positive%20Freedom.pdf|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=73|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hannah Arendt]] traces freedom's conceptual origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] politics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of [[free will|freedom of the will]], or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is "the raison d'être of politics".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?", ''Between Past and Future: Eight exercises in political thought'' (New York: Penguin, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Arendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to [[sovereignty]] or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to "begin anew", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as "new beginnings and hence beginners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25458723|title=On revolution|last=Hannah|first=Arendt|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1965|isbn=9780140184211|edition=Reprinted|location=London|pages=211|oclc=25458723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arendt's view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of "the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, "What is Freedom?", p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Population Media Center''' ('''PMC''') is an international non-profit organisation, founded in 1998 by [[Bill Ryerson]] and headquartered in [[South Burlington, Vermont|South Burlington]], [[Vermont]], United States.

The organization works with [[mass media]] and other organizations to achieve the stabilization of the human population at a level that can be sustained by the world's natural resources. It also aims to lessen the impact of the growing number of humans on the environment. The organization helps to educate people  about the benefits of small families, encourages the use of family planning, upholds women's status&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/two-crises-one-solution-pmc/|title=Population Media Center: Two Crises, One Solution {{!}} MAHB|date=2017-10-19|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotes gender equity.

The organization creates long-running serial dramas based on its particular [https://www.populationmedia.org/product/serial-dramas/ entertainment methodology], derived from [[Miguel Sabido]]'s original [[Entertainment-Education]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/2007/08/09/sex-soap-social-change-the-sabido-methodology/|title=Sex, Soap &amp; Social Change - The Sabido Methodology - Population Media Center|date=2007-08-09|work=Population Media Center|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help change attitudes and behavior related to people's health and well-being.  This methodology has been scientifically shown to lead to population-wide behavior change in many countries where it has been implemented, and was spread widely by former PMC board member and advisor [[David Poindexter]].

[[File:Gerbrand van den Eeckhout 003.jpg|thumb|260px|right|''Scholar and His Books'' by [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]].]]
The '''scholarly method''' or '''scholarship''' is the body of [[principle]]s and [[Practice (social theory)|practice]]s used by [[wikt:scholar|scholars]] to make their claims about the world as valid and trustworthy as possible, and to make them known to the scholarly public. It is the methods that systemically advance the [[teaching]], [[research]], and [[:wikt:practice|practice]] of a given scholarly or academic field of study through rigorous inquiry. Scholarship is noted by its significance to its particular profession{{huh|date=October 2018}}, and is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and can be and is [[peer-reviewed]] through various methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacn.nche.edu/publications/position/defining-scholarship Aacn.nche.edu, Retrieved 15OCT2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Originally started to reconcile the [[philosophy]] of the ancient [[classical philosophy|classical philosophers]] with medieval [[Christian theology|theology]], [[scholasticism]] is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].  The primary purpose of scholasticism is to find the answer to a question or to resolve a contradiction.  It was once well known for its application in medieval theology but was eventually applied to classical philosophy and many other fields of study.

The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. The question of the nature, and indeed the possibility, of sound historical method is raised in the [[philosophy of history]], as a question of [[epistemology]]. History guidelines commonly used by historians in their work require [[external criticism]], internal criticism, and [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]].

The [[empirical method]] is generally taken to mean the collection of data on which to base a [[hypothesis]] or derive a conclusion in [[science]]. It is part of the [[scientific method]], but is often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with other methods. The empirical method is not sharply defined and is often contrasted with the precision of experiments, where data is derived from the systematic manipulation of variables. The [[experimental method]] investigates [[causality|causal]] relationships among [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]. An experiment is a cornerstone of the [[empiricism|empirical]] approach to acquiring data about the world and is used in both [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s. An experiment can be used to help solve practical problems and to support or negate [[theory|theoretical]] assumptions.

The scientific method refers to a body of techniques for investigating [[phenomenon|phenomena]], acquiring new [[knowledge]], or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]], [[empirical]] and measurable [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794–6}}, Christian Horsley from the General Scholium, which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Self-fashioning''', a term introduced by [[Stephen Greenblatt]] (''Renaissance Self-Fashioning'', 1980), is used to describe the process of constructing one's identity and public persona according to a set of socially acceptable standards.  Greenblatt described the process in the Renaissance era where a noble man was instructed to dress in the finest clothing he could afford, to be well versed and educated in art, literature, sports, and other culturally determined noble exercises, and to generally compose himself in a carefully intended manner.  Additionally, the relationship between self-fashioning and the aesthetic mediums was a reciprocal one.  Just as the art of creating oneself was highly influenced by the art and literature of the time, such as conduct books and religious [[iconography]], such a concern for one's outwardly projected image was reflected in the [[portrait painting|portraiture]] of the time.

According to Greenblatt, during the [[Renaissance]] the upper class practiced self-fashioning.  Prescribed attire and behavior was created for the noblemen and women, and were represented through portraits.  The ideological traits portraying [[masculinity]] were symbols of authority and power.  Male rulers depicted themselves in armor or with weapons.  The most important characteristic attributed to women was beauty. Beauty represents the concepts of purity, virtue and modesty.  In portraits, women performed these traits through idealized features, fancy dresses, and elaborate jewelry. The iconography of portraits displays the gender-specific qualities prescribed during the Renaissance through visual devices.

''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', by [[Baldassare Castiglione]], is one of the first texts that depicted behaviors which individuals were expected to adopt in society. As an informal book of conduct, ''The Courtier'' included instructions on how people of the noble class were to dress and speak, as well as general rules of interaction to follow in social situations.  In his article "The Semiotics of Masculinity in Renaissance England", David Kuchta discusses the role of ''The Courtier''   concerning its influence on the self-fashioning of Renaissance England.  Men of the noble class were to "create" themselves as works of art, according to the conventions of dress and manner as set forth by the monarchs.  Characteristics of this Renaissance self-fashioning involve the use of "feminine" aspects of dress and conduct.  A man was to conduct and dress in a way that reflected his position in society.  He was not supposed to act in an affected manner, but present naturalness and nonchalance, or sprezzatura.  In addition to, ''The Courtier''  puts emphasis on the importance of not only trying to resemble one's master, but actually trying to transform himself into his master in a way that exercises sprezzatura.  This presents a key theme in self-fashioning: the conscious effort to strive to imitate a praised model in society.

For women, one of the most popular figures to imitate was the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].  Margaret R. Miles provides a thorough analysis of this influence-through-images of iconography and art in her article "The Virgin's One Bare Breast". The bare breast symbolized nourishment in a time of famine.  Depicting the Virgin Mary nursing the infant [[Christ]] encouraged women to aspire to provide the same nourishment for their own families and community.  Miles goes on to explain that, although women were encouraged to strive to emulate the many virtues of the Virgin, they must also be aware that one could never fully achieve such a standard.  Similarly, men were taught that they should follow in the image of Christ, which was believed to be more attainable.

Greenblatt's theories are influenced by the French sociologist and historian [[Michel Foucault]].

Self-fashioning has implications and applications outside of Renaissance studies. Waleska Schwandt applies the theory to Oscar Wilde in a chapter of the book ''The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: Versions of Wilde during the Last 100 Years'',  edited by Uwe Boker et al. (New York and Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2002).  Alvina E. Quintana uses the theory to analyse twentieth century Chicano literature (see "Ana Castillo's ''The Mixquiahuala Leters''", in ''Criticism in the Borderlands: Studies in Chicano Literature, Culture and Ideology'', Hector Calderon and Jose David Saldivar (eds), Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;72–83). Jack Chen applies the concept to the writings of Emperor Taizong in a book titled ''the Poetics of Sovereignty: on Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty,'' (Boston, Mass: Harvard University Asia Center, 2011).

'''Social position''' is the position of an [[individual]] in a given [[society]] and [[culture]]. A given position (for example, the occupation of ''[[priest]]'') may belong to many individuals. Social position influences [[social status]].

Social positions an individual may hold fall into the categories of [[employment|occupation]] (medical doctor, academic lecturer), [[profession]] (member of associations and organisations), [[family]] (parent, sibling, etc.), [[hobby]] (member of various clubs and organisations), among others. An individual is likely to create a personal [[hierarchy]] of such positions, where one will be a central position while the rest are peripheral positions.

Social positions are ''visible'' if they require an individual to wear a [[uniform]] or some other kind of identifying mark. Often individual clothes or other attributes will advertise what social position one has at the moment. Non-visible social positions are called ''hidden''. A position that is deemed the most important to a given individual is called ''central'', others are ''peripheral''. If a ''sequence of positions'' is required to obtain a given position, it can be defined as a [[career]], and a change of position in this context is a [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] or [[demotion]]. Some social positions may make it easier for a given person to obtain others; in other cases, some positions may be restricted to individuals meeting specific criteria.

Social position together with [[social role]] determines an individual's place in the [[social environment]] and [[social organisation]]. A group of social positions will create a [[social class]] and a [[social circle]].

A [[social conflict]] caused by interference between social positions is called a ''position conflict''.

==Research==

The sociological term for social position is a way of identifying a person's position within the [[social hierarchy]] in a society.

=== Subjective social position ===

Subjective social position refers to an individual's perceived social position in a social hierarchy. According to Kristina Lindemann the individual objective characteristics like education, occupation and income are related with the subjective social position.&lt;ref name="lindemann"/&gt; In addition, the culture and society that a person lives and grows in, heavily impacts an individual’s subjective social position.  "An individual's subjective social position status depends not only on the objective characteristics but also on how people experience society, the way they perceive their position in comparison with others,and what they imagine their position would be in the future."&lt;ref name="lindemann"&gt;
Lindemann, Kristina. "The Impact of Objective Characteristics on Subjective Social Position." Trames 11 (2007): 54-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindemann divides objective characteristics into two groups, ascribed and achieved characteristics.  Ascribed characteristics are things like age, gender, and ethnicity.  Achieved characteristics are things like the education level, occupation, or income. Studies have indicated a significant relevance of these characteristics to an individual’s subjective social position.

On the other hand, some theories expect that objective characteristics do not have influence on subjective social position. The reference group theory mentioned by Lindemann in her essay states that people see the world as an enlarged version of their [[reference group]].  People base their social position upon the people around them. Typically people’s family, friends, and co-workers are usually very similar, and in general, most people see themselves as average and unexceptional. The status maximizing process also mentioned by Lindemann means that subjective social position reflects also person prospects and hopes for future societal attainment.

Lindemann’s empirical study focuses on Estonian society. Age is considered an impactful characteristic on people when identifying with their social position in Estonia. Young people give higher estimation to their social position, which is a tendency also found in other Eastern European countries. Gender and ethnicity, are also considerable characteristics in identifying social position.  In general, the subjective social position of men and women is not significantly different in western countries.  [[Ethnicity]] impacts social position differently from [[country]] to country.  More importantly the influence of ethnicity is closely related to the extent [[ethnic minorities]] are accepted by the overall society.&lt;ref name="lindemann"/&gt;

Different studies have shown that the effect of income on class identification in particular has increased during the last decades in Western countries. In Estonia, the income is the most important determinant that shapes people opinion of their social position. The increased influence of income on the subjective social position can be explained by the rise of consumer society values. In her studies Lindemann also found that occupation and education influence significantly the subjective social position.  As expected, managers and professionals and higher educated people identify with the middle or higher strata, while unskilled workers and low educated people relate with the lower positions in social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="lindemann"/&gt;

In several studies, researchers have assessed Individuals' perceived social position using the single-item MacArthur scale of subjective social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Relationship of subjective and objective social status with psychological and physiological functioning: Preliminary data in healthy, White women.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586|journal = Health Psychology|pages = 586–592|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586|first = Nancy E.|last = Adler|first2 = Elissa S.|last2 = Epel|first3 = Grace|last3 = Castellazzo|first4 = Jeannette R.|last4 = Ickovics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in self-rated health and subjective social status over time in a cohort of healthcare personnel|url = http://hpq.sagepub.com/content/19/9/1185|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|date = 2014-09-01|issn = 1359-1053|pmid = 23682064|pages = 1185–1196|volume = 19|issue = 9|doi = 10.1177/1359105313485486|first = Mark G.|last = Thompson|first2 = Manjusha J.|last2 = Gaglani|first3 = Allison|last3 = Naleway|first4 = Swathi|last4 = Thaker|first5 = Sarah|last5 = Ball}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacArthur scale of subjective social status is a drawing of a ten-rung ladder presented as the distribution of individuals in a social hierarchy. People with the highest salaries, best ranked jobs and highest education levels are depicted as standing on the upper rungs of the ladder, whereas those with the lowest salaries, poorest jobs, and lowest education levels are those who stand at the bottom of the ladder.

=== Social class ===
{{Main|Social class}}
A [[social class]] (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the [[social sciences]] and [[political theory]] centered on models of [[social stratification]] in which people are grouped into a set of [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchical]] social categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grant, J. Andrew |chapter=class, definition of |editor=Jones, R.J. Barry |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-24350-6 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a29qBofx8Y8C&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common being the [[upper class|upper]], [[middle class|middle]], and [[working class|lower classes]].

Class is a subject of analysis for [[List of sociologists|sociologists]], [[political scientist]]s, [[anthropologists]], and [[social history|social historians]]. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of  "class", and the term has a wide range of  sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term "social class" is usually synonymous with "[[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic]] class", defined as "people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status", e.g., "the [[working class]]"; "an emerging professional class".&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University. [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=social+class&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h=0 "Social class"].

The precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time.  [[Karl Marx]] thought "class" was defined  by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His simple understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]], are the [[proletariat]], those who work but do not own the means of production; and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist [[Max Weber]], who argued "class" is determined by economic position, in contrast to "[[social status]]" or "''Stand''"&lt;!--German term, could be confused with English word, so italics needed--&gt; which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (1921/2015). "Classes, Stände, Parties" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy and Social Stratification.  Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "class" is etymologically derived from the Latin ''classis'', which was used by [[census]] takers to categorize citizens by wealth, in order to determine military service obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, D.F. |chapter=Social class and Status |editor=Mey, Jacob |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics |publisher=Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-08-096297-9 |page=952 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmXgeBE7k0C&amp;pg=PA952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the term "class" began to replace classifications such as [[Estates of the realm|estate]]s, [[nobility|rank]], and [[religious order|order]]s as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics, and increase in the significance of wealth and [[income]] as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Class, Social |editor=Kuper, Adam |title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32096-2 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penney, Robert |chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen &amp; Levinson, David |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human capital ===
{{Main|Human capital}}

One way to change one's social position is to increase human capital.  The human capital theory suggest that people having more job-relevant resources, such as education and training, should receive more organizational rewards i.e. promotions than people with fewer of these resources.  Human capital alone can affect social position to a certain extent.  An individual has to have social skills and build social networks to help promote their social position.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, Erika H. "Race Related Differences in Promotions and Support." Organization Science 11.5 (2000): 493-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social capital ===
{{Main|Social capital}}

Another way to effectively increase one's chance of obtaining or sustaining social position is by increasing [[social capital]].  The social capital theory posits that certain qualities in workplace relationships are beneficial for receiving organizational rewards, and employees whose relationships are not characterized by these qualities are at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; In other words, people who have social relationships with upper management might get to know about a promotion possibility before someone lacking in the social capital infrastructure that relays that sort of information.

Erika James finds through studies and analysis that in general blacks have been promoted at a slower pace than whites.  This workplace discrimination occurred most likely because of unequal human/social capital between the two races.  Clearly this is not a justification for the actions to occur.  The issue of race still exists as a statistically proven factor in American job markets.

=== Trust ===
{{Main|Trust (social sciences)}}

For an individual to hold a social position thoroughly and knowledgeably they must be trusted in the{{Which|date=February 2011}} [[Market (economics)|market]] and reflect it in their behavior. Paul S. Adler says that a review of trends in [[employment relations]], interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust.  He believes the form of trust that is most effective in this context is of a distinctively modern kind - "reflective trust"  - as opposed to traditionalistic, "blind" trust.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;Adler, Paul S. "Market, Hierarchy, and Trust: The Knowledge Economy and the Future of Capitalism" ''Organization Science'' 12.2 (2001): 215-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The values at work in modern trust are those of the scientific community: "universalism, communism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism" (Merton 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;270). Modern trust is inclusive and open. The author concludes that the efficacy of trust for knowledge management and the likelihood of its growth over time are maximized if:

# Trust is balanced by hierarchical rules to ensure stability and equity
# Trust is balanced by market competition to ensure flexibility and opportunity
# Trust is modern and reflective rather than traditionalistic and blind

There is an element of trust necessary within society and for identifying with a particular social position - especially relevant to particular community positions where one's actions weigh heavily on one's social position.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;

In mathematics, a '''unitary spider diagram''' adds existential points to an [[Euler diagram|Euler]] or a [[Venn diagram]]. The points indicate the existence of an attribute described by the intersection of contours in the Euler diagram. These points may be joined together forming a shape like a [[spider]]. Joined points represent an "or" condition, also known as a [[logical disjunction]].

A '''spider diagram''' is a boolean expression involving unitary spider diagrams and the logical symbols &lt;math&gt;\land,\lor,\lnot&lt;/math&gt;. For example, it may consist of the conjunction of two spider diagrams, the disjunction of two spider diagrams, or the negation of a spider diagram.

== Example ==
[[Image:SpiderEuler.jpg|thumb|275px|Logical disjunction superimposed on Euler diagram]]
In the image shown, the following conjunctions
: &lt;math&gt;A \land B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;B \land C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F \land E&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;G \land F&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[universe of discourse]] defined by this [[Euler diagram]], in addition to the conjunctions specified above, all possible sets from ''A'' through ''B'' and ''D'' through ''G'' are available separately. The set ''C'' is only available as a subset of ''B''. Often, in complicated diagrams, [[singleton set]]s and/or conjunctions may be obscured by other set combinations.

The two spiders in the example correspond to the following logical expressions:
* Red spider: &lt;math&gt;(F \land E) \lor (G) \lor (D)&lt;/math&gt;
*Blue spider: &lt;math&gt;(A) \lor (C \land B) \lor (F)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Structured English Immersion (SEI)''' is a technique for rapidly teaching English to [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|English Language Learners]].  The term was coined by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter in a 1983 recommendation to schools to make use of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's]] successful [[French immersion]] programs.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model was developed to encourage bilingualism through immersing Anglophones in the minority language and replaced [[language policies of the Canadian provinces and territories|many English-only laws in various Canadian provinces]] before the 1960s, while in the United States the same approach was advocated to force minority speakers to adopt English.

More recently, SEI has been defined as a methodology in which English language learners (ELLs) learn English through structured and sequential lessons. Specially developed for ELLs, these lessons are  based, to a large degree, on the mainstream curricula. (Haver, Johanna J., ''Structured English Immersion,'' Corwin Press, 2002)

In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than [[bilingual education]]. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author      = SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SEI is mandatory in California, Arizona and Massachusetts where voter initiatives opted to restrict the use of bilingual education in preference for SEI.

== SEI Framework ==
Only Arizona mandates that its public schools implement SEI models as follows:
* Significant amounts of the school day are dedicated to the explicit teaching of the English language, and students are grouped for this instruction according to their level of English proficiency.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "The English language is the main content of SEI instruction. Academic content plays a supporting, but subordinate, role."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "English is the language of instruction; students and teachers are expected to speak, read, and write in English."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Teachers use instructional methods that treat English as a foreign language."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Students learn discrete English grammar skills."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Rigorous time lines are established for students to exit from the program."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* SEI program graduates continue to receive support services until they are reclassified as "fluent English proficient" whereby Federal law then requires students be monitored for two years after reclassification.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">A '''swim lane''' (or '''swim lane diagram''') is used in [[flowchart|process flow diagram]]s, or flowcharts, that visually distinguishes [[job sharing]] and responsibilities for sub-processes of a [[business process]]. Swim lanes may be arranged either horizontally or vertically. 
[[File:Approvals.svg|thumb|Swim lane flowchart.  Here, the swim lanes are named Customer, Sales, Contracts, Legal, and Fulfillment, and are arranged vertically.
]]

==Attributes of a swim lane==
The swim lane flowchart differs from other flowcharts in that processes and decisions are grouped visually by placing them in ''lanes''. Parallel lines divide the chart into lanes, with one lane for each person, group or sub process. Lanes are labelled to show how the chart is organized.

In the accompanying example, the vertical direction represents the sequence of events in the overall process, while the horizontal divisions depict what sub-process is performing that step.  Arrows between the lanes represent how information or material is passed between the sub processes.

Alternately, the flow can be rotated so that the sequence reads horizontally from left to right, with the roles involved being shown at the left edge.  This can be easier to read and design, since computer screens are typically wider than they are tall, which gives an improved view of the flow.

Use of standard symbols enables clear linkage to be shown between related flow charts when charting flows with complex relationships.

==Usage==
When used to diagram a business process that involves more than one department, swimlanes often serve to clarify not only the steps and who is responsible for each one, but also how delays, mistakes or cheating are most likely to occur.

Many process modeling methodologies utilize the concept of swim lanes, as a mechanism to organize activities into separate visual categories in order to illustrate different functional capabilities or responsibilities (organisational [[role]]s). Swim lanes are used in [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN) and  [[Unified Modeling Language]]  [[activity diagram]] modeling methodologies.

==Alternative terms==
A swim lane may also be referred to as a '''functional band''' (as it is in [[Microsoft Visio]] 2007) and is used in the same way, to create a cross functional flowchart to map a process within the functional units of a business.&lt;ref name="FunctionalBand"&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/create-a-cross-functional-flowchart-HP010357078.aspx Create a cross-functional flowchart, Microsoft Office Visio Help]&lt;/ref&gt; The term functional band precedes the use of swim lane and is seemingly in decline as the preferred term.

==Origin==
Swim lane diagrams first appeared in the 1940s as a variation of the flow process chart called multi-column charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worksimp.com/articles/processcharting.pdf?pdf=1945-Process-Charting&lt;/ref&gt; They were called Swim Lane diagrams by Geary Rummler and Alan Brache in their book Improving Performance (1990). Swim lanes are also known as "Rummler-Brache Diagrams".
Another possible origin of the term swim lane is as part of the  JBoss jBPM jPDL (Process Definition Language) graphical process designer a part of the JBoss jBPM framework for process languages.&lt;ref name="JBossjBPMjPDL"&gt;[http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v3/userguide/jpdl.html#swimlane.element Chapter 18. jBPM Process Definition Language – Swimlane]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swim Lane presentation was developed in the early 1980s by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Binner as part of his doctoral thesis on the requirements of the IT and CIM concept at the Institute for Factory Facilities at Prof. Wiendahl at TU-Hannover.

A process model was developed in which the role-based process analysis and modeling was the starting point for the IT-based IT solution or, in the case, the CIM solution with which the development of an IT-CIM concept was possible.

"'''The Most Dangerous Game'''", also published as "'''The Hounds of Zaroff'''"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, is a [[short story]] by [[Richard Connell]], first published in ''[[Collier's]]'' on January 19, 1924. The story features a [[big-game hunter]] from [[New York City]] who falls off a [[yacht]] and swims to what seems to be an abandoned and isolated [[island]] in the [[Caribbean]], where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat. The story is inspired by the big-game hunting [[safari]]s in [[Africa]] and [[South America]] that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s.

The story has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1932 [[RKO Pictures]] film ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', starring [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Leslie Banks]], and for a 1943 episode of the [[CBS Radio]] series ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', starring [[Orson Welles]].

==Plot Summary==
Sanger Rainsford and his friend, Whitney, are traveling to the [[Amazon rainforest]] to hunt the region's big cat: the [[jaguar]]. After a discussion about how they are "the hunters" instead of "the hunted", Whitney goes to bed and Rainsford hears gunshots. He climbs onto the yacht's rail and accidentally falls overboard, swimming to Ship-Trap Island, which is notorious for shipwrecks. On the island, he finds a palatial chateau inhabited by two [[Cossack]]s: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic [[deaf-mute]] servant, Ivan.

Zaroff, another big-game hunter, knows of Rainsford from his published account of hunting [[snow leopard]]s in [[Tibet]]. After inviting him to dinner, General Zaroff tells Rainsford he is bored of hunting because it no longer challenges him; he has moved to Ship-Trap in order to capture shipwrecked sailors. Any captives who can elude Zaroff, Ivan, and a pack of [[hunting dog]]s for three days are set free. Zaroff reveals that no one has lasted that long, although a couple of sailors had come close. Zaroff also says that he offers sailors a "choice"; should they decline to be hunted they will be handed over to Ivan, who had once been official [[Knout|knouter]] for [[Nicholas II|The Great White Czar]]. Rainsford denounces this as barbarism. Zaroff reacts in a cosmopolitan manner that "[[survival of the fittest|life is for the strong]]". Realizing he has no way out, Rainsford reluctantly agrees to be hunted.

During his three-hour head start, Rainsford lays an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to play with him like a cat would a mouse, standing underneath the tree Rainsford is hiding in, smoking a cigarette, and then abruptly departing. After the failed attempt at eluding Zaroff, Rainsford builds a Malay man-catcher, a [[Deadfall trap|weighted log attached to a trigger]]. This contraption injures Zaroff's shoulder, causing him to return home for the night. The next day Rainsford creates a [[Trapping pit|Burmese tiger pit]], which kills one of Zaroff's hounds. He sacrifices his knife and ties it to a sapling to make a [[Uganda]]n knife trap; Ivan is killed when he stumbles into this trap and the knife plunges into his heart. To escape Zaroff and his approaching hounds, Rainsford dives off a cliff into the sea; Zaroff, disappointed at Rainsford's suicide, returns home. 

Zaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights only to find Rainsford waiting for him; he had swum around the island in order to sneak into the chateau without the dogs finding him. Zaroff congratulates him on winning the "game", but Rainsford decides to fight him, saying he is still a beast-at-bay and that the original hunt is not over. Accepting the challenge, Zaroff says that the loser will be fed to the dogs, while the winner will sleep in his bed. Though the ensuing fight is not described, the story ends with Rainsford observing that "he had never slept in a better bed"—implying that he defeated and killed Zaroff.

==Analysis==
"The Most Dangerous Game" is a popular read within middle and high school curricula due to the strength of the themes within the story. The first and foremost question that the story bears is that of justifiable murder. Rainsford justifies his hunting of animals because he believes that man is superior to animals because animals do not feel. To contradict, General Zaroff believes that men are superior because they are able to reason. Zaroff uses his reasoning to explain why men are the most interesting game to hunt; men can reason, and thus provide a challenge that no animal can contend with. The story simultaneously highlights through the experience of Rainsford, as he is hunted, the fears that animals must experience while being hunted.

Zaroff himself is a contradiction because his exquisite manners are juxtaposed with his heartless brutality in killing men. The idea of a man who is proper in all aspects, but still contains a desire to kill, is a suggestion by Connell that men possess murderous instincts that can only be subdued by the presence of society and law. Zaroff is only able to partake in his "hobby" because he does not live within a civilization.

The ending of the story bears questions about the true nature of Rainsford, who is implied to have killed Zaroff in order to secure his own safety. By killing Zaroff, he thus took part in the "game" that Zaroff wanted him to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/most-dangerous-game/themes|title=The Most Dangerous Game Themes |publisher=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
This story has been adapted to film numerous times. The most significant of these adaptations—and the only film to use the original characters—was [[RKO Pictures]]' film released in [[1932 in film|1932]], ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]''. [[Joel McCrea]] stars as Rainsford; [[Leslie Banks]] portrays Zaroff. The adaptation by [[James Ashmore Creelman]] adds two other principal characters, brother-and-sister pair Eve Trowbridge ([[Fay Wray]]) and Martin Trowbridge ([[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]), who are castaways from a shipwreck. ''The Most Dangerous Game'' was co-directed by [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] and [[Irving Pichel]]; also with a score by [[Max Steiner]], the film was a favorite project of producer [[Merian C. Cooper]]. The production shared several sets with ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), a simultaneous RKO project that also involved Schoedsack, Cooper, Wray, Armstrong, Creelman, and Steiner. ''The Most Dangerous Game'' was a modest success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=3937 |title=The Most Dangerous Game  |publisher=''AFI Catalog of Feature Films'' |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKO Story"&gt;Jewell, Richard B., ''The RKO Story''. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. {{ISBN|0-517-54656-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51|date=February 2014}}

RKO produced a remake titled ''[[A Game of Death]]'' (1945), directed by [[Robert Wise]], from a screenplay Norman Houston wrote. This film stars [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] and [[Audrey Long]], with [[Edgar Barrier]] as the mad hunter.&lt;ref name="RKO Story"/&gt;{{Rp|206|date=February 2014}} In order to keep with events of that time, ''A Game of Death'' changed Zaroff into "Erich Kreiger", a Nazi, and was set in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]].

In 1956, United Artists released another film adaptation, ''[[Run for the Sun]]'', starring [[Richard Widmark]], [[Trevor Howard]] and [[Jane Greer]].&lt;ref name="RKO Story"/&gt;{{Rp|206|date=February 2014}}

In 1961, the film ''[[Bloodlust!]]'' was released, directed by [[Ralph Brooke]] and starring [[Wilton Graff]] as the Zaroff-type character, and [[Robert Reed]] as the leader of a band of youths who become stranded on the island.

1972's ''[[The Woman Hunt]]'' starring [[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] and [[Sid Haig]] made for [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]] is an unofficial remake of the story. 

The Australian film ''[[Turkey Shoot (1982 film)|Turkey Shoot]]'' has similar elements.

[[John Woo]]'s first Hollywood directorial effort, the [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] thriller ''[[Hard Target]]'' (1993), was loosely based on the same story. The locale was shifted to 1990s New Orleans, with homeless Vietnam war veterans voluntarily serving (in return for potential payment from a shady businessman) as human prey.

In ''[[Surviving the Game]]'' (1994), a homeless man is hired as a survival guide for a group of wealthy businessmen on a hunting trip in the mountains. He is unaware that they are killers who hunt humans for sport, and that he is their new prey. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson, the film stars [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Ice-T]], and [[Charles S. Dutton]].

''[[The Pest (1997 film)|The Pest]]'' (1997) is a comedic parody of the story, with German huntsman Gustav Shank accidentally bringing Puerto Rican teenage hustler Pestario "Pest" Vargas to his island instead of the skilled man he had intended to hunt, only to decide to hunt the Pest anyway due to his sheer obnoxiousness. Shank's ambition is to have a head of a warrior of every ethnicity in his Trophy Room. He also rigs the "game" by having his prey unknowingly drink a slow-acting poison before the hunt, making sure that they die even if they escape him. 

In '' [[The Eliminator (film)|The Eliminator]]'' (2004), seven captured people are hunted at night for sport on an island as a betting game for the wealthy.

}}

''Thinking and Destiny'' by [[Harold W. Percival]] on "The law of thought". Its basic premise is that thinking creates karma or destiny. The book shows how to perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts.

==Ideas==
The book is based on what Percival called “The law of thought.” It was produced over a period of 34 years and has 14 chapters, each with sections. Percival also provides succinct definitions of many words, from Accident and Alcoholism to Wrong, as they are used in his book. In ''Thinking and Destiny'' he offers a complete cosmology of the universe, with ideas such as the universe having nature and intelligent sides. Percival defines the nature side of the universe, in part, as an unintelligent mechanism through which units that are conscious only as their functions become self-conscious intelligences by means of what he termed “The Eternal Order of Progression.”

===The Law of Thought===
In ''Thinking and Destiny'', Percival explains how all of life’s lessons are the result of our own thinking and can be used to learn what to do and what not to do, and that we can perfect our thinking and learn how to think without creating thoughts. Thinking without creating thoughts is said to be the way to stop creating [[karma]] or destiny. Thinking is shown to be the cause and solution to reincarnation, otherwise known as the wheel of birth, life and death. Percival leaves it to the reader to choose what to do with the often startling information provided and assures that the lessons will be learned eventually.

===Conscious of Consciousness===
In his Foreword to the book, the author explained that his experiences of being “conscious of Consciousness” allowed him to focus the Conscious Light within on subjects to see their essence. He further stated that the book was dictated because it was difficult to do this kind of thinking and write at the same time. While the contents of ''Thinking and Destiny'' are from no other book or body of authority, he indicated that the authority for the truth in the book is in the reader who can judge the statements by the truth that is in him or her. To be able to think in this concentrated way and to be “conscious of Consciousness” are shown to be potentially within the grasp of all humans.

===The Great Way===
In a postscript to ''Thinking and Destiny'' it is stated that the most one person can do for another is to tell him or her that there is the Great Way, as shown in the book. The Great Way is how and where the human body is transformed into an immortal body. The author offers specific information for the few who really want it, and shows why each person must do the work in life, not after death. The individual will embrace the ideas or put them off, but death remains the cost of life until conscious immortality is attained. The truth is faced as a matter of honesty and courage.

===The Word Foundation===
In 1950 Harold W. Percival established [[The Word Foundation]], Inc., a non-profit organization, to keep ''Thinking and Destiny'' and all of his other works in print and to share with the people of the world what he called “the royal good news” about the doer said to be indwelling in every human body. Three of his other books expanded on themes from ''Thinking and Destiny''. They are: ''Man and Woman and Child, Democracy Is Self-Government, and Masonry and Its Symbols.''

==Editions==
''Thinking and Destiny'', by [[Harold W. Percival]], was originally published by The Word Publishing Company, New York in 1946 and is now in its fourteenth printing. Its subtitle is: “With a Brief Account of the Descent of Man into this Human World, and, How He Will Return to the Eternal Order of Progression.” To support the text, Percival included sections for Symbols, Illustrations and Charts and Definitions of Terms and Phrases as they are used in the book.

==Influence==
Percival’s works were noted as a major influence upon [[Richard Matheson]], the famous author and screenwriter. He said that his book The Path was based largely on ''Thinking and Destiny''.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, Richard. The Path: Metaphysics for the 90’s. (1998) The Word Foundation, Inc. {{ISBN|091165013X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self'', 1999, by Owen Slight, the author states that [[Harold W. Percival]]’s ''Thinking and Destiny'', like the [[Bhagavad Gita]], reveals relevant, instructive and long lasting lessons regarding the higher self and the human plight—long lost lessons of everlasting truth contained both in the Sanskrit ''Bhagavad Gita'' and ''Thinking and Destiny''. Both books contain complete systems of knowledge. The plight of [[Arjuna]] is shown by Percival to be our own.&lt;ref&gt;Slight, Owen, The Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Exalted Self, Owen Slight Publisher, 1999 {{ISBN|064635602X}}, 9780646356020&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The Tweedie distributions include a number of familiar distributions as well as some unusual ones, each being specified by the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] of the index parameter.  We have the 
 
*[[normal distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,
*[[Poisson distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,
*[[Compound Poisson distribution|compound Poisson–gamma distribution]], 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2,
*[[gamma distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,
*positive [[stable distribution]]s, 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3,
*[[inverse Gaussian distribution]], ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3,
*positive stable distributions, ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3, and
*extreme stable distributions, ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}.

For 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 no Tweedie model exists.

==Definitions==

Tweedie distributions are a special case of [[exponential dispersion model]]s, a class of models used to describe error distributions for the [[generalized linear model]].&lt;ref 
name="Jørgensen-1997"&gt;{{cite book

      | year = 1997

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "exponential dispersion model" refers to the [[Exponential family|exponential form]] that these models take, evident from the canonical equation used to describe the distribution ''P&lt;sub&gt;λ,θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the random variable ''Z'' on the [[Measure (mathematics)|measurable sets]] ''A'',

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\lambda,\theta}(Z\in A)=\int_{A} \exp[\theta \cdot z-\lambda\kappa(\theta)]\cdot \nu_\lambda\, (dz),&lt;/math&gt;

with the interrelated [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] ''ν&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''.  ''θ'' is the [[Exponential family|canonical parameter]]; the cumulant function is

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa(\theta)=\lambda^{-1}\log\int e^{\theta z}\cdot \nu_\lambda\, (dz);&lt;/math&gt;

''λ'' is the index parameter; and ''z'' the canonical statistic.  This equation represents a family of exponential dispersion models ED&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''θ'',''λ'') that are completely determined by the parameters ''θ'' and ''λ'' and the cumulant function.

===Additive exponential dispersion models===

The models just described are additive models with the property that the distribution of the sum of independent random variables,

: &lt;math&gt;Z_+ = Z_1 +\cdots+ Z_n,&lt;/math&gt;

for which ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;ED&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''θ'',''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) with fixed ''θ'' and various ''λ'' are members of the family of distributions with the same ''θ'',

: &lt;math&gt;Z_+ \sim ED^*(\theta,\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_n).&lt;/math&gt;

===Reproductive exponential dispersion models===

A second class of exponential dispersion models exists designated by the random variable

: &lt;math&gt;Y=Z/\lambda \sim ED(\mu,\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''λ'', known as reproductive exponential dispersion models.  They have the property that for ''n'' independent random variables ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;ED(''μ'',''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), with weighting factors ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and

: &lt;math&gt;w= \sum_{i=1}^n w_i,&lt;/math&gt;

a weighted average of the variables gives,

: &lt;math&gt;w^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n w_iY_i \sim ED(\mu,\sigma^2/w).&lt;/math&gt;

For reproductive models the weighted average of independent random variables with fixed ''μ'' and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and various values for ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a member of the family of distributions with same ''μ'' and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Tweedie exponential dispersion models are both additive and reproductive; we thus have the ''duality transformation''

: &lt;math&gt;Y \mapsto Z=Y/\sigma^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale invariance===

A third property of the Tweedie models is that they are [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]]:  For a reproductive exponential dispersion model ED(''μ'',''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and any positive constant ''c'' we have the property of closure under scale transformation,

: &lt;math&gt;c ED(\mu,\sigma^2)=ED(c\mu,c^{2-p}\sigma^2),&lt;/math&gt;

where the index parameter ''p'' is a real-valued unitless constant. With this transformation the new variable ''Y’''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''cY'' belongs to the family of distributions with fixed ''μ'' and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but different values of ''c''.

===The Tweedie power variance function===

To define the [[variance function]] for exponential dispersion models we make use of the mean value mapping, the relationship between the canonical parameter ''θ'' and the mean ''μ''.  It is defined by the function

: &lt;math&gt;\tau(\theta)=\kappa^\prime(\theta)=\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Natural exponential family|variance function]] ''V''(''μ'') is constructed from the mean value mapping,

: &lt;math&gt;V(\mu)=\tau^\prime[\tau^{-1}(\mu)].&lt;/math&gt;

Here the minus exponent in ''τ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''μ'') denotes an inverse function rather than a reciprocal.  The mean and variance of an additive random variable is then E(''Z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''λμ'' and var(''Z'')=λV(''μ'').

Scale invariance implies that the variance function obeys the relationship 
''V''(''μ'') = ''μ''&lt;sup&gt; ''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref 
name="Jørgensen-1997" /&gt;

===The Tweedie cumulant generating functions===
The properties of exponential dispersion models give us two [[differential equation]]s.&lt;ref 
name="Jørgensen-1997" /&gt;  The first relates the mean value mapping and the variance function to each other,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \tau^{-1}(\mu)}{\partial \mu}= \frac{1}{V(\mu)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second shows how the mean value mapping is related to the [[cumulant|cumulant function]],

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \kappa(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=\tau(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be solved to obtain the cumulant function for different cases of the Tweedie models.  A cumulant generating function (CGF) may then be obtained from the cumulant function.  The additive CGF is generally specified by the equation

: &lt;math&gt;K^*(s)=\log[\text{E}(e^{sZ})]=\lambda[\kappa(\theta+s)-\kappa(\theta)],&lt;/math&gt;

and the reproductive CGF by

: &lt;math&gt;K(s)=\log[\text{E}(e^{sY})]=\lambda[\kappa(\theta+s/\lambda)-\kappa(\theta)],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the generating function variable.

The cumulant functions for specific values of the index parameter ''p'' are&lt;ref 
name="Jørgensen-1997" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_p(\theta) = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\alpha-1}{\alpha} \left(\dfrac{\theta}{\alpha-1}\right)^\alpha
&amp; \quad p \ne 1,2, \\ -\log(-\theta)  &amp; \quad p = 2, \\ e^\theta &amp; \quad p = 1, \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is the Tweedie exponent

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\dfrac{p-2}{p-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the additive Tweedie models the CGFs take the form,

: &lt;math&gt;K^*_p(s;\theta,\lambda) = \begin{cases} \lambda\kappa_p(\theta)[(1+s/\theta)^\alpha-1]
 &amp; \quad p \ne 1,2, \\ -\lambda \log(1+s/\theta) &amp;  \quad p = 2,  \\ \lambda e^\theta (e^s -1) &amp; \quad p = 1, \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

and for the reproductive models,

: &lt;math&gt;K_p(s;\theta,\lambda) = \begin{cases} \lambda\kappa_p(\theta)\left \{ [1+s/(\theta \lambda)]^\alpha-1 \right \}
&amp; \quad p \ne 1,2, \\ -\lambda \log[1+s/(\theta \lambda)]  &amp; \quad p = 2,  \\ \lambda e^\theta (e^{s/\lambda} -1) &amp; \quad p = 1. \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The additive and reproductive Tweedie models are conventionally denoted by the symbols ''Tw''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'',''λ'') and ''Tw''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'',''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

The first and second derivatives of the CGFs, with ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, yields the mean and variance, respectively.  One can thus confirm that for the additive models the variance relates to the mean by the power law,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{var} (Z)\propto \mathrm{E}(Z)^p.&lt;/math&gt;

==The Tweedie convergence theorem==

The Tweedie exponential dispersion models are fundamental in statistical theory consequent to their roles as foci of [[convergence in distribution|convergence]] for a wide range of statistical processes.  Jørgensen ''et al'' proved a theorem that specifies the asymptotic behaviour of variance functions known as the Tweedie convergence theorem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jørgensen, B |author2=Martinez, JR |author3=Tsao, M|title=Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Statistics|year=1994|volume=21|pages=223–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem, in technical terms, is stated thus:&lt;ref 
name="Jørgensen-1997" /&gt; The unit variance function is regular of order ''p'' at zero (or infinity) provided that ''V''(''μ'')&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''μ''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''μ'' as it approaches zero (or infinity) for all real values of ''p'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  Then for a unit variance function regular of order ''p'' at either zero or infinity and for

: &lt;math&gt;p \notin (0,1),&lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;\mu&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we have

: &lt;math&gt;c^{-1} ED(c\mu,\sigma^2c^{2-p}) \rightarrow Tw_p(\mu,c_0 \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;c \downarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, where the convergence is through values of ''c'' such that ''cμ'' is in the domain of ''θ'' and ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is in the domain of ''λ''.   The model must be infinitely divisible as ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; approaches infinity.&lt;ref 
name="Jørgensen-1997" /&gt;

In nontechnical terms this theorem implies that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance-to-mean power law is required to have a variance function that comes within the [[Attractor|domain of attraction]] of a Tweedie model.  Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form.  Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and  the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence for a wide range of data types.&lt;ref name=Kendal2011b&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = W.

==The Tweedie models and Taylor’s power law==

[[Taylor's law]] is an empirical law in [[ecology]] that relates the variance of the number of individuals of a species per unit area of habitat to the corresponding mean by a [[power-law]] relationship.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = LR | year = 1961 | title = Aggregation, variance and the mean | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 189 | issue = | pages = 732–735 | doi=10.1038/189732a0| bibcode = 1961Natur.189..732T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the population count ''Y'' with mean ''µ'' and variance var(''Y''), Taylor’s law is written,

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}\,(Y) = a\mu^p,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''p'' are both positive constants.   Since L. R. Taylor described this law in 1961 there have been many different explanations offered to explain it, ranging from animal behavior,&lt;ref name="Taylor1961" /&gt; a [[random walk]] model,&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanski | first1 = I | year = 1980 | title = Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 293–310 | doi=10.2307/3544289}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[birth-death process|stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model]],&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RD | last2 = Crawley | first2 = GM | last3 = Hassell | first3 = M | year = 1982 | title = Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 296 | issue = | pages = 245–248 | doi=10.1038/296245a0| bibcode = 1982Natur.296..245A }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a consequence of equilibrium and non-equilibrium [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Fronczak2010&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fronczak | first1 = A | last2 = Fronczak | first2 = P | year = 2010 | title = Origins of Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling in complex systems | url = | journal = Phys Rev E | volume = 81 | issue = | page = 066112 | doi=10.1103/physreve.81.066112| arxiv = 0909.1896 | bibcode = 2010PhRvE..81f6112F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  No consensus exists as to an explanation for this model.

Since Taylor’s law is mathematically identical to the variance-to-mean power law that characterizes the Tweedie models, it seemed reasonable to use these models and the Tweedie convergence theorem to explain the observed clustering of animals and plants associated with Taylor’s law.&lt;ref name=Kendal2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2002 | title = Spatial aggregation of the Colorado potato beetle described by an exponential dispersion model | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 261–269 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(01)00494-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2004 | title = Taylor's ecological power law as a consequence of scale invariant exponential dispersion models | url = | journal = Ecol Complex | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 193–209 | doi=10.1016/j.ecocom.2004.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the observed values for the power-law exponent ''p'' have fallen in the interval (1,2) and so the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution would seem applicable.  Comparison of the [[empirical distribution function]] to the theoretical compound Poisson–gamma distribution has provided a means to verify consistency of this hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Kendal2002" /&gt;

Whereas conventional models for Taylor’s law have tended to involve ''[[ad hoc]]'' animal behavioral or [[population dynamics|population dynamic]] assumptions, the Tweedie convergence theorem would imply that Taylor’s law results from a general mathematical convergence effect much as how the [[central limit theorem]] governs the convergence behavior of certain types of random data.  Indeed, any mathematical model, approximation or simulation that is designed to yield Taylor’s law (on the basis of this theorem) is required to converge to the form of the Tweedie models.&lt;ref name=Kendal2011b /&gt;

==Tweedie convergence and 1/''f'' noise==

[[Pink noise]], or 1/''f'' noise, refers to a pattern of noise characterized by a power-law relationship between its intensities ''S''(''f'') at different frequencies ''f'',

: &lt;math&gt;S(f)\propto 1/f^{ \gamma},&lt;/math&gt;

where the dimensionless exponent ''γ'' ∈ [0,1].  It is found within a diverse number of natural processes.&lt;ref name=Dutta1981&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutta | first1 = P | last2 = Horn | first2 = PM | year = 1981 | title = Low frequency fluctuations in solids: 1/''f'' noise | url = | journal = Rev Mod Phys | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 497–516 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.53.497 | bibcode=1981RvMP...53..497D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many different explanations for 1/''f'' noise exist, a widely held hypothesis is based on [[Self-organized criticality]] where dynamical systems close to a [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] are thought to manifest [[scale-invariance|scale-invariant]] spatial and/or temporal behavior.

In this subsection a mathematical connection between 1/''f'' noise and the Tweedie variance-to-mean power law will be described.  To begin, we first need to introduce [[self-similar process]]es:  For the sequence of numbers

: &lt;math&gt;Y=(Y_i :i=0,1,2,\ldots,N)&lt;/math&gt;

with mean

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}=\text{E}(Y_i),&lt;/math&gt;

deviations

: &lt;math&gt;y_i = Y_i - \hat{\mu}, &lt;/math&gt;

variance

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}^2=\text{E}(y_i^2),&lt;/math&gt;
 
and autocorrelation function

: &lt;math&gt;r(k)=\text{E}(y_i,y_{i+k})/\text{E}(y_i^2)&lt;/math&gt;

with lag ''k'', if the [[autocorrelation]] of this sequence has the long range behavior

: &lt;math&gt;r(k)\sim k^{-d} L(k) &lt;/math&gt;

as ''k''{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;rarr;&amp;infin;&lt;/VAR&gt;}} and where ''L''(''k'') is a slowly varying function at large values of ''k'', this sequence is called a self-similar process.&lt;ref name=Leland1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leland | first1 = WE | last2 = Taqqu | first2 = MS | last3 = Willinger | first3 = W | last4 = Wilson | first4 = DV | year = 1994 | title = On the self-similar nature of ethernet traffic | url = | journal = IEE/ACM Trans Networking | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–15 | doi=10.1109/90.282603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''method of expanding bins''' can be used to analyze self-similar processes.  Consider a set of equal-sized non-overlapping bins that divides the original sequence of ''N'' elements into groups of ''m'' equal-sized segments (''N/m'' is integer) so that new reproductive sequences, based on the mean values, can be defined:

: &lt;math&gt;Y_i^{(m)}=(Y_{im-m+1}+\cdots+Y_{im})/m.&lt;/math&gt;

The variance determined from this sequence will scale as the bin size changes such that

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}[Y^{(m)}]=\hat{\sigma}^2 m^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
 
if and only if the autocorrelation has the limiting form&lt;ref name=Tsybakov1997&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsybakov | first1 = B | last2 = Georganas | first2 = ND | year = 1997 | title = On self-similar traffic in ATM queues: definitions, overflow probability bound, and cell delay distribution | url = | journal = IEEE/ACM Trans Networking | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 397–409 | doi=10.1109/90.611104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}r(k)/k^{-d} = (2-d)(1-d)/2.&lt;/math&gt;

One can also construct a set of corresponding additive sequences

: &lt;math&gt;Z_i^{(m)} = mY_i^{(m)},&lt;/math&gt;

based on the expanding bins,

: &lt;math&gt;Z_i^{(m)}=(Y_{im-m+1}+\cdots+Y_{im}).&lt;/math&gt;

Provided the autocorrelation function exhibits the same behavior, the additive sequences will obey the relationship

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}[Z_i^{(m)}]=m^2 \text{var}[Y^{(m)}]=(\hat{\sigma}^2 /\hat{\mu}^{2-d})\text{E}[Z_i^{(m)}]^{2-d}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt; are constants this relationship constitutes a variance-to-mean power law, with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''d''.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2007 | title = Scale invariant correlations between genes and SNPs on Human chromosome 1 reveal potential evolutionary mechanisms | url = | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 245 | issue = | pages = 329–340 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Logical biconditional|biconditional]] relationship above between the variance-to-mean power law and power law autocorrelation function, and the [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]]&lt;ref name=McQuarrie1976&gt;McQuarrie DA (1976) ''Statistical mechanics'' [Harper &amp; Row]&lt;/ref&gt; imply that any sequence that exhibits a variance-to-mean power law by the method of expanding bins will also manifest 1/''f'' noise, and vice versa.  Moreover, the Tweedie convergence theorem, by virtue of its central limit-like effect of generating distributions that manifest variance-to-mean power functions, will also generate processes that manifest 1/''f'' noise.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;  The Tweedie convergence theorem thus provides an alternative explanation for the origin of 1/''f'' noise, based its central limit-like effect.

Much as the [[central limit theorem]] requires certain kinds of random processes to have as a focus of their convergence the [[normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] and thus express [[white noise]], the Tweedie convergence theorem requires certain non-Gaussian processes to have as a focus of convergence the Tweedie distributions that express 1/''f'' noise.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;

==The Tweedie models and multifractality==

From the properties of self-similar processes, the power-law exponent ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''d'' is related to the [[Hurst exponent]] ''H'' and the [[fractal dimension]] ''D'' by&lt;ref name="Tsybakov1997" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;D = 2-H = 2 - p/2. &lt;/math&gt;

A one-dimensional data sequence of self-similar data may demonstrate a variance-to-mean power law with local variations in the value of ''p'' and hence in the value of ''D''.  When fractal structures manifest local variations in fractal dimension, they are said to be  [[multifractal system|multifractals]].  Examples of data sequences that exhibit local variations in ''p'' like this include the eigenvalue deviations of the [[Random matrix|Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary Ensembles]].&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;  The Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution has served to model multifractality based on local variations in the Tweedie exponent ''α''.  Consequently, in conjunction with the variation of ''α'', the Tweedie convergence theorem can be viewed as having a role in the genesis of such multifractals.

The variation of ''α'' has been found to obey the asymmetric [[Laplace distribution]] in certain cases.&lt;ref name=Kendal2014&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2014 | title = Multifractality attributed to dual central limit-lie convergence effects | url = | journal = Physica A | volume = 401 | issue = | pages = 22–33 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2014.01.022| bibcode = 2014PhyA..401...22K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distribution has been shown to be a member of the family of geometric Tweedie models,&lt;ref name="Jørgensen2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jørgensen | first1 = B | last2 = Kokonendji | first2 = CC | year = 2011 | title = Dispersion models for geometric sums | url = | journal = Braz J Probab Stat | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 263–293 | doi=10.1214/10-bjps136}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manifest as limiting distributions in a convergence theorem for geometric dispersion models.

==Applications==

===Regional organ blood flow===

Regional organ blood flow has been traditionally assessed by the injection of [[Isotopic labeling|radiolabelled]] [[polyethylene microspheres]] into the arterial circulation of animals, of a size that they become entrapped within the [[microcirculation]] of organs.  The organ to be assessed is then divided into equal-sized cubes and the amount of radiolabel within each cube is evaluated by [[liquid scintillation counting]] and recorded. The amount of radioactivity within each cube is taken to reflect the blood flow through that sample at the time of injection.  It is possible to evaluate adjacent cubes from an organ in order to additively determine the blood flow through larger regions.  Through the work of '''J B Bassingthwaighte''' and others an empirical power law has been derived between the relative dispersion of blood flow of tissue samples (''RD''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;standard&amp;nbsp;deviation/mean) of mass ''m'' relative to reference-sized samples:&lt;ref name=Bassingthwaighte1989&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bassingthwaighte | first1 = JB | year = 1989 | title = Fractal nature of regional myocardial blood flow heterogeneity | url = | journal = Circ Res | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 578–590 | doi=10.1161/01.res.65.3.578| pmc = 3361973 | pmid=2766485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;RD(m)=RD(m_\text{ref})\left (\frac{m}{m_\text{ref}}\right )^{1-D_s}&lt;/math&gt;

This power law exponent ''D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' has been called a fractal dimension.  '''Bassingthwaighte’s power law''' can be shown to directly relate to the variance-to-mean power law.  Regional organ blood flow can thus be modelled by the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution.,&lt;ref name=Kendal2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2001 | title = A stochastic model for the self-similar heterogeneity of regional organ blood flow | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = | pages = 837–841 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.837| pmc = 14670| bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..837K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model tissue sample could be considered to contain a random (Poisson) distributed number of entrapment sites, each with [[gamma distribution|gamma distributed]] blood flow.  Blood flow at this microcirculatory level has been observed to obey a gamma distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honig | first1 = CR | last2 = Feldstein | first2 = ML | last3 = Frierson | first3 = JL | year = 1977 | title = Capillary lengths, anastomoses, and estimated capillary transit times in skeletal muscle | url = | journal = Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol | volume = 233 | issue = | pages = H122–H129 | doi=10.1152/ajpheart.1977.233.1.h122}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus providing support for this hypothesis.

===Cancer metastasis===

The "experimental cancer [[metastasis]] assay"&lt;ref name=Fidler1977&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fidler|first=IJ|author2=Kripke, M |title=Metastasis results from preexisting variant cells within a malignant tumor|journal=Science|year=1977|volume=197|pages=893–895|bibcode = 1977Sci...197..893F |doi = 10.1126/science.887927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  has some resemblance to the above method to measure regional blood flow.  Groups of [[syngeneic]] and age matched mice are given intravenous injections of equal-sized aliquots of suspensions of cloned cancer cells and then after a set period of time their lungs are removed and the number of cancer metastases enumerated within each pair of lungs.  If other groups of mice are injected with different cancer cell [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]] then the number of metastases per group will differ in accordance with the metastatic potentials of the clones.  It has been long recognized that there can be considerable intraclonal variation in the numbers of metastases per mouse despite the best attempts to keep the experimental conditions within each clonal group uniform.&lt;ref name=Fidler1977 /&gt; This variation is larger than would be expected on the basis of a [[Poisson distribution]] of numbers of metastases per mouse in each clone and when the variance of the number of metastases per mouse was plotted against the corresponding mean a power law was found.&lt;ref name=Kendal1987&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | last2 = Frost | first2 = P | year = 1987 | title = Experimental metastasis: a novel application of the variance-to-mean power function | doi = 10.1093/jnci/79.5.1113 | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 1113–1115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The variance-to-mean power law for metastases was found to also hold for '''spontaneous murine metastases'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 1999 | title = Clustering of murine lung metastases reflects fractal nonuniformity in regional lung blood flow | url = | journal = Invasion Metastasis | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1159/000024521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and for cases series of human metastases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | last2 = Lagerwaard | first2 = FJ | last3 = Agboola | first3 = O | year = 2000 | title = Characterization of the frequency distribution for human hematogenous metastases: evidence for clustering and a power variance function | url = | journal = Clin Exp Metastasis | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 219–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since hematogenous metastasis occurs in direct relationship to regional blood flow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = L | last2 = Bronk | first2 = J | last3 = Pickren | first3 = JW | last4 = Lane | first4 = WW | year = 1981 | title = Metastatic patterns and targe organ arterial blood flow | url = | journal = Invasion Metastasis | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 126–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and videomicroscopic studies indicate that the passage and entrapment of cancer cells within the circulation appears analogous to the microsphere experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chambers | first1 = AF | last2 = Groom | first2 = AC | last3 = MacDonald | first3 = IC | year = 2002 | title = Dissemination and growth of cancer cells in metastatic sites | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 563–572 | doi=10.1038/nrc865}}&lt;/ref&gt; it seemed plausible to propose that the variation in numbers of hematogenous metastases could reflect heterogeneity in regional organ blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2002 | title = A frequency distribution for the number of hematogenous organ metastases | url = | journal = Invasion Metastasis | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 126–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The blood flow model was based on the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution, a distribution governing a continuous random variable.  For that reason in the metastasis model it was assumed that blood flow was governed by that distribution and that the number of regional metastases occurred as a [[Poisson process]] for which the intensity was directly proportional to blood flow.  This led to the description of the Poisson negative binomial (PNB) distribution as a [[discrete probability distribution|discrete equivalent]] to the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution.  The [[probability-generating function|probability generating function]] for the PNB distribution is

: &lt;math&gt;G(s)= \exp \left [\lambda \frac {\alpha-1}{\alpha} \left( \frac{\theta} {\alpha-1} \right)^\alpha \left\{ \left(1- \frac{1} {\theta}+ \frac {s} {\theta}\right)^\alpha-1 \right\}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between the mean and variance of the PNB distribution is then

: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}\,(Y) = a\text{E}(Y)^b + \text{E}(Y),&lt;/math&gt;

which, in the range of many experimental metastasis assays, would be indistinguishable from the variance-to-mean power law.  For sparse data, however, this discrete variance-to-mean relationship would behave more like that of a Poisson distribution where the variance equaled the mean.

===Genomic structure and evolution===

The local density of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms]] (SNPs) within the [[human genome]], as well as that of [[gene]]s, appears to cluster in accord with the variance-to-mean power law and the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution.&lt;ref name=Kendal2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendal | first1 = WS | year = 2003 | title = An exponential dispersion model for the  distribution of human single nucleotide polymorphisms | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 579–590 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msg057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KendalGenes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendal|first=WS|title=A scale invariant clustering of genes on human chromosome 7|journal=BMC Evol Biol|year=2004|volume=4|pages=3|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-3|pmid=15040817|pmc=373443}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of SNPs their observed density reflects the assessment techniques, the availability of genomic sequences for analysis, and the [[Nucleotide diversity|nucleotide heterozygosity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2001 | title = A map of human genome variation containing 1.42 million single nucleotide polymorphisms | doi = 10.1038/35057149 | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = | pages = 928–933 | pmid=11237013 | last1 = Sachidanandam | first1 = R | last2 = Weissman | first2 = D | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = SC | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two factors reflect ascertainment errors inherent to the collection methods, the latter factor reflects an intrinsic property of the genome.

In the [[Coalescent theory|coalescent model]] of population genetics each genetic locus has its own unique history.  Within the evolution of a population from some species some genetic loci could presumably be traced back to a relatively [[Most recent common ancestor|recent common ancestor]] whereas other loci might have more ancient [[Genetic genealogy|genealogies]].  More ancient genomic segments would have had more time to accumulate SNPs and to experience [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].  '''R R Hudson''' has proposed a model where recombination could cause variation in the time to [[Most recent common ancestor|most common recent ancestor]] for different genomic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = RR | year = 1991 | title = Gene genealogies and the coalescent process | url = | journal = Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A high recombination rate could cause a chromosome to contain a large number of small segments with less correlated genealogies.

Assuming a constant background rate of mutation the number of SNPs per genomic segment would accumulate proportionately to the time to the most recent common ancestor.  Current [[population genetics|population genetic theory]] would indicate that these times would be [[gamma distribution|gamma distributed]], on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tavare | first1 = S | last2 = Balding | first2 = DJ | last3 = Griffiths | first3 = RC | last4 = Donnelly | first4 = P | year = 1997 | title = Inferring coalescent times from DNA sequence data | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 505–518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution would suggest a model whereby the SNP map would consist of multiple small genomic segments with the mean number of SNPs per segment would be gamma distributed as per Hudson’s model.

The distribution of genes within the human genome also demonstrated a variance-to-mean power law, when the method of expanding bins was used to determine the corresponding variances and means.&lt;ref name=KendalGenes /&gt; Similarly the number of genes per enumerative bin was found to obey a Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution.  This probability distribution was deemed compatible with two different biological models: the '''microarrangement model''' where the number of genes per unit genomic length was determined by the sum of a random number of smaller genomic segments derived by random breakage and reconstruction of protochormosomes.  These smaller segments would be assumed to carry on average a gamma distributed number of genes.

In the alternative '''gene cluster model''', genes would be distributed randomly within the protochromosomes.  Over large evolutionary timescales there would occur [[gene duplication|tandem duplication]], [[mutation|mutations, insertions, deletions]] and [[chromosomal rearrangement|rearrangements]] that could affect the genes through a stochastic [[Birth–death process|birth, death and immigration process]] to yield the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution.

Both these mechanisms would implicate [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral evolutionary processes]] that would result in regional clustering of genes.

===Random matrix theory===

The '''[[Random matrix|Gaussian unitary ensemble]]''' (GUE) consists of complex [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] that are invariant under [[unitary transformation]]s whereas the '''[[Random matrix|Gaussian orthogonal ensemble]]''' (GOE) consists of real symmetric matrices invariant under [[orthogonal transformation]]s.  The ranked [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/SUB&gt;'' from these random matrices obey '''[[Wigner semicircle distribution|Wigner’s semicircular distribution]]''': For a ''N''&amp;times;''N'' matrix the average density for eigenvalues of size ''E'' will be

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}(E)=  \begin{cases} \sqrt{2N-E^2}/\pi
&amp; \quad \left\vert E \right\vert &lt; \sqrt{2N} \\ 0 &amp; \quad \left\vert E \right\vert &gt; \sqrt{2N} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

as ''E''{{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;rarr; &amp;infin; &lt;/VAR&gt;}}.  Integration of the semicircular rule provides the number of eigenvalues on average less than ''E'',

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\eta}(E) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left [E\sqrt{2N-E^2}+2N \arcsin \left( \frac{E}{\sqrt{2N}} \right )+ \pi N \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

The ranked eigenvalues can be '''unfolded''', or renormalized, with the equation

: &lt;math&gt;e_n = \bar{\eta}(E)=\int \limits_{-\infty}^{E_n}dE^\prime \bar{\rho}(E^\prime). &lt;/math&gt;

This removes the trend of the sequence from the fluctuating portion.  If we look at the absolute value of the difference between the actual and expected cumulative number of eigenvalues

: &lt;math&gt;\left | \bar{D}_n \right | =\left |  n- \bar{\eta}(E_n) \right | &lt;/math&gt;

we obtain a sequence of '''eigenvalue fluctuations''' which, using the method of expanding bins, reveals a variance-to-mean power law.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;
The eigenvalue fluctuations of both the GUE and the GOE manifest this power law with the power law exponents ranging between 1 and 2, and they similarly manifest 1/''f'' noise spectra.  These eigenvalue fluctuations also correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution and they exhibit multifractality.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b" /&gt;

===The distribution of [[prime number]]s===

The '''second [[Chebyshev function]]''' ''&amp;psi;''(''x'') is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; \psi(x) = \sum_{\hat{p}^k\le x}\log \hat{p}=\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n) &lt;/math&gt;

where the summation extends over all prime powers &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}^k &lt;/math&gt; not exceeding&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x'' runs over the positive real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Mangoldt function]]. The function ''&amp;psi;''(''x'') is related to the [[prime-counting function]] ''&amp;pi;''(''x''), and as such provides information with regards to the distribution of prime numbers amongst the real numbers.  It is asymptotic to&amp;nbsp;''x'', a statement equivalent to the [[prime number theorem]] and it can also be shown to be related to the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] located on the critical strip ρ, where the real part of the zeta zero ρ is between 0 and 1.  Then ψ expressed for ''x'' greater than one can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_0(x) = x - \sum_\rho \frac{x^\rho}{\rho} - \ln 2\pi - \frac12 \ln(1-x^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\psi_0(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}\frac{\psi(x-\varepsilon)+\psi(x+\varepsilon)}2.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Riemann hypothesis]] states that the [[root of a function|nontrivial zeros]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] all have [[real part]] ½.  These zeta function zeros are related to the [[prime number theorem|distribution of prime numbers]].  [[Lowell Schoenfeld|'''Schoenfeld''']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoenfeld|first=J|title=Sharper bounds for the Chebyshev functions θ(x) and ψ(x). II|journal=Math Computation|year=1976|volume=30|issue=134|pages=337–360|doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-1976-0457374-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has shown that if the Riemann hypothesis is true then

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta(x)=\left\vert \psi(x)-x \right\vert &lt; \sqrt{x} \log^{2}(x)/(8 \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;73.2&lt;/math&gt;. If we analyze the Chebyshev deviations Δ(''n'') on the integers ''n'' using the method of expanding bins and plot the variance versus the mean a variance to mean power law can be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendal|first=WS|title=Fluctuation scaling and 1/f noise: shared origins from the Tweedie family of statistical distributions|journal=J Basic Appl Phys|year=2013|volume=2|pages=40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, these deviations correspond to the Tweedie compound Poisson-gamma distribution and they exhibit 1/''f'' noise.

published by Myrmidion Press. Eden Studios uses ''Unisystem'' under an exclusive license, but has allowed other game companies to license the system. Eden Studios published ''WitchCraft 2nd Edition'' and their original ''All Flesh Must Be Eaten'' games as ''Unisystem'' games. ''Armageddon 2nd Edition'' and a new 2nd Edition of Eden's own ''Conspiracy X'' were later published using this gaming system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What and Who is Eden Studios| publisher = Eden Studios| url = http://www.edenstudios.net/edeninfo.htm| format = bios, information| accessdate = 2008-02-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080119104956/http://www.edenstudios.net/edeninfo.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Unisystem'' games use a point-buy system to generate characters.&lt;ref name="Flesh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ConspiracyX"/&gt; Points are spent on Attributes, Skills, Qualities and Metaphysics. Drawbacks can be used to gain extra points.

Attributes represent the character's main six abilities, which in this case are three physical attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution; and three mental attributes: Intelligence, Perception, Willpower.&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12023.phtml| title=Review of Army of Darkness Roleplaying Game| publisher=[[RPGnet]]|date=March 2006| accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Characters also have a variety of Skills, Qualities and Drawbacks to give the character added perks or faults (respectively). Other Qualities and Drawbacks are of a Supernatural sort and are used to designate a character as a particular type of character (be it a Gifted human, a Vampyre, a Spirit, and so on) or detail what sort of magic they can do.

Actions are resolved by adding together the character's relevant Attribute, the applicable Skill, and a ten-sided die roll, plus any modifiers for difficulty; if the total is nine or greater, the action succeeds. [[Gamemaster]]s (called "Chroniclers" in ''Classic'', and "Directors" in ''Cinematic Unisystem'') are also given tables of successes: characters that get a higher roll than the required nine have bonuses on their final outcome; this table describes how successful they turn out to be, and gives guidelines to figure out the resulting bonuses.

== ''Classic'' versus ''Cinematic'' ==
''Unisystem'' can be divided into two sub-systems: ''Classic'' and ''Cinematic''.
 
''Classic Unisystem'' was developed first and is featured in ''All Flesh Must Be Eaten'', ''[[Armageddon: The End Times|Armageddon]]'', ''Conspiracy X 2.0'', ''[[Terra Primate]]''&lt;ref name="SciFi411"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is typified by grittier, more realistic play, greater attention to detail in skills and combat, and the use of Secondary Attributes that are typically derived from the Primary Attributes.  Essence, or the measure of life-force and magic, is also central to ''Classic Unisystem'' play.

''Cinematic Unisystem'' was designed to mimic the "cinematic" exploits of characters. First developed for the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (roleplaying game)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Roleplaying Game]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer Roleplaying Game: Designer Notes|last=Carella |first=C.

''[[Army of Darkness Roleplaying Game|Army of Darkness]]''&lt;ref name="Army"/&gt; and ''[[Ghosts of Albion Roleplaying Game|Ghosts of Albion]]''. ''Cinematic'' features a limited set of skills that cover most situations, no Secondary Attributes or Essence, simplified combat and flat damage resolution. ''Cinematic'' games also feature the use of Drama Points which allow the character to do things above and beyond what they could do under the system alone.

The chief difference between the systems are Drama Points (used only in the Cinematic system), and differences in magic system mechanics.

Despite the differences the two are still largely compatible, though every ''Cinematic Unisystem'' game offers an appendix to convert values from the ''Classic'' system, and the ''Buffy RPG''{{'}}s Magic Box supplement offers an appendix on converting between the ''Buffy'' magic system and the ''WitchCraft'' magic system.

In [[mathematics]], '''−1''' is the [[additive inverse]] of [[1 (number)|1]], that is, the number that when [[addition|added]] to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the [[negative number|negative]] [[integer]] greater than negative two (−2) and less than&amp;nbsp;[[0 (number)|0]].

Negative one bears relation to [[Euler's identity]] since ''e''{{sup|''i''{{pi}}}} = −1.

In [[software development]], '''−1''' is a common initial value for integers and is also used to show that [[Sentinel value|a variable contains no useful information]].

In [[programming languages]], '''−1''' can be used to [[array slicing|index]] the last (or 2nd last) item of an [[array data structure|array]], depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.

'''Negative one''' has some similar but slightly different properties to positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrh89dLWZqEC Mathematical analysis and applications]
 By Jayant V. Deshpande, {{ISBN|1-84265-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic properties ==
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=1\cdot x+(-1)\cdot x=(1+(-1))\cdot x=0 \cdot x=0&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot x=(0+0)\cdot x=0\cdot x+0\cdot x \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

so (−1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x'', or&amp;nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.

=== Square of −1 ===
The [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.

For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot 0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\cdot1+(-1)\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\cdot(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.

=== Square roots of −1 ===
Although there are no [[Real number| real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 has infinite solutions]].

== Exponentiation to negative integers ==
[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.

−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.

== Computer representation ==
{{Main|Signed number representations}}
Most computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring "11111111", or "FF" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string "11111111" above represents 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;255.

== Programming languages ==
In some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.
If the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.
If the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.
