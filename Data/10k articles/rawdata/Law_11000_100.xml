      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19413">The '''Administrative Appeals Office''', full name '''USCIS Administrative Appeals Office''', and also known as the '''AAO''' and '''USCIS AAO''', is an office within [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) that can be used by petitioners to appeal adverse USCIS decisions made on their petitions.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/administrative-appeals-office-aao|title = The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO)|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Washington, D.C.]], and all its in-person functions (including listening to oral arguments) happens only in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=i-290b-instructions/&gt;

==  Appeals process ==

{{main|USCIS immigration forms}}Most appeals must be filed on [[USCIS immigration forms|Form I-290B]] (with a fee) within 30 days of the initial denial. The USCIS office that denied the benefit will review the appeal and determine whether to take favorable action and grant the benefit request. If that office does not take favorable action, it will forward the appeal to the AAO for appellate review.

Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, can be used for three purposes:&lt;ref name=i-290b-instructions&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/system/files_force/files/form/i-290binstr.pdf|title = Instructions for Form I-290B|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# To file an appeal with the AAO
# To file a [[Reconsideration of a motion|motion to reconsider]] a decision
# To file a motion to reopen a decision

The key difference between appeals and motions is that appeals go to the AAO, i.e., a higher authority than the one that made the decision being appealed. Also, they do not need to include additional evidence, since the underlying claim of the appeal is that the office whose decision is being appealed did not correctly process the existing evidence.

In contrast, motions to reconsider or reopen apply to the same office that made the decision being appealed. In particular, a motion to reconsider or reopen a denial by a service center will be made to that service center. Motions to reconsider/reopen must be accompanied by new evidence showing that the initially filed petition should have been approved.

To complicate matters, it is possible to file a motion to reconsider or reopen AAO's decision in response to a past appeal.

'''1. Adjudication (or readjudication) that must be completed before an appeal can be made'''

An appeal can be made about a petition only after the USCIS officer adjudicating or re-adjudicating the petition has finished adjudicating, and only if the petition was denied (for initial adjudication) or revoked (for re-adjudication).

There are two steps that the USCIS might take in order to help petitioners voice their concerns during adjudication, to reduce the need for appeals:

* [[Request For Evidence]] (RFE): Here, the USCIS requests the petitioner for additional evidence while the form is still being adjudicated. It is intended for use in cases where the adjudicator (the person evaluating the petition) believes that there is not enough evidence to approve the petition, but also believes that the petition may be redeemable, and that there is no clear factual or statutory basis for denial.&lt;ref name=2013-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2013/June%202013/Requests%20for%20Evidence%20%28Final%29.pdf|title = Policy Memorandum|date = June 3, 2013|accessdate = January 16, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Notice of Intent to Deny]] (NOID): Here, the USCIS sends the petitioner a notice explaining that a denial is likely, along with reasons for denial. The petitioner has some time to send additional evidence that could help change the decision. The NOID is used for situations where the adjudicator (the person evaluating the petition) believes that the petition should be denied, but that the petitioner may have additional evidence that might lead the petition to be approved.&lt;ref name=2013-memo/&gt;

In some cases, petitions that were initially approved are readjudicated after a consular officer processing a visa based on the approved petition finds a reason that the petition should not have been approved or is no longer approvable. The USCIS may decide, based on the readjudication, to revoke the petition. During this readjudication process, the USCIS may issue a [[Notice of Intent to Revoke]] (NOIR) that plays a similar role as the NOID does for initial adjudication.

if a denial or revocation is sent, it includes information on whether an appeal is allowed. If no appeal is allowed, then the only option available for challenge is filing a motion to reconsider or reopen.&lt;ref name=USCIS&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/practice-manual/chapter-4-motions-reopen-and-reconsider|title = Practice Manual : Motions to Reopen and Reconsider|accessdate = November 28, 2017|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2. Submission of appeal'''

The following restrictions apply on using Form I-290B to file appeals:

* The appeal ''must'' be filed by the petitioner. The beneficiary cannot appeal a USCIS decision. This is relevant to forms such as Form I-129, Form I-130, and Form I-140, where, in most cases, the beneficiary differs from the petitioner. For instance, with Form I-130, a US citizen wife might file a petition for her non-US-citizen husband. In this case, only the wife can appeal a denial, not the husband.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/forms/questions-and-answers-appeals-and-motions|title = Questions and Answers: Appeals and Motions|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The appeal must be filed within a specific time limit after the adverse decision. The limits are:&lt;ref name=i-290b-instructions/&gt;
** 30 calendar days for denials served in person
** 33 calendar days for denials served by mail
** 15 calendar days for revocations served in person
** 18 calendar days for revocations served by mail

An appeal that is filed late is automatically treated as a motion to reconsider or reopen, if it otherwise meets the criteria for those. Although the motion to reconsider or reopen also has the same time limits, there is a little more flexibility allowed for late filing of motions.

Appeals may be accompanied by briefs in support of the appeal. The briefs can be submitted at the time of initial filing of the appeal or within 30 days.

The appellant can also request an oral argument before the AAO in [[Washington, D.C.]] Oral arguments are not always granted. Interpreters are not provided for oral arguments.&lt;ref name=aao-processing-requests&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/aao-processing-requests|title = AAO Processing Requests|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appellants may also request expedited processing of the AAO, but only by providing evidence of one or more of these:

* Severe financial loss to a company or individual;
* Extreme emergent situation;
* Humanitarian situation;
* Nonprofit status of requesting organization in furthering the cultural and social interests of the United States;
* Department of Defense or National Interest Situation (Note: The request must come from an official United States Government entity and must state that a delay will be detrimental to the Government);
* Handling error by USCIS that has created an unreasonable delay that may be corrected by placing the case back in its original order; and
* Compelling interest of USCIS.
'''3. Initial field review (IFR)'''

If the petitioner files Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, the appeal is first sent to the office that adjudicated the original petition. This gives the office the opportunity to review the appeal and readjudicate the petition if necessary. This stage is called initial field review or IFR.&lt;ref name=aao-decision-data&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/aao-decision-data|title = AAO Decision Data|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the office finds no problem with the denial or revocation, then the appeal is forwarded to the AAO, entering the stage called appellate review.

The initial field review should be completed within 45 days.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

The defining guidelines for IFR were issued in a November 2015 policy memorandum.&lt;ref name=ifr-memo/&gt;

=== Appellate review ===

After initial field review, the appeal is processed by AAO, using the original petition, the decision of the USCIS field office, and any briefs or oral arguments presented as part of the appeal. The AAO will then come to one of three decisions:&lt;ref name=aao-decision-data/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://immigration.findlaw.com/visas/administrative-appeals-with-the-uscis.html|title = Administrative Appeals with the USCIS|publisher = FindLaw|accessdate= December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sustain (approve) the appeal, thus overturning the original denial or revocation.
* Dismiss (deny) the appeal, thus maintaining the original denial or revocation.
* Remand (return) the appeal, thus making the original office review the petition yet again.

The appellate review should be completed within six months (180 days) of receiving the appeal (note that this includes the time spent on initial field review).&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=aao-processing-times/&gt; Like the rest of USCIS, the AAO releases processing time goals for appeals based on form type.&lt;ref name=aao-processing-times&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/aao-processing-times|title = AAO Processing Times|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current AAO processing times are not included in [[USCIS processing times|USCIS' monthly report of processing times]] across its field offices and service centers,&lt;ref name=uscis-processing-times-official&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplayInit.do|title =  USCIS Processing Time Information|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather, the fraction of appeals for each category for which processing time goals were met in the most recent quarter is included on the AAO processing times page.

=== Records ===

It is possible to get a copy of the notice of record for an appeal made to AAO by submitting a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request to USCIS. However, this is not part of the appeal timeline, so an appellant cannot use delay in processing of the FOIA to explain delay in submitting any necessary documents.&lt;ref name=aao-processing-requests/&gt; The FOIA can be made by anybody (not necessarily the petitioner or beneficiary); however, key identifying information, including the petitioner's and beneficiary's name, are often redacted.&lt;ref name=sample-decision&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/err/B4%20-%20Multinational%20Managers%20and%20Executives/Decisions_Issued_in_2010/Aug032010_03B4203.pdf|title = Sample AAO non-precedent decision|date = August 3, 2010|accessdate = December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steps if the appeal is denied ===

If an appeal to AAO is denied, the appellant can file a motion to reconsider or reopen if there is new evidence that would show that the appeal should have been sustained.

Otherwise, the AAO's decision can be appealed within the United States federal judicial system.

== Decision framework and impact on USCIS and judicial review ==

The significance of precedent and non-precedent decisions, as well as the concept of adopted decisions, as detailed below, have been evolving slowly since 2003. The most recent defining memorandum explaining the distinction was issued by the USCIS on November 2013.&lt;ref name=precedent-memo/&gt; This is part of a general thrust in the AAO to move toward clearer and more consistent rulemaking to improve decision quality and consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://discuss.ilw.com/content.php?3158-Article-USCIS-AAO-(Administrative-Appeals-Office)-Appears-to-be-Moving-In-The-Right-Direction-By-Joseph-P-Whalen|title = USCIS' AAO (Administrative Appeals Office) Appears to be Moving In The Right Direction|last = Whalen|first = Joseph P.|date = May 29, 2014|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[Immigration Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-precedent decisions ===

Most AAO decisions are non-precedent decisions: they apply existing law and policy to the facts of the case. Non-precedent decisions are binding on the parties involved, but have no effect on agency guidance or practice.&lt;ref name=aao-non-precedent&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/aao-non-precedent-decisions|title = AAO Non-Precedent Decisions|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAO has all its non-precedent decisions since 2005 available in an online repository. Decisions before 2005 can be obtained using [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests.&lt;ref name=aao-non-precedent/&gt; The name of the petitioner and beneficiary are usually redacted in the non-precedent decisions available online.

=== Adopted decisions ===

Non-precedent decisions by AAO are sometimes adopted by USCIS as binding policy guidance for USCIS personnel. An adopted decision may later get superseded by other USCIS policy changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/adopted-aao-decisions|title = Adopted AAO Decisions|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precedent decisions ===

Some AAO decisions acquire the status of precedent decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-14|title=Boika v. Holder|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boika_v._Holder&amp;oldid=739423372|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means they become legally binding on all DHS components that deal with the law. Precedent decisions therefore carry more force than adopted decisions, which in turn carry more force than other non-precedent decisions.&lt;ref name=precedent-decisions&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/laws/precedent-decisions|title = Precedent Decisions|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.justice.gov/eoir/dhs-aao-ins-decisions|title = DHS/AAO/INS Decisions|publisher = [[United States Department of Justice]]|accessdate = December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precedent decisions may be modified or overruled by:

* The Attorney General
* Federal Courts
* Later precedent decisions
* Changes in the law

Although not legally bound by them, federal courts generally give more deference to precedent decisions, and decisions using similar reasoning as precedent decisions, than to non-precedent decisions,

== Data sets ==

The AAO releases data on the number of appeals of each decision type (dismiss, sustain, remand) for each combination of USCIS form category and fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/About%20Us/Directorates%20and%20Program%20Offices/AAO/USCIS_and_AAO_Data_for_Publishing_Thru_FY16.pdf|title = AAO Appeal Adjudications|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] (the historical agency that carried out functions currently carried out by USCIS, as well as some of the functions of ICE and CBP) created the Administrative Appeals Unit (AAU) in 1983.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=aao-practice-manual-chapter-1&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/directorates-and-program-offices/administrative-appeals-office-aao/practice-manual/chapter-1-administrative-appeals-office|title = AAO Practice Manual, Chapter 1|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, to deal with appeals for the legalization introduced as part of the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], it created the Legalization Appeals Unit (LAU).&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=aao-practice-manual-chapter-1/&gt;

In 1994, the two units were combined into the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). In 2003, the INS was dismantled and AAO was absorbed into the newly created United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).&lt;ref name=official/&gt;&lt;ref name=aao-practice-manual-chapter-1/&gt;

On November 18, 2013, USCIS issued a Policy Memorandum with guidance on the proper use of precedent and non-precedent decisions.&lt;ref name=precedent-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ilw.com/immigrationdaily/news/PM-602-0086-1_AAO_Precedent_and_Non-Precedent_Decisions_Final_Memo.pdf|title = Policy Memorandum: Subject: Precedent and Non-Precedent Decisions of the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO)|date = November 18, 2013|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the first edition of the AAO Practice Manual was published and made available online.&lt;ref name=manual-launch&gt;{{cite web|url = http://discuss.ilw.com/showthread.php?37948-News-USCIS-Message-Administrative-Appeals-Office-Introduces-First-Practice-Manual|title =  News: USCIS Message: Administrative Appeals Office Introduces First Practice Manual|date = January 29, 2015|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2015, the USCIS issued a Policy Memorandum with updated guidance on how Form I-290B appeals would be processed by the USCIS, with a focus on explaining the timeline and process for initial field review.&lt;ref name=ifr-memo&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ilw.com/immigrationdaily/news/2015,1111-USCIS.pdf|title = Policy Memorandum: Subject: Initial Field Review of Appeals to the Administrative Appeals Office|date = November 4, 2015|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, AAO made its non-precedent decisions since 2005 publicly searchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://discuss.ilw.com/content.php?6165-News-USCIS-Administrative-Appeals-Office-Launches-Search-Tool-for-Non-Precedent-Decisions|title = News: USCIS Administrative Appeals Office Launches Search Tool for Non-Precedent Decisions|date = April 4, 2016|accessdate = December 25, 2016|publisher = [[Immigration Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avenimiento''' (literally, "agreement" or "compromise")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collins Spanish-English Dictionary English Translation of "avenimiento"|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/spanish-english/avenimiento|publisher=Collins|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a legal concept in the [[Argentine Penal Code]], which stated that if a rape victim over the age of 16 agreed to marry her rapist, he could be freed from prison.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Hannah|title=Congress Pass Important Bills in First Session of the Year|url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromargentina/congress-pass-important-bills-in-first-session-of-the-year/|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=The Argentina Independent|date=15 March 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130117080815/http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromargentina/congress-pass-important-bills-in-first-session-of-the-year/|archivedate=2013-01-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of avenimiento was created as part of a 1998 overhaul of Argentinian laws related to [[sexual offences]]. Before 1998, this section of the law was called "Offences to Honesty": afterwards it was renamed "Offences to Sexual Integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pimentel|first=Silvia |author2=Valéria Pandjiarjian |author3=Juliana Belloque|title="Legitimate Defense of Honor" Illegitimate Impunity of Murders|journal=UNICAMP Center for Gender Studies|year=2006|pages=138|url=http://www.bibliotecadigital.unicamp.br/document/?down=50807|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been widely criticized by [[international human rights]] organizations, and was removed from the penal code in March 2012, following a unanimous vote of 51 Argentinian senators.&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;

The classes vary slightly between the two countries. Finnish and Swedish alcohol monopolies (Alko and Systembolaget) are completely exceptional in the countries of the European Union.

While previously enforced by law, the beer class legislation was repealed in 1995 with the accession of [[Finland]] into the [[European Union]] and the consequent harmonization of tax law, and is now merely kept as a convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viisitahtea.fi/content/view/2724/149/ Viisi Tähteä - Oluiden luokittelu ja oluttyypit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531112858/http://www.viisitahtea.fi/content/view/2724/149/ |date=May 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However,  drinks containing under 2.8% alcohol (Class ''I'') are still favorably taxed, and the retail sale of any drinks containing more than 5.5% alcohol is still limited to state retailer [[Alko]].

==Sweden==
Only classes ''I'' and ''II'' can be purchased in [[supermarket]]s, while class ''III'' can only be purchased in restaurants licensed to do so, and the state shops [[Systembolaget]]. Class ''II'' beer is loosely divided into two sub-groups, light "Folköl" ("People's Beer") with a maximum ABV of 2.8% and normal "Folköl", with a maximum ABV of 3.5%. An alcohol content of 2.8% and below is not subject to specific, higher, alcohol taxes, but only to VAT (12%) as any other food or non-alcoholic drink. Class ''III'' beer is also, unofficially, divided into two sub-groups, "Mellanöl" ("in-between beer"), with ABV between 3.6% and 4.5%, and normal "strong beer" with ABV above 4.5%. There is no real maximum amount of how much alcohol Class ''III'' beer may contain, and amounts of 10%+ are common. Mellanöl used to be available in supermarkets between October 1, 1965 and July 1, 1977, but was removed from the supermarkets due to heavy consumption by Swedish teenagers. Today "Mellanöl" does not exist as a class of its own, but "Mellanöl style beer" is available at [[Systembolaget]]. Before 1997, [[alcohol by weight]] was used, and then the limit for shops was 2.8 %, same as 3.5 % [[alcohol by volume]], which was a source of confusion.

'''''Bowman v. Monsanto Co.''''', 569 U.S. 278 (2013),&lt;ref name="ruling"&gt;{{ussc|name=Bowman v. Monsanto Co.|volume=569|page=278|year=2013}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States Supreme Court]] [[patent]] decision in which the Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] that the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|patent exhaustion doctrine]] does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought [[transgenic soybean]] crop seeds&lt;ref&gt;The soybean crop is seeds that are the same as the seeds from which the crop was grown.&lt;/ref&gt; from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. [[Monsanto]] originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.

In a unanimous opinion written by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Elena Kagan]], the Supreme Court ruled that Bowman's conduct infringed Monsanto's patents and that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds by planting and harvesting saved crop seeds without the patent holder's permission. The Court held that, when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed, thereby growing another soybean crop, that action constitutes an unauthorized "making" of the patented product.

The case garnered attention in part due to its potential impact on policy about genetically modified crops and self-replicating technologies, and due to the involvement of Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], who previously served as a lawyer for Monsanto.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Danforth]], then the attorney general of Missouri, hired Thomas out of Yale as a lawyer on his staff, and after a few years Thomas moved on to the legal department at Monsanto. Jeffrey Toobin, [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/11/12/unforgiven ''Unforgiven''], {{smallcaps|The New Yorker}} (Nov. 12, 2007); see also {{smallcaps|Ken Foskett, Judging Thomas: The Life and Times of Clarence Thomas}} 147-49 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Commentators noted, however, that the Court's ruling was narrow in scope, and did not set a broad legal precedent with respect to the applicability of the doctrine of patent exhaustion to self-replicating technologies.

==Background==
{{See also|Genetically modified crops|Monsanto|Monsanto legal cases}}

===Factual setting===
Monsanto developed patents for genetically modified [[soybean]]s that were resistant to [[glyphosate]]-based [[herbicide]]s.&lt;ref name=Brougher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brougher|first1=Joanna T.|title=Intellectual Property and Health Technologies: Balancing Innovation and the Public's Health|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461482024}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}} When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Jill |date=Fall 2013 |title=Bowman v.

[[File:Multicolor soybeans in Hale Township.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=rows of soybeans|Different types of genetically modified soybeans being grown side by side]]
In 1999, [[Indiana]] farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years.&lt;ref name=InDispute /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Supreme Court appears to defend patent on soybean|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/business/justices-signal-a-monsanto-edge-in-patent-case.html|accessdate=October 25, 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, many of which were transgenic,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman CAFC decision" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PatentDocsBowman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentdocs.org/2011/09/monsanto-co-v-bowman-fed-cir-2011.html |title=Monsanto Co. v. Bowman (Fed. Cir. 2011) |publisher=Patent Docs |date=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator.&lt;ref name="Bowman CAFC decision" /&gt; He informed Monsanto of his activities.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman CAFC decision" /&gt;

Monsanto stated that he was infringing its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman stated that he had not infringed due to [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|patent exhaustion]] on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.&lt;ref name="PatentDocsBowman" /&gt; Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation.&lt;ref name="ruling"/&gt; In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana]].&lt;ref name=Brougher /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name=InDispute /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman CAFC decision"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Monsanto Co. v. Bowman |vol=657 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1341 |pinpoint= |court=[[Fed. Cir.]] |date=2011 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20110921127 |accessdate=2018-06-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower court rulings===
After filing suit, Monsanto moved for [[summary judgment]]. In response, Bowman argued that if Monsanto was allowed to continue its license past exhaustion, it would be able to dominate the market.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in ''Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs |vol=459 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1328 |pinpoint= |court=[[Fed. Cir.]] |date=2006 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/459/1328/489587/ |accessdate=2018-06-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 and ''Monsanto Co. v. McFarling''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Monsanto Co. v. McFarling |vol=302 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1291 |pinpoint= |court=[[Fed. Cir.]] |date=2002 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/302/1291/559968/ |accessdate=2018-06-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;

Bowman then appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]].&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.|link=|volume=553|page=617|pin=|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto.&lt;ref name=Brougher /&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman CAFC decision" /&gt;

===Petition to the Supreme Court===
Bowman sought review in the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; Bowman argued that the Federal Circuit's decision conflicted with existing Supreme Court precedent on patent exhaustion.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; Bowman said that ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', {{Ussc|316|241|1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that patent exhaustion applied even when the patent holder created post-sale restrictions.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created a judicial exception to patent exhaustion for Monsanto, allowing it to dominate the soybean seed market.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; Finally, Bowman argued that he was not "making" infringing new seeds merely by planting and reaping crops.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;

Monsanto argued that the Federal Circuit's decision was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; They further argued that this was not an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] on October 5, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/10/court-grants-7-new-cases/ |last=Denniston|first=Lyle|title=Court grants seven new cases (Updated) |publisher=SCOTUSblog |date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
[[File:Elena Kagan Official SCOTUS Portrait (2013).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo of Elena Kagan wearing judicial robes|[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Elena Kagan]] delivered the opinion of the Court]]

===Arguments===
Bowman argued that the authorized sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created an exception to the exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to decide.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; Monsanto argued that the second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt; He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;

A number of ''[[Amicus Curiae|Amici Curiae]]'' also filed briefs on behalf of the parties.&lt;ref name = Simmons&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simmons |first=William J. |date=July 2013 |title=Bowman v. Monsanto and the protection of patented replicative biologic technologies |url=http://www.sughrue.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Simmons%202013%20Nature%20Biotech%20Bowman%20v%20Monsanto%20Spm%20Ct%20Decision.pdf |journal=Nature |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=602–06 |doi= |access-date=February 4, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[American Intellectual Property Law Association]], arguing on behalf of Monsanto, wrote that "[e]xhaustion of the right to control propagation of patented seed would disrupt the balance created by Congress between the Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act."&lt;ref name = Simmons/&gt; The [[American Seed Trade Association]], also arguing on behalf of Monsanto, wrote that "[p]atented seed technology benefits farmers, consumers and the environment".&lt;ref name = Simmons/&gt; The [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]], arguing on behalf of Bowman, wrote that "[a] patent exhaustion exception for self-replicating technologies is inconsistent with this Court’s precedent and the competition policies reflected in the first-sale doctrine", and the [[Center for Food Safety]] wrote that "[f]arming is not genetic engineering".&lt;ref name = Simmons/&gt;

===Commentary prior to the Supreme Court's ruling===
In the months leading up to the decision, commentators weighed in on several issues relating to the case. Because Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] had served as a lawyer for the Monsanto Company 34 years earlier, some critics questioned whether he would remain impartial.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web | url=http://rt.com/usa/patented-monsanto-court-patent-210/ | title=Monsanto wins landmark patent case in Supreme Court |date=May 13, 2013 | publisher=RT.com | accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators noted that the case raised the "important question" of whether the exhaustion doctrine should include an exception for self-replicating technologies, which may one day include self-replicating robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/replication-without-human-intervention-lessons-monsanto-v-bowman | title=Replication without Human Intervention: Lessons from Monsanto v. Bowman |last=Dalla Valle |first=Mark A. |date=May 9, 2013 | publisher=The National Law Review | accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[SCOTUSblog]], Ronald Mann wrote the case's "practical ramifications are substantial",&lt;ref name = MannPreview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/02/argument-preview-stakes-are-high-in-dispute-over-rights-to-genetically-modified-seeds/ |title=Argument preview: Stakes are high in dispute over rights to genetically modified seeds |last1=Mann |first1=Ronald |date=February 18, 2013 |website=SCOTUSblog |publisher= |access-date=January 25, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the case was "one of the highest-stakes cases of the Term".&lt;ref name = MannRecap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/02/argument-recap-justices-wary-of-cutting-patent-rights-to-genetically-modified-seeds/ |title=Argument recap: Justices wary of cutting patent rights to genetically modified seeds |last1=Mann |first1=Ronald |date=February 21, 2013 |website=SCOTUSblog |publisher= |access-date=January 25, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mann also predicted that "it seems most unlikely the Court will rule against Monsanto",&lt;ref name = MannPreview/&gt; and in his coverage of the case's oral arguments, he observed that "none of the Justices expressed any sympathy for [Bowman’s] position".&lt;ref name = MannRecap/&gt;

===Opinion of the Court===
On May 13, 2013, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Elena Kagan]] delivered the Court's unanimous opinion, which affirmed the judgment of the Federal Circuit.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ruling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/business/monsanto-victorious-in-genetic-seed-case.html |title=Monsanto Wins Case on Genetically Altered Soybeans |first=Adam | last=Liptak | publisher=The New York Times |date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Kagan stated that while an authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item, that exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ruling"/&gt; Justice Kagan stated that when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed, thereby growing a further soybean crop, that action constitutes an unauthorized "making" of the patented product, in violation of section 271(a) of the patent code.&lt;ref name="InDispute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|35|271|a}}. Section 271(a) gives the owner of a patent the exclusive right to ''make'' products that the patent covers.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Kagan concluded that Bowman could resell the patented seeds he obtained from the elevator, or use them as feed, but that he could not produce additional seeds (that is, crops).&lt;ref name=Brougher /&gt;{{rp|37}}

==Commentary and analysis==
After the Court published its decision, analysts offered a range of opinions about the impact of the Court's ruling. An academic co-author of an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] on behalf of Bowman filed by the [[American Antitrust Institute]] expressed relief that the loss was on a narrow basis rather than providing a broad affirmation of the lack of patent exhaustion for self-replicating technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Shubha|title=Monopoly without apology|url=http://patentlyo.com/patent/2013/05/guest-post-monopoly-without-apology.html|publisher=Patently-O|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Rodkey argued that an analysis under ''Quanta Computer'' leads to the conclusion that patent rights covering self-replicating seeds are exhausted on the first authorized sale, including subsequent generations, and that seed companies can only exclude subsequent replantings with carefully written license restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodkey|first1=Kevin|title=Exhaustion and Validity of Single-Use Licenses for Transgenic Seeds in the Wake of Quanta v. LG Electronics|journal=Federal Circuit Bar Journal|date=2010|volume=19|pages=579–616}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|600–603}} Ronald Mann writing in [[SCOTUSblog]] noted: "The tenor of the Court came through most clearly when the Court ridiculed what it called Bowman’s 'blame-the-bean defense' – the argument that Bowman did not make new seeds, because it was the seeds themselves that replicated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Ronald|title=Opinion recap: Justices firmly validate patent rights to genetically modified seeds|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/05/opinion-recap-justices-firmly-validate-patent-rights-to-genetically-modified-seeds/|publisher=SCOTUSBlog|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another academic, [[Richard H. Stern]], did not take issue with the Court's refusal to shelter Bowman's conduct under the exhaustion doctrine, but criticized the Court's classification of the act of planting seeds and growing crops from them as an act of "making" a new patented article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Stern|Stern, Richard H.]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Bowman.pdf ''Bowman v Monsanto'': ''Exhaustion versus Making''], [2014] {{smallcaps|Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev.}} 255, 260–61. He argued that, because Congress has not addressed the issue whether the millennia-old practice of planting and growing a crop from harvested seeds constituted a "making" of a patented product, the Court should have left it to Congress to make the decision as to whether replanting patented seed should constitute infringement.&lt;/ref&gt; Rochelle C. Dreyfus is also reported to have criticized the decision, noting that Bowman was attempting to obtain the benefit of the genetic modifications, while others, such as organic growers, fear being sued for inadvertent cross-contamination.&lt;ref name=Okediji&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Okediji|editor1-first=Ruth L.|editor2-last=Bagley|editor2-first=Margo A.|title=Patent Law in Global Perspective|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199334278|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' wrote that "[t]he Court reached the correct outcome but via the wrong route" because its ruling "obfuscates the role of the licensing agreement" and because the "exhaustion doctrine is ill suited to address the challenges posed by self-replicating technologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Patent Act of 1952 — Patent Exhaustion Doctrine — Bowman v.

Other commentators suggested the case will have broad-ranging impacts for other self-replicating technologies. Tabetha Marie Peavey suggested that the Court "appeared to be alert to the consequences of its ruling, not just for the value of Monsanto’s soybean patents, but also for technologies like cell lines, software, and vaccines".&lt;ref name = Peavey&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peavey |first=Tabetha Marie |date=August 1, 2014 |title=Bowman v.

Holman wrote that the case "should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self-replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holman |first=Christopher M. |date=2015 |title=Bowman v. Monsanto Co.: A Bellwether for the Emerging Issue of Patentable Self- Replicating Technologies and Inadvertent Infringement |url=http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/files/2015/12/6.-Holman.pdf |journal=Missouri Law Review |volume=80 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=February 4, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; William J. Simmons also wrote that "more cases like this will probably be appealed to [the Supreme Court] as these technologies become more prevalent in society".&lt;ref name = Simmons/&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
In a similar case, ''[[Organic Seed Growers &amp; Trade Ass'n v. Monsanto Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Organic Seed Growers &amp; Trade Ass'n v.

The suit did not demonstrate instances of current harm or future risk. Monsanto also gave assurances that it did not plan to sue in cases of inadvertent infringement when a grower was not also using glyphosate on their crop.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Circuit said: "Monsanto has made binding assurances that it will not 'take legal action against growers whose crops might inadvertently contain traces of Monsanto biotech genes (because, for example, some transgenic seed or pollen blew onto the grower's land).'&amp;#1329;" See also [http://www.patentdocs.org/2013/07/organic-seed-growers-trade-assn-v-monsanto-co-fed-cir-2013.html ''Organic Seed Growers &amp; Trade Ass'n v.

== Background ==

=== Federal law ===

==== Religious Freedom Restoration Act ====
The United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' (1990) that a person may not defy ''neutral laws of general applicability''{{efn|The meaning of ''neutral law of general applicability'' was [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah|elaborated by the court in 1993]].}} even as an expression of religious belief. "To permit this," wrote Justice Scalia, citing the 1878 ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' decision, "would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.utk.edu/~scheb/decisions/Reynolds.htm|title = Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878)|date = 1878|accessdate = September 2, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; " He wrote that generally applicable laws do not have to meet the standard of [[strict scrutiny]], because such a requirement would create "a private right to ignore generally applicable laws". Strict scrutiny would require a law to be the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.

In 1993, the US Congress responded by passing the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), requiring strict scrutiny when a neutral law of general applicability "substantially burden[s] a person's{{efn|The [[Dictionary Act]] defines the word 'person' in any act of Congress to include corporations.}} exercise of religion".&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Supreme Court Hears Cases on Contraception Rule|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/us/politics/q-and-a-on-challenges-to-health-laws-birth-control-requirement.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFRA was amended in 2000 by the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] (RLUIPA) to redefine ''exercise of religion'' as any exercise of religion, "whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief", which is to be "construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution". The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the RFRA as applied to federal statutes in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita]]'' in 2006.

==== Affordable Care Act ====
Of those Americans who have health insurance, most are covered by [[Private Option|employer-sponsored]] health insurance. In 2010, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), which relies on the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of preventive care for women should be covered in certain employer-based health plans. HHS exempted religious employers (churches and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order), non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High court worsens pain of Obamacare birth-control compromise|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-health-contraceptives01-20140701,0,3865443.story|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; employers providing grandfathered plans (that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees. The HRSA decided that all twenty contraceptives approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) should be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A statement by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html|work=HHS.gov|accessdate=March 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702150143/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html|archivedate=July 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that refuse are fined $100 per individual per day,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Mears|first=Bill|title=Justices to hear 'Hobby Lobby' case on Obamacare birth control rule|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/21/politics/scotus-obamacare-contraception-mandate/|accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they can replace their health coverage with higher wages and a calibrated tax.

=== Lower court history ===
In September 2012, Hobby Lobby filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma]] against enforcement of the contraception rule based on the RFRA and the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the First Amendment.  On November 19, 2012, U.S. District Judge [[Joe L. Heaton]] denied Hobby Lobby's request for a preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10390225281706554853&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius'', 870 F. Supp. 2d 1278 (W.D. Okla. 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 26, 2012, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] issued an [[in-chambers opinion]] denying an injunction pending appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1721474507433667393&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.

Ed. 2d 448 (Sotomayor, Circuit Justice 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2013, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] granted a hearing of the case. In June, the appeals court ruled that Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. is a person who has [[religious freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16964735894130305098&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v.

In September, the government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Timeline|url=http://www.hobbylobbycase.com/the-case/case-timeline/|work=hobbylobbycase.com|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other federal appeals courts ruled against the contraception coverage rule, while another two upheld it.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The case was previously titled ''Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby''. [[Sylvia Mathews Burwell|Sylvia Burwell]] was automatically substituted as petitioner when she was approved by the [[United States Senate]] as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|the Secretary of Health and Human Services]] after being nominated by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] to replace [[Kathleen Sebelius]] following Sebelius' resignation on April 10, 2014.

== U.S. Supreme Court consideration ==

=== Acceptance and briefs ===
On November 26, the Supreme Court accepted and consolidated the case with ''Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius.'' Two dozen amicus briefs support the government, and five dozen support the companies. [[American Freedom Law Center]]'s brief argues that birth control harms women because men will only want them "for the satisfaction of [their] own desires."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|title=Your Health Care, Your Choices (Amen, to That!)|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/24/your-health-care-your-choices-amen-to-that.html|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another brief argues that the contraception rule leads to "the maximization of sexual activity".&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=Religion run amok?

=== Argument and deliberation ===
Oral arguments were held on March 25, 2014 for 30 minutes more than the usual one hour.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;
The three women in the court focused their questioning on Hobby Lobby's lawyer, [[Paul Clement]], while the men focused on the administration's lawyer, Solicitor General [[Donald B. Verrilli Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Condon|first=Stephanie|title=Hobby Lobby case fires up women, conservatives on Supreme Court|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hobby-lobby-case-fires-up-women-conservatives-on-supreme-court/|accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=CBS News|date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Sotomayor quoted the ruling from [[United States v. Lee (1982)|''United States v. Lee'' (1982)]] saying that an employer can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of religious beliefs. Clement replied that ''Lee'' does not apply because it was a challenge against a tax rather than against a significant burden. Sotomayor said that instead of paying the burden of the penalty, Hobby Lobby could replace its health care with the equivalent expense of higher wages and a calibrated tax, which the government would use to pay for the employees' health care.&lt;ref name=Proceedings&gt;{{cite web|title=Proceedings|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-354_5436.pdf|work=supremecourt.gov|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Noah|title=Feldman: Hobby Lobby verdict may be a surprise|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/57738599-82/religious-hobby-lobby-court.html.csp|accessdate=March 28, 2014|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of Clement's argument, Justice Kennedy expressed concern for the rights of the employees who may not agree with the religious beliefs of their employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court Struggles In Hobby Lobby Case With Question Of Companies' Religious Rights|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/25/supreme-court-hobby-lobby_n_5027527.html|accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=March 25, 2014|author=Ryan J.

Wilkinson]]'' requires the court to weigh the impact on third parties in every RFRA case, Justice Scalia said that the RFRA does not require the court to balance the interest of the religious objector to the interest of other individuals.

== Opinion of the Court ==

=== Majority opinion ===
[[File:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Justice [[Samuel Alito]] was the author of the Court's majority opinion.]]
On June 30, 2014, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Samuel Alito]] delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) joined him to strike down the HHS mandate, as applied to [[closely held corporation]]s with religious objections, and to prevent the plaintiffs from being compelled to provide contraception under their healthcare plans. The ruling was reached on statutory grounds, citing the RFRA, because the mandate was not the "least restrictive" method of implementing the government's interest. The ruling did not address Hobby Lobby's claims under the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/30/politics/scotus-obamacare-contraception/&lt;/ref&gt;

The court argued that the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the rights of shareholders, officers, and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.|volume=573|year=|docket=13-354}}, slip op. at 24 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; It said that "allowing Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the religious liberty of the Greens and the Hahns."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 24, restated in and quoted from p 27]&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that for-profit corporations could be considered ''persons'' under the RFRA. It noted that the HHS treats ''nonprofit'' corporations as ''persons'' within the meaning of RFRA. The court stated, "no conceivable definition of the term includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp. 25–26]&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to lower court judges' suggestion that the purpose of for-profit corporations "is simply to make money", the court said, "For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp. 28–29]&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the contention that "the Nation lacks a tradition of exempting for-profit corporations from generally applicable laws," pointing to a federal statute from 1993 that exempted any covered health care entity from engaging in "certain activities related to abortion".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 34]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court held that the HHS contraception mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion, rejecting an argument that the $2,000-per-employee penalty for dropping insurance coverage is less than the average cost of health insurance. Responding to HHS's argument that the provision of coverage does not itself result in destruction of embryos, the Court asserted that the argument dodges the substantial burden question that the Court is supposed to address. The Court added, citing Jesuit moral manuals, that the argument is also the religious question of the morality of enabling the immoral acts of others, to which HHS had provided "a binding national answer". The Court argued that federal courts should not answer religious questions because they would in effect be deciding whether certain beliefs are flawed.&lt;ref&gt;134 S. Ct. 2751, 2778 fn.34 (citing [[David S. Oderberg]], [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6248324&amp;fileId=S1358246100008511|The Ethics of Co-operation in Wrongdoing, in Modern Moral Philosophy 203-228 (A.

Hobby Lobby Stores,'' pp. 39–40]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court found it unnecessary to adjudicate on whether the HHS contraceptive mandate furthers a compelling government interest and held that HHS has not shown that the mandate is "the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt; The court argued that the most straightforward alternative would be "for the Government to assume the cost&amp;nbsp;..." and that HHS has not shown that it is not "a viable alternative".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,''  p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that the RFRA can "require creation of entirely new programs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 48]&lt;/ref&gt; The court also pointed out that HHS already exempts any nonprofit organization from paying for any required contraception by allowing it to certify its religious objection to its insurance issuer, which must "[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,'' pp. 15–16, 49]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court said the approach might not necessarily be the least restrictive alternative for all religious claims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 50]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded by addressing "the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction". The court said that their decision "provides no such shield", and that "prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 52]&lt;/ref&gt; The court also said that the requirement to pay taxes despite any religious objection is different from the contraceptive mandate because "there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'',. pp. 52–53]&lt;/ref&gt; The court acknowledged the dissent's "worries about forcing the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims made by litigants seeking a religious exemption from generally applicable laws&amp;nbsp;...", noting that this point was "made forcefully by the Court in ''Smith''". The court responded by saying, "Congress, in enacting RFRA, took the position that 'the compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests'&amp;nbsp;... The wisdom of Congress's judgment on this matter is not our concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and under the standard that RFRA prescribes, the HHS contraceptive mandate is unlawful."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concurring opinion ===
[[File:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], joined in the majority opinion but also wrote a concurring opinion addressing the dissent.]]
Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote a concurring opinion, responding to the "respectful and powerful dissent", by emphasizing the limited nature of the ruling and saying that the government  "makes the case that the mandate serves the Government's compelling interest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of female employees", but that the RFRA's least-restrictive way requirement is not met because "there is an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework to provide coverage," the one that HHS has devised for non-profit corporations with religious objections. "RFRA requires the Government to use this less restrictive means. As the Court explains, this existing model, designed precisely for this problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise." (Kennedy, J., concurring, pp.&amp;nbsp;3, 4)

=== Dissenting opinions ===
[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|left|185px| Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote a stern dissent disagreeing with the Court's reasoning.]]
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] delivered the primary dissent, which was joined by Justice Sotomayor in full and by Justices Breyer and Kagan as to all but Part III–C–1&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt; on "whether a corporation qualifies as a 'person' capable of exercising religion".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp 72–73]&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsburg began, "In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.&amp;nbsp;... Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least when there is a 'less restrictive alternative.' And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religion-based exemption, the government, i.e., the general public, can pick up the tab."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp. 60–61]&lt;/ref&gt;

She challenged the majority's unprecedented view of for-profit religion saying "Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized a for-profit corporation's qualification for a religious exemption from a generally applicable law, whether under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA. The absence of such precedent is just what one would expect, for the exercise of religion is characteristic of natural persons, not artificial legal entities...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations commonly are not drawn from one religious community."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 75]&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the majority's argument that the government should "assume the cost" of contraceptives, Ginsburg said that "the nation's only dedicated source of federal funding for safety net family planning services&amp;nbsp;..." is not designed to absorb the unmet needs of those already insured. She noted that "a less restrictive alternative" has not been written into law by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp. 87–88]&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsburg warns, "The Court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp. 93–94]&lt;/ref&gt;

Justices Breyer and Kagan wrote a one-paragraph dissenting opinion, saying that "the plaintiffs' challenge to the contraceptive coverage requirement fails on the merits" and that they "need not and do not decide whether either for-profit corporations or their owners may bring claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/scotusblog-reports-closely-held-corporations-cannot-be-required-to-provide-contraception-coverage/ |title=Hobby Lobby wins before the Supreme Court |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=June 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pro-choice]] and civil-liberties groups criticized the ruling. [[Cecile Richards]], president of the [[Planned Parenthood Action Fund]], said, "Today, the Supreme Court ruled against American women and families, giving bosses the right to discriminate against women and deny their employees access to birth control coverage.

In an editorial, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' called the decision "a setback for both the ACA's foundational goal of access to universal health care and for women's health care specifically", voicing concern that "in assessing the competing claims about abortion and birth control, the Court's majority focused on the religious claims of the corporations without discussing scientific or medical opinions."&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = N Engl J Med |vauthors=Annas GJ, Ruger TW, Ruger JP | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle1408081 | title = Money, Sex, and Religion — The Supreme Court's ACA Sequel | year = 2014 | doi=10.1056/NEJMhle1408081 | volume=371 |issue=9 | pages=862–866 | pmid=25029337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[JAMA Internal Medicine]]'', [[Alta Charo]] wrote that "consistent with a disturbing trend among courts and legislatures to misstate or misuse scientific information in the context of women's [[reproductive rights]] and health, the Supreme Court's decision ignored the well-accepted distinction between contraception and abortion."&lt;ref name="jama"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | author = Charo RA | authorlink = Alta Charo | year = 2014 | url = http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1888557 | title = Conscience, Complicity, and Contraception | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.4200 | volume=174 | page=1537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], representing 90% of U.S. board-certified gynecologists, supported a bill to overturn the ''Hobby Lobby'' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bassett|first1=Laura|title=Major Doctors' Group Endorses Hobby Lobby Override Bill|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/14/major-doctors-group-endor_0_n_5585018.html|accessdate=Jul 16, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=Jul 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
[[White House]] spokesman [[Josh Earnest]] said, "Congress needs to take action to solve this problem that's been created and the administration stands ready to work with them to do so. President Obama believes that women should make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their bosses deciding for them. Today's decision jeopardizes the health of women that are employed by these companies."&lt;ref name=MaggieFox/&gt;

Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] (D-Nev.) said, "If the Supreme Court will not protect women's access to health care, then Democrats will. We will continue to fight to preserve women's access to contraceptive coverage and keep bosses out of the examination room."&lt;ref name=HaberkornGerstein/&gt;

Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY), who introduced the RFRA in 1993, said his law "was not intended to extend the same protection to for-profit corporations, whose very purpose is to profit from the open market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Kristina|title=Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby Ruling Ignites Debate Over Religious-Freedom Law|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-courts-hobby-lobby-ruling-ignites-debate-over-religious-freedom-law-1404155510|accessdate=Jun 30, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=Jun 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]] (R-Ohio) said, "The mandate overturned today would have required for-profit companies to choose between violating their constitutionally-protected faith or paying crippling fines, which would have forced them to lay off employees or close their doors."&lt;ref name=Carmon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carmon|first1=Irin|title=Supreme Court rules for Hobby Lobby in contraception case|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hobby-lobby-supreme-court-wins-narrow-ruling|accessdate=Jun 30, 2014|work=msnbc|date=Jun 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

House minority leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-CA) said, "Although the Court restricted their ruling to 'closely held' companies, this ruling will immediately affect the lives of millions of women across the country.

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah) said, "I applaud the Supreme Court's decision to protect the religious freedom of all Americans, both individually and collectively. The notion that religious freedom belongs only to some, and even then only in private, defies our nation's traditions, our laws, and our Constitution. And as the Supreme Court rightfully said today, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could not have been clearer in saying religious liberty of all Americans must be equally protected and not unnecessarily burdened."&lt;ref name=DeVogue/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Cases following SCOTUS ruling===
''[[Forbes]]'' reported that following the ruling in ''Burwell v. Hobby Lobby'', "the Supreme Court vacated the judgment against [[Eden Foods]] and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for further consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/07/03/hobby-lobby-fallout-catholic-soy-milk-mogul-wont-cover-drugs-that-prevent-procreation/|title=Hobby Lobby Fallout: Catholic Soy Milk Mogul Won't Cover Drugs That 'Prevent Procreation'|last=O'Connor|first=Clare|date=3 July 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2015 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided it will hear arguments for the case of ''[[Zubik v.

===Wheaton College order===
On July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court granted a temporary exemption to the approach it suggested as a less restrictive alternative in ''Hobby Lobby,'' where the plaintiffs would send a form ([[EBSA Form 700]])&lt;ref name=form700&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc EBSA Form 700: Certification for Safe Harbor Exemption from Contraceptive Coverage Mandate]&lt;/ref&gt; to its insurance issuer, which would pay for the contraception. In an unsigned emergency injunction for [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in Illinois, the court said that instead of notifying its insurance issuer, Wheaton can notify the government. Once notified, the government should notify the issuer. Wheaton believed that by transferring the obligation to cover contraceptives to its insurance issuer, it was triggering that obligation. The emergency injunction does not constitute a ruling on the merits of Wheaton's religious objection. The court said "Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the applicant's employees and students to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13a1284_ap6c.pdf Order in Pending Case, Wheaton College v. Bruwell, On Application for Injunction], July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 15-page dissent joined by the other two women on the court, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] criticized the majority's reasoning: "Wheaton's application comes nowhere near the high bar necessary to warrant an emergency injunction from this court&amp;nbsp;... The court's actions in this case create unnecessary costs and layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth: The government must be allowed to handle the basic tasks of public administration in a manner that comports with common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Birth Control Order Deepens Divide Among Justices|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/us/politics/supreme-court-order-suspends-contraception-rule-for-christian-college.html|accessdate=Jul 3, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=Jul 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor granted a similar temporary injunction to the [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] at the end of 2013, just before the mandate was to go into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bazelon|first1=Emily|title=Did Little Sisters of the Poor Win or Lose at the Supreme Court?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/01/little_sisters_of_the_poor_case_supreme_court_grants_a_temporary_reprieve.single.html|accessdate=Jul 6, 2014|work=Slate|date=Jan 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/012414zr_6jgm.pdf Supreme Court order]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/13A691-Little-Sisters-v-Sebelius-Order.pdf order from Sotomayor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In dueling commentaries between regular [[SCOTUSblog]] contributor [[Marty Lederman]] and co-founder [[Tom Goldstein]], Lederman argued that only Form 700 can require an insurance provider to pay for contraception coverage. Goldstein argued that an existing regulation allows the government to specify an alternative to Form 700. He pointed out that "the Court didn't accept Wheaton's most aggressive argument" that it cannot be required to do anything. He said that Justice Kennedy's concurrence is controlling and makes clear that the RFRA is not violated by requiring Wheaton to notify the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Tom|title=Commentary: Why I don't think the Court's Wheaton College decision rests on any misunderstanding of the law|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/07/commentary-why-i-dont-think-the-courts-wheaton-college-decision-rests-on-any-misunderstanding-of-the-law/|accessdate=Jul 15, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog|date=Jul 4, 2014 &lt;!-- 11:53 AM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lederman|first1=Marty|title=Commentary: Is the Court's attempt at a compromise order in Wheaton College based upon a misunderstanding of the law?|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/07/commentary-is-the-courts-attempt-at-a-compromise-order-in-wheaton-college-based-upon-a-misunderstanding-of-the-law/|accessdate=Jul 15, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog|date=Jul 4, 2014 &lt;!-- 11:52 AM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revised version of EBSA Form 700, effective August 2014, says "[a]s an alternative to using this form, an eligible organization may provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the eligible organization has a religious objection to providing coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name=form700/&gt;

===Religious exemption from laws that apply to the general public===
Although the court stated clearly that the decision is limited to the contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p.&amp;nbsp;4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. [[Walter Dellinger]], former acting solicitor general said, "for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else." Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care.&lt;ref name=Reach&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Ruling Could Have Reach Beyond Issue of Contraception|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/us/contraception-ruling-could-have-reach-far-beyond-womens-rights.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the dissenting opinion, [[The American Prospect]] asked, "[W]ill the taxpayers have to send a check to employees if employers feel that [[minimum wage]] laws violate their religious beliefs?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemieux|first1=Scott|title=5 Men on Supreme Court Impose Substantial Burden on Women in Illogical Decision|url=http://prospect.org/article/5-men-supreme-court-impose-substantial-burden-women-illogical-decision|accessdate=Jul 3, 2014|work=The American Prospect|date=Jun 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Rauch]], a senior fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]], said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; The [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] (NGLT) and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] withdrew their support for the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the ''Hobby Lobby'' ruling. NGLT executive director [[Rea Carey]] said, "We do not take this move lightly. We've been pushing for this bill for 20 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Ed|title=Gay rights group withdrawing support of ENDA after Hobby Lobby decision|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/08/gay-rights-group-withdrawing-support-of-enda-after-hobby-lobby-decision/|accessdate=Jul 8, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=Jul 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such concerns are focused on the court's application of the federal RFRA law and were driven by national controversy over a [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts|state RFRA]] amendment bill in Arizona. Douglas Laycock, law professor at the University of Virginia, said, "The whole secular left has decided" that RFRA laws "are very dangerous because they care so much more about the contraception cases and gay rights." He said RFRA laws are mischaracterized because they do not dictate outcomes favoring religious objectors, they only require courts to use the highest standard of scrutiny on any law challenged.&lt;ref name=Reach/&gt; Mark Kernes, Senior Editor and Chief Legal Analyst for [[AVN magazine]] stated in an [[op-ed]] piece, "If the Hobby Lobby decision supports the 'right' of companies not to make available birth control that will prevent women from 'catching' a pregnancy, what's to keep those same religious companies from arguing that providing access to [[pre-exposure prophylaxis|PrEP]] drugs like [[Truvada]], which help prevent gays (and, admittedly, everyone) from catching [[HIV]] shouldn't similarly be excluded from their health plans?"&lt;ref name=2014AVNTruvada&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernes|first1=Mark|title=Will the Hobby Lobby Decision Impact the Availability of Truvada?|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Will-the-Hobby-Lobby-Decision-Impact-the-Availability-of-Truvada-565669.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imposition of religious beliefs onto others===
Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the [[National Women's Law Center]], said that the Supreme Court has never ruled that companies have religious beliefs and that "it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties." Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom "gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give you the right to impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; The editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the decision "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=The Editorial Board|title=Limiting Rights: Imposing Religion on Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/opinion/the-supreme-court-imposing-religion-on-workers.html|accessdate=Jul 2, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=Jun 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] columnist wrote, "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees?

[[Welton Gaddy]] said, "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used to protect the rights of minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom."&lt;ref name=Boorstein/&gt;

Scholars on the other side (including some on the left){{citation needed|date=July 2017}} disagree, arguing that companies owned and run by liberals will likewise benefit from the freedom to operate according to their conscience or values—which has not been viewed as "imposing" views, because people routinely choose whom to associate with based on philosophical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;

===Corporate liability===
''[[New York Times]]'' editor Dorothy J. Samuels invoked the cautionary adage "be careful what you wish for", speculating that "if owners indicate that they are not entirely separate from their corporation—by denying corporation employees' birth control coverage based on their personal religious beliefs—the case could be made in future state-court litigation that they have waived their right to be shielded from responsibility for corporate financial liabilities."&lt;ref name=Samuels&gt;{{cite news|last1=J.

'''Charismatic authority''' is a concept about leadership that was developed by the German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. It involves a type of [[organization]] or a type of [[leadership]] in which [[authority]] derives from the [[charisma]] of the leader. This stands in contrast to two other types of authority: [[legal authority]] and [[traditional authority]]. Each of the three types forms part of [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]].

"Charisma" is an ancient Greek term that initially gained prominence through Saint Paul's letters to the emerging Christian communities in the first century. In this context, it generally referred to a divinely-originating "gift" that demonstrated the authority of God within the early leaders of the Church. [[Max Weber]] took this theological notion and generalized it, viewing it as something that followers attribute, thereby opening it up for use by [[sociologist]]s who applied it to political, military, celebrity, and non-Christian religious contests.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms used are "charismatic domination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o12f99.htm Power, Domination, Legitimation, and Authority] Sociology 250 Retrieved October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and "charismatic leadership".&lt;ref&gt;
Adair-Toteff,  Christopher, ''Max Weber’s Charisma'', ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', Vol. 5, No. 2, 189-204 (2005)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

===Charisma===
Weber applies the term [[charisma]] to 
{{quote|[A] certain quality of an individual personality, by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These are such as are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader ... How the quality in question would be ultimately judged from an ethical, aesthetic, or other such point of view is naturally indifferent for the purpose of definition.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Maximillan. ''Theory of Social and Economic Organization.'' Chapter: "The Nature of Charismatic Authority and its Routinization" translated by A. R. Anderson and [[Talcott Parsons]], 1947. Originally published in 1922 in German under the title [http://www.textlog.de/7415.html ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'' chapter III, § 10] (available online)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Original German: "»Charisma« soll eine als außeralltäglich (ursprünglich, sowohl bei Propheten wie bei therapeutischen wie bei Rechts-Weisen wie bei Jagdführern wie bei Kriegshelden: als magisch bedingt) geltende Qualität einer Persönlichkeit heißen, um derentwillen sie als mit übernatürlichen oder übermenschlichen oder mindestens spezifisch außeralltäglichen, nicht jedem andern zugänglichen Kräften oder Eigenschaften oder als gottgesandt oder als vorbildlich und deshalb als »Führer« gewertet wird."}}}}

===Legitimization===
Charismatic authority is often the most lasting of regimes because the leader is seen as infallible and any action against him will be seen as a crime against the state. Charismatic leaders eventually develop a [[cult of personality]] often not by their own doing. 
{{quote|[P]ower legitimized on the basis of a leader's exceptional personal qualities or the demonstration of extraordinary insight and accomplishment, which inspire loyalty and obedience from followers.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Diana, Jane Lothian Murray, and Rick Linden. ''Sociology in our time'' (2nd ed.), 2000. Scarborough, On: Nelson, 438-439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leadership is the power to diffuse a positive energy and a sense of greatness. As such, it rests almost entirely on the [[leadership|leader]]. The absence of that leader for any reason can lead to the authority's power dissolving. However, due to its idiosyncratic nature and lack of formal [[organization]], charismatic authority depends much more strongly on the perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority than Weber's other forms of authority. For instance, a charismatic leader in a [[religion|religious]] context might require an unchallenged [[belief]] that the leader has been touched by [[God]], in the sense of a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousauthority/a/types_2.htm Charismatic Authority: Emotional Bonds Between Leaders and Followers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Should the strength of this belief fade, the power of the charismatic leader can fade quickly, which is one of the ways in which this form of authority shows itself to be unstable.

In contrast to the current popular use of the term ''charismatic leader'', Weber saw charismatic authority not so much as character traits of the charismatic leader but as a relationship between the leader and his followers. The validity of [[charism]] is founded on its "recognition" by the leader's followers (or "adepts" - ''Anhänger''). 
His charisma risks disappearing if he is "abandoned by God" or if "his government doesn't provide any prosperity to those whom he dominates".{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A Weber-style charismatic leader need not be a positive force;&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology'' By Jens Beckert, Milan Zafirovski, Published by Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-28673-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-28673-2}}, pag. 53&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] qualify. Furthermore, sociology is [[axiology|axiologically]] neutral (''Wertfreie Soziologie'') towards various forms of charismatic domination: it does not differentiate between the charisma of a [[Berserker]], of a [[shaman]] or of that displayed by [[Kurt Eisner]]. For Weber, sociology considers these types of charismatic domination in "an identical manner to the charisma of [[hero]]es, prophets, the "greatest saviours according to common appreciation".}}

=== Routinizing charisma ===
Charismatic authority almost always endangers the boundaries set by [[traditional authority|traditional]] (coercive) or [[Rational-legal authority|rational]] (legal) authority. It tends to challenge this authority, and is thus often seen as [[revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/weber_links.html WEBER LINKS page http&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426080033/http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/weber_links.html |date=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, Seth D. "Religion; the modern theories" University of Edinburgh 2003 {{ISBN|0-7486-1522-9}} page 40&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this charismatic authority is incorporated into society. Hereby the challenge that it presents to society will subside. The way in which this happens is called ''routinization''.

By routinization,  the charismatic authority changes: 
{{quote|[C]harismatic authority is succeeded by a bureaucracy controlled by a rationally established authority or by a combination of traditional and bureaucratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Beeghley, and Powers, 1995 cited in Kendal et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A religion which evolves its own [[priesthood]] and establishes a set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another type of authority. For example, [[Muhammad]], who had charismatic authority as "The Prophet" among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of [[Islam]], a clear example of routinization.

In politics, charismatic rule is often found in various [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian states]], [[Autocracy|autocracies]], [[dictatorship]]s and [[Theocracy|theocracies]]. To help to maintain their charismatic authority, such regimes will often establish a vast [[personality cult]]. When the leader of such a state dies or leaves office, and a new charismatic leader does not appear, such a regime is likely to fall shortly thereafter, unless it has become fully routinized.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology'' By Jens Beckert, Milan Zafirovski, Published by Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-28673-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-28673-2}}, pag. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charismatic succession==
Because the [[authority]] is concentrated in one leader, the death of the charismatic leader would constitute the destruction of the government unless prior arrangements were made. A society that faces the end of their charismatic leader can choose to move to another format of [[leadership]] or to have a transference of charismatic authority to another leader by means of succession.

According to Max Weber, the methods of succession are: search, revelation, designation by original leader, designation by qualified staff, hereditary charisma, and office charisma.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}} These are the various ways in which an individual and a society can contrive to maintain the unique energy and nature of charisma in their leadership.

===Search===
"The search for a new charismatic leader (takes place) on the basis of the qualities which will fit him for the position of [[authority]]." An example of this search method is the search for a new [[Dalai Lama]]. "It consists in a search for a child with characteristics which are interpreted to mean that he is a [[reincarnation]] of the [[Buddha]]." This search is an example of the way in which an original charismatic leader can be made to "live on" through a replacement.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Revelation===
"In this case the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of selection." The technique of selection is the ''modus operandi'' of the selection process. In ancient times, [[oracles]] were believed to have special access to "divine judgment" and thus their technique in selection was perceived to be [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]]. Their choice was imbued with the charismatic authority that came with the oracle's endorsement.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Designation by original leader===
In this form, the original holder of charismatic authority is perceived to have passed their authority to another. An excellent example is [[Joseph Stalin]]'s claim that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had designated him to be his successor as leader of the USSR. Insofar as people believed in this claim, Stalin gained Lenin's charismatic authority.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Designated by qualified staff===
"A successor (may be designated) by the charismatically qualified administrative staff... (T)his process should not be interpreted as 'election' or 'nomination'... It is not determined by merely a majority vote...Unanimity (is) often required." A case example of this form of succession is the [[papal conclave]] of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] to choose a new [[pope]]. The cardinals taking part in the papal conclave are viewed to be charismatically qualified by their [[Roman Catholic]] congregations and thus their choice is imbued with charismatic authority.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Hereditary charisma===
Charisma can be perceived as "a quality transmitted by heredity". This method of succession is present in [[Kim il Sung]]'s charisma being passed on to his son, [[Kim Jong Il]]. This type of succession is a difficult undertaking and often results in a movement toward [[Traditional authority|traditionalization]] and [[Rational-legal authority|legalization]] in [[authority]].{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-B}}{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-D}}

===Office charisma===
"The concept of charisma may be transmitted by [[ritual]] means from one bearer to another...It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular individual, making it an objective, transferable entity." [[Consecration|Priestly consecration]] is believed to be a modus through which priestly charisma to teach and perform other priestly duties is transferred to a person. In this way, [[priest]]s inherit priestly charisma and are subsequently perceived by their congregations as having the charismatic authority that comes with the priesthood.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

==Application of Weber's theories==
Weber's model of charismatic leadership giving way to institutionalization is endorsed by several academic sociologists.

===New religious movements===
[[Eileen Barker]] discusses the tendency for [[new religious movement]]s to have founders or leaders who wield considerable charismatic authority and are believed to have special powers or knowledge.  Charismatic leaders are unpredictable, Barker says, for they are not bound by tradition or rules and they may be accorded by their followers the right to pronounce on all aspects of their lives. Barker warns that in these cases the leader may lack any accountability, require unquestioning obedience, and encourage a dependency upon the movement for material, spiritual and social resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, {{ISBN|0-11-340927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] asserts that not all new religious movements have charismatic leaders, and that there are differences in the hegemonic styles among those movements that do.&lt;ref&gt;[[George D. Chryssides|Chryssides, George D.]] ''Unrecognized charisma? A study and comparison of four charismatic leaders: Charles Taze Russell, Joseph Smith, L Ron Hubbard, Swami Prabhupada.'' Paper presented at the 2001 International Conference The Spiritual Supermarket: Religious Pluralism in the 21st Century, organised by [[INFORM]] and [[CESNUR]] (London, April 19–22, 2001). [http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/chryssides.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism==
[[Len Oakes]], an [[Australia]]n psychologist who wrote a [[dissertation]] about charisma, had eleven charismatic leaders fill in a psychometric test, which he called the ''adjective checklist'', and found them as a group quite ordinary. Following the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Heinz Kohut]], Oakes argues that charismatic leaders exhibit traits of [[narcissism]] and also argues that they display an extraordinary amount of energy, accompanied by an inner clarity unhindered by the anxieties and guilt that afflict more ordinary people. He did however not fully follow Weber's framework of charismatic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Len: ''Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-8156-0398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:dickens-common-serjeant.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Henry Fielding Dickens|Henry Dickens]], [[Queen's Counsel|KC]], Common Serjeant of London 1917 – 1932]]
The '''Common Serjeant of London''' (full title '''The Serjeant-at-Law in the Common Hall''') is an ancient British [[Law|legal office]], first recorded in 1291, and is the second most senior permanent judge of the [[Old Bailey|Central Criminal Court]] after the [[Recorder of London]], acting as deputy to that office, and sitting as a judge in the trial of criminal offences.

He is also one of the High Officers of the [[City of London Corporation]], and must undertake certain civic obligations alongside his judicial duties: each Midsummer he presides at the election of [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Sheriffs]] in the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and each Michaelmas he plays a key role in the ceremonial election of the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterconservators.org/uploaded_files/.../ElectionofLordMayor.pdf Order of Ceremonial, 2013]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He presents the Sheriffs to the [[Queen's Remembrancer]] at the annual [[Quit Rents ceremony]], and is in attendance on most other major ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jac.judiciary.gov.uk/static/documents/Job_Description_00739.DOC Job description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521033313/http://jac.judiciary.gov.uk/static/documents/Job_Description_00739.DOC |date=21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Common Serjeant is appointed by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Crown]] on the recommendation of the [[Lord Chancellor]]. 

Formerly, the Common Serjeant of London was a legal officer of the City Corporation of London.  The Common Serjeant of London attended on the [[Lord Mayor of London]] and the [[Court of Aldermen]] on court days, and acted with them in council. He also attended the Court of Aldermen and [[City of London Corporation#Court of Common Council|Common Council]], and had charge of the Orphans' Estates&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Dignities: Containing Rolls of the Official Personages of the British Empire ... from the Earliest Periods to the Present Time ... Together with the Sovereigns of Europe, from the Foundation of Their Respective States; the Peerage of England and Great Britain ... by Joseph Haydn and Joseph Timothy Haydn Published by Longmans, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1851
&lt;/ref&gt;

The 81st incumbent is His Honour Judge Richard Marks, QC, who was appointed on 3 March 2015.

The '''Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters''' is a convention to facilitate the entering into bilateral [[tax information exchange agreement]]s between state parties. The Convention was developed by the [[OECD]] and the [[Council of Europe]] and was open for signature to members of both organizations on 25 January 1988, and entered into force in 1995. 

An amending protocol was concluded on 27 May 2010, which since coming into force became open to any state at the invitation of present state parties.

==Ratifications==
The Convention as well as the amending protocol entered into force upon the ratification of five members. 

As of September 2018, one state (the United States) is a party to the original convention only, 26 states have ratified the original 1995 convention and the amending protocol, while 65 others are parties to the amended convention. The table below shows between whom the convention applies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8396">The term "'''debellatio'''" or "'''debellation'''" ([[Latin]] "defeating, or the act of conquering or subduing", literally, "warring (the enemy) down", from Latin ''bellum'' "war") designates the end of war caused by complete destruction of a hostile [[Sovereign state|state]]. Israeli law-school professor [[Eyal Benvenisti]] defines it as "a situation in which a party to a conflict has been totally defeated in war, its national institutions have disintegrated, and none of its allies continue to challenge the enemy militarily on its behalf".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Eyal |last=Benvenisti|title=The International Law of Occupation |date=2012 |publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958889-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgeX_sdQG0C&amp;pg=PA161 161]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases debellation ends with a complete dissolution and [[annexation]] of the defeated state into the victor's national territory, as happened at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] with the defeat of Carthage by Rome in the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref&gt;"No European state had come to an end, as Germany had, with a 'debellatio', with the dissolution of the enemy state by the victor, a term familiar from Roman history: after three terrible wars, Rome completely annihilated Carthage by means of a 'debellatio'."

The [[unconditional surrender]] of the [[Nazi Germany]]—in the strict sense only the [[Wehrmacht|German Armed Forces]]—at the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] was at the time accepted by most authorities as a case of debellatio as it ended with the complete breakup of the [[German Reich]],&lt;ref name=Benvenisti&gt;Eyal Benvenisti, ''The international law of occupation'', Princeton University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-691-12130-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lcVOlb0wefwC&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;ots=Um0uRsvKCN&amp;dq=hague%20conventions%20occupation%20of%20Germany%20Debellatio&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=Most%20of%20the%20authorities%20link&amp;f=false pp. 92-95]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breven C.

{{Wiktionary}}[[Image:46-aspetti di vita quotidiana, discrezione,Taccuino Sanitati.jpg|thumb|250px|Discretion, [[Tacuinum Sanitatis]] casanatensis (XIV secolo)]]
'''Discretion''' has the meaning of acting on one's own authority and judgement. In law, discretion as to legal rulings, such as whether evidence is excluded at a trial, may be exercised by a judge. Some view discretion negatively, while some view it positively. Discretion exists at all levels of law enforcement and in many types of [[front-line bureaucrat]]s. Discretion has been called "the Art of suiting action to particular circumstances" ([[Lord Scarman]]). Those in a position of [[Power (sociology)|power]] are most often able to exercise discretion as to how they will apply or exercise that power. The ability to make decisions which represent a responsible choice and for which an understanding of what is lawful, right or wise may be presupposed. &lt;ref&gt;See Websters Third New International Dictionary (unabridged).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In law==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
In the legal system, discretion is often defined as the ability of a judge to choose where, how and with what severity to sentence a person who has been convicted. A person chooses to utilize his or her options and decides which to use, whether this is a police officer arresting a person on the street (criminal) or evicting someone from an apartment (civil) or anywhere in between.&lt;ref name="Justifications, Powers, and Authority"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorburn|first1=Malcolm|title=Justifications, Powers, and Authority.|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=Apr 2008|volume= 117|issue= 6|pages=1070–1130|doi=10.2307/20454675}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are some arguments that implementing discretion overrules or weakens the rule of law. However, laws cannot be written without using discretion and therefore the rule of law serves to guide discretion towards societal expectations, norms and, at least in part, public interest&lt;ref name="Shane, Peter M"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shane|first1=Peter M|title=THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INEVITABILITY OF DISCRETION.|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|date=Winter 2013|volume=36|issue=1|pages=21–28|url=https://hal.weber.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=85163775&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=29 October 2014|ref=THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INEVITABILITY OF DISCRETION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal===
The term ''[[crime]]'' is defined as an action that is by law, banned or restricted and enforced via Punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merriam-Webster|title=Crime|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crime|website=Merriam-Webster.com.|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, where law ends and discretion begins lies in implementing those laws. The enforcers, [[police officers]], are tasked with enforcing these regulations, but they often have the discretion of when to file charges and arrest. For example, a traffic violation, the police officer may simply issue a [[warning (traffic stop)|warning]]. In fact discretion can be found in all stages of the [[criminal justice]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorburn|first1=Malcolm|title=Justifications, Powers, and Authority.|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=Apr 2008|volume=117|issue=6|pages=1070–1130|doi=10.2307/20454675}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The victim, has the discretion to use [[self defense]] and to report the crime given the opportunity. The Dispatch officer decides the priority of the call, an officer responding has discretion to take statements from [[witnesses]] as well as detain potential [[suspect]]s. The suspect/the accused has the discretion to obtain a [[lawyer]], how they will plead and to accept a [[plea bargain]]. The [[prosecutor]] has the choice (''prosecutorial discretion'') to prosecute a case or drop the charges as well as suggesting [[plea bargain]]s. The [[judge]] has discretion every time an objection is raised or [[evidence]] is given. The [[jury]] has discretion over the final verdict. These examples are only a small cross section of the chain of choices that is criminal law.

[[File:US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest.jpg|thumb|Police Officer making an arrest]]

===Environmental ===
One article shows that when officers respond to a [[call for service]], if an area has a high rate of Black or wealthy citizens then it significantly affects the officers' decision to downgrade a crime or incident reported. Officers' experience in different surroundings affect the way they react to service calls. The economic status, poverty level, race and ethnicity influence the officer and how he sees and reacts to his surroundings. Scholar Michael Banton stated that "In different neighborhoods police provide different services". This is a good example of how and why police are able to use discretion in the performance of their duties. Different environments and neighborhoods provide different levels of dangers and greater levels of crime taking place than others. Which is why an officer might choose to downgrade a crime in a wealthy neighborhood compared to an economically unstable one. The article also states that merely being in a different environment from the one the officer lives in or is accustomed to forces the officer to treat it differently. 

Thus, the officer would then treat the individuals differently. This can be an argument either for or against police using discretion. On the one hand, all people should be treated equally regardless of race or economic status. On the other hand, officer and public safety are the most important duties for an officer. If an officer can recognize that a certain area requires a different approach in order to keep that safety, they should use that discretion appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lum (2011) The Influence of Places on Police Decision Pathways: From
Call for Service to Arrest, Justice Quarterly, 28:4, 631-665&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdräkt, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Prosecutor at work]]

===Civil===
In [[civil law (common law)|civil]] actions, judges and juries are also deemed to have discretion in the matter of [[damages]]. Judges also have discretion in the grant or denial of certain [[motion (legal)|motions]], e.g. a motion for a [[continuance]]. Prosecutors have a huge discretional role in the criminal justice process. They have the ability to initiate and terminate all criminal prosecutions. They have to use discretion to weigh the rights of the accused, the feelings of the victim, and the capacity of prisons when determining a proper punishment. Prosecutors control plea bargains and thus have possibly the most discretion-based role in the criminal justice process. If they believe a person deserves to be in prison, they will pursue that route, knowing that the prisons are very full and would then lead to a person being released early without serving his full sentence.&lt;ref&gt;MISNER, RL. RECASTING PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION. Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology. 86, 3, 717, 1996. {{ISSN|0091-4169}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse===
It is often hard to control officers' use of discretion because of the way it is applied to situations. "Policing the police" is a very important part in maintaining a balance of police discretion and controlling it so the power of discretion is not abused. Unfortunately, the police have an ability to perform an abuse of discretion without being noticed or regulated by the judicial or legislative community in what is referred to as the "legal shadow". In this place questionable police tactics are being performed and, in a sense, covered up with police privilege backed by government support. Although there has been some effort by the federal government to regulate police discretion, unless there is a conflict including the Constitution, it is difficult for them to involve themselves. Most of the time police misconduct doesn't draw enough attention to include federal intervention.&lt;ref&gt;JAROS, DM. PREEMPTING THE POLICE. Boston College Law Review. 55, 4, 1149-1195, Sept. 2014. {{ISSN|0161-6587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of discretion by [[judge]]s is an inherent aspect of [[judicial independence]] under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. The [[standard of review]] applied to [[appeal]]s from decisions involving the exercise of [[judicial discretion]] is "[[abuse of discretion]]."

"An abuse of discretion is a failure to take into proper consideration the facts and law relating to a particular matter; an arbitrary or unreasonable departure from precedent and settled judicial custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://answers.encyclopedia.com/question/definition-abuse-discretion-344834.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718005708/http://answers.encyclopedia.com/question/definition-abuse-discretion-344834.html |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal of an exercise of judicial discretion, "abuse of discretion" is a standard of review requiring the appellate court to find that the lower court's decision would "shock the conscience" of a reasonable person in order to reverse the decision below.

==Positive use==
Studies show that police officers use discretion to simplify their very complex job requirements and also to identify certain individual priorities, as each officer has to apply the very broad and often contradictory laws put into place by statutes and policymakers. If officers had to cite or make an arrest on every law being broken, we would need a police officer for every 2-3 citizens. We leave it up to the individual officer to use discretion in cases where a gray area resides. Should an officer ticket every person that speeds? Where do they draw the line? This is one of many situations where discretion comes into place. There are other things that contribute to the individual officer's use of their discretion. Often the sex or minority status of an officer would lead them to act in different ways and use discretion in different ways than that of the opposite. Where an officer was raised or what they have experienced would lead them to react to scenarios differently.

Not all discretionary usage by law enforcement is negative. They often use it so that they can simplify and weed out the true criminals from the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;LAFRANCE, TC. Targeting discretion: an exploration of organisational communication between rank levels in a medium-sized Southern US police department. International Journal of Police Science &amp; Management. 13, 2, 158-171, 2011. {{ISSN|1461-3557}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contexts==
The term often comes as part of "Viewer Discretion Is Advised" warning on TV shows before the show begins. In this context, VDA implies the show's content may not be suitable for younger viewers; that is, too explicit in terms of nudity, violence, sexual content, or language. From the book of Proverbs "like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion."

'''Dock Work Convention, 1973''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]].

It was established in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Considering that important changes have taken place and are taking place in cargo-handling methods in docks—such as the adoption of unit loads, the introduction of roll-on roll-off techniques and the increase of mechanisation and automation—and in the pattern of movement of freight, and that such changes are expected to become more widespread in the future,...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Ratifications==
As of 2013, the convention has been ratified by 25 states, with the most recent ratification being completed by the [[Russian Federation]] in 2004. One of the ratifying states, the [[Netherlands]], has denounced the treaty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13258">In the [[United States of America]], the '''Equal Access to Justice Act''' (EAJA) authorizes the payment of [[attorney's fees]] to a prevailing party in an action against the United States absent a showing by the government that its position in the underlying litigation "was substantially justified."  The Act is codified in scattered sections of the United States Code:
* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/504 5 U. S. C. § 504] provides that an agency that conducts an adversary adjudication against a prevailing party (as "party" is defined) shall pay the fees and expenses of the party, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified.   ("adversary adjudication" is defined as a formal trial-type ''ex parte'' proceeding in which the agency is adverse to the party, and governed by 5 U. S. C. § 554 "trial type" proceedings, as opposed to an ''inter partes'' proceeding in which the agency adjudicates a dispute between two parties, or the less-formal proceedings of § 555)
* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U. S. C. §2412] provides that the agency shall pay attorney fees of a prevailing party in a court case against the agency, unless the court finds that the agency position was substantially justified.

Each is subject to multiple conditions, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412|Section 2412(d)(1)] for court fees requires:
* a short time deadline after the favorable final judgment (see [[Equal_Access_to_Justice_Act#Time for Filing|Time for Filing]]), including a statement of "the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney ... stating the actual time expended and the rate" charged.
* a showing that the applicant is a "prevailing party"
* a showing that the applicant is "eligible to receive an award"
* a limit on the net worth of the party  (see [[Equal_Access_to_Justice_Act#Net worth|Net worth]])
* an allegation that "the position of the United States was not substantially justified" (see [[Equal_Access_to_Justice_Act#Substantial Justification and Special Circumstances|Substantial Justification and Special Circumstances]])
[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=02-1657 Scarborough v. Principi, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004).]

== Time for filing ==
An applicant for attorney's fees under the EAJA must file an application within thirty days of the final judgment in the civil action.  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d) (1) (B).]   [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=02-1657 Scarborough, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004).]   However, an EAJA application may be filed until thirty days after a judgment becomes “not appealable.”  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412 (d) (1) (B) and (d) (2) (G).]  In some instances when an agency of the United States is a party in this case, a notice of appeal may be filed within 60 days of entry of the judgment.  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rules.html Fed. R. App. P. 4 (a) (1).]  [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=509&amp;invol=292 Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292 (1993).]  See [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=501&amp;invol=89 Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U.S. 89 (1991).]

== Net worth ==
A party must meet the threshold requirement of having a net worth not in excess of $7,000,000 for any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization.  Or, $2,000,000 at the time the action was filed for an individual.  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U. S. C. §2412(d)(2)(B))].

== Substantial Justification and Special Circumstances ==
The court must determine whether “the position of the United States was substantially justified or . . . special circumstances make an award unjust.”  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U.S.C. §2412 (d) (1) (A).] The government has the burden of proving its action is substantially justified or that circumstances make an award of attorney's fees unjust.  [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=02-1657 Scarborough v. Principi, 124 S. Ct. 1856 (2004)] citing [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=487&amp;invol=552 Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 567 (1988)]; id., at 575 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Davidson v. Veneman, 317 F. 3d 503, 506 (CA5 2003); Lauer v. Barnhart, 321 F. 3d 762, 764 (CA8 2003); Libas, Ltd. v. United States, 314 F. 3d 1362, 1365 (CA Fed. 2003). See also H. R. Rep. No. 96-1005, at 10 ("[T]he strong deterrents to contesting Government action that currently exis[t] require that the burden of proof rest with the
Government.").

In Pierce, the Supreme Court held that the position of the United States is substantially justified if it is “justified in substance or in the main--that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person."  [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=487&amp;invol=552. Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988).]  The Pierce Court provided further guidance on this standard, noting, ". . . [A] position can be substantially justified even though it is not correct, and we believe that it can be substantially (i.e., for the most part) justified if a reasonable person could think it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact."  Id. at 566 n.2, 108 S. Ct. at 2550 n.2.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] has described the substantial justification standard as requiring that the government show that its position was grounded in "'(1) a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged; (2) a reasonable basis in law for the theory propounded; and (3) a reasonable connection between the facts alleged and the legal theory advanced.'" United States v. Hallmark Constr. Co., 200 F.3d 1076, 1080 (7th Cir. 2000) quoting Phil Smidt &amp; Son, Inc. v. NLRB, 810 F.2d 638, 642 (7th Cir. 1987) quoting Donovan v. DialAmerica Mkting, Inc., 757 F.2d 1376, 1389 (3d Cir. 1985).  Furthermore, some courts have held the “court only needs to find one reason for finding the ALJ was not substantially justified in order to allow EAJA fees . . .”  Mallette v. Sullivan, 1990 WL 19894, *3-*5 (N.D. Il. 1990).

Congress’s inclusion in the EAJA of the substantial justification standard manifests its intent not to permit a prevailing party to automatically recover fees. See Federal Election Commission v. Rose, 806 F.2d 1081, 1087 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  As the Cummings court observed, these two standards of review “are used at different stages and involve different tests.” Cummings v. Sullivan, 950 F.2d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 1991).  A court at the EAJA stage must take a fresh look at the case from an EAJA perspective, and reach a judgment independent from the ultimate merits decision.  Rose, 806 F.2d at 1087-90. Thus, the government’s position may be substantially justified even if its decision was not supported by substantial evidence.

[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=487&amp;invol=552 In Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 (1988)], the Supreme Court held that the government’s position is substantially justified if it is “justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person,” that is, “if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.” Id. at 565-66 &amp; n.2.  The Pierce Court rejected the position that substantial justification requires more than mere reasonableness. Id. 487 U.S. at 567-68. See also Brouwers v. Bowen, 823 F.2d 273, 275 (8th Cir. 1987) (“the substantial justification standard is a lesser standard than the substantial evidence standard used to review administrative determinations”) (citations omitted).

“Substantially justified” does not mean “justified to a high degree,” but rather has been said to be satisfied if there is a “genuine dispute,” or if reasonable people could differ as to the appropriateness of the contested action. Stein v. Sullivan, 966 F.2d 317, 320 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing Pierce, 487 U.S. at 565). Thus, a loss on the merits does not equate with a lack of substantial justification. See Pierce, 487 U.S. at 569 (“[O]bviously, the fact that one other court agreed or disagreed with the Government does not establish whether its position was substantially justified. Conceivably, the Government could take a position that is not substantially justified, yet win; even more likely, it could take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose.”); United States v. Hallmark Construction Company, 200 F.3d 1076, 1080 (7th Cir. 2000).  Thus, a court’s statement in its merits decision that a government agency did not have a “rational ground” for denying benefits does not imply a lack of substantial justification for the agency’s position. Kolman v. Shalala, 39 F.3d 173, 177 (7th Cir. 1994). As the Seventh Circuit explained in Kolman, its statement that the agency did not have a rational ground for its decision was a reference to the test for invalidating agency action; at the EAJA stage, the test is “whether the agency had a rational ground for thinking it had a rational ground for its action.” Kolman, 39 F.3d at 177.

== Reasonableness of the Fee ==
The applicant for EAJA fees has the burden of proving that the fees requested are reasonable.  See [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=461&amp;invol=424 Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983)] (although Hensley dealt with attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the standards which it sets out are applicable generally to attorney's fee cases); [http://supreme.justia.com/us/463/680/case.html Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 691-92 (1983).]

== Amount of Fees ==
Attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125.00 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or other special factors justifies a higher fee.  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) (2) (A).] The movant bears the burden of producing satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate for the kind and quality of legal services rendered. [http://supreme.justia.com/us/465/886/case.html Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 892 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1547 n. 11, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984).]  Applicants for EAJA who claim and provide proof of inflation may be awarded attorney fees at an hourly fee in excess of $125.00 for work beginning after 1996 due to inflation.  Failure to adjust the statutory cap for inflation might be considered an abuse of discretion.  Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army, 820 F.2d 513, 521 (1st Cir. 1987); Trichilo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 823 F.2d 702, 704-07 (2d Cir. 1987); Allen v. Otis Bowen, 821 F.2d 963 (3d Cir. 1987); Ramon-Sepulveda v. INS, 863 F.2d 1458 (9th Cir. 1988); and U.S. v. A Leasehold Interest in Property, 789 F.Supp. 1385, 1394 (E.D. Mich. 1992).

== Costs ==
Some costs may be compensated by the EAJA, including federal court filing fee. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2412 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412 (a) (1) and (a) (2), and (d) (2) (A).]

== Payment of Fees to Litigant and Payment of Government Debts ==
In [http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/08-1322/ Astrue v. Ratliff, 130 S. Ct. 2521 (June 14, 2010)] the Supreme Court unanimously held that an EAJA award is payable to the litigant, not his or her attorney, and is subject to offset to satisfy a pre-existing debt that the litigant owes to the United States.

==Amendments==

===Proposed===
The [[Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act (H.R. 2919; 113th Congress)]] was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on August 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=2919sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2919 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2919|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would amend the Equal Access to Justice Act by requiring the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]] (ACUS) to prepare a report each year on the amount of fees and other expenses awarded by federal courts to nonfederal entities when they prevail in a case against the United States.&lt;ref name="2919sum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbo2919&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 2919|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45145|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geneva Conventions Act 1957''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] that incorporates the provisions of the [[Geneva Convention]] into British law.

One aspect of the Geneva Conventions Act is that it makes wearing the [[Red Cross symbol]] illegal in many circumstances, sometimes with curious consequences. In 2011, a British pantomime costume had to be changed in order to comply with the Geneva Conventions Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/852072-jim-davidsons-panto-breaks-geneva-convention|title=Jim Davidson's pantomime breaks Geneva Convention|publisher=Metro|date=7 January 2011|author=Daniella Graham|accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its provisions were later amended by the [[Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act 1995]] and [[Geneva Conventions and United Nations Personnel (Protocols) Act 2009]].

The '''Grandview Mall Aquarium''', also known as "The Ocean World," is on the sixth floor of [[Grandview Shopping Mall]] ([[Zhengjia Square]]) in the city of [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], [[China]]. The aquarium is considered one of the longest in a shopping mall in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guangzhoutravelguide.com/guangzhou-shopping-mall/guangzhou-grandview-mall.html|title=Guangzhou Grandview Mall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main tank in the aquarium is approximately 30 meters long, 3 meters wide and 3 meters high. Over 2000 fish, 200 [[sting ray|sting rays]], 30 [[shark|sharks]] are housed within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_981/node_989/node_996/node_1012/2013/06/24/1372043582143274.shtml|title=Grandview Ocean World: an Aquarium in a Shopping Mall_Life of Guangzhou|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aquarium also includes mammals, such as the [[arctic fox]], [[polar bear]], [[walrus]], [[Beluga whale|beluga]], and others.

==Animal abuse==
In early 2016, [[Animals Asia Foundation]] (AAF) began campaigning for the release and closure of the aquarium due to poor conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animalsasia.org/us/media/news/news-archive/animals-asia-returns-to-grandview-as-it-continues-to-make-headlines.html|title=Animals Asia returns to Grandview as it continues to make headlines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization have issued online petitions that have reached over 400,000 signatures and counting calling for the closure of the themepark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36865676/worlds-saddest-polar-bear-kept-in-chinese-mall?ocid=socialflow_facebook&amp;ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbcnews&amp;ns_source=facebook|title=World's 'saddest' polar bear kept in Chinese mall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Pizza the polar bear===
On March 17, 2016, AAF released a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=52&amp;v=_UhP4bcYcsU video] of the [[grizzly-polar bear hybrid|polar bear-brown bear hybrid]], 'Pizza', in its enclosure at the theme park. The video appears to show the polar bear lying on its side and crying due to its entrapment in the unnatural environment. The video has been viewed over 600,000 times. Pizza has been deemed the "world's saddest polar bear" due to the inhumane conditions of the theme park, as shown in the highly publicized video.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/world/asia/china-polar-bear-shopping-mall.html&lt;/ref&gt; A petition calls for Pizza's relocation to [[Yorkshire Wildlife Park]]. 

As a result, the aquarium is under renovations. In November 2016, the Grandview Mall Aquarium announced Pizza would be moved temporarily to upgrade and optimize his living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/world/asia/china-pizza-polar-bear.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Animal rights activists applauded the aquarium's move and are still working towards the bear's release.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2016/10/grandview-shopping-mall-chinese-group-letter-102516.html?referrer=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/world/asia/china-polar-bear-shopping-mall.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|Law|talk=Update|reason=information and references are antiquated|date=December 2013}}
'''Guarantee''' is a legal term more comprehensive and of higher import than either [[warranty]] or "security". It most commonly designates a private transaction by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for him.  It may also designate a [[treaty]] through which claims, rights or possessions are secured. It is to be differentiated from the colloquial "personal guarantee" in that a Guarantee is a legal concept which produces an economic effect. A personal guarantee by contrast is often used to refer to a promise made by an individual which is supported by, or assured through, the word of the individual. In the same way, a guarantee produces a legal effect wherein one party affirms the promise of another (usually to pay) by promising to themselves pay if default occurs. 

At law, the giver of a guarantee is called the [[surety]] or the "guarantor". The person to whom the guarantee is given is the [[creditor]] or the "obligee"; while the person whose payment or performance is secured thereby is termed "the obligor", "the principal debtor", or simply "the principal".

Suretys have been classified as follows:
#Those in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the secured creditor is a party;
#those in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger;
#those in which, without any such contract of suretyship, there is a primary and a secondary liability of two persons for one and the same debt, the debt being, as between the two, that of one of those persons only, and not equally of both, so that the other, if he should be compelled to pay it, would be entitled to reimbursement from the person by whom (as between the two) it ought to have been paid.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fox and Co. v. North and South Wales Bank, 6 App. Cas. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Guarantee is sometimes spelt "guarantie" or "guaranty".&lt;ref&gt;The guarantee (person) is sometimes distinguished from the guaranty (obligation).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is from an [[Old French]] form of "warrant", from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word which appears in [[German language|German]] as ''wahren'': to defend or make safe and binding.{{citation needed|reason=source of etymology|date=December 2013}}

==Common law==

===England===
In [[English law]], a guarantee is a [[contract]] whereby the person (the guarantor) enters into an agreement to pay a [[debt]], or effect the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. The extent of the debt that the guarantor is liable to this debt is co-extensive to the obligation of the third-party.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance and is secondary to the primary obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Chitty on Contracts 32nd edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Volume II Chapter 45-001, ''Lakeman v Mountstephen'' [1865] LR 7 HL 17, also cf Halsbury Laws of England &amp; Wales, Para 1013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails. Two forms of guarantee exists in England, (1) Guarantees creating a conditional payment, wherein if the principal fails, the guarantor will pay. Under this form, the guarantee is not enforceable until failure occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; (2) A "See-to-it" obligation where the guarantor's obligation is to ensure that the principal will carry out the obligation. Failure of the principal to do so will automatically make the guarantor in breach of his contractual obligation, on which the creditor can sue.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286&lt;/ref&gt;

The liabilities of a guarantor in law depend upon those of the principal [[debtor]], and when the principal's obligations cease the guarantor's do too,&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286. ''See'' Stacey v. Hill, I KB 666 (1901).  ''See'' Bateson v. Gosling, 1871 L.R. 7, 14&lt;/ref&gt; except in certain cases where the discharge of the principal debtor is by the operation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;''With regard to release of the debtor See'' Finley v Connell Associates [2002] Lloyds Rep PN 62 ''or also In re'' Fitzgeorge ''[[ex parte]]'' Robson, I KB 462 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[co-extensive]], secondary nature of the liability of the guarantor along with the fact that the guarantee is a contract to answer default, debt, or miscarriage; crucially differentiates the guarantee from an indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286 ''Also See'' Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, a person wrongly supposes that someone is liable to them, and a guarantee is given on that erroneous basis, the guarantee is invalid by virtue of the law of contracts, because its foundation (that another was liable) failed.&lt;ref&gt;Mountstephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

No special phraseology is necessary to form a guarantee. What distinguishes a guarantee from [[insurance]] is not any difference between the words "insurance" and "guarantee", but the substance of the contract entered into by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v. Heath-Seaton v. Burnand, I QB 782, 792, C.A. (1899); ''In re'' Denton's Estate Licenses Insurance Corporation and Guarantee Fund Ltd. v. Denton, 2 Ch. 188 (1899); ''see'' Dane v. Mortgage Insurance Corporation, I Q.B. 54 C.A. (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory requisites of a guarantee are, in England, prescribed firstly by the [[statute of frauds]], which provides in section 4 that "no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person, unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some [[memorandum]] or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized". This in effect means that the guarantee are not invalid but are merely unenforceable through a chose in personam. The requirement for a signature in writing was clarified in ''Elpis Maritimes Co v Marti Chartering Co Inc (the "Maria D") [1992] 1 AC 21'' and ''J Pereia Fernandes SA v Mehta [2006] EWHC 813 (Ch)''. In the latter, it was held that a contract was enforceable either by written agreement signed by the guarantor or his agent OR; if the guarantee was oral, a separate note or memorandum of the agreement could make the guarantee similarly enforceable. In the former, the court held it was sufficient that it was written or printed by the guarantor, a initial within an email was sufficient but a standard header name in an email was not. The court believed that the minor action was sufficient to engage the Statute as it had long been held that a single fingerprint, or "X" was sufficient. The [[Electronic Communications Act 2000]] created a power to issue statutory instruments to modify legislation so as to be congruent with modern use of electronic communications. This is congruent with Article 9 of the [[EU Directive on Electronic Commerce 2000]], this specifically allowed exceptions to the 'in writing' requirement of a guarantee. It has even been held that clicking a button to confirm personal details sufficiently discharges the Statute of Frauds requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Beale and Griffiths (2000) LMCLQ 467, 473&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requisite is Lord Tenterden's Act&lt;ref&gt;9 Geo. IV. c. 14 §6&lt;/ref&gt; which enacts that "no action shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon or by reason of any representation or assurance made or given concerning or relating to the character, conduct, credit, ability, trade or dealings of any other person, to the intent or purpose that such other person may obtain credit, money or goods upon unless such representation or assurance be made in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith".&lt;ref&gt;i.e. "upon credit"Lyde v. Barnard, 1 M. &amp; W. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Tenterden's Act, which applies to [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] companies and to individual persons,&lt;ref&gt;Hirst v. West Riding Union Banking Co., 2 K.B. 560 C.A. (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; was rendered necessary by an evasion of the statute of frauds, treating the guarantee for a debt, default or miscarriage, when not in writing as a fraudulent representation, giving rise to damages for a [[tort]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasley v. Freeman, 3 T.R. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Scotland, where a guarantee is called a "cautionary obligation," similar enactments to those just specified are contained in the Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 §6, while&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statute of frauds====
{{main article|Statute of frauds}}
The statute of frauds does not invalidate a verbal guarantee, but renders it unenforceable. It may therefore be available to support a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to an action, and money paid under it cannot be recovered.  An [[indemnity]] is not a guarantee within the statute, unless it contemplates the primary liability of a third person. It need not, therefore, be in writing when it is only a promise to become liable for a debt if the person to whom the promise is made should become liable.&lt;ref&gt;Wildes v. Dudlow, L.R. 19 Eq. 198; Harburg India-Rubber Co. v. Martin, 1902, I K.B. 786; Guild v. Conrad, 1894, 2 Q.B. 885 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither does the statute apply to the promise of a [[del credere]] agent to make no sales on behalf of his principal except to persons who are absolutely solvent, and renders the agent liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise. A promise to give a guarantee is within the statute, though not one to procure a guarantee. The general principles which determine what are guarantees within the statute of frauds are: (1) the primary liability of a third person must exist or be contemplated;&lt;ref&gt;Birkmyr v. Darnell, 1 Sm. L.C. Iith ed. 299; Mounistephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 196; L.R. 7 H.L. 17&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the promise must be made to the creditor; (3) there must be no liability by the surety independent of an express promise of guarantee; (4) the main object of the parties to the guarantee must be the fulfilment of a third party's obligation;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Harburg India-Rubber Comb Co. v. Martin, I K.B. 778, 786 (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) the contract entered into must not amount to a [[sales|sale]] by the creditor to the promiser of the security for a debt or of the debt itself&lt;ref&gt;''See'' de Colyar's ''Law of Guarantees and of Principal and Surety'', 3rd ed. pp. 65-161, where these principles are discussed in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards the kind of note or memorandum of the guarantee that will satisfy the statute of frauds, "no special promise to be made, by any person after the passing of this act, to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, being in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, shall be deemed invalid to support an action, suit or other proceeding, to charge the person by whom such promise shall have been made, by reason only that the consideration for such promise does not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document."&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 §3&lt;/ref&gt; Any writing embodying the terms of the agreement between the parties and signed by the party to be charged is sufficient; and the idea of agreement need not be present to the mind of the person signing.&lt;ref&gt;''In re'' Hoyle - Hoyle v. Hoyle, I Ch., 98 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, necessary that the names of the contracting parties should appear somewhere in writing; that the party to be charged, or his agent, should sign the agreement or another paper referring to it; and that, when the note or memorandum is made, a complete agreement shall exist. The memorandum need not be contemporaneous with the agreement itself.&lt;ref&gt;As regards the stamping of the memorandum or note of agreement, a guarantee cannot, in England, be given in evidence unless properly stamped.  [[Stamp Act]] 1891.  A guarantee for the payment of goods, however, requires no stamp. Nor is it necessary to stamp a written representation or assurance as to character within 9 Geo. IV. c. 14.  If under seal, a guarantee may require an [[ad valorem]] [[Revenue stamp|stamp]]; and, on certain prescribed terms, the stamps can be affixed any time after execution.  Stamp Act 1891, 15, amended by 15 of the Finance Act 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, but not apparently elsewhere, there is a distinction between a '''surety''' and a '''guarantor'''.  A surety is usually bound with the principal, at the same time and on the same [[consideration]], while the contract of a guarantor is his own separate undertaking and the guarantor is not liable until [[due diligence]] has been exerted to compel the principal debtor to make good any default. There is no [[privity of contract]] between a surety and the principal debtor.  Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Bain v. Cooper, I Dowl. R. (N.S.) 11, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other common law jurisdictions===
In India a guarantee may be either oral or written&lt;ref&gt;Indian Contract Act §126&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Australia]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Sri Lanka]] it must be in writing.

In the Irish Statute of Frauds&lt;ref&gt;7 Will. III. c. 12&lt;/ref&gt; there are provisions identical with that found in the English Statute of Frauds.

==Civil law==
According to various existing [[civil code]]s, a suretyship, when the underlying obligation is "non-valuable", is null and void unless the invalidity is the result of personal incapacity of the principal debtor&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2012; Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822; Italy, 1899; Netherlands, 1858; Lower Canada, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, however, the mere personal incapacity of a minor to borrow suffices to eliminate the guarantee of a loan made to him&lt;ref&gt;Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822, §2, 1535, 1536&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian codes sanction guarantees expressly entered into "in view of debtor's want of legal capacity" to contract a valid principal obligation &lt;ref&gt;Egyptain Codes, Mixed Suits, 605; Native Tribunals, 496&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese code retains the surety's liability, in respect of an invalid principal obligation, until the latter has been legally rescinded&lt;ref&gt;art. 822, §I&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several codes civil sureties are divided into conventional, legal and judicial,&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2015, 2040 et seq.; Spain, 1823; Lower Canada, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; while the Spanish code further divides them into gratuitous and for valuable [[consideration]].&lt;ref&gt;art. 1, 823&lt;/ref&gt;

The German code civil requires the surety's promise to be verified by writing where he has not executed the principal obligation.&lt;ref&gt;art. 766&lt;/ref&gt;  The Portuguese code renders a guarantee provable by all the modes established by law for the proof of the principal contract&lt;ref&gt;art. 826&lt;/ref&gt; According to most civil codes civil a guarantee like any other contract can usually be made verbally in the presence of witnesses and in certain cases (where for instance considerable sums of money are involved) ''sous signature privee''{{Technical statement|date=December 2013}} or by a judicial or notarial [[legal instrument|instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codes Civil, France and Belgium 1341; Spain, 1244; Portugal 2506, 2513; Italy, 1341 et seq.; Pothier's ''Law of Obligations'', Evans's ed. i. 257; ''Burge on Suretyship'', p. 19; van der Linden's ''Institutes of Holland'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The French and Belgian Codes, moreover, provide that suretyship is not to be presumed but must always be expressed&lt;ref&gt;art. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract law==
{{Main article|Contract|Offer and acceptance|Meeting of the minds}}
In England the common-law requisites of a guarantee are the same as any other [[contract]]. The mutual assent of two or more parties, competency to contract and valuable consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Pillan v. van Mierop and Hopkins, 3 Burr. 1666; Haigh v. Brooks, 10 A. &amp; E. 309; Barrell v. Trussell, 4 Taunt. 117; [[Indian Contract Act 1872]] §127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If the guarantee is made "under [[seal (device)|seal]]" no consideration may be required.  However, sealed contracts without consideration are no longer valid in most common law jurisdictions.{{citation needed|reason=support obsolescence of sealed contracts|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An offer to guarantee must be accepted, either by express or implied acceptance.

If a surety's assent to a guarantee has been procured by [[fraud]] by the person to whom it is given, there is no binding contract.  [[Fraud]] may consist of suppression, concealment or misrepresentation.  However, only facts that are really material to the risk undertaken need be spontaneously disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v. Burn and Burn v. Seaton, 1900 A.C. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The competency of the parties to enter into a contract of guarantee may be affected by [[insanity]] or [[substance intoxication|intoxication]] of the surety, if known to the creditor, or by any disability. The ordinary disabilities are those of [[minor (law)|minors]].

In some guarantees the consideration is "entire". For example, in consideration for a [[lease]] being granted, the surety becomes answerable for the performance of the [[covenant (law)|covenants]] of the lease.  In other cases it is "fragmentary" or supplied from time to time, as where a guarantee is given to secure the balance of a running account at a bank, for goods supplied&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's v. Harper, 16 Ch. Div. 319&lt;/ref&gt; When the consideration is "entire", the guarantee runs on through the duration of the lease and is irrevocable. When the consideration is "fragmentary", unless the guarantee stipulates to the contrary, the surety may at any time terminate his liability under the guarantee.

Total [[failure of consideration]] or illegal consideration by the party giving a guarantee will prevent its being enforced. Though in all countries the mutual assent of two or more parties is essential to the formation of any contract,&lt;ref&gt;''See e.g.'' Codes Civil, Fr. and Bel. 1108; Port. 643, 647 et seq.; Spain, 1258, 1261; Italy, 1104; Holt. 1356; Lower Canada, 984&lt;/ref&gt; a consideration is not everywhere regarded as a necessary element.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Pothier's ''Law of Obligations'', Evans's edition vol. ii. p. l9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in Scotland a contract may be binding without a consideration to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Stair i. to. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liability==
{{Main article|Legal liability}}
The liability incurred by a surety under his guarantee depends upon its terms, and is not necessarily coextensive with that of the principal debtor. It is, however, obvious that the surety's obligation cannot exceed that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;de Colyar, ''Law of Guarantees'', 3rd ed. p. 233; Burge, ''Suretyship'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; By many existing civil codes, however, a guarantee which imposes on the surety a greater liability than that of the principal is not invalidated but is merely reducible to that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2013; Portugal 823; Spain, 1826; Italy, 1900; Netherlands, 1859; Lower Canada, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; However, in India the liability of the surety is, unless otherwise provided by contract, coextensive with that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Contract Act 1872 §128&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the liability of the surety is less extensive in amount than that of the principal debtor, questions have arisen in England and America as to whether the surety is liable only for part of the debt equal to the limit of his liability, or, up to such limit, for the whole debt.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis v. Emmanuel, 4 Ex. Div. 157; Hobson v. Bass, 6 Ch. App. 792; Brandt, ''Suretyship'', sec. 219&lt;/ref&gt; The surety cannot be made liable except for a loss sustained by reason of the default guaranteed against. Moreover, in the case of a [[joint and several liability|joint and several guarantee]] by several sureties, unless all sign it none are liable thereunder.&lt;ref&gt;National Pro. Bank of England v. Brackenbury 1906, 22 Times L.R. 797&lt;/ref&gt;  The limit of the surety's liability must be construed so as to give effect to what may fairly be inferred to have been the intention of the parties as expressed in writing. In cases of doubtful import, recourse to [[parol evidence]] is permissible, to explain, but not to contradict, the written evidence of the guarantee.

As a general rule, the surety is not liable if the principal debt cannot be enforced. It has never been actually decided in England whether this rule holds good in cases where the principal debtor is a minor and on that account is not liable to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Kimball v. Newell 7 Hill (N.Y.) 116&lt;/ref&gt; When directors guarantee the performance by their company of a contract which is [[ultra vires|beyond their authority]], and therefore not binding on the company, the directors' liability is enforceable against them personally.&lt;ref&gt;Yorkshire Railway Waggon Co. v. Maclure, 21 Ch. D. 309 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination of liability===
It is not always easy to determine for how long liability under a guarantee endures. Sometimes a guarantee is limited to a single transaction, and is obviously intended to be security against one specific default only. On the other hand, it as often happens that it is not exhausted by one transaction on the faith of it, but extends to a series of transactions, and remains a standing security until it is revoked, either by the act of the parties or by the death of the surety. It is then termed a continuing guarantee.

No fixed rules of interpretation determine whether a guarantee is a continuing one or not, but each case must be judged on its individual merits.  Frequently, in order to achieve a correct construction, it becomes necessary to examine the surrounding circumstances, which often reveal what was the subject matter which the parties contemplated when the guarantee was given, and what was the scope and object of the transaction between them. Most continuing guarantees are either ordinary business securities for advances made or goods supplied to the principal debtor or else bonds for the good behavior of persons in public or private offices or employment. With regard to the latter class of continuing guarantees, the surety's liability is, generally speaking, revoked by any change in the constitution of the persons to or for whom the guarantee is given.&lt;ref&gt;Partnership Act 1890 §18, which applies to Scotland as well as England, provides that "a continuing guarantee or cautionary obligation given either to a firm or to a third person in respect of the transactions of a firm, is, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, revoked as to future transactions by any change in the constitution of the firm to which, or of the firm in respect of the transactions of which the guaranty or obligation was given." This section is mainly declaratory of the English common law, which indicates that the changes in the persons to or for whom a guarantee is given may consist either of an increase in their number, of a diminution thereof caused by death or [[retirement]] from business, or of the incorporation or consolidation of the persons to whom the guarantee is given.&lt;/ref&gt;  In England the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to vary the character of any security, for good behavior by the heads of public departments&lt;ref&gt;Government Offices (Security) Act 1875, Amended by the Statute Law Revision Act 1883&lt;/ref&gt; given by companies for the due performance of the duties of an office or employment in the public service.

===Limitation of liability===
Before the surety can be rendered liable on his guarantee, the principal debtor must have made default. When, however, this has occurred, the creditor, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, may sue the surety, without informing him of such default having taken place before proceeding against the principal debtor or resorting to [[securities]] for the debt received from the latter. In those countries where the municipal law is based on the [[Roman law]], sureties usually possess the right (which may, however, be renounced by them) of compelling the creditor to insist on the goods, etc. (if any) of the principal debtor being first "discussed," i.e., appraised and sold, and appropriated to the liquidation of the debt guaranteed before having recourse to the sureties.&lt;ref&gt;''See Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2021 et seq.; Spain, 1830, 1831; Portugal 830; Germany, 771, 772, 773; Netherlands, 1868; Italy, 1907; Lower Canada, 1941-1942; Egypt [mixed suits] 612; ibid. [native tribunals] 502&lt;/ref&gt; This right "accords with a common sense of justice and the natural equity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Hayes v. Ward, 4 Johns. New York, Ch. Cas. p. 132, (opinion by Kent, [[Chancellor]]&lt;/ref&gt; In England this right has never been fully recognized, nor does it prevail in America and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 §8&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, however, before any demand for payment has been made by the creditor on the surety, the latter can, as soon as the principal debtor has made default, compel the creditor, on giving him an [[indemnity]] against costs and expenses, to sue the principal debtor if the latter is solvent and able to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v. Bradford Banking Company 1894, 2 Ch. 75; Wright v. Simpson, 6 Yes. 733&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar remedy is also open to the surety in America.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Brandt on Suretyship'', p. 290 ¶205 Extent of surety's liability&lt;/ref&gt;  In neither of these countries nor in Scotland can one of several sureties, when sued for the whole guaranteed debt by the creditor, compel the latter to divide his claim among the sureties, and reduce it to the share and proportion of each surety. However, this ''beneficium divisionis'', as it is called in Roman law, is recognized by many existing codes.&lt;ref&gt;France and Belgium 2025-2027; Spain, 1837; Portugal, 835- 836; Germany, 426; Netherlands, 1873-1874; Italy, 1911-1912; Lower Canada, 1946; Egypt [mixed suits], 615,616&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement of liability===
The usual mode in England of enforcing liability under a guarantee is by action in the [[Her Majesty's High Court of Justice in England|High Court]] or a [[County court#England and Wales|County Court]]. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress by means of a set-off or [[counterclaim]], in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial.  The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the principal debtor.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte'' Young ''In re'' Kitchin, 17 Ch. Div. 668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, 1883 §37&lt;/ref&gt;

A person liable as a surety for another under a guarantee possesses rights against the person to whom the guarantee was given. As regards the surety's rights against the principal debtor, where the guarantee was made with the debtors consent but not otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Hodgson, v. Shaw, 3 Myl. &amp; K. 190&lt;/ref&gt; after he has made default, be compelled by the surety to exonerate him from liability by payment of the guaranteed debt.&lt;ref&gt;Antrobus v. Davidson, 3 Meriv. 569, 579; Johnston v. Salvage Association, 19 Q.B.D. 460, 461; and Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 2 Ch. 514 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the surety has paid any portion of the guaranteed debt, the surety is entitled to rank as a creditor for the amount paid and to compel repayment.

In the event of the principal debtor's bankruptcy, the surety can in England act against the bankrupt's estate, not only in respect of payments made before the bankruptcy of the principal debtor, but also, it seems, in respect of the contingent liability to pay under the guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Ex parte'' Delmar re Herepath, 38 W.R. 752 (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the creditor has already acted, the surety who has paid the guaranteed debt has a right to all dividends received by the creditor from the bankrupt in respect to the guaranteed debt, and to stand in the creditor's place as to future [[dividend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This right is, however, often waived by the guarantee stipulating that, until the creditor has received full payment of all sums over and above the guaranteed debt, due to him from the principal debtor, the surety shall not participate in any dividends distributed from the bankrupt's estate amongst his creditors.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights of the surety against the creditor are in England exercisable even by one who in the first instance was a principal debtor, but has since become a surety, by arrangement with his creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v. The Bradford Banking Co., 1894 A.C. 586&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of surety against the creditor===
The surety's principal right against the creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, to the benefit of all [[securities]] which the creditor held against the principal debtor.  If the creditor has lost these securities by default or [[laches (equity)|laches]] or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged [[pro tanto]]. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon v. Steel, 1901, 2 Ch. 602&lt;/ref&gt;  "[E]very person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in [[equity (legal concept)|equity]], in order to obtain from the principal debtor, or any co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person shall be justly liable".&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856, §5&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the surety to be [[subrogation|subrogated]] on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor is recognized in America&lt;ref&gt;Tobin v. Kirk, 80 New York S.C.R. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2029; Spain, 1839; Portugal 839; Germany, - 994; Netherlands, 1877; Italy, 1916; Lower Canada, 2959; Egypt [mixed suits], 617; ibid. [native tribunals], 505&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of surety against other sureties===
A surety is entitled to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is not the result of any contract, but is derived from a [[equity (legal concept)|equity]], on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case of a surety for a surety;&lt;ref&gt;''See ''In re'' Denton's Estate, 1904, 2 Ch. 178 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 1893, 2 Ch. 514&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.

The Roman law did not recognize the right of contribution among sureties. It is, however, sanctioned by many existing codes.&lt;ref&gt;Code Civil France and Belgium 2033; Germany, 426,474; Italy, 1920; Netherlands, 1881; Spain, 1844; Portugal 845; Lower Canada, 1955; Egypt [mixed suits], 618, ibid. [native tribunals], 506; Indian Contract Act 1872, §§146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discharge of liability===
The most prolific ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from the creditor's conduct.  The governing principle is that if the creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only [[nominal damages|nominal]], the guarantee cannot be enforced.  The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, or of that between the creditor and the surety;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Rickaby v. Lewis, 22 T.L.R. 130&lt;/ref&gt; (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the principal debtor from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a [[novation]]. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2034, 2038; Spain 1847; Portugal 848; Lower Canada, 1956; 1960; Egypt [mixed suits], 622, ibid. [native tribunals], 509; Indian Contract Act 1872, sec. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codes Civil France and Belgium 2037; Spain, 1852; Portugal 853; Germany, 776; Italy, 1928; Egypt [mixed suits], 623&lt;/ref&gt; although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil,&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil Spain, 1851; Portugal 852&lt;/ref&gt; is rejected by the majority of them.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil France and Belgium 2039; Netherlands, 1887; Italy, 1930; Lower Canada, 1961; Egypt [mixed suits], 613; ib. [native tribunals], 503); ''see'' Morice, ''English and Dutch Law'', p. 96; van der Linden, ''Institutes of Holland'', pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.

The [[death]] of a surety does not per se determine the guarantee, but, save where from its nature the guarantee is irrevocable by the surety himself, it can be revoked by express notice after his death, or by the creditor becoming receiving [[constructive notice]] of the death; except where, under the testator's [[will (law)|will]], the [[executor]] has the option of continuing the guarantee, in which case the executor should specifically withdraw the guarantee in order to terminate it.  If one of a number of joint and several sureties dies, the future liability of the survivors continues, at least until it has been terminated by express notice.  In such a case, however, the estate of the deceased surety would be relieved from liability. The [[statute of limitations]] may bar the right of action on guarantees subject to variation by statute in any [[U.S. state]] where the guarantee is sought to be enforced.

The '''Hamayouni Decree''' (also "Hamayonic", "Hamayoni") ({{lang-ar|الخط الهمايونى}}) or "Hamayony Khat" is a clause in the Egyptian law that dates back to the [[Hatt-ı Hümayun]] of February 1856 issued during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], which regulates [[Christian church]] construction and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/SUDAN932.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently a cause of much controversy due to the conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for the permit to be granted. These same restrictions do not apply to mosques.&lt;ref name="persecution.org"&gt;[http://www.persecution.org/suffering/countryinfodetail.php?countrycode=7]&lt;/ref&gt; The law formerly required that each permit must be issued by the [[President of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-105shrg40890/pdf/CHRG-105shrg40890.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, under the administration of [[Hosni Mubarak]], the law was changed to also allow [[Governorates of Egypt|Egyptian Governors]] to grant permits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2000/3/bro.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
While ostensibly part of the [[Tanzimat]] reforms of the Ottoman Empire in the 1800s, the special restrictions on churches trace back to the [[Pact of Umar]] in the 7th century.  This treaty included a provision against the building of new churches or other religious buildings, and became the jurisprudential basis for subsequent interactions between Muslim leaders and non-Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/pact-umar.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hamayouni Decree was later elaborated by the [[Ten Conditions of Al-Ezabi]].

== Conditions ==
The requirements are complex and frequently arbitrary for building and repairing churches or church-owned buildings. The state president must personally approve all building applications, and the provincial governors must approve all applications for repairs, even for something as small as repairing a toilet or a broken window.&lt;ref name="persecution.org" /&gt;

'''Hannah Szenes''' (often [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as '''Hannah Senesh''' or '''Chanah Senesh'''; {{lang-he-n|חנה סנש}}; {{lang-hu|Szenes Anikó}}; July 17, 1921{{spaced ndash}}November 7, 1944) was a poet and [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) paratrooper. She was one of 37 [[Jewish Parachutists of Mandate Palestine|Jewish parachutists of Mandate Palestine]] [[Paratrooper|parachuted]] by the [[British Army]] into [[Yugoslavia]] during the [[Second World War]] to assist in the rescue of [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] about to be deported to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[death camp]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;Hecht, Ben. ''Perfidy'', first published by Julian Messner, 1961; this edition Milah Press, 1997, pp. 118-133. Hecht cites Bar Adon, Dorothy and Pessach. ''The Seven who Fell''. Sefer Press, 1947, and "The Return of Hanna Senesh" in ''Pioneer Woman'', XXV, No. 5, May 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szenes was arrested at the Hungarian border, then imprisoned and tortured, but refused to reveal details of her mission. She was eventually tried and [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]].&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt; She is regarded as a national heroine in [[Israel]], where her poetry is widely known and the headquarters of the [[Zionist youth movement]]s ''Israel Hatzeira'', [[Yad Hana|a kibbutz]] and several streets are named after her.

== Early life ==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7718 Hannah Senesh and her brother.JPG|thumb|right|Hannah Szenes and her brother, [[Budapest]], circa 1924]]
Szenes was born on July 17, 1921, to an [[assimilated Jewish]] family in [[Hungary]]. Her father, Béla, a journalist and playwright, died when Hannah was six years old. She continued to live with her mother, Katalin, and her brother, György.

She enrolled in a Protestant private school for girls that also accepted [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and Jewish pupils; most of those of the Jewish faith had to pay three times the amount Catholics paid.  However, Szenes only had to pay twice the regular tuition because she was considered a "Gifted Student".  This, along with the realization that the situation of the [[Jews in Hungary]] was becoming precarious, prompted Szenes to embrace [[Zionism]], and she joined ''Maccabea'', a Hungarian [[Zionist youth movement|Zionist students organization]].

==Immigrating to Nahalal==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7708 Hannah Senesh.jpg|thumb|Hannah Senesh, Budapest, 1937–38&lt;ref&gt;http://info.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?levelId=38530&amp;itemId=6347&amp;itemType=0&amp;obj=154229&amp;picI=13&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Szenes graduated in 1939 and decided to emigrate to what was then the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in order to study in the Girls' Agricultural School at [[Nahalal]]. In 1941, she joined [[Kibbutz]] [[Sdot Yam]] and then joined the [[Haganah]], the paramilitary group that laid the foundation of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. 
[[File:Hannah Szenes.jpg|thumb|Hannah Szenes with members of Kibbutz Sdot Yam. (4th from left)]]
In 1943, she enlisted in the [[British Army]] in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] as an Aircraftwoman 2nd Class and began her training in [[Egypt]] as a paratrooper for the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE).

==Arrest and torture==
[[File:HannahSzenes1.jpg|thumb|right|Hannah Szenes in a Hungarian army uniform as a [[Purim]] costume]]
On March 14, 1944, she and colleagues [[Yoel Palgi]] and [[Peretz Goldstein]]&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt; were parachuted into [[Yugoslavia]] and joined a [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisan group]]. After landing, they learned the Germans had already occupied Hungary, so the men decided to call off the mission as too dangerous.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;

Szenes continued on and headed for the Hungarian border. At the border, she and her companions were arrested by Hungarian [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]], who found her British military transmitter, used to communicate with the SOE and other partisans. She was taken to a prison, stripped, tied to a chair, then whipped and clubbed for three days. She lost several teeth as a result of the beating.&lt;ref&gt;Blessed Is the Match: The Life and Death of Hannah Senesh (2008 film)&lt;/ref&gt;

The guards wanted to know the code for her transmitter so they could find out who the parachutists were and trap others. Transferred to a Budapest prison, Szenes was repeatedly interrogated and tortured, but only revealed her name and refused to provide the transmitter code, even when her mother was also arrested. They threatened to kill her mother if she did not cooperate, but she refused.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;

While in prison, Szenes used a mirror to flash signals out of the window to prisoners in other cells and communicated using large cut-out letters that she placed in her cell window one at a time and by drawing the [[Magen David]] in the dust.

==Trial and execution==
She was tried for [[treason]] on October 28, 1944. There was an eight-day postponement to give the judges more time to find a verdict, followed by another postponement, this one because of the appointment of a new Judge Advocate. She was executed by a [[firing squad]] on November 7, 1944.&lt;ref name="Baumel-Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumel-Schwartz|first=Judith Tydor|title=Perfect heroes: the World War II parachutists and the making of Israeli collective memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_KNdfB3vrgC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22Hannah+Szenes%22#v=snippet&amp;q=firing%20squad&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]]|isbn=978-0-299-23484-3|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She kept diary entries until her last day. One of them read: "In the month of July, I shall be twenty-three/I played a number in a game/The dice have rolled. I have lost," and another: "I loved the warm sunlight."&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;
[[Image:Chana Senesh grave.JPG|thumb|right|Szenes's gravestone]]
Her diary was published in Hebrew in 1946. Her remains were brought to [[Israel]] in 1950 and buried in the cemetery on [[Mount Herzl]], [[Jerusalem]]. Her tombstone was brought to Israel in November 2007 and placed in [[Sdot Yam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/927718.html Tombstone of WWII poet and spy Hannah Szenes arrives in Israel], Haaretz, 25 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial of [[Rudolf Kastner]], Hannah's mother testified that during the time her daughter was imprisoned, Kastner's people had advised her not to obtain a lawyer for her daughter.  Further, she recalled a conversation with Kastner after the war, telling him, "I don't say that you could have saved my daughter Hannah, but that you didn't try – it makes it harder for me that nothing was done."&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Ben. ''Perfidy''. 1961, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Cold War]], a Hungarian military court officially exonerated her. Her kin in Israel were informed on November 5, 1993.

==Poetry, songs and plays==

Szenes was a [[poetry|poet]] and playwright, writing both in Hungarian and Hebrew. The following are four of her better known poems. The best known of these is "[[A Walk to Caesarea]]", commonly known as ''Eli, Eli'' ("My God, My God").  The well-known melody was composed by David Zahavi.  Many singers have sung it, including [[Ofra Haza]], [[Regina Spektor]], and [[Sophie Milman]]. It was used to close some versions of the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''My God, My God, I pray that these things never end'',
''The sand and the sea,''
''The rustle of the waters,''
''Lightning of the Heavens,''
''The prayer of Man.''&lt;ref name="NYJW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/well-versed/poems-hannah-senesh |title=Poems, by Hannah Senesh |date=December 22, 2010 |publisher=The Jewish Week |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302111016/http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/well-versed/poems-hannah-senesh |archivedate=March 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''אלי, אלי, שלא יגמר לעולם
''החול והים
''רשרוש של המים
''ברק השמים
''תפילת האדם
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another of her poems begins,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''A voice called, and I went.''
''I went, for a voice called.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The following lines are from the last poem she wrote, "Ashrei Hagafrur", after she was parachuted into a partisan camp in Yugoslavia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
,אַשְׁרֵי הַגַּפְרוּר שֶׁנִּשְׂרַף וְהִצִּית לֶהָבוֹת
.אַשְׁרֵי הַלְּהָבָה שֶׁבָּעֲרָה בְּסִתְרֵי לְבָבוֹת

.אַשְׁרֵי הַגַּפְרוּר שֶׁנִּשְׂרַף וְהִצִּית לֶהָבוֹת

''Blessed is the match consumed in kindling flame.''
''Blessed is the flame that burns in the secret fastness of the heart.''
''Blessed is the heart with strength to stop its beating for honour's sake.''
''Blessed is the match consumed in kindling flame.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hannah Senesh: Her Life &amp; Diary|edition=paperback|year=1973|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8052-0410-5|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following lines were found in Hannah's death cell after her execution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''One—two—three ... eight feet long,''
''Two strides across, the rest is dark ...''
''Life hangs over me like a question mark.''

''One—two—three ... maybe another week,''
''Or next month may still find me here,''
''But death, I feel, is very near.''

''I could have been twenty-three next July;''
''I gambled on what mattered most,'' 
''The dice were cast. I lost.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hannah Senesh: Her Life &amp; Diary|edition=paperback|year=1973|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8052-0410-5|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="942">'''Hard law''' refers to actual binding legal instruments and laws. In contrast with [[soft law]], hard law gives States and international actors actual binding responsibilities as well as rights. The term is common in [[international law]] where there are no sovereign governing bodies.

Hard law means binding laws. To constitute law, a rule, instrument or decision must be authoritative and prescriptive. In international law, hard law includes self-executing treaties or international agreements, as well as customary laws. These instruments result in legally enforceable commitments for countries (states) and other international subjects.

Sources of international hard law:
*[[Treaty|Treaties (also known as conventions or international agreements)]]
*[[United Nations Security Council resolution|United Nations Security Council Resolutions]]
*[[Customary international law|Customary International Law]]

'''Human overpopulation''' (or '''population overshoot''') occurs when the [[ecological footprint]] of a human population in a specific geographical location exceeds the [[carrying capacity]] of the place occupied by that group. [[Overpopulation]] can further be viewed, in a long term perspective, as existing if a population cannot be maintained given the rapid depletion of [[non-renewable resources]] or given the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population. Changes in lifestyle could reverse overpopulated status without a large population reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Paul R.

When its population cannot be maintained without rapidly depleting nonrenewable resources [39] (or converting renewable resources into nonrenewable ones) and without decreasing the capacity of the environment to support the population.

The term ''human overpopulation'' refers to the relationship between the [[world population|entire human population]] and its [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]: the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food Global food crisis looms as climate change and population growth strip fertile land] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429094959/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food |date=29 April 2016 }}". Guardian.co.uk (2007-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; or to smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation can result from an increase in [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|births]], a decline in [[mortality rate]]s, an increase in [[immigration]], or an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] [[biome]] and [[depletion of resources]]. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a [[desert]]). Advocates of population moderation cite issues like [[quality of life]], [[carrying capacity]], and risk of [[starvation]] as a basis to argue for [[population decline]]. Scientists suggest that the [[human impact on the environment]] as a result of overpopulation, [[Overconsumption|profligate consumption]] and proliferation of technology has pushed the planet into a new geological [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] known as the [[Anthropocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-03-coping-anthropocene.html|title= Coping with the Anthropocene|first= |last= |date=17 March 2015|work=[[Phys.org]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/07/human-impact-has-pushed-earth-into-the-anthropocene-scientists-say|title=Human impact has pushed Earth into the Anthropocene, scientists say|first=Adam |last=Vaughan|date=7 January 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140920-population-11billion-demographics-anthropocene/|title=As World’s Population Booms, Will Its Resources Be Enough for Us?|first=Dennis |last=Dimick|date=21 September 2014|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Human population]] has been rising continuously since the end of the [[Black Death]], around the year 1350,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120404/http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most significant increase has been since the 1950s, mainly due to [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advancements]] and increases in [[agricultural productivity]]. The rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s, while the absolute total numbers are increasing. Recent rate increases in several countries previously enjoying steady declines are also apparently contributing to continued growth in total numbers. The [[United Nations]] has expressed concerns on continued population growth in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=BBC News – Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges |publisher=BBC |date=2013-05-22 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has demonstrated that those concerns are well grounded.&lt;ref name="cliodynamics.ru"&gt;Zinkina J., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]] [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=360&amp;Itemid=1 Explosive Population Growth in Tropical Africa: Crucial Omission in Development Forecasts (Emerging Risks and Way Out).

The recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants. The [[IAP statement on population growth|InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth]], circa 1994, stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]], [[global warming]], and [[pollution]], are aggravated by the population expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=joint statement by fifty-eight of the world's scientific academies |url=http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203604/http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |archivedate=10 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food, [[starvation]] and [[malnutrition]], consumption of natural resources (such as [[fossil fuels]]) faster than the rate of regeneration, and a deterioration in living conditions. Wealthy but highly populated territories like [[Great Britain|Britain]] rely on food imports from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WRIGHT|first1=OLIVER|title=Britain's food self-sufficiency at risk from reliance on overseas imports of fruit and vegetables that could be produced at home|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britains-food-selfsufficiency-at-risk-from-reliance-on-overseas-imports-of-fruit-and-vegetables-that-could-be-produced-at-home-9574238.html|website=www.independent.co.uk|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was severely felt during the [[World war#The World Wars|World Wars]] when, despite food efficiency initiatives like "[[Dig for victory#World War II|dig for victory]]" and [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], Britain needed to [[Battle of the Atlantic|fight to secure import routes]].

==History of concern==
[[File:Overpopulation in Hồ Chí Minh City, Vietnam.JPG|thumb|275px|Thousands of scooters make their way through [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]].]]
Concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic. [[Tertullian]] was a resident of the city of [[Carthage]] in the second century [[Common Era|CE]], when the population of the world was about 190 million (only 3–4% of what it is today). He notably said: "What most frequently meets our view (and occasions complaint) is our teeming population. Our numbers are burdensome to the world, which can hardly support us.... In very deed, pestilence, and famine, and wars, and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations, as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race." Before that, [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and others broached the topic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R.E. (1924). [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/roberts_theology/roberts_05.htm The Theology of Tertullian, Chapter 5 (pp. 79–119)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212931/http://www.tertullian.org/articles/roberts_theology/roberts_05.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}. Tertullian.org (2001-07-14). Retrieved on 2012-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout recorded history, population growth has usually been slow despite high [[birth rates]], due to war, [[Plague (disease)|plagues]] and other diseases, and high [[infant mortality]]. During the 750 years before the [[Industrial Revolution]], the world's population increased very slowly, remaining under 250 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Moffet]], ''Critical Masses: The Global Population Challenge'' (1994): "[the world's population remained] capped by birth rates and death rates locked in a seemingly permanent equilibrium."&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 19th century, the world population had grown to a billion individuals, and intellectuals such as [[Thomas Malthus]] predicted that humankind would outgrow its available resources, because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Essay on the Principle of Population|date=1798|publisher=J. Johnson,|location=London|chapter=VII, paragraph 10, lines 8–10|quote=The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercantilism|Mercantillists]] argued that a large population was a form of wealth, which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies.

During the 19th century, Malthus's work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run.&lt;ref name="Claeys"&gt;Gregory Claeys: The "Survival of the Fittest" and the Origins of Social Darwinism, in: Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 61, No. 2, 2002, p. 223–240&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted, for example, in the [[English poor laws]] of 1834&lt;ref name="Claeys"/&gt; and in a hesitating response to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Great Famine]] of 1845–52.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda: Famine. A Short History, Princeton University Press 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-12237-3}} (pp. 20, 203–206)&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN publication 'World population prospects' (2017) projects that the world population will reach 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. Human population is predicted to stabilise soon thereafter.

We found there's a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century.

The human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of [[civilization]] in the [[Holocene]] period, around 10,000 BCE. The beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of [[glacial ice]] following the end of the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muller.lbl.gov/pages/iceagebook/history_of_climate.html|title=A Brief Introduction to the History of Climate|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is estimated that between 1–5 million people, subsisting on hunting and [[foraging]], inhabited the Earth in the period before the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when human activity shifted away from [[Hunter gatherer#History|hunter-gathering]] and towards [[Oasis Theory|very primitive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msh.councilforeconed.org/documents/978-1-56183-758-8-activity-lesson-03.pdf|title=The Neolithic Agricultural Revolution|page=46|publisher=Council For Economic Education|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 8000 BCE, at the [[Agriculture#History|dawn of agriculture]], the population of the world was approximately 5 million.&lt;ref name=worldometer&gt;"What was the population of the world in the past?", [http://www.worldometers.info/population/ World-o-meters]&lt;/ref&gt; The next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population, with very rapid growth beginning in 1000 BCE, and a peak of between 200 and 300 million people in 1 BCE.

There is concern over the sharp population increase in many countries, especially in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], that has occurred over the last several decades, and that it is creating problems with land management, natural resources and access to water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.mit.edu/africantech/www/articles/EnvChall.htm|title = The Environmental Challenges In Sub Saharan Africa|author = Akin L.

In 2000, the [[United Nations]] estimated that the world's population was growing at the rate of 1.14% (or about 75 million people) per year and according to data from the CIA's [[The World Factbook|World Factbook]], the world human population currently increases by 145 every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=People and Society:WORLD:Population growth rate|accessdate=4 March 2012|work=The World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[world population]] is currently growing by approximately 74 million people per year. Current United Nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach 9.0 billion around 2050, assuming a decrease in average [[fertility rate]] from 2.5 down to 2.0.&lt;ref name=UNPop&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Population Division|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ | accessdate=6 March 2018}} {{specify|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf |title=WORLD POPULATION TO 2300|publisher=United Nations|format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions, where today's 5.3 billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to 7.8 billion in 2050. By contrast, the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged, at 1.2 billion. An exception is the United States population, which is expected to increase by 44% from 2008 to 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ |title=US Census Bureau estimates and news release.of AUG. 14, 2008 |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000–2005, the average world fertility was 2.65 children per woman, about half the level in 1950–1955 (5 children per woman). In the medium variant, global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.05 children per woman.
* During 2005–2050, nine countries are expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase: [[India]], [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Constable, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/a-disaster-in-the-making-pakistans-population-has-more-than-doubled-in-20-years/2017/09/08/4f434c58-926b-11e7-8482-8dc9a7af29f9_story.html ‘A disaster in the making’: Pakistan’s population surges to 207.7 million] (September 2017), ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Uganda]], United States, [[Ethiopia]], and China, listed according to the size of their contribution to population growth. China would be higher still in this list were it not for its [[one-child policy]].
* Global life expectancy at birth is expected to continue rising from 65 years in 2000–2005 to 75 years in 2045–2050. In the more developed regions, the projection is to 82 years by 2050. Among the least developed countries, where life expectancy today is just under 50 years, it is expected to increase to 66 years by 2045–2050.
* The population of 51 countries or areas is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.
* During 2005–2050, the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million. Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 2005–2050, population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration.
* In 2000–2005, net migration in 28 countries either prevented [[population decline]] or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to population growth.
* [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|Birth rate]]s are now falling in a small percentage of [[developing country|developing countries]], while the actual populations in many [[developed country|developed countries]] would fall without immigration.&lt;ref name=UNPop/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Kathmandu street.jpg|thumb|Street in [[Kathmandu]]]]
From a historical perspective, [[technological revolution]]s have coincided with population expansion. There have been three major technological revolutions – the tool-making revolution, the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]], and the [[industrial revolution]] – all of which allowed humans more access to food, resulting in subsequent population explosions. For example, the use of tools, such as bow and arrow, allowed primitive hunters greater access to more high energy foods (e.g. animal meat). Similarly, the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply, which was used to support more people. Food production further increased with the [[industrial revolution]] as machinery, [[fertilizer]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[pesticide]]s were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields. Today, starvation is caused by economic and political forces rather than a lack of the means to produce food.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], "Unintended Consequences of Industrial Agriculture", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment By Michael Huesemann, Joyce Huesemann|publisher=New Society Publishers|page=73|quote=despite the fact that hunger and starvation may not be due to food shortages but rather the result of various economic and political factors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant increases in human population occur whenever the [[birth rate]] exceeds the [[death rate]] for extended periods of time. Traditionally, the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social, technological, or environmental conditions. For example, when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century – as a result of improved sanitation, child immunizations, and other advances in medicine – allowing more newborns to survive, the fertility rate did not adjust downward, resulting in significant population growth. Until the 1700s, seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, T. (1988). ''The Origins of Human Disease'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, UK, pp.60.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, more than nine out of ten children born in industrialized nations reach adulthood.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

There is a strong correlation between overpopulation and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donellameadows.org/archives/poverty-causes-population-growth-causes-poverty/|title=Poverty Causes Population Growth Causes Poverty - The Donella Meadows Project|website=donellameadows.org|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the invention of the [[birth control pill]] and other modern methods of contraception resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of children per household in all but the very poorest countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/family/trendsContraceptiveUse2015Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture]] has sustained human population growth. This dates back to prehistoric times, when agricultural methods were first developed, and continues to the present day, with fertilizers, agrochemicals, large-scale mechanization, genetic manipulation, and other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck12.org/earth-science/Agriculture-and-Human-Population-Growth/|title=Agriculture and Human Population Growth|publisher=CK-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have historically [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited the environment]] using the easiest, most accessible resources first. The richest farmland was plowed and the richest mineral ore mined first. Ceballos, Ehrlich A and Ehrlich P said that overpopulation is demanding the use of ever more creative, expensive and/or environmentally destructive means in order to exploit ever more difficult to access and/or poorer quality natural resources to satisfy consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 146 {{ISBN|1421417189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic transition==
{{Main article|Demographic transition|Sub-replacement fertility}}
The theory of demographic transition held that, after the [[standard of living]] and [[life expectancy]] increase, [[family size]]s and [[birth rate]]s decline. However, as new data has become available, it has been observed that after a certain level of development ([[Human Development Index|HDI]] equal to 0.86 or higher) the fertility increases again and is often represented as a "J" shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Myrskylä | first1 = M. | last2 = Kohler | first2 = H. P. | last3 = Billari | first3 = F. C. | doi = 10.1038/nature08230 | title = Advances in development reverse fertility declines | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7256 | pages = 741–743 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19661915| pmc = | bibcode = 2009Natur.460..741M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth could need reevaluation.

Factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage, the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside [[child rearing]] and domestic work, and the decreased need for children in industrialized settings. The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.

Many countries have high population growth rates but lower [[total fertility rate]]s because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.
"Demographic entrapment" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity, no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food. This will cause starvation. He claims that for example many sub-Saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment, instead of having a demographic transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = M. | last2 = Elliott | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.313.7063.995 | title = Averting a world food shortage: Tighten your belts for CAIRO II | journal = BMJ | volume = 313 | issue = 7063 | pages = 995–997 | year = 1996 | pmid =  8892423| pmc =2352328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the world as a whole, the number of [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|children born per woman]] decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005. A breakdown by region is as follows:

* Europe – 2.66 to 1.41
* North America – 3.47 to 1.99
* Oceania – 3.87 to 2.30
* Central America – 6.38 to 2.66
* South America – 5.75 to 2.49
* Asia (excluding Middle East) – 5.85 to 2.43
* Middle East &amp; North Africa – 6.99 to 3.37
* Sub-Saharan Africa – 6.7 to 5.53

Excluding the theoretical reversal in fertility decrease for high development, the projected world number of children born per woman for 2050 would be around 2.05. Only the Middle East &amp; North Africa (2.09) and Sub-Saharan Africa (2.61) would then have numbers greater than 2.05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/searchable_db/results.php?years=1950-1955,1955-1960,1960-1965,1965-1970,1970-1975,1975-1980,1980-1985,1985-1990,1990-1995,1995-2000,2000-2005,2045-2050&amp;variable_ID=369&amp;theme=4&amp;cID=&amp;ccID=0,1,6,2,3,5,8,7,4 |title=World Resources Institute |publisher=Earthtrends.wri.org |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117215622/http://earthtrends.wri.org/searchable_db/results.php?years=1950-1955%2C1955-1960%2C1960-1965%2C1965-1970%2C1970-1975%2C1975-1980%2C1980-1985%2C1985-1990%2C1990-1995%2C1995-2000%2C2000-2005%2C2045-2050&amp;variable_ID=369&amp;theme=4&amp;cID=&amp;ccID=0%2C1%2C6%2C2%2C3%2C5%2C8%2C7%2C4 |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s "[[Living Planet Report]]" stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of Europeans, we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/news_facts/publications/living_planet_report/index.cfm |title=WWF LIving planet report |publisher=Panda.org |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanity as a whole was using, by 2006, 40 percent more than what Earth can regenerate.&lt;ref&gt;Ecological Footprint Atlas 2009, Global Footprint Network, www.footprintnetwork.org/atlas&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Roger Martin (diplomat)|Roger Martin]] of [[Population Matters]] states the view: "the poor want to get rich, and I want them to get rich," with a later addition, "of course we have to change consumption habits,... but we've also got to stabilise our numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Roger|title=Stopping at two children is better for the planet|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9281866.stm|publisher=BBC HARDtalk|year=2010}} Interviewed by Carrie Gracie&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by the World Wildlife Fund in 2014 found that it would take the equivalent of 1.5 Earths of biocapacity to meet humanity's current levels of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrington|first=Damian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf|title=Earth has lost half of its wildlife in the past 40 years, says WWF |publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 September 2014 |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating Ecological Footprints. Therefore, Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results – reviews have been produced by France, Germany, the European Commission, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Japan and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/publications/|title=Publications - Global Footprint Network|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some point out that a more refined method of assessing Ecological Footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tinbergen.nl/discussionpapers/98105.pdf |title=Spatial sustainability, trade and indicators: an evaluation of the 'ecological footprint' |author=Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh and Harmen Verbruggen |journal=Ecological Economics |year=1999 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00032-4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009210421/http://www.tinbergen.nl/discussionpapers/98105.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html |title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W.

* Less personal freedom and more restrictive laws. Laws regulate and shape politics, economics, history and society and serve as a mediator of relations and interactions between people.

Many of these problems are explored in the dystopic science fiction film ''[[Soylent Green]]'', where an overpopulated Earth suffers from food shortages, depleted resources and poverty and in the documentary "[[Aftermath (2010 TV series)#Population Overload|Aftermath: Population Overload]]".

[[David Attenborough]] described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People and Planet speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=536&amp;v=fK0rXRmC4DQ|publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]]|ref=at 13mins,30secs into speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he described humanity as "a plague on the Earth" that needs to be controlled by limiting population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html David Attenborough – Humans are plague on Earth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120085247/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html |date=20 November 2016 }}.

Most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;Wilson, E.O. (2002). ''The Future of Life'', Vintage {{ISBN|0-679-76811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt; Some [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]], such as the radical thinker and polemicist [[Pentti Linkola]], see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Pentti Linkola, "Can Life Prevail?", Arktos Media, 2nd Revised ed. 2011. pp. 120–121. {{ISBN|1907166637}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of overpopulation are compounded by [[overconsumption]]. According to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planet’s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones. We grab all the fish from the sea, wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We have triggered a major extinction event ... A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect. This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse ... If everyone consumed resources at the US level – which is what the world aspires to – you will need another four or five Earths.

Overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population, but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources. It also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population.

The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include [[drinking water|clean water]], clean air, food, shelter, warmth, and other resources necessary to sustain life. If the quality of human life is addressed, there may be additional resources considered, such as medical care, education, proper [[sewage treatment]], [[waste disposal]] and energy supplies. Overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=growing-population-poses-malthusian-dilemma Another Inconvenient Truth: The World's Growing Population Poses a Malthusian Dilemma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225120645/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=growing-population-poses-malthusian-dilemma |date=25 December 2013 }}".

Directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply, and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain. With the global population at about 7.5 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 15 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation.
Irrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles.

[[David Pimentel]] has stated that "With the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources, humans must actively conserve cropland, freshwater, energy, and biological resources. There is a need to develop renewable energy resources. Humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the Earth's resources and diminishes human well-being."&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, et al.

These reflect the comments also of the [[United States Geological Survey]] in their paper [http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=653 The Future of Planet Earth: Scientific Challenges in the Coming Century]. "As the global population continues to grow...people will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet, including mineral and [[energy resources]], open space, [[water crisis|water]], and plant and animal resources."

On the other hand, some [[cornucopian]] researchers, such as [[Julian Simon|Julian L. Simon]] and [[Bjørn Lomborg]] believe that resources exist for further population growth. In a 2010 study, they concluded that "there are not (and will never be) too many people for the planet to feed" according to [[The Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-the-population-timebomb-is-a-myth-2186968.html |title=Dominic Lawson: The population timebomb is a myth The doom-sayers are becoming more fashionable just as experts are coming to the view it has all been one giant false alarm |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics warn, this will be at a high cost to the Earth: "the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decades...[however] the environmental cost of what Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich describe as 'turning the Earth into a giant human feedlot' could be severe.

According to the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]], a four-year research effort by 1,360 of the world's prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world, "The structure of the world's ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history, and virtually all of Earth's ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/ecosystems/millennium-assessment-3/1-ecosystem-change.htm#1p1 |title=1.

Another study was done by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) called the [[Global Environment Outlook]].

Although all resources, whether mineral or other, are limited on the planet, there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced. For example, in 1990 known reserves of many natural resources were higher, and their prices lower, than in 1970, despite higher demand and higher consumption. Whenever a price spike would occur, the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=34|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below, however, the majority of the world's freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps, and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells.

Fresh water can be obtained from salt water by [[desalination]]. For example, [[Malta]] derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination. A number of [[nuclear power]]ed desalination plants exist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Desalination |url=http://www.uic.com.au/nip74.htm |website=https://web.archive.org/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208191547/http://www.uic.com.au/nip74.htm |archivedate=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford-cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.13440 |url=http://www.sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf |title=Breeder reactors: A renewable energy source |author=Cohen, Bernard L. |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=75–76 |year=1983 |bibcode=1983AmJPh..51...75C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114062518/http://sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the high costs of desalination, especially for poor countries, make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020902/barlow |title=Who Owns Water? |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of desalination varies; [[Israel]] is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter,&lt;ref name = "ejpress-water"/&gt; [[Singapore]] at 49 cents per cubic meter.&lt;ref name = "edie-distinct"/&gt; In the United States, the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter ($3.06 for 1,000 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desalination gets a serious look|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/mar/21/desalination-gets-serious-look/|website=http://www.lasvegassun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2004 study by Zhou and Tol, "one needs to lift the water by 2000 m, or transport it over more than 1600&amp;nbsp;km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs. Desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high, such as [[Riyadh]] and [[Harare]]. In other places, the dominant cost is desalination, not transport. This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing, [[Bangkok]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and, of course, coastal cities like [[Tripoli]]." Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans, it concludes that "Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation. Unfortunately, that includes some of the places with biggest water problems."&lt;ref name="uni-hamburg.de"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=41|pages=W03003|year=2005|doi=10.1029/2004WR003749|title=Evaluating the costs of desalination and water transport|author1=Zhou, Yuan  |author2=Tol, Richard S.

However, new data originating from the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] experiments and isotopic testing done by the [[IAEA]] show that the [[Nubian aquifer]]—which is under the largest, driest part of the earth's surface, has enough water in it to provide for "at least several centuries".

A 2001 United Nations report says population growth is "the main force driving increases in agricultural demand" but "most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future (that is to say, until approximately 2030 or 2050)", assuming declining population growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=38|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Food production per capita.svg|thumb|Growth in food production has been greater than population growth.]]
The amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed, and their distribution is not necessarily a [[zero-sum game]]. For example, due to the [[Green Revolution]] and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes, the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until 1995. World food production per person was considerably higher in 2005 than 1961.

As world population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion, daily [[calorie]] consumption in poor countries increased from 1,932 to 2,650, and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45% to 18%. This suggests that Third World poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment, not overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=718860 | work=The Economist | title=The truth about the environment | date=2001-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others question these statistics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/170_Pimm_Harvey_Nature.pdf|doi=10.1038/35102629|title=No need to worry about the future|year=2001|last1=Pimm|first1=Stuart|last2=Harvey|first2=Jeff|journal=Nature|volume=414|issue=6860|page=149|bibcode=2001Natur.414..149P|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610083807/http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/170_Pimm_Harvey_Nature.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950 to 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kindall, Henery W  |author2=Pimentel, David|title=Constraints on the Expansion of the Global Food Supply |journal=Ambio. |volume=23 |issue=3 |date=May 1994 |url= http://dieoff.org/page36.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution and most believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]] than the UN presently documents.&lt;ref name="The limits of a Green Revolution" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/26/food.unitednations Feed the world?

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations states in its report ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006'', that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million, a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 1990–92: 17% against 20%. Furthermore, FAO's projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from 1990–92 levels to 10% by 2015. The FAO also states "We have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community. The world is richer today than it was ten years ago. There is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices. The knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there. What is lacking is sufficient political will to mobilize those resources to the benefit of the hungry."&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0750e/a0750e01.pdf The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased, the population grows. Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and its increased food supply. This was, subsequent to the [[Green Revolution]], followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that "intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population."&lt;ref&gt;Farb, Peter: 1978, ''Humankind''. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon, which he calls the "[[Food Race]]" (comparable, in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe, to the [[nuclear arms race]]).

Critics of this theory point out that, in the modern era, birth rates are lowest in the [[developed nation]]s, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan, and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This shows that, limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary, particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. However, the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major ''exporters'' of food to poorer populations, so that, "it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas (Allaby, 1984; Pimentel et al., 1999) that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled."&lt;ref name = "Hopfenberg and Pimentel"/&gt;

Regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability, the [[world population|human population]] is, on the global scale, undeniably increasing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Quinn]] (1996). ''[[The Story of B]]'', pp. 304–305, Random House Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0553379011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as is the net quantity of human food produced — a pattern that has been true for roughly 10,000 years, since the human development of agriculture. The fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole, since the world has become a [[globalization|globalized system]] with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity. Hopfenberg and Pimentel's findings support both this&lt;ref name = "Hopfenberg and Pimentel"/&gt;  and Quinn's direct accusation that "First World farmers are fueling the Third World population explosion."&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel: "The Question (ID Number 122)", Retrieved October 2014 from {{cite web|url=http://www.ishmael.org/Interaction/QandA/Detail.CFM?Record%3D122 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064622/http://ishmael.org/interaction/qanda/detail.cfm?record=122 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study, as in Germany's recent population trends; clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas: [[contraceptive]] access, educational programs, cultural norms and, most influentially, differing economic realities from nation to nation.

====As a result of water deficits====
[[Water deficits]], which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as China or India, if technology is not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news – India grows a grain crisis |publisher=Atimes.com |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) owing to widespread [[overdrafting]] beyond [[sustainable]] yields. Other countries affected include Pakistan, [[Iran]], and Mexico. This overdrafting is already leading to [[water scarcity]] and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China has developed a grain deficit. This effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]]. [[Desalination]] is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages.&lt;ref name="ejpress-water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/4873 |title=EJP &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; France &amp;#124; French-run water plant launched in Israel |publisher=Ejpress.org |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213050101/http://www.ejpress.org/article/4873 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edie-distinct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=11402&amp;channel=0 |title=Black &amp; Veatch-Designed Desalination Plant Wins Global Water Distinction |publisher=Edie.net |date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324144203/http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=11402&amp;channel=0 |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High [[crop yield]] vegetables like potatoes and lettuce{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} &lt;!--Lettuce is high yield?--&gt; use less space on inedible plant parts, like stalks, husks, vines, and inedible leaves. New varieties of selectively bred and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plants have larger edible parts (fruit, vegetable, grain) and smaller inedible parts; however, many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic, and new advances are more difficult to achieve. With new technologies, it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions. [[Aquaculture]] could theoretically increase available area. [[Hydroponics]] and food from bacteria and fungi, like [[quorn (food product)|quorn]], may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality, climate, or even available sunlight, although such a process may be very energy-intensive. Some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some [[marginal land]] can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. Even with the modern techniques of agriculture, the sustainability of production is in question.

It examined the time frame for the occurrence of [[peak oil]], the necessary mitigating actions, and the likely impacts based on the timeliness of those actions. It concludes that world oil peaking is going to happen, and will likely be abrupt. Initiating a mitigation crash program 20 years before peaking appears to offer the possibility of avoiding a world liquid fuels shortfall for the forecast period.

Optimists counter that fossil fuels will be sufficient until the development and implementation of suitable replacement technologies—such as nuclear power or various sources of [[renewable energy]]—occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/cs/macroeconomics/a/run_out_of_oil.htm |title=We Will Never Run Out of Oil |publisher=Economics.about.com |date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of manufacturing fertilizers from garbage, [[sewage]], and agricultural waste by using [[thermal depolymerization]] have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemley |first=Brad |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ |title=Anything Into Oil &amp;#124; Alternative Energy |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=1 May 2003 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemley |first=Brad |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/apr/anything-oil/ |title=Anything Into Oil &amp;#124; Alternative Energy |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=2 April 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing awareness about [[global warming]], the question of peak oil has become less relevant. According to many studies, about 80% of the remaining fossil fuels must be left untouched because the bottleneck has shifted from resource availability to the resource of absorbing the generated greenhouse gases when burning fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Carrington 2015.

As of 2004, there were 108 countries in the world with more than five million people. All of these in which women have, on the average, more than 4 children in their lifetime, have a per capita GDP of less than $5000. Only in two countries with per capita GDP above ~$15,000 do women have, on the average, more than 2 children in their lifetime: these are Israel and Saudi Arabia, with average lifetime births per woman between 2 and 4.

Says Peter Raven, former President of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in their seminal work [http://atlas.aaas.org/ AAAS Atlas of Population &amp; Environment], "Where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world? Clearly, the past half century has been a traumatic one, as the collective impact of human numbers, affluence (consumption per individual) and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate. ... During a remarkably short period of time, we have lost a quarter of the world's [[topsoil]] and a fifth of its agricultural land, altered the composition of the [[atmosphere]] profoundly, and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural [[habitat]]s without replacing them. Worst of all, we have driven the rate of biological [[extinction]], the permanent loss of species, up several hundred times beyond its historical levels, and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century."

Further, even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems, it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems.&lt;ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=31|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized, pollution and consumption will invariably increase.

The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said in 2006 that the booming economies of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and India are "planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere". The report states:

==Warfare and conflict==

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Champion |first=Tony |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Daniels |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Bradshaw |editor3-first=Denis |editor3-last=Shaw |editor4-first=James |editor4-last=Sidaway  |title=An Introduction to Human Geography Issues for the 21st Century Second edition|publisher=Pearson Education |year=2005 |pages=88–111 |chapter=Chapter 4: Demographic transformations |isbn=0-131-21766-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries. Modern usage of the term [[Lebensraum#Modern usage|"lebensraum"]] supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment (the [[War#Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]).

===Criticism of this hypothesis===
The [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]] has been recently criticized on empirical grounds. Two studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603173842/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 |date=3 June 2016 }}. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).

Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

{{Cquote|quote=Given the current levels of violence by this culture against both humans and the natural world, however, it's not possible to speak of reductions in population and consumption that do not involve violence and privation, not because the reductions themselves would necessarily involve violence, but because violence and privation have become the default of our culture.|author=[[Derrick Jensen]]|source=''[[Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|Endgame]]'', 2006&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jensen|first=Derrick |date=2006 |title=Endgame, Vol. 1: The Problem of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSsfg3325iEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|page=129 |isbn=978-1583227305|author-link=Derrick Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several solutions and mitigation measures have the potential to reduce overpopulation. Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level (e.g., via [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions), while some on a country or state government organization level, and some on a family or an individual level. Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social, cultural, behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms.

For example, in societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. "The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.community.peacecorpsconnect.org/view/514/utilizing-social-marking-and-social-norms-to-addresss-problems-in-the-gambia |title=Utilizing social marketing and social norms to address problems in gambia |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement. Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods. An example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is Afghanistan. "The approval by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of the Shia Personal Status Law in March 2009 effectively destroyed Shia women's rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. Under this law, women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill, and can be denied food if they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Scientists and technologists including e.g. Huesemann, Huesemann, Ehrlich and Ehrlich caution that science and technology, as currently practiced, cannot solve the serious problems global human society faces, and that a cultural-social-political shift is needed to reorient science and technology in a more socially responsible and environmentally sustainable direction.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H. and Huesemann, J.A.

=== Reducing overpopulation ===
{{Main|Human population planning}}

==== Education and empowerment ====

One option is to focus on education about overpopulation, [[family planning]], and [[birth control]] methods, and to make birth-control devices like male and [[female condom|female]] [[condoms]], [[combined oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pills]] and [[intrauterine device]]s easily available. Worldwide, nearly 40% of [[unintended pregnancy|pregnancies are unintended]] (some 80 million unintended pregnancies each year).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gevGOq7Vctd1FmJkzO3gapTqX4ZA Population growth driving climate change, poverty: experts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523114015/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gevGOq7Vctd1FmJkzO3gapTqX4ZA |date=23 May 2012 }}".

[[Egypt]] announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting [[women in the workforce]]. It was announced in June 2008 by the Minister of Health and Population, and the government has set aside 480 million Egyptian pounds (about $90 million US) for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?from=rss_Africa&amp;set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=nw20080611085517622C989460 |title=Population woes weigh down Egypt |publisher=IOL |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scientists (including e.g. [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul and Anne Ehrlich]] and [[Gretchen Daily]]) proposed that humanity should work at stabilizing its absolute numbers, as a starting point towards beginning the process of reducing the total numbers. They suggested the following solutions and policies: following a small-family-size socio-cultural-behavioral norm worldwide (especially one-child-per-family ethos), and providing contraception to all along with proper education on its use and benefits (while providing access to safe, legal abortion as a backup to contraception), combined with a significantly more equitable distribution of resources globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Business magnate [[Ted Turner]] proposed a "voluntary, non-imposed" one-child-per-family cultural norm.  A "[[Population Matters#Pledge two or fewer|pledge two or fewer]]" campaign is run by [[Population Matters]] (a UK population concern organisation), in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size.

Population planning that is intended to reduce population size or growth rate may promote or enforce one or more of the following practices, although there are other methods as well:

* Greater and better access to [[contraception]]
* Reducing [[infant mortality]] so that parents do not need to have many children to ensure at least some survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Lifeblood: How to Change the World One Dead Mosquito at a Time, Alex Perry p9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improving the [[status of women]] in order to facilitate a departure from traditional sexual division of labour.
* [[One child policy|One-Child]] and [[Two child policy|Two-Child]] policies, and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly.
* [[Family planning]]&lt;ref name="Ryerson 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryerson|first1=William N.|title=The Post Carbon Reader: Managing the 21st Century's Sustainability Crises, "Ch.12: Population: The Multiplier of Everything Else"|date=2010|publisher=Watershed Media|location=Healdsburg, Calif.|isbn=978-0970950062|pages=153–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating small family "role models"&lt;ref name="Ryerson 2010"/&gt;
* Tighter immigration restrictions

The method(s) chosen can be strongly influenced by the cultural and religious beliefs of community members.

==== Birth regulations ====

Overpopulation can be mitigated by [[birth control]]; some nations, like the People's Republic of China, use strict measures to reduce birth rates. Religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Sanjay Gandhi]], son of late Prime Minister of India [[Indira Gandhi]], implemented a forced [[compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] programme between 1975 and 1977. Officially, men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization, but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men. Some unmarried young men and political opponents may also have been sterilized {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. This program is still remembered and criticized in India, and is blamed for creating a public aversion to [[family planning]], which hampered government programs for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Vinay Lal.

Urban designer [[Michael E. Arth]] has proposed a "choice-based, marketable birth license plan" he calls "[[birth credit]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/michael_e_arth/ |title=Interview: City Architect and Reconstructor Michael E.

If that allotment was determined to be one child, for example, then the first child would be free, and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost. Extra credits would expire after a certain time, so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators. The actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual [[Cost of raising a child|cost of having and raising a child]], so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010, pp. 352-362"&gt;Arth, Michael E., ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'', Golden Apples Media, 2010, Chapter 35: "Overpopulation" pp. 352–362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Growthbydevelopedvslessdeveloped.jpg|thumb|left|350px]] Another choice-based approach, similar to Arth's birth credits, is financial compensation or other benefits (free goods and/or services) by the state (or state-owned companies) offered to people who voluntarily undergo [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]. Such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13982031 Goods for sterilization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083235/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13982031 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the United Nations estimated there is an 80% likelihood that the world's population will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion by 2100. Most of the world's expected population increase will be in Africa and southern Asia.  Africa's population is expected to rise from the current one billion to four billion by 2100, and Asia could add another billion in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzig, Robert, "A world with 11 billion people? New population projections shatter earlier estimates."

For countries with a wide base in their [[population pyramid]] it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010, pp. 352-362"/&gt;  An example of [[demographic momentum]] is China, which added perhaps 400,000 more people after its one-child policy was enacted. Arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010, pp. 352-362"/&gt;

===Extraterrestrial settlement===
{{Main article|Space colonization}}
{{See also | Space advocacy | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space }}
Various scientists and [[science fiction]] authors have contemplated that overpopulation on Earth may be remedied in the future by the use of extraterrestrial settlements. In the 1970s, [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] suggested building [[space habitats]] that could support 30,000 times the carrying capacity of Earth using just the asteroid belt, and that the [[Solar System]] as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[[The High Frontier]] (1976, 2000) [[Gerard O'Neill]], Apogee Books {{ISBN|1-896522-67-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall Savage]] (1992, 1994) has projected a human population of five [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1018|quintillion]] (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;)
throughout the Solar System by 3000, with the majority in the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Savage]], (1992, 1994) ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]].'' Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeman Dyson]] (1999) favours the [[Kuiper belt]] as the future home of humanity, suggesting this could happen within a few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]]'', [[John&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]] suggests that the resources of the solar system could support 10 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) people. In an interview, [[Stephen Hawking]] claimed that overpopulation is a threat to human existence and "our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth but to spread out into space."&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph. Stephen Hawking: mankind must move to outer space within a century. (August 2010) {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025174153/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Eric Drexler]], famous inventor of the futuristic concept of [[molecular nanotechnology]], has suggested in ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' that colonizing space will mean breaking the [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian limits]] to growth for the human species.

It may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future. [[Geoffrey A. Landis|Geoffrey Landis]] of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[Glenn Research Center]] in particular has pointed out that "[at] cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet", as one could construct [[aerostat]] habitats and [[Floating city (science fiction)|floating cities]] there easily, based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]]. [[Venus]] would, like also [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]], in the upper layers of their atmospheres, even afford a [[gravitation]] almost exactly as strong as [[g-force|that on Earth]] (''see'' [[colonization of Venus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/15570/colonizing-venus-with-floating-cities/ |title=Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities |author=Nancy Atkinson |date=16 July 2008 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[science fiction]] authors, including [[Carl Sagan]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]],&lt;ref name = clarkebipeds&gt;''Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!'' (1999) [[Arthur C. Clarke]], Voyager {{ISBN|0-00-224698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Good Earth Is Dying'' (1971) [[Isaac Asimov]] (published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that shipping any excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation. According to Clarke, "the population battle must be fought or won here on Earth".&lt;ref name = clarkebipeds/&gt; The problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space (as shown in books such as ''Mining the Sky''&lt;ref&gt;[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]] (1996) [[John&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]]. Addison Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-47959-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to "solve" overpopulation on Earth. However, [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]'s calculations show that Earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=O'Neill, Gerard K.|year=1981|title=2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-44751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[StarTram]] concept, by [[James R. Powell]] (the co-inventor of [[maglev]] transport) and others, envisions a capability to send up to 4 million people a decade to space per facility.&lt;ref name=StarTram2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startram.com/resources|title=StarTram2010: Maglev Launch: Ultra Low Cost Ultra High Volume Access to Space for Cargo and Humans|publisher=startram.com|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;nbsp;hypothetical extraterrestrial colony could potentially grow by reproduction only (i.e., without any immigration), with all of the inhabitants being the direct descendants of the original colonists.

===Urbanization===
Despite the increase in population density within cities (and the emergence of megacities), [[UN Habitat]] states in its reports that urbanization may be the best compromise in the face of global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6244496.stm |title=UN Habitat calling urban living 'a good thing |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities concentrate human activity within limited areas, limiting the breadth of environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michellenijhuis.com/ |title=National Geographic Magazine; Special report 2008: Changing Climate (Village Green-article by Michelle Nijhuis) |publisher=Michellenijhuis.com |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this mitigating influence can only be achieved if [[urban planning]] is significantly improved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2523&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 |title=UN Habitat calling to rethink urban planning |publisher=Unhabitat.org |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807191706/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2523&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and city services are properly maintained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20511">The '''industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands''' are [[radio band]]s (portions of the [[radio spectrum]]) reserved internationally for the use of [[radio frequency]] (RF) energy for industrial, scientific and medical purposes other than [[telecommunications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Examples of applications in these bands include [[Radio frequency heating|radio-frequency process heating]], [[microwave oven]]s, and medical [[diathermy]] machines.  The powerful emissions of these devices can create [[electromagnetic interference]] and disrupt [[radio communication]] using the same [[frequency]], so these devices  were limited to certain bands of frequencies. In general, communications equipment operating in these bands must tolerate any interference generated by [[ISM applications]], and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation.

Despite the intent of the original allocations, in recent years the fastest-growing uses of these bands have been for short-range, low power [[wireless communication]]s systems, since these bands can be used without a government license, as is required for transmitters on other frequencies.  [[Cordless phone]]s, [[Bluetooth]] devices, [[near field communication]] (NFC) devices, [[garage door opener]]s, [[baby monitor]]s and [[Wireless network|wireless computer networks]] ([[WiFi]]) all use the ISM frequencies, although these low power emitters are not considered ISM.

==ISM bands==
The ISM bands are defined by the [[ITU Radio Regulations]] (article 5) in footnotes 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the [[Radio Regulations]]. Individual countries' use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations.  Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway.  The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low.  In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by Part 18 of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules, while [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the [[ETSI]] is responsible for regulating the use of [[Short Range Devices]], some of which operate in ISM bands.

=== Frequency allocation ===
The allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to ''Article 5'' of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).&lt;ref&gt;''ITU Radio Regulations, CHAPTER II – Frequencies, ARTICLE 5 Frequency allocations, Section IV – Table of Frequency Allocations''&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, the majority of service-allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations which is within the responsibility of the appropriate national administration. The allocation might be primary, secondary, exclusive, and shared.
*primary allocation:  is indicated by writing in capital letters (see example below)
*secondary allocation: is indicated by small letters
*exclusive or shared utilization: is within the responsibility of administrations

==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
The ISM bands were first established at the International Telecommunications Conference of the [[ITU]] in Atlantic City, 1947. The American delegation specifically proposed several bands, including the now commonplace 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, to accommodate the then nascent process of microwave heating;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/01/S020100002B4813PDFE.pdf | title=Documents of the International Radio Conference (Atlantic City, 1947) - Doc. No. 1-100| page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, FCC annual reports of that time suggest that much preparation was done ahead of these presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| title=Thirteenth Annual Report of the FCC, June 30, 1947|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Databases/documents_collection/annual_reports/1947.pdf|pages=8, 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the proceedings:
"The delegate of the United States, referring to his request that the frequency 2450 Mc/s be allocated for I.S.M., indicated that there was in existence in the United States, and working on this frequency a diathermy machine and an electronic cooker, and that the latter might eventually be installed in transatlantic ships and airplanes. There was therefore some point in attempting to reach world agreement on this subject."

Radio frequencies in the ISM bands have been used for communication purposes, although such devices may experience interference from non-communication sources. In the United States, as early as 1958 Class D [[Citizens Band]], a Part 95 service, was allocated to frequencies that are also allocated to ISM. [1]

In the U.S., the FCC first made unlicensed [[spread spectrum]] available in the ISM bands in rules adopted on May 9, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marcus-spectrum.com/documents/81413RO.txt |format=TXT |title=Authorization of Spread Spectrum Systems Under Parts 15 and 90 of the FCC Rules and Regulations |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=June 18, 1985 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314063902/http://www.marcus-spectrum.com/documents/81413RO.txt |archivedate=March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other countries later developed similar regulations, enabling use of this technology. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The FCC action was proposed by Michael Marcus of the FCC staff in 1980 and the subsequent regulatory action took five more years. It was part of a broader proposal to allow civil use of spread spectrum technology and was opposed at the time by mainstream equipment manufacturers and many radio system operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.gmu.edu/UnlicensedWireless.php  |title=The Genesis of Unlicensed Wireless Policy |publisher=George Mason University|date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The original ISM specifications envisioned that the bands would be used primarily for noncommunication purposes, such as heating.  The bands are still widely used for these purposes.  For many people, the most commonly encountered ISM device is the home [[microwave oven]] operating at 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz which uses microwaves to cook food.  Industrial heating is another big application area; such as [[induction heating]], microwave heat treating, plastic softening, and [[plastic welding#High frequency welding|plastic welding]] processes.  In medical settings, shortwave and microwave [[diathermy]] machines use radio waves in the ISM bands to apply deep heating to the body for relaxation and healing.  More recently [[hyperthermia therapy]] uses microwaves to heat tissue to kill cancer cells.  

However, as detailed below, the increasing congestion of the radio spectrum, the increasing sophistication of [[microelectronics]], and the attraction of unlicensed use, has in recent decades led to an explosion of uses of these bands for short range communication systems for [[wireless device]]s, which are now by far the largest uses of these bands.  These are sometimes called "non ISM" uses since they do not fall under the originally envisioned "industrial", "scientific", and "medical" application areas.   One of the largest applications has been [[wireless networking]] ([[WiFi]]). The [[IEEE 802.11]] wireless networking protocols, the standards on which almost all wireless systems are based, use the ISM bands.   Virtually all [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[printer (computer)|computer printers]] and [[cellphone]]s now have 802.11 [[wireless modem]]s using the 2.4 and 5.7&amp;nbsp;GHz ISM bands. [[Bluetooth]] is another networking technology using the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, which can be problematic given the probability of interference. &lt;ref name="Why does Bluetooth still suck?"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-bluetooth-sucks-bad-problems-issues-disconnects-2018-2 |title=Why does Bluetooth still suck? |last=Eizikowitz |first=Grant |date=2018-03-05 |website=Business Insider |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Near field communication]] devices such as [[proximity card]]s and [[contactless smart card]]s use the lower frequency 13 and 27&amp;nbsp;MHz ISM bands.  Other short range devices using the ISM bands are: [[wireless microphone]]s, [[baby monitor]]s, [[garage door opener]]s, wireless [[doorbell]]s, [[keyless entry system]]s for vehicles, [[radio control]] channels for [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] (drones), wireless [[surveillance]] systems, [[radio frequency identification|RFID]] systems for merchandise, and [[animal tracking|wild animal tracking]] systems.   

Some [[electrodeless lamp]] designs are ISM devices, which use RF emissions to [[excited state|excite]] [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tubes]].  [[Sulfur lamp]]s are commercially available [[plasma lamp]]s, which use a 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz [[magnetron]] to heat sulfur into a brightly glowing [[Plasma physics|plasma]].

Long-distance [[wireless power]] systems have been proposed and experimented with which would use high-power transmitters and [[rectenna]]s, in lieu of [[overhead power line|overhead transmission lines]] and [[undergrounding|underground cables]], to send power to remote locations. [[NASA]] has studied using [[microwave power transmission]] on 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz to send energy collected by [[space-based solar power|solar power satellites]] back to the ground.

Also in space applications, a [[Helicon Double Layer Thruster|Helicon Double Layer]] [[ion thruster]] is a prototype spacecraft propulsion engine which uses a 13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz transmission to break down and heat gas into plasma.

==Non-ISM uses==
In recent years ISM bands have also been shared with (non-ISM) license-free error-tolerant communications applications such as [[wireless sensor network]]s in the 915&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2.450&amp;nbsp;GHz bands, as well as [[wireless LAN]]s and [[Cordless telephone|cordless phone]]s in the 915&amp;nbsp;MHz, 2.450&amp;nbsp;GHz, and 5.800&amp;nbsp;GHz bands. Because unlicensed devices are required to be tolerant of ISM emissions in these bands, unlicensed low power users are generally able to operate in these bands without causing problems for ISM users. ISM equipment does not necessarily include a radio receiver in the ISM band (e.g. a microwave oven does not have a receiver).

In the United States, according to 47 CFR Part 15.5, low power communication devices must accept interference from licensed users of that frequency band, and the Part 15 device must not cause interference to licensed users. Note that the 915&amp;nbsp;MHz band should not be used in countries outside [[International Telecommunication Union region|Region 2]], except those that specifically allow it, such as Australia and Israel, especially those that use the [[GSM frequency bands#GSM-900, GSM-1800 and EGSM/EGSM-900|GSM-900]] band for cellphones.  The ISM bands are also widely used for [[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) applications with the most commonly used band being the 13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz band used by systems compliant with [[ISO/IEC 14443]] including those used by [[biometric passport]]s and [[contactless smart card]]s.

In Europe, the use of the ISM band is covered by [[Short Range Device]] regulations issued by [[European Commission]], based on technical recommendations by [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] and  standards by [[ETSI]]. In most of Europe, [[LPD433]] band is allowed for license-free voice communication in addition to [[PMR446]].

[[Wireless LAN]] devices use wavebands as follows:
* [[Bluetooth]] 2450&amp;nbsp;MHz band&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8U86p2igDhsC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=Bluetooth+2450+MHz+band+falls+under+WPAN&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fOuqn2PKDE&amp;sig=IIqg8uHuMcAFpxj7DgmB65XdOl0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3stCTjYbYAhUJYo8KHYXZC4sQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Bluetooth%202450%20MHz%20band%20falls%20under%20WPAN&amp;f=false|title=International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electronic and Photonic Devices and Systems (ELECTRO-2009), December 22-24, 2009|last=Chakrabarti|first=P.|date=2009|publisher=Macmillan Publishers India|isbn=9780230328518|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} falls under [[Wireless personal area network|WPAN]]
* [[HIPERLAN]] 5800&amp;nbsp;MHz band
* [[IEEE 802.11]]/[[Wi-Fi]] 2450&amp;nbsp;MHz and 5800&amp;nbsp;MHz bands

[[IEEE 802.15.4]], [[ZigBee]] and other personal area networks may use the {{nowrap|915 MHz}} and {{nowrap|2450 MHz}} ISM bands because of frequency sharing between different allocations.

Wireless LANs and cordless phones can also use bands other than those shared with ISM, but such uses require approval on a country by country basis.  [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|DECT]] phones use allocated spectrum outside the ISM bands that differs in Europe and North America.  [[Ultra-wideband]] LANs require more spectrum than the ISM bands can provide, so the relevant standards such as [[IEEE 802.15.4a]] are designed to make use of spectrum outside the ISM bands.  Despite the fact that these additional bands are outside the official ITU-R ISM bands, because they are used for the same types of low power personal communications, they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as ISM bands as well.

Also note that several brands of radio control equipment use the {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band range for low power remote control of toys, from gas powered cars to miniature aircraft.

Worldwide Digital Cordless Telecommunications or WDCT is a technology that uses the {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} radio spectrum.

Google's [[Project Loon]] uses ISM bands (specifically 2.4 and 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz bands) for balloon-to-balloon and balloon-to-ground communications.

Pursuant to 47 CFR Part 97 some ISM bands are used by licensed [[amateur radio]] operators for communication - including [[amateur television]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15300">'''Intention to create legal relations'''', otherwise "'''intention to be legally bound'''", is a [[Contract theory|doctrine]] used in [[contract law]], particularly [[English contract law]] and related [[common law]] jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt; As in the New Zealand case of ''[[Welch v Jess]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine establishes whether a court should presume that parties to an agreement wish it to be enforceable at law, and it states that an [[agreement in English law|agreement]] is legally enforceable only if the parties are deemed to have intended it to be a binding contract.

==Identifying intention to create legal relations==
A contract is a legally binding [[Meeting of minds|agreement]]. Once an offer has been accepted, there is an agreement, but not necessarily a contract. The element that converts any agreement into a true contract is "intention to create legal relations". There must be evidence that the parties intended the agreement to be subject to the law of contract. If evidence of intent is found, the agreement gives rise to legal obligations whereby any party in breach may be sued.

In [[English law]], there are '''two''' judicial devices to help a court to decide whether there is intent: the earlier '''[[objective test]]''', &amp; the later '''[[rebuttable presumption]]'''. Both tests are used together in combination.

* '''The objective test'''
[[Image:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|right|The reasonable man would deem that the [[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company|Company's]] offer was intended to be binding.]]
Counterintuitively, the best way of discovering whether the parties intended to contract is '''not''' to ask them, as this "subjective test"  would give the rogue an easy loophole to escape liability. (He would reply, "No!".) Instead, just as in ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256&lt;/ref&gt; the court applies the "objective test" and asks whether the reasonable bystander, after taking into account all the circumstances of the case, thinks that the parties intended to be bound.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Carlill'', the contract was unilateral, with only one promise, so that only the company was bound.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advertisement (pictured) stated that the company had "deposited £1,000 in the Alliance Bank to show sincerity in the matter", the court held that any objective bystander who read this would presume an intention to contract.

* '''The rebuttable presumption'''
The rebuttable presumption establishes a burden of proof; but the burden may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.  The civil standard of proof is "a balance of probabilities", while the criminal standard of proof is "beyond reasonable doubt".  Here, different presumptions will apply, according to the class of agreement.  For these purposes, there are four classes of agreement:
* Family agreements: a presumption of NO contract
* Social agreements (i.e. agreements between friends): no presumption (case decided on its merits, using the objective test)
* Commercial agreements: a presumption of a VALID contract
* Collective agreements: a presumption of NO contract

==The four classes==
* '''Family agreements''': a presumption of NO contract
Family agreements are presumed '''not''' to give rise to legal relations, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. The courts will dismiss agreements which for policy reasons should not be legally enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Koffman, Macdonald, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, [[Lord Atkin]] held in ''[[Balfour v Balfour]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Balfour v Balfour'' [1919] 2 KB 571&lt;/ref&gt; (where a husband promised his wife to pay maintenance while he worked in [[Ceylon]]) that there was no "intention to be legally bound", even though the wife was relying upon the payments. The judge stated that as a general rule, agreements between spouses would not be legally enforceable:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The matter really reduces itself to an absurdity when one considers it, because if we were to hold that there was a contract in this case we should have to hold that with regard to all the more or less trivial concerns of life where a wife, at the request of her husband, makes a promise to him, that is a promise which can be enforced in law.&lt;ref&gt;per Warrington LJ, [1919] 2 KB 571, pp. 574-575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In a more modern case, ''[[Jones v Padavatton]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v Padavatton'' [1969] 1 WLR 328&lt;/ref&gt; the court applied ''Balfour v Balfour'' and declared that a mother's promise to allow her daughter an allowance plus the use of a house provided that she left the USA to study for the [[English Bar]] was not an enforceable contract.

However, if there is clear intent to be contractually bound, the presumption is rebutted.  In ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' [1970],&lt;ref&gt;''Merritt v Merritt'' [1970] 2 All ER 760, [1970] 1 WLR 1211&lt;/ref&gt; a separation agreement between estranged spouses was enforceable.  In ''[[Beswick v Beswick]]'' [1967]&lt;ref&gt;''Beswick v Beswick'' [1967] AC 58&lt;/ref&gt; an uncle's agreement to sell a coal delivery business to his nephew was enforceable.  Also, in ''[[Errington v Errington]]'' [1952], a father's promise to his son and daughter-in-law that they could live in (and ultimately own) a house if they paid off the balance of the mortgage, was an enforceable [[unilateral contract]].

* '''Social agreements''': NO presumption, the case being decided solely on its merits
''Although many sources consider "Social and Domestic Agreements" to be a single class, it is better to regard "Family Agreements" as a class  separate from "Social Agreements", as the latter invokes ''no'' presumption, and ''only'' the objective test applies.''

In ''[[Simpkins v Pays]]'' [1955],&lt;ref&gt;''Simpkins v Pays'' [1955] 1 WLR 975&lt;/ref&gt; an informal agreement between a grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger to share competition winnings was binding. Sellers J held, applying the objective test, that the facts showed a "mutuality" between the parties, adding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If my conclusion that there was an arrangement to share any prize money is not correct, the alternative position to that of these three persons competing together as a "syndicate", as counsel for the plaintiff put it, would mean that the plaintiff, despite her propensity for having a gamble, suddenly abandoned all her interest in the competition in the ''[[Sunday Empire News]]''. I think that that is most improbable ... .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Coward v MIB]]'' [1962],&lt;ref&gt;''Coward v M.I.B.'' [1962] 1 All ER 531 CA&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that when a motorcyclist regularly gave a friend a pillion lift in return for some remuneration in cash or in kind, there was '''no''' contract.&lt;ref&gt;The court had so decided presumably to prevent a finding of the bike being used "for hire or reward", beyond the scope of the "social, domestic &amp; pleasure" policy.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in ''[[Connell v MIB]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''Connell v M.I.B.'' [1969] 3 All ER 572 CA&lt;/ref&gt; a case with materially similar facts, [[Lord Denning]] (violating the rule that the Court of Appeal was bound by its own decisions) said, "I am not satisfied by the decision in ''Coward''. I think that when one person regularly gives a lift to another in return for money, there ''is'' a contract, albeit informal". In a similar "lifts for friends case", ''[[Coward v MIB|Albert v MIB]]'' [1971],&lt;ref&gt;''Albert v M.I.B.'' [1971] 2 All ER 1345&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] [[Mechanisms of the English common law#TheMechanisms|approved]] Denning's decision in ''Connell'' (so that ''Coward'' may be considered bad law).

* '''Commercial agreements''': Business transactions incur a strong presumption of a VALID contract
[[Image:Handshake (Workshop Cologne '06).jpeg|thumb|right|Business transactions are presumed to be binding contracts.]]
These agreements where the parties deal as though they were strangers, are presumed to be binding. However, "Honour Clauses" in "Gentlemen's' Agreements" will be recognised as negating intention to create legal relations, as in ''Jones v Vernons Pools'' [1938]&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v Vernons Pools'' [1938] 2 All ER 626&lt;/ref&gt; (where the clause "this agreement is binding in honour only" was effective). One must be careful not to draft a clause so as to attempt to exclude a court's jurisdiction, as the clause will be void, as in ''Baker v Jones'' [1954].&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v Jones'' [1954] 1 WLR 1005&lt;/ref&gt; If a contract has both an "honour clause" and a clause that attempts to exclude a court's jurisdiction (as in ''[[Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd|Rose &amp; Frank v Crompton]]'' [1925]&lt;ref&gt;''Rose &amp; Frank v Crompton'' [1925] AC 445&lt;/ref&gt;) the court may apply the ''blue pencil rule'', which strikes out the offending part. The court will then recognise the remainder, provided it still makes sense, and remains in accord with the parties' bargain. The offending clause was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written, as a formal or legal agreement, and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England, but it is only a definite expression and record of the purpose and intention of the three parties concerned, to which they each honourably pledge themselves with the fullest confidence - based on past business with each other - that it will be carried through by each of the three parties with mutual loyalty and friendly co-operation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the words "and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England," are "blue-pencilled out", the remainder becomes legally acceptable, while staying true to the intended meaning.

The party asserting an absence of legal relations must prove it; and any terms seeking to rebut the presumption must be clear and unambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, Cheshire, Simpson, Fifoot, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Where in ''[[Edwards v Skyways Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v Skyways Ltd'' [1964] 1 WLR 349&lt;/ref&gt; a bonus payment, described as '[[ex gratia]]', was promised to an employee, this was found to be legally binding. He had relied upon the promise in accepting a redundancy package, and his employer could not adequately prove that they had not intended their promise to become a contractual term.&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, Cheshire, Simpson, Fifoot, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Collective agreements''' : a presumption of NO contract (unless parties agree otherwise in writing)
A [[collective agreement]] is a special type of commercial agreement, such as one negotiated through [[collective bargaining]] between management and [[trades union]]s. At [[English common law|common law]], ''[[Ford v A.U.E.F.]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''Ford v A.U.E.F.'' [1969] 2 QB 303&lt;/ref&gt; the courts held that collective agreements were '''not''' binding.&lt;ref&gt;In Germany, where employers and employees regard themselves as "[[social partner]]s", collective agreements have always been enforceable; in England, the class war intervened to maintain a mutual distrust, hence the current status of such agreements.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], introduced by [[Robert Carr]] (Employment Minister in [[Edward Heath]]'s cabinet), provided that collective agreements '''were''' binding, unless a contact clause ''in writing'' declared otherwise. After the demise of the [[Heath ministry|Heath government]], the law was reversed.&lt;ref name="Honeyball2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Honeyball|title=Honeyball and Bowers' Textbook on Employment Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sdb1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-968562-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is now contained in the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] s.179:

:"Any collective agreement made after the commencement of this section shall be conclusively presumed not to have been intended  by the parties to be a legally enforceable contract, unless the agreement:
::(a) is in writing, and
::(b) contains a provision which states that the parties intend that the agreement shall be a legally enforceable contract".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/179 Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s.179]&lt;/ref&gt;

This reflects the tradition in British industrial relations policy of legal abstentionism from workplace disputes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} By contrast, in post-war Germany, employers and employees bathe in the luxurious title of "[[social partner]]s", and they are content that collective agreements are binding.

==The Civil Law approach==
In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]], the concept of intention to create legal relations&lt;ref&gt;in Latin: (''animus contrahendi'' or ''obligandi'')&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the "will theory" of contracts as espoused by German jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] in his nineteenth century work ''[[System des heutigen Römischen Rechts]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, [http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22199236%22 System des heutigen Römischen Rechts] (1840) online, in German&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a prominent concept through the nineteenth century that contracts were based on a [[meeting of minds]] between two or more parties, and that their mutual consent to a bargain, or their intention to contract, were paramount.  While it is generally true that courts wish to uphold the parties' intentions,&lt;ref&gt;''[[BCCI v Ali]]'' and ''[[HIH v Chase Manhattan Bank]]''&lt;/ref&gt; courts moved in the later half of the nineteenth century to a more objective stance for interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871] LR 6 QB 597&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the emphasis moved to the way in which the parties had manifested their consent to a bargain to the outside world. Given this change, it was still said that "intention to be legally bound" was a necessary element for a contract, but it came to reflect a policy about when to enforce agreements, and when not to.

'''International trade law''' includes the appropriate rules and customs for handling trade between countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/dynamic/guide.php?id=60#toc0|title=International Trade Law|last=Library|first=University of California Berkeley School of Law|website=www.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also used in legal writings as trade between private sectors, which is not right. This branch of law is now an independent field of study as most governments have become part of the world trade, as members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Since the transaction between private sectors of different countries is an important part of the WTO activities, this latter branch of law is now a very important part of the academic works and is under study in many universities across the world.

==Overview==
International trade law should be distinguished from the broader field of [[international economic law]].  The latter could be said to encompass not only WTO law, but also law governing the international [[monetary system]] and [[currency]] regulation, as well as the law of [[international development]].

The body of rules for transnational trade in the 21st century derives from medieval commercial laws called the ''[[lex mercatoria]]'' and ''[[lex maritima]]'' — respectively, "the law for merchants on land" and "the law for merchants on the sea." Modern trade law (extending beyond bilateral treaties) began shortly after the [[Second World War]], with the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to deal with trade in goods: the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).

International trade law is based on theories of [[economic liberalism]] developed in [[Europe]] and later the [[United States]] from the 18th century onwards.

International Trade Law is an aggregate of legal rules of “international legislation” and new lex mercatoria, regulating relations in international trade. '''“International legislation”''' – international treaties and acts of international intergovernmental organizations regulating relations in international trade.
'''lex mercatoria'''  - "the law for merchants on land". Alok Narayan defines "lex mercatoria" as "any law relating to businesses" which was criticised by Professor Julius Stone.
and 
'''lex maritime'''  - "the law for merchants on sea. Alok in his recent article criticised this definition to be "too narrow" and "merely-creative". Professor Dodd and Professor Malcolm Shaw of Leeds University supported this proposition.

==World Trade Organization==
In 1995, the [[World Trade Organization]], a formal international organization to regulate trade, was established.  It is the most important development in the history of international trade law.

The purposes and structure of the organization is governed by the ''Agreement Establishing The World Trade Organization'', also known as the "[[Marrakesh Agreement]]".  It does not specify the actual rules that govern international trade in specific areas. These are found in separate treaties, annexed to the Marrakesh Agreement.

The scope of WTO :

(a) provide a framework for administration and implementation of agreements;
(b) forum for further negotiations;
(c) trade policy review mechanism; and
(d) promote greater coherence among members economics policies

Principles of the WTO:

(a) A principle of non-discrimination (most-favored-nation treatment obligation and the national treatment obligation)
(b) market access (reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade) 
(c) balancing trade liberalization and other societal interests
(d) harmonization of national regulation (TRIPS agreement, TBT agreement, SPS agreement)

==Trade in goods==
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) has been the backbone of international trade law since 1948 after the charter for international trade had been agreed upon in [[Havana]].  It contains rules relating to "unfair" trading practices — [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. Many things impacted GATT like the [[Uruguay Round]] and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1994 the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established to take the place of the GATT. This is because the GATT was meant to be a temporary fix to trade issues, and the founders hoped for something more concrete. It took many years for this to come about, however, because of the lack of money. The British Economy was in crisis and there was not much backing from Congress to pass the new agreement.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The idea of these agreements ( WTO and [http://search.proquest.com/docview/220713673/4FC715D36F734E68PQ/20?accountid=26218 GATT] was to create an equal field for all countries in trade. This way all countries got something of equal value out of the trade. This was a difficult thing to do since every country has a different economy size. This led to the [[Trade Expansion Act|Trade Expansion act]] of 1962.{{[[Trade_Expansion_Act]}}

==Trade and intellectual property==
The World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ([[TRIPS]]) agreement required signatory nations to raise [[intellectual property rights]] (also known as intellectual monopoly privileges). This arguably has had a negative impact on access to essential medicines in some nations such as less developed countries, as the local economy is not as capable of producing more technical products such as pharmaceuticals.

==Cross-border transactions==

Cross-border operations are subject to taxation by more than one country. Commercial activity that occurs among several jurisdictions or countries is called a cross-border transaction. Those involved in any international business development or international trade should be knowledgeable in [[International taxation|tax law]], as every country enforces different laws on foreign businesses. International tax planning ensures that cross-border businesses stay tax compliant and avoid or lessen [[double taxation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Dispute settlement==

Most prominent in the area of dispute settlement in international trade law is the WTO dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement body is operational since 1995 and has been very active since then with 369 cases in the time between 1 January 1995 and 1 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van den Bossche|first=Peter|title=The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization - Text, Cases and Materials|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Maastricht University|isbn=978-0-521-72759-4|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly a quarter of disputes reached an amicable solution, in other cases the parties to the dispute resorted to adjudication. The WTO dispute settlement body has exclusive and compulsory jurisdiction over disputes on WTO law (Article 23.1 Dispute Settlement Understanding&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = "Governance of International Trade Under World Trade Organization Agreements-Relationships Between World Trade Organization Agreements and Other Trade Agreements."|url = Http://search.proquest.com/docview/217554638/4FC715D36F734E68PQ/3?accountid=26218}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Juan A. Rivera Jr.''' (born October 31, 1972) is an American man who was wrongfully convicted three times for the 1992 rape and murder of 11-year-old Holly Staker in [[Waukegan, Illinois]]. He was convicted twice on the basis of a confession that he claims was coerced. No physical evidence linked him to the crime scene. [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]] done in 2004 on [[semen]] taken from the crime scene ruled out Rivera as the source; however, the prosecution argued that the semen sample came from previous consensual sex with another man, and Rivera was convicted a third time. His conviction was overturned by the [[appellate court]], which took the unusual step of barring prosecutors from retrying Rivera, and he was released.&lt;ref name=Appeal&gt;{{cite news|title=People V. Rivera|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/il-court-of-appeals/1588686.html|agency=Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Rivera's attorneys asked the courts to order genetic testing on Rivera's shoes, which the prosecution had tried to enter into evidence in 1993. The shoes had Staker's blood on them, but the prosecution withdrew the evidence prior to Rivera's first trial when it was discovered that the shoes were not available for sale anywhere in the United States until after the murder. DNA testing conducted on the shoes in 2015 indicated that the blood indeed belonged to Staker, but also contained another genetic sample &amp;ndash; one that matched the semen sample. Rivera's defense team insists that this is proof not only that the blood was [[Tampering with evidence|planted]], but that the real killer's DNA was inadvertently planted as well. The DNA has yet to be matched to an individual but has been linked to DNA from another home invasion and murder. The man convicted of that crime also claims he was wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;&lt;ref name="ordered tests"/&gt;

Following his [[exoneration]], Rivera was awarded $20 million, the largest wrongful conviction settlement in United States history, including $2 million from John E. Reid &amp; Associates, who were known for the [[Reid technique]] of questioning suspects. This technique has been widely criticized for its history of eliciting confessions that were later determined to be false. Rivera was questioned twice at Reid headquarters by an employee of the company during his  interrogation, which lasted for several days.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meincke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Starr&gt;{{cite news|last1=Starr|first1=Douglas|title=Juan Rivera and the Dangers of Coercive Interrogation|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/juan-rivera-and-the-dangers-of-coercive-interrogation|agency=The New Yorker|date=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Holly Staker==
On August 17, 1992, police received a call from a woman in Waukegan, Illinois, who reported that the babysitter for her two children, 11-year-old Holly Staker, was missing and the back door to the apartment had been kicked in. Staker's partially clothed body was found on the floor of the children's bedroom. She had been [[rape]]d, stabbed 27 times, and [[Strangulation|strangled]]. Vaginal and anal swabs tested positive for semen.&lt;ref name=Appeal/&gt;

Evidence technicians took fingerprints and blood samples found in the bedroom and near the kitchen sink, where it appeared someone had washed blood off their hands.&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;{{cite news|title=Juan Rivera|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3850|agency=The National Registry of Exonerations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;

==Investigation==
On September 29, 1992, police received a tip from a prison inmate that another inmate, [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]]-born&lt;ref name=Freed&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Ruth|last2=Hinkel|first2=Dan|title=Freed after 20 years, Juan Rivera adjusts to life outside prison|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-13/news/ct-met-juan-rivera-interview-20120113_1_holly-staker-prison-yard-stateville-correctional-center|work=Chicago Tribune|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Rivera, believed he knew who killed Staker.  According to the informant, Rivera told him he was at a party that night near the crime scene and saw a man acting suspiciously. Rivera was described by the police as friendly and cooperative when he was interviewed and agreed to provide samples of his blood and hair. He told police he was at a party near the crime scene, when another man, whom he identified as Robert Hurley, left the party more than once before later returning sweaty, out of breath, and with a fresh scratch. Further investigation revealed there was no party at the residence on August 17, leading to greater suspicion of Rivera.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Case No. 92 CF 2751 People of the state of Illinois v. Juan A. Rivera Jr|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/documents/rivera_brief.pdf|agency=Appellate Court of Illinois|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivera was questioned for many hours over the course of several days and eventually admitted to killing Staker. Following the confession, jail personnel saw Rivera, who had a history of [[mental illness]], beating his head against the wall of his cell. A prison nurse determined that Rivera was in an acute psychotic state and was "not in touch with the reality of what was going on around him". Several hours later, detectives entered the room Rivera was in and had him sign the summary account taken by detectives. Detectives reviewed the statement and agreed that many details given by Rivera were inconsistent with the known facts of the crime; it was decided that two other members of the Task Force would re-interview Rivera to try to clear up these "inconsistencies".&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;

Rivera's mental state had not improved by the time the next interview was to take place, so he was placed in heavy restraints and a prison psychiatrist prescribed [[Haldol]], [[Cogentin]], and [[Ativan]]. Rivera signed a rights waiver and the interrogation resumed. A detective told Rivera that "there were a lot of questions concerning facts" in his previous statement and that "he wanted to give Mr. Rivera an opportunity to tell the truth on some of those issues". During this interview, detectives suggested details such as, "She had a multi-colored shirt on, right, Juan?" He had previously misidentified her clothing. The confession that was eventually settled on was closer to the known facts about the crime, but still contained a number of inconsistencies with the crime scene.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;

No physical evidence was found linking him to the crime and the fingerprints taken from the crime scene did not match Rivera. At the time of the crime, Rivera was wearing an electronic monitor from a previous conviction. [[Ankle monitor|Electronic monitoring]] system records showed that Rivera did not leave his home on August 17, 1992. Phone records also showed a call from Rivera's home to a relative in Puerto Rico that evening.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;

==Trials==
Rivera was charged with [[first-degree murder]] on the basis of his confession. He was convicted in November 1993.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;

Rivera's first conviction was overturned and he was retried in 1998. Taylor Arena, the child whom Staker had been babysitting, testified at this trial. Arena, who was only 2 years old at the time of Staker's murder and 8 at the time of the retrial, testified that she remembered the events of the evening and identified Rivera as the man who had attacked Staker.  After four days of deliberation, the jury acquitted him of the first-degree murder charge, but convicted him on three other murder counts.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;   He was sentenced to [[life without parole]].&lt;ref name="second trial appeal"&gt;{{cite news|title=No. 92—CF—2751 The people of the State of Illinois v. Juan A. Rivera|url=http://www.state.il.us/court/opinions/appellatecourt/2002/2nddistrict/march/html/2981662.htm|agency=The appellate court of Illinois—second district}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA testing==
In 2004, Rivera filed a motion to test the [[DNA]] from the vaginal swabs taken from the crime scene. The motion was granted and DNA testing excluded Rivera as the source of the semen sample.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt; Rivera's conviction was vacated a second time.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Andrew|title=The Prosecution's Case Against DNA|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/dna-evidence-lake-county.html|work=The New York Times|date=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Innocence Project"&gt;{{cite news|title=Juan Rivera|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/cases-false-imprisonment/juan-rivera|accessdate=6 May 2015|agency=The Innocence Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the DNA evidence, prosecutors made the controversial decision to retry the case, arguing that Staker may have been sexually active or that lab technicians mishandled the DNA. Defense experts noted that if Staker had intercourse prior to the fatal attack, semen would have been found on her panties. Tests on her undergarments were negative for sperm.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt; Her twin sister also denied that Holly was sexually active.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

On April 13, 2009, Rivera's third jury trial began. On May 8, the jury found Rivera guilty and he was sentenced to life in prison for the third time.&lt;ref name="Innocence Project"/&gt;

==Conviction overturned==
In December 2011, Rivera's conviction was overturned a third and final time.&lt;ref name="2011 opinion"&gt;{{cite news|title=People v. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060|url=http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2091060.pdf|agency=Illinois Appellate Court|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate court criticized the confession, noting the complete absence of any information that was not previously known to members of the investigation team. Each time Rivera gave information that was not already known, the information proved to be false. For example, Rivera claimed to have burned his clothing in a specific dumpster; there was no evidence of a previous fire in that dumpster. He also told investigators that there was another child at the scene &amp;ndash; a boy &amp;ndash; when there was only a 2-year-old girl. The only details Rivera was able to give investigators that could be corroborated were details that were already known to them.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2011 opinion"/&gt;

The appellate court also criticized the prosecution for dismissing the DNA evidence. The prosecution presented two possible theories as to how the DNA could eliminate Rivera: contamination and previous sex with another man. Regarding the contamination theory, where they speculated that no sperm was recovered from the autopsy, but someone else's sperm came in contact with the swab sometime later, the courts dismissed it as "highly improbable".&lt;ref name="2011 opinion"/&gt;

The courts similarly dismissed the theory that the victim was sexually active. The evidence presented by the prosecution to support Staker's being sexually active was evidence concerning an incident when she was molested at the age of 8 and an incident of masturbation, and extensive testimony about a pair of red lace panties that she owned. The defense argued that this evidence should never have been introduced because it violated the [[rape shield law]]. Typically, this law is invoked by prosecutors to limit the argument by the defense that the victim is the "type of person" who is more likely to engage in sexual activity; however, the law also bars prosecutors from presenting the same type of evidence.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2011 opinion"/&gt; Regarding the State's theories on why the DNA did not match, they wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The State's theories distort to an absurd degree the real and undisputed testimony that the sperm was deposited shortly before the victim died. Simply put, the States rationalizations of how the DNA from "Unidentified Male #1" came to be found in the victim's body and why none of the defendant's DNA appeared in or around the victim or anywhere at the crime scene cannot save a conviction obtained on a theory of a violent sexual assault and murder. The State did not present any evidence that the victim was in a relationship with anyone. The most reasonable explanation, therefore, of who murdered the victim is not the defendant but rather someone who, unfortunately, has not yet been identified.&lt;ref name="2011 opinion"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trial judge was also criticized for precluding the defense from presenting multiple pieces of exculpatory evidence, including testimony from experts regarding false confessions. Several risk factors were present in this case, including a history of mental illness, Rivera's mental state during the interrogation, and multiple interrogation techniques that are known to increase the likelihood of a false confession. The jury was also led to believe that Rivera failed a [[Polygraph|polygraph test]]. The defense was then precluded from telling the jury the actual results, which were inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Appellate 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2011 opinion"/&gt;

Following the reversal, the appellate court took the extraordinary step of barring prosecutors from retrying the defendant.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;

===Knife===
In 2014, former Waukegan police chief Dan Greathouse, who is handling the re-investigation of the Staker case, told Rivera's attorneys about the existence of a knife found near the crime scene. In 1994, a neighbor uprooted a bush between his house and the murder scene and found a serrated knife. Rivera's attorneys were not notified about the existence of the weapon, and it was destroyed without any testing. In the original investigation, police found a broken, straight-edged knife in a nearby yard. No physical evidence connected the weapon to the crime, but prosecutors argued that it was the murder weapon. Rivera confessed that he had broken the knife during the crime and then discarded it.&lt;ref name=knife&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinkel|first1=Dan|last2=Mills|first2=Steve|title=Police destroyed knife discovered near scene of baby sitter's slaying|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-21/news/ct-rivera-murder-knife-met-20140121_1_holly-staker-knife-baby-sitter|work=Chicago Tribune|date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Russell Ainsworth, one of Rivera's lawyers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The knife is hugely important. It's the potential murder weapon in the case. It could have had the real killer's DNA on it, and it could exclude without any doubt the notion that Juan Rivera had anything to do with this case. To destroy evidence without giving the defense the chance to test it goes against any sense of fairness and justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rivera's lawyers said that a forensic expert they consulted ruled that Staker's wounds point to a knife with a serrated blade rather than a straight edge.&lt;ref name=knife/&gt;

===Shoes===
After Rivera's conviction was overturned, his attorney sought to conduct further genetic testing on a piece of evidence that prosecutors attempted to introduce at his trial in 1993: a pair of shoes owned by Rivera that had Staker's blood on them. The shoes were collected a few weeks after Rivera's arrest from a fellow inmate when he traded them for a television set.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;&lt;ref name="ordered tests"/&gt;

Prosecutors announced that they would introduce this critical piece of evidence--the only physical evidence linking Rivera to the crime. An investigation by the defense revealed that the [[Voit]] sneakers, made in [[Hong Kong]], were not available for purchase in the United States until sometime after the murder. The defense took the further step of contacting the [[Walmart]] store where the shoes had been purchased and obtaining proof that the purchase took place after the murder.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;&lt;ref name="ordered tests"/&gt; Prosecutors withdrew the evidence.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;&lt;ref name="ordered tests"/&gt;

In 2015, a federal judge ordered DNA testing to investigate the allegations of evidence tampering. The results showed that the blood on the shoes indeed belonged to Staker, but that it contained a second genetic profile &amp;ndash; one that matched the semen sample taken from the crime scene. "The only realistic inference from the foregoing evidence is that someone endeavored to plant Holly Staker's blood on Mr. Rivera's Voit shoes and in doing so inadvertently planted both her blood there and the blood of the as-yet unidentified killer", said Rivera's attorney.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=Steve|title=Attorneys: Police planted blood on Juan Rivera's shoes in Waukegan slaying|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-juan-rivera-shoes-met-20141210-story.html#page=1|work=Chicago Tribune|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordered tests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinkel|first1=Dan|last2=Mills|first2=Steve|title=Judge orders tests for alleged evidence tampering in Juan Rivera case|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-juan-rivera-shoes-test-met-20150130-story.html|work=Chicago Tribune|date=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Delwin Foxworth==
Following the DNA testing on evidence from the Staker crime scene, a match was found with DNA taken from evidence in the murder of a [[Chicago]] man. Thirty-nine-year-old Delwin Foxworth was reportedly attacked by three burglars in his Chicago home in January 2000. He was held at gunpoint and tied up before being beaten with a board, doused with gasoline, and set on fire. He was able to extinguish the flames and seek help but later died in August 2002 as a result of his injuries. Foxworth's girlfriend, who witnessed the attack, identified Marvin Tyrone Williford as the killer. Williford was tried largely on that evidence; no physical evidence linked him to the crime.&lt;ref name=Mills2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=Steve|last2=Hinckel|first2=Dan|title=DNA links murder and rape of Holly Staker, 11, to second murder 8 years later|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-10/news/chi-dna-links-murder-and-rape-of-holly-staker-11-to-second-murder-8-years-later-20140610_1_holly-staker-dna-evidence-dna-match|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crimesider Staff|title=DNA links 1992 slaying of Ill. girl, 11, to another murder|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dna-links-1992-murder-of-illinois-girl-11-to-another-murder/|publisher=CBS News|date=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted of the crime and is serving an 80-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBS News"/&gt;

Williford's attorneys insist that the DNA from the Staker crime scene proves his innocence. "While Mr. Rivera fought to clear his name and officials fought to keep him in prison, the man who really committed the crime was free to commit this additional crime", said Steven Art, one of Rivera's attorneys. "It's the antithesis of good policing in our society. The community suffers as well". The DNA profile has been entered into [[DNA database|criminal databases]], but has not yet been identified.&lt;ref name="ordered tests"/&gt;

==Settlement==
Rivera received a US$20 million settlement, the largest-ever settlement for a wrongful conviction in U.S. history. City attorney Steve Martin told the council that the settlement is
&lt;blockquote&gt;the best economic decision the city could make in this case. We all agreed that this was an excellent settlement for the city of Waukegan. I understand it's a lot of money, but considering the downside that could have occurred in a courtroom with the case, it was felt economically, it would be extremely beneficial to the city to pay out that amount of money.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moran|first1=Dan|title=Man freed after 20 years in prison for murder gets $7.5 million from Waukegan|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/news/ct-lns-rivera-settlement-st-0506-20150505-story.html|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meincke&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meincke|first1=Paul|title=Juan Rivera wins largest wrongful conviction settlement in U.S. history |url=http://abc7chicago.com/news/man-wins-largest-wrongful-conviction-settlement-in-us-history/566716/|agency=ABC 7|date=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Kentucky v. King''''', 563 U.S. 452 (2011), was a decision by the [[US Supreme Court|United States Supreme Court]] which held that [[Warrantless searches in the United States|warrantless searches]] conducted in police-created [[Exigent circumstance in United States law|exigent circumstances]] do not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] so long as the police did not create the exigency by violating or threatening to violate the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{ussc|name=Kentucky v. King|volume=563|page=452|pin=|year=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

=== Legal Background ===
The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] requires searches and seizures be reasonable. The Court has held a search or seizure without a warrant presumptively unreasonable. However, there are many exceptions to the warrant requirement, including [[exigent circumstance]]s, [[Searches incident to a lawful arrest|search incident to arrest]], [[consent search]], [[Plain view doctrine|plain view]], [[Motor vehicle exception|automobile exception]], and [[border search exception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment|title=Fourth Amendment|last=Strasser|first=Mr. Ryan|date=2008-07-16|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncids.org/Defender%20Training/2004%20Fall%20Conference/Exceptions.pdf|title=Valid Searches and Seizures Without Warrants|last=Doran Brooks|first=Jeanette|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kentucky v. King'' involves the [[exigent circumstance]]s exception to the warrant requirement. The Court has identified three exigent circumstances: [[Emergency Aid Doctrine|emergency aid]], [[hot pursuit]], and [[destruction of evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wakeforestlawreview.com/2013/04/kentucky-v-king-the-one-where-the-supreme-court-dishonors-the-warrant-requirement-in-drug-cases/|title=Kentucky v. King: The One Where the Supreme Court Dishonors the Warrant Requirement in Drug Cases|date=2013-04-01|work=Wake Forest Law Review|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emergency Aid Doctrine|"emergency aid]]” exception allows officers to enter a home without a warrant to provide assistance to an occupant who is injured or under imminent threat of injury.&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{ussc|name=Brigham City v. Stuart|link=|volume=547|page=398|pin=|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Mincey v. Arizona|volume=437|page=385|pin=|year=1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The “hot pursuit” exception allows officers to pursue a fleeing suspect onto protected property without a warrant. The "destruction of evidence" exception permits warrantless entry when officers reasonably believe the occupants are destroying evidence of a crime.

Before ''Kentucky v. King'' was decided, lower courts had developed the “police-created exigency” doctrine, which stated that police may not create exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court confronted the “police-created exigency” doctrine in ''Kentucky v. King.''

=== Facts of the Case ===
Police officers in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], set up a drug buy outside of an apartment complex using an undercover informant. After the suspect sold the informant crack cocaine, Officer Gibson, who was undercover watching the transaction from a nearby unmarked vehicle, called in uniformed officers to pursue the suspect. The officers pursued the suspect into a breezeway and lost sight of him. They heard a door close but, when they got to the end of the breezeway, they encountered two door and did not know whether the suspect entered the apartment on the right or the left. Officer Gibson did see the suspect enter the door on the right, but the other officers did not hear his radio transmission because it went to their vehicle.

While the officers did not know which apartment the suspect was in, they could smell burning marijuana coming from inside the apartment on the left. Per one of the officer's testimony, the officers began banging on the left door “as loud as [they] could” and announced, “‘This is the police’” or “‘Police, police, police,’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/opinion.html|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which they heard movements which they believed indicated evidence was going to be destroyed. They announced they were going to enter and kicked down the door. They found Hollis King, the defendant, his girlfriend, and a guest who was smoking marijuana. Upon a further search of the home, they found cash, drugs, and paraphernalia.

=== Procedural Posture ===
King entered a conditional guilty plea in the Fayette Circuit Court, reserving his right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from what he argued was an illegal search. The court sentenced King to eleven years in prison. The [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances supporting the warrantless search were not of the police's making and that police did not engage in deliberate and intentional conduct to evade the warrant requirement. In January 2010, the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] reversed the lower court order, finding that the entry was improper. They reserved the issue of whether what the officers heard was sufficient to establish exigent circumstances. Even assuming exigent circumstances did exist, though, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that (1) officers cannot create exigent circumstances in bad faith and (2) even without bad faith, police cannot rely on exigent circumstances that are reasonably foreseeable from the officers' actions. They held the officers in this case violated the Fourth Amendment under the second theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/opinion.html|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issue ==
Whether the exigent circumstances rule, which allows police officers to conduct a warrantless search, applies where the police create the exigent circumstance without violating or threatening to violate the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/opinion.html|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
Justice [[Samuel Alito|Alito]] delivered the opinion of the Court, holding that, assuming for purposes of argument that exigent circumstances did exist, the exigent circumstances rule applies because the officers did not create the exigency by violating or threatening to violate the Fourth Amendment.

Justice Alito clarified the police-created exigency doctrine which had been percolating in the lower courts. He explains that the answer to this question, just as with any other Fourth Amendment question, is about reasonableness: "the exigent circumstances rule justifies a warrantless search when the conduct of the police preceding the exigency is reasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment, warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/opinion.html|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejects rules that impose requirements beyond lawful conduct, including bad faith; reasonable foreseeability; probable cause and time to secure a warrant; and standard or good investigative tactics. He also rejects King's proposed rule, which would prohibit officers from creating an exigency by “engag[ing] in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is imminent and inevitable,” for turning on "subtleties" and requiring a "nebulous and impractical test."

He explained that the police officers actions before they entered the apartment, knocking and announcing their presence, were lawful and "no more than any private citizen might do." Assuming, but not deciding, that there were exigent circumstances here, the police actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment.

The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/opinion.html|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Justice Ginsburg Dissent ===
In her dissenting opinion, Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] contends that the majority allows police to “dishonor the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement in drug cases.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452/dissent.html|title=Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would rule that the exigency must exist when the police arrive at the scene, and may not be created by their own conduct. She further points out that the facts here are indistinguishable from ''[[Johnson v. United States (1948 a)|Johnson v. United States]]'', 333 U. S. 10 (1948), in which the Court held a warrantless entry and search unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Subsequent Kentucky Supreme Court Decision ==
In 2012, the Kentucky Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether exigency existed in this case, an issue which had been previously assumed by that court and the U.S. Supreme Court. The court decided that the prosecution had not met it's burden of proving exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless entry; that the police's testimony about movement inside the apartment were "indistinguishable from ordinary household sounds." The trial court's denial of King's motion to suppress was reversed, his conviction vacated, and the case remanded to the lower court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1600095.html|title=FindLaw's Supreme Court of Kentucky case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Knowledge and Politics''''' is a 1975 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In it, Unger criticizes classical liberal doctrine, which originated with European social theorists in the mid-17th century and continues to exercise a tight grip over contemporary thought, as an untenable system of ideas, resulting in contradictions in solving the problems that liberal doctrine itself identifies as fundamental to human experience. Liberal doctrine, according to Unger, is an ideological prison-house that condemns people living under its spell to lives of resignation and disintegration. In its place, Unger proposes an alternative to liberal doctrine that he calls the "theory of organic groups," elements of which he finds emergent in partial form in the welfare-corporate state and the socialist state. The theory of organic groups, Unger contends, offers a way to overcome the divisions in human experience that make liberalism fatally flawed. The theory of organic groups shows how to revise society so that all people can live in a way that is more hospitable to the flourishing of human nature as it is developing in history, particularly in allowing people to integrate their private and social natures, achieving a wholeness in life that has previously been limited to the experience of a small elite of geniuses and visionaries.

==Overview==

===Introduction===

Unger opens ''Knowledge and Politics'' by explaining how he intends to criticize liberal doctrine and how that criticism will help lead to, and elucidate, a positive program: the creation of a nonliberal doctrine of mind and society.&lt;ref&gt;’’Knowledge and Politics’’, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that the rationale for this theoretical enterprise is rooted in the human desire to understand the “meaning of life,” specifically, the nature of the bond between the self and the world.&lt;ref&gt;’’Knowledge and Politics’’, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unger contends that the contemporary human moral experience is one of division, between a side of the self that maintains allegiance to the dominant theoretical and political regimes of society, and another side that is drawn to ideals that current modes of thought reject. Under this experience of division, Unger contends, human experience demands “total criticism” of the kind he intends to apply to the doctrine of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;’’Knowledge and Politics’’, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger describes classical liberal doctrine as both a ruling consciousness of society and a metaphysical system, a system of ideas which involves a particular organization of moral sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;’’Knowledge and Politics’’, 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In human moral experience, liberalism's failure to satisfy the ideal of the self (which Unger later describes as the fullest expression of man's species nature) is experienced as the twin evils of resignation and disintegration. The early liberal thinkers and the classic social theorists understood the radical separations that mark human life, between self and nature, self and others, self and its own roles and works.&lt;ref&gt;’’Knowledge and Politics’’, 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; By undertaking a total criticism of liberal doctrine, particularly by repudiating its distinction between reason and desire, and Unger intends to lay the groundwork for his positive program, the nonliberal social theory that would help to overcome these divisions and give full expression to a range of human feelings and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;’’Knowledge and Politics’’, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 1: Liberal Psychology===

====The Antinomy of Theory and Fact====

The liberal doctrines of mind and society rejected the medieval view of knowledge which held that all things in nature have intelligible essences. Under the doctrine of intelligible essences, everything can be classified under the word that names its category. Liberal thinkers, in rejecting the doctrine of intelligible essences, realized that there is an infinite number of ways objects and events can be classified, infinite ways the world can be divided up by the mind. Liberalism's rejection of the doctrine of intelligible essences had far-reaching consequences for moral and political views. The rejection of intelligible essences also led to the antinomy of theory and fact, a seemingly insoluble conflict between two ideas that seemed equally plausible but led to equally absurd consequences. The antinomy of theory and fact is the conflict between, on the one hand, the realization that all understanding of facts is mediated by theory, and on the other hand, the belief in an independent comparison of theory and fact. Faced with the antinomy of theory and fact, we ask: how can we assess the power of competing theories, if there is no appeal to facts independently of theories? Kant's metaphysics offered a promising and ingenious solution—namely, locating the source of the antinomy in the division of universal and particular, form and substance, in human thought. The division between the universal and particular is at the heart of the contradictions of liberal thought.

====The Principles of Liberal Psychology====
Unger describes the “unreflective view of mind” that characterizes liberal psychology. According to this unreflective view of mind, the mind is a machine that perceives and understands facts (object-events) through sensations. These sensations can be combined, or split until they are indivisible. Combining sensations does not change them. Facts that have been combined can be analyzed back into their constituent sensations. Hobbes explained that desire is what impels the “mind-machine” to its operations of combination and analysis. What leads desire to choose one course of action over another is the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain. This account of liberal doctrine's unreflective view of the mind can be reduced to three principles:
* '''The principle of reason and desire'''. The principle that the self is divided between desire, which is the active, desiring, moving part of the self, and understanding, which is the knowing part of the self. The understanding wants nothing; desire can see nothing. What distinguishes human beings is that they desire different things, not that they understand the world differently. 
* '''The principle of arbitrary desire'''. This principle holds that desires are arbitrary from the perspective of the understanding. We cannot determine what we should want simply by learning more about the world. Reason cannot be used to justify the content of desires.
* '''The principle of analysis'''. This principle holds that knowledge is the sum of its parts. Operations of the mind by which we acquire knowledge involve either joining discrete sensations into more complex ideas, or breaking these complex ideas down into their building blocks. Underlying the principle of analysis is an idea at the heart of liberal doctrine as a whole: confidence in the primacy of the simple. The principle of analysis, according to Unger, reveals liberalism's incomplete rejection of the doctrine of intelligible essences, and has pernicious effects on social theory, by demoralizing attempts to construct ambitious conceptual systems and discouraging us from trying to understand, and change, social situations as a whole.

====Reason and Desire====
Liberal psychology gives rise to two kinds of moral theory, each of which are caught up in a paradox that Unger calls the antinomy of reason and desire. Both of these moralities are destructive of a true conception of human personality.
One moral theory generated under liberal psychology is the morality of desire. This morality defines the good as the satisfaction of desire, and asserts the primacy of the good over the right. Contentment is the condition in which desire is satisfied, and the task of moral theory is to show how we might organize our lives so that we can gain contentment, or happiness.
The other moral theory bequeathed by liberal psychology is the morality of reason, which holds that reason alone establishes the standards of right conduct. Unger points out that, in light of liberal doctrine's conviction that reason wants nothing, it might strike us as strange to contend that reason alone is a basis of morality. The basis for the morality of reason is the belief that humans must accept certain rules, offered by reason, to move beyond the exercise of “naked desire” to the possibility of judging right and wrong and justifying our actions to our fellow men. When reason is believed to offer us universal rules for conduct, it is really telling us what principles we would have to accept to engage in moral criticism. The foremost example of the morality of reason is Kant's moral theory.

The moralities of reason and desire are both vulnerable to serious objections. The morality of desire is deficient because it is incapable of passing from description to evaluation of conduct, and thus is unable to lay down standards of justification. Furthermore, the life to which morality of desire points is inadequate; contentment is elusive without any criteria to judge and order the ends of conduct. The morality of reason is inadequate, first, due to the inadequacy of reason to serve as a foundation for any moral judgments and, second, because the moral life as conceived by the moralist of reason is inadequate.
The respective inadequacies of moralities of desire and reason generate an antinomy. If morality of desire abandons us to our random and changing appetites, morality of reason suppresses our existence as subjective beings with individual ends. The root of this antinomy of reason and desire is the separation between understanding and evaluation in liberal doctrine.

====Personality====
Unger contends that the psychological principles of liberalism make it impossible to formulate an adequate conception of personality. Unger identifies four dimensions of the minimum idea of personality: continuing identity, common humanity with others, ability to change ends over time while acknowledging continuity of existence, and being a unique individual despite membership in species of like beings. But neither the morality of desire nor morality of reason does justice to these qualities. The morality of desire denies continuity and humanity of the self, seeing the human being led by desire to seek contentment without any criteria for ordering the ends of conduct, while the morality of reason denies the human capacity for moral innovation and individual identity, offering a formal, empty principle of reason as the only guidance to what we ought to do.

The theoretical deficiencies of the liberal conception of personality are mirrored in the experience of the individual in the social world in which the liberal mode of consciousness prevails. The individual is condemned to a state of degradation and division, forced to deal with others in a social world that threatens the person with loss of individuality and loss of autonomy in directing his life, perpetually fleeing to private life for the chance to shed the mask of one's largely unchosen public role. People seek temporal unity in a public identity at the cost of their singularity and uniqueness. As Unger says, “Others save you from being nothing, but they do not allow you to become yourself.” Under liberalism, people are torn between roles that force them to sacrifice their private selves to their public ones, thus surrendering individual identity; or casting off convention and following their own courses, but risking disintegration of the self.

===Chapter 2: Liberal Political Theory===

====The Unreflective View of Society====

Unger outlines liberal political theory in much the same way that he described liberal psychology. He begins by describing the unreflective view of society that holds a central place in everyday thinking about social life, as well as in some specialized fields of study. According to this unreflective and widely held view of society, the individual is made up of reason and will. Reason is directed by will, the desiring element of personality. Human beings are blind creatures of appetite, but they are capable of objectively understanding the world, and some are more acute in their understanding than others. Despite their capacity for objective understanding, the things people desire are infinitely diverse. The universal desire for comfort and honor, under circumstances of scarcity, make mutual antagonism and mutual dependence inevitable and unavoidable. Freedom, or not being under the control of an alien will, is sought and experienced as a form of power. People form alliances to further their interests in hostility and collaboration. The two fundamental problems of politics, order and freedom, are consequences of this mutual antagonism and reciprocal need.

Society's first task is to place restraints on the exercise of mutual antagonism, so that mutual need can be satisfied. Such restraints moderate the struggle for comfort, power and glory, so that everyone can be protected from the worst outcomes for a person—grave indignity, harsh penury, enslavement, or violent death. How to control hostility between people is the problem of order. As soon as limits are placed on mutual antagonism, men encounter the problem of freedom: how to order society so that no one's liberty is arbitrarily preferred over another's, so that no one's arbitrarily chosen means and ends of striving take unjustifiable precedence over another's? Society tries to solve the problems of order and freedom by making and applying impersonal laws.

====The Principles of Liberal Political Thought====

Liberal political thought revolves around three core principles, according to Unger:

* '''The principle of rules and values'''. This principle holds that value is the social face of desire, referring to something wanted or sought by a person. Rules are necessary to restrain the mutual hostility and antagonism that arises as people pursue their arbitrarily chosen values. The distinction between rules and values as two basic elements of social order is the first principle of liberal social thought, and it stands at the heart of the unreflective liberal belief that the eternal hostility of men to each other requires that order and freedom be maintained by government under law. 
* 
* '''The principle of subjective value'''. This is the idea that all values are individual and subjective; the individuality of values is the basis of personal identity under liberalism, which does not recognize communal values. Values are subjective, determined by choice, a belief that goes against the ancient conception of objective value. Liberal thought represents a revolt against the conception of objective value.
* 
* '''The principle of individualism''' holds that a group is simply a collection of individuals. Formally analogous to the principle of analysis, which maintains that a whole is just the sum of its parts, the principle of individualism implies that society is artificial, that groups, being merely the products of the will and interests of individuals, are less real than the individuals that comprise them. Unger suggests that individualism is so deeply rooted in Western liberal thought that it is hard to grasp the opposite view, the collectivist and organicist view held by romantics. Collectivists view the group as having an independent existence. The heart of the collectivist view is the idea of the spontaneity of social bonds and their priority over individual striving.

====The Problems of Legislation and Adjudication====

Unger contends that there can be no coherent theory of legislation or adjudication on liberal premises. Liberal thinkers believe society is held together by rules, so under liberal doctrine issues of legislation and adjudication are central to solving the problems of order and freedom. Unger shows that the problems of order and freedom collapse into each other (to know what standards laws would have to conform to, so as not to prefer arbitrarily one man's advantage over another's, one would also have to know how best to restrain antagonism in the interest of collaboration). Justification of laws, therefore, consists in showing that restraints on freedom are justified and no greater than necessary.

Unger enumerates three main ways that modern political philosophy envisages the establishment of freedom through legislation. The first two, based on formal and substantive theories of freedom, are expressions of liberal doctrine. They have similar flaws that render them incoherent. The formal theory (represented most prominently by Kant) is too abstract to offer concrete guidance on legislation; once we try to derive specificity from its principles, we cannot avoid preferring some values over others. The substantive doctrine (with variations offered by utilitarianism, social contract theory, and Rawls) also fails because it cannot find a neutral way to legislate among individual and competing values. The third basis for legislation, based on a doctrine of shared values, is a partial attempt to escape liberal doctrine, one that does not go far enough. It has the merit of viewing freedom as something other than the liberal concept of freedom to do whatever one wants; freedom, under the doctrine of shared values, is a development of human capacities, talents, and powers, and the task of the state is to choose arrangements that foster this human flourishing. If taken to the hilt, the doctrine of shared values might be a coherent basis for lawmaking. Liberalism has failed to provide such a coherent theory; its attempts to offer one have failed because they could not avoid preferring some values over others, thus violating the demand for neutral laws that is at the heart of liberalism.

Similarly, liberalism has failed to provide a coherent theory of adjudication. Unger describes two ways of ordering human relations under a judicial regime: '''legal justice''' and '''substantive justice'''. Legal justice establishes rules governing general categories of acts and persons, and settles particular disputes on the basis of the system's rules. Substantive justice determines goals of the system, and then, independent of rules, tries to decide cases by a judgment of which decision will likely contribute to the achievement of the goal, in other words, an exercise of instrumental rationality. In a system of legal justice, there is a possible distinction between legislation and adjudication, although the line may be hazy in some systems (such as under a common law system). In substantive justice regimes, there is no meaningful line between legislation and adjudication.

In his account of the failure of liberalism to provide a coherent account of adjudication, Unger explores the two primary paths that jurists have taken in explaining regimes of legal justice: formalist and purposive accounts. Formalist accounts collapse because they depend upon a theory of plain meaning that can only be accepted if one accepts the doctrine of intelligible essences, which liberalism must reject. A purposive account of legal justice, which holds that judges must consider the purposes and policies of laws they apply, in order to apply them correctly and uniformly, results in judges applying their own subjective preferences, and there is no method of choice among the many policies that may compete for the judge's attention in finding a rationale for decision. Ultimately, purposive adjudication results in the exercise of instrumental rationality, which cannot pretend to have stability or generality, thus it is fatal to the aims of legal justice.

Substantive justice does not offer hope for the liberal seeking a basis for a coherent theory of adjudication. A substantive justice regime, Unger explains, requires common values so firmly established that they can be taken for granted in deciding individual cases. Tribal societies and theocratic states have common values that can provide such a basis for adjudication. But in liberal thought, the centrality of the principles of subjective value and individualism destroy the possibility of a stable set of common ends. Thus, whether liberal doctrine appeals to legal justice or substantive justice in developing a theory of adjudication, it will fail, because the premises of liberalism make all such efforts collapse into incoherence.

====Shared Values====

Unger concludes his account of liberal political thought by exploring the idea of shared values as a possible solution to the problem of order and freedom that liberalism failed to solve. Unger sees the concept of shared values as a possible basis for saving formalism, a formalism based on plain meanings that derive from shared social life, not derived from the unsupportable doctrine of intelligible essences. Shared values could also serve as a basis for a regime of substantive justice, in which decisions would be made based on their ability to promote common ends.  Rules could have plain meanings because that are backed by a common vision of the world. Unger sees the possibility of shared values, conceived in this way, as requiring group values that are neither individual nor subjective. A system of ideas and social life in which shared values would have this central role would be one in which the distinction between fact and value has been repudiated. But under liberalism, and the social experience that exists in the grip of liberal doctrine, shared values could not have this force. Unger believes shared values have this promise, but that this promise could only be realized under two conditions: the development of a new system of thought, and the occurrence of a political event that transforms the conditions of social life. The theory of organic groups, which he will explore at the end of ''Knowledge and Politics'', describes a setting in which these conditions are satisfied.

===Chapter 3: The Unity of Liberal Thought===

Having surveyed liberal psychology and liberal political thought, Unger then undertakes to show the underlying unity of liberal thought, and he seeks to locate the source of this unity in ideas even more fundamental than those discussed in previous chapters.

====The Methodological Challenge of Studying Liberalism====

Unger explains that much criticism of liberalism is directed at liberal doctrine only as it exists in the order of ideas, a level of discourse in which one can fruitfully apply the methods and procedures of formal logic. However, a full review of liberalism requires that it be examined not only as it exists in the order of ideas, but also as a form of social life, one that exists in the realm of consciousness. Studying liberalism as it exists in the realm of consciousness is not an inquiry susceptible of formal logical analysis; rather, a different method must be employed, one suited to symbolic analysis. Unger describes the method needed as a method of appositeness or symbolic interpretation.

The method Unger contends is most suited to the examination of liberalism in the realm of consciousness, is one that has been driven to the periphery of intellectual life under liberalism, namely the method of the ancient humanistic, dogmatic disciplines, such as theology, grammar, and legal study. Such method assumes a community of intention between the interpreter and the interpreted. This method of symbolic interpretation has been largely abandoned under liberalism, since liberal principles of subjective value and individualism have destroyed the community of intentions required to make such doctrinal inquiry fruitful.

Unger discusses how studying ideas such as those represented by liberalism can be challenging because ideas can exist in three senses of existence—in the mode of events, in the mode of social life, and in the mode of ideas. An idea can be a psychic event that can be studied by science; a belief wedded to human conduct that is amenable only to a symbolic, interpretive method; and as the content of thought, which can have truth or falsehood and is susceptible to logical analysis. This "stratified ontology," as Unger describes it, leads to some of the most intractable problems of philosophy, especially in understanding the relation of social life to the realms of ideas and events.

Liberalism exists both as a philosophical system and as a type of consciousness that represents and dictates a kind of social life. Explaining that liberalism "is a 'deep structure' of thought, placed at the intersection of two modes of being, liberalism resists a purely logical analysis."&lt;ref&gt;''Knowledge and Politics'', 118,&lt;/ref&gt; Unger makes this foray into methodology as a way of setting the stage for his explanation of the unity of liberalism, and his exploration of what might replace liberalism as a superior conception of culture and society.

====The Interdependence of Psychological and Political Principles====

Unger describes how key principles of liberal psychology—the principle of reason and desire and the principle of arbitrary desire—have a reciprocal interdependence with the main principles of liberal political thought, the principle of rules and values and the principle of subjective value. The psychological principles, which apply to the individual, mirror the corresponding political principles that describe society. “Desire” describes the place of individual ends in the self, while “value” describes the place of individual ends in society. Under liberalism, in neither the psychological realm nor the political realm can the understanding guide people to what they ought to desire or value.

A society in which understanding were capable of perceiving or establishing the ends of conduct would look very different from society under a liberal regime of social life. Values would be perceived as objective, they would be shared communally, and rules would no longer be needed as the main social bond. The theories of natural law and natural right, and the communal/organicist view of the romantics, both articulate a vision in which values are communal and evident to all members of society, a very different view from liberal thought which holds that men have no natural guides to the moral life and must be led around by threats and restrained by rules.

Unger explains how the psychological principle of analysis and the political principle of individualism have an identical form and a relationship of reciprocal interdependence. They both stand for the idea that the whole is the sum of its parts. Individualism depends upon the principle of analysis, because it implies that one is able to decompose every aspect of group life into a feature of the lives of individuals. Analysis depends upon individualism, because individualism implies that all phenomena must be treated as aggregations of distinct individuals interacting with each other. But Unger, using the examples of artistic style and consciousness, concludes that analysis and individualism both fail to explain certain phenomena that resist reduction to individual belief and conduct. The concepts of collectivism and totality manage to explain phenomena of consciousness, and these anti-liberal concepts view the authors of these wholes as groups, classes, factions, and nations, not individuals. If we admit that consciousness is real, we must reject the principles of individualism and analysis, as unable to explain much of the world as we experience it. Unger contends that the implications of analytic thinking also give unmerited authority to the [[Fact–value distinction|fact-value distinction]]; because the analytic thinker fragments forms of social consciousness, such as dividing beliefs into descriptive and normative beliefs, the analyst gives plausibility to the fact-value distinction which has been part of the damaging legacy of liberal doctrine.

Because principles of analysis and individualism create obstacles for the understanding of mind and science, social theory has sought to escape these limitations and find a method of social study that respects the integrity of social wholes. Unger offers a suggestion of how analytic and individualist ideas can be overthrown, and he explains why some efforts to do so (such as structuralism) have failed. As Unger explained earlier in ''Knowledge and Politics'', analysis and individualism reflect belief in the principle of aggregation, while synthesis and collectivism reflect a belief in totality. Modern social theory has repeatedly tried to formulate a plausible account of the idea of totality; examples of these efforts include Chomsky's linguistic theory, gestalt psychology, structuralism, and Marxism. But these efforts have often stumbled in defining exactly what the difference is between wholes and parts, and exactly what the idea of “part” means if it is something different in kind from the totality. Unger explains that the two main interpretations of the principle of totality are structuralism and realism. Structuralism finds it useful to regard certain things as totalities, but it errs in its conventionalist attitude toward totality; it doubts whether totalities correspond to real things. Realism is a more promising approach to totality because it regards unanalyzable wholes—totalities—as real things. But realism, too, falls short of the mark because it fails to resolve the antinomy of theory and fact.

====The Antinomies of Liberal Thought Related to the Universal and the Particular====

Unger concludes his discussion of the unity of liberal thought by discussing the seemingly insoluble antinomies of liberal thought—theory and fact, reason and desire, rules and values—and their connection with the division between the universal and the particular. Under the antinomy of theory and fact, it appears that we can only discuss facts in the language of theory, but at the same time there appears to be some ability to appeal to the facts independently of theory, in order to judge the merits of competing theories. Reason and desire present a similarly intractable conflict; reason can clarify the relations among ends, never what ends we should choose; but falling back on a morality of desire seems to condemn us to action with no standards other than arbitrary choice. The antinomy of rules and values reveals that a system of legal justice or rules cannot dispense with a consideration of values, but also cannot be made consistent with them, and a system of substantive justice (or values) cannot do without rules but also cannot be made consistent with them. Unger contends that we will never resolve these antinomies until we find our way out of the "prison-house of liberal thought."

Unger begins here to suggest the way we might create an alternative doctrine, one that is not bedeviled by the antinomies of liberalism, would be to start with a premise of the unity, or identity, of universals and particulars. Doing this plausibly, would require overcoming the division between ideas and events, reason and desire, rule and value, without denying their separateness, and without rejecting universality and particularity. Overcoming the seemingly intractable antagonism between universality and particularity, which is the source of so much tragedy in life according to Unger, may seem impossible, but Unger points to examples of how this unity can be understood. He maintains that universals must exist as particulars; in the way a person is inseparable from their body but is also more than their body, the universal and particular may represent different levels of reality. Unger contends that a kind of unity between the universal and the particular is evident in moral, artistic, and religious experience, and understanding the basis of this unity is a way past the antinomies of liberal thought. Understanding this unity between the universal and particular sets the stage for Unger's positive theory in ''Knowledge and Politics''.

===Chapter 4: The Theory of the Welfare-Corporate State===

In this chapter, Unger expands his view and intends to consider liberal thought in view of its relationship to society. Liberalism, Unger explains, is a representation of a form of life in the language of speculative thought, and gains its unity and richness by being associated with a form of life. We must understand the nature of its association with a form of life in order to complete the task of total criticism.

Unger contends that the underlying mode of social life has been changing in ways that both require a reconstruction of philosophical principles and guide us toward that reconstruction. Unger asserts that "the truth of knowledge and politics is both made and discovered in history."

Every type of social life can be viewed from two complementary perspectives, both informed by the principle of totality: as a form of consciousness, and as a mode of order. Forms of social consciousness cannot be dissolved into constituent parts without a critical loss of understanding; this is the basis for Unger's assertion that the principle of totality governs the explanation of social consciousness.

====Social Consciousness in the Liberal State====

Unger sees three major elements of social consciousness in the liberal state as instrumentalism, individualism, and a conception of social place as a role that is external to oneself. Each of these elements of liberal social consciousness are reflections of the ideal of transcendence, which, being opposed to the concept of immanence, originated in the religious concept of a separation between the divine and the mundane, heaven and earth, God and man. The divisions at the heart of liberalism reflect a secularized version of transcendence; liberals abandon the explicitly theological form of religiosity without completely discarding the implicitly religious meaning of the concept.

Liberal consciousness, because it has abandoned the explicitly theological form of transcendence, leads to a seeming paradox: when the divine is secularized, part of the secular world becomes sanctified, which seems to lead to the position of immanence. For this reason, Unger sees liberal social consciousness as a transition between two modes of consciousness: from one in which transcendence is emphasized, to one that reasserts the earlier religious ideal of immanence. This uneasy balance between the pure theological form of transcendence and the affirmation of religious immanence is the basis for the key dichotomies of liberal thought.

====Social Order in the Liberal State====

Unger argues that a social order is composed of elements, each defined by their relation to all other elements. The two types of elements are individuals and groups. One's position in the social order is one's social place. The types of social order are distinguished by their principle of order, the rule according to which the elements are arranged.

Each individual lives in a social situation in which one or a few types of social order are dominant.  According to Unger, the generative principles of the types of social order are the foremost determinants of how a person defines his identity.

The most familiar principles of social order are kinship, estate, class, and role. Class and role are the most relevant to the social order of the liberal state. When determination of social place is governed by class, one's class membership tends to determine the job one holds. When determination of social place is by role, one's merit is the principle that determines the job one holds. Unger explains that the links between class and role can be so numerous that they appear indistinguishable.

Unger points out that there could be a fundamental opposition between class and role—a role achieved by recognized merit could give access to consumption, power, and knowledge. Class would then become a consequence, not a cause, of role.

Under the systems of kinship, estate, and class, there is a common reliance on personal dependence and personal domination as devices of social organization. By contrast with these earlier systems, the principle of role, at its fullest development, actualizes an ideal that moves away from personal dependence and domination. It embodies the ideal that power in the liberal state should be disciplined by prescriptive, impersonal rules. Power should not be held arbitrarily; in government, those with power must be chosen by election, and in private roles, by merit. Jobs are to be allocated by merit, namely the ability to get job done, by acquired skill, past efforts, and natural talent.

Although the ascendance of role seems to imply the lessening of arbitrary power in society, Unger points out how class survives alongside role, pervading every aspect of social life, and functioning as a permanent refutation of ideal of impersonal roles. Natural talent and genetic gifts are distributed capriciously, and amount to a brute fact of natural advantage that is decisive in allocating power in a society governed by a principle of merit-based role.

Unger concludes that superimposed on the conflict between class and role, there is a pervasive conflict between experience of personal dependency/dominance, and the ideal of organization by impersonal rules, and evidence of these two tensions touches every aspect of life in the liberal state.

====Bureaucracy as the Master Institution of the Liberal State====

Unger considers bureaucracy to be the characteristic institution of the liberal state, one that reflects the prevailing kinds of social order that are deep and hidden modes of social organization. Bureaucracy has several key features:

* Bureaucracy is committed to organization by impersonal rules; 
* A hierarchy of authority exists among members of the institution; 
* Individuals in the institution have roles, specific jobs to do, that are defined in a standardized way; 
* There is a pervasive experience of personal dependence and domination.

As a historical institution, bureaucracy developed during the emergence of the European nation-state, when breakup of feudal and postfeudal hierarchies made dependence on rules necessary. As bureaucracy developed, bureaucratic staffs acquired interests of their own. Systems of rules and hierarchy allowed bureaucracies to resist encroachments of rulers and social groups and pretend to be above politics.

Bureaucracy became a characteristic institution of the liberal state because, like the liberal state, bureaucracy exists in context of class organization of society and seems to offer an escape from constraints of class society, by putting impersonal rules in the place of personal dependence. But bureaucracy does not solve the internal conflicts of a class society. The bureaucratic role is not a total social place; the making and applying of rules involves some arbitrary exercise of power; and the implications of the ideal of merit include the fact that merit creates a new class system. A hierarchy of talents succeeds the accident of inherited wealth as an arbitrary determinant of one's fortunes. The bureaucracy, for this reason, cannot solve the problem of personal domination in the liberal state. As Unger puts it, "Men want to be humans but bureaucracy doesn't satisfy their humanity."

====The Welfare-Corporate State====

According to Unger, the conflicts within its dominant types of social consciousness and order push the liberal state in the direction of the welfare-corporate state. Unger contends that contemporary capitalist society sees the development of types of social consciousness and social organization that are incompatible with certain traits of the liberal state, creating new problems and perspectives that call out for new concepts and a reconstructed theory of society. Classical social theory was an attempt to understand the liberal state; understanding the welfare-corporate state demands that we transform the substance and methods of the study of society.

Classic social theory fails in part because it continues to rely upon extensive elements of liberal doctrine, and fails to advance from partial to total criticism. The emergent welfare-corporate state transforms the experience of social life and calls for a nonliberal system of thought. Although the conception of a second stage of liberal capitalist society is a familiar one, its identity remains elusive. Its features are commonly described to include the following:

* It is a state where government assumes widespread overt responsibility for distribution of economic and market advantages.
* It is a state where bodies intermediate between individual and government achieve a larger place in society (reflecting a welfare and corporatist tendency to break down distinction between government and civil society).
* It includes an emphasis on the transformation of nature, a prominent role for technology, and there is a preeminent bureaucratic class who direct the state's welfare activities.

But it is necessary to describe the social consciousness that would establish the identity of the welfare-corporate state.  The welfare-corporate state appears with the emergence of a certain type of consciousness and of social order. Such consciousness was foreshadowed by ideas that were marginal at the height of liberal social consciousness, namely the romantic worship of nature, the invocation of hierarchical and egalitarian ideals of community, and a repudiation of a division of labor. As society transitions to a welfare-corporate state, those ideas move from a visionary elite to be widely embraced by a broader class of people who hold bureaucratic, technical and professional roles.

As this transformed social consciousness takes hold, key aspects of liberal social consciousness are rejected. The emergent consciousness is hostile to a manipulative posture toward society, believing that order will develop spontaneously and should not be imposed. There's an emphasis on decentralization and de-bureaucratization, increased interest in preservation, an embrace of nature and a reassertion of mystic religiosity. Individualism is rejected, replaced by more interest in solidarity and a desire for non-hierarchical communities. The new social consciousness of the welfare-corporate state rebels against the liberal conception of work and social place, rejecting the traditional division of labor and demanding that jobs represent the vitality and range of the self.

All of these changes in social consciousness that appear in the transition to the welfare-corporate state represent the rise of immanence as an ideal. Like the secularized transcendence of liberalism, the immanence that emerges is a secularized immanence.

Unger sees both the welfare-corporate state, and the socialist state, as providing the seeds of a solution to problem of the divisions at the heart of liberalism. The philosophy that is needed to transcend the antinomies of liberalism is one that would offer a union of immanence and transcendence and make possible the achievement of egalitarian community.

===Chapter 5: The Theory of the Self===

In this chapter, Unger states a metaphysical conception of the self. He intends to demonstrate the relationship between certain aspects of human nature and lay the groundwork  for a definition of the social ideal. He describes familiar attributes of humanity that are central to our ideas of personality and society, and he infers from these attributes a more general view of the relation between self and world.

Unger has already shown, through his discussion of the antinomies of liberal thought, that liberal doctrine fails to provide a coherent view of knowledge, personality, and society. This leads to two questions:
# Where can we find a solid ground on which to establish an alternative set of principles and fulfill the task of total criticism? 
# Both the welfare-corporate state and the socialist state seem to have a double nature. What are we to make of this duality, and how can we resolve it favorably?

These questions suggest a possible synthesis of immanence and transcendence, and they also suggest an actualization of nonhierarchical community in social life.

For Unger, the criticism of liberal thought implies an idea of personality and an idea of community. The ideas of personality and community contain each other; to some extent the self is the personification of mankind.

====Requirements of an Adequate Theory of the Self====

According to Unger, three topics have dominated the study of human nature in Western culture, and there are two main positions on each topic.

* The problem of the connection between human nature and history: One view, the suprahistorical view, holds that human beings are condemned to in an iron circle of virtues and vices; the other, the historicist view, holds that there are as many human natures as there are societies or even individuals.
* The problem of essentialist versus relational view of human nature: One view is that there is an essential core to human nature, a view related to the doctrine of intelligible essences; and the other view is that human nature is relational and can change with historical context.
* The problem of the relation between individual humans and their species: One view holds that the individual is a mere example of his species (a view asserting the primacy of species nature), and the other view reduces the species to a category of classification and holds that individual nature has primacy.

An adequate view of human nature, Unger believes, must avoid the defects of all six positions. His view is that human nature is a universal that exists through its particular embodiments. Each person, each culture, is a novel interpretation of humanity.

====Method of Exposition and Proof====

Unger sees a person's life as operating in three theaters: (1) the person's relationship to nature, (2) the person's relation to other persons, and (3) the person's relation to his or her own work and station.

In each theater we face certain recurring problems arising from the most basic demands we place on nature, others, or ourselves. These demands define the meaning of humanity. One can identify them through some commonplace ideas we have about human nature. When we put them together, Unger claims, they form a vision foreign to liberal doctrine that is capable of replacing it.

Unger sees his doctrine of the self as promising because it answers two major questions about human life, one historical and the other metaphysical. First, it answers a historical question: it allows us to clarify the antagonistic trends we have found within the welfare-corporate and socialist state, and explains the historical alternation between immanence and transcendence in social consciousness. Second, it helps answers the question of what men are and what men ought to be, by drawing upon the ideas contained in our everyday judgments, our moral intuitions, and our present ways of speaking about human life, all of which offer a more complete picture of humanity than that allowed by liberal premises.

Unger acknowledges that the answers to both the historical and the metaphysical questions are problematic, in that our theory shapes our interpretation of history, and it can be difficult to know what aspects of our experience, intuitions, and everyday judgments to accept or reject. Unger does not consider these problems fatal to his ambition to find a persuasive theory of the self: we may find that the number of plausible accounts of human nature is extremely limited, and our inability to confirm which account is true may simply point to the fact that human nature contains different possibilities.

====The Nature of the Self====

Unger sees the first two attributes of the self as consciousness and indeterminacy. Consciousness is experienced as the self's distance from the world, and the self's indeterminacy is based on the limited hold of natural instincts over human will. Consciousness is the mark of man's subjective separation from the world, and indeterminacy is the mark of man's objective separation from the world. According to Unger, these two attributes of self mean that man has no predetermined place in nature, and therefore it is the human task to make a place for himself. Unger sees the problem to be solved by a theory of the self as a twofold one: man needs to preserve his independence from the outside world, while also living in a world that is transparent to the mind. To achieve these things is to achieve what Unger calls "natural harmony."

There are two ways that natural harmony can be achieved, according to Unger:
* Reconciliation with the nonhuman world
* Realizing harmony in day-to-day life

The principal way of achieving natural harmony in one's life is through work, which allows us to join the human and the nonhuman world. Works combine features of natural objects with geometrical objects: works embody qualities of natural objects to the extent that they are embodied, tangible things; but also have qualities of geometrical objects in that they are products of the human intelligence and thus, in principle, can be known perfectly to the extent that they represent the intention of the maker.

In addition to trying to achieve harmony with the nonhuman world, man also endeavors to achieve harmony with other people. This involves striving to realize the ideal of sympathy, which in Unger's view combines the greatest degree of individuality with the greatest sociability. This ideal, which represents the highest reconciliation of the self with others, can only be achieved, Unger argues, in groups that are both small and represent a "universalized" association, or in other words, an association that gives the fullest expression and fulfillment to the various aspects of mankind's species nature. Such an association would offer the possibility of achieving the "concrete universality" that, in Unger's view, is the best chance of surmounting the fatal divisions of liberal theory.

====How the Theory of the Self Points Toward a Solution to the Dilemmas of Liberal Doctrine====

The three aspects of Unger's ideal of the self—natural harmony (reconciliation with nature), sympathy (reconciliation with fellow man), and concrete universality (reconciliation with oneself)—would move us past the mode of division in which liberal doctrine traps us, if they can be actualized. These three aspects of the ideal describe a hypothetical ideal circumstance for human beings, according to Unger.

Unger contends that this theory of self solves two central problems with which ''Knowledge and Politics'' is concerned: first, it offers an outline of an alternative to liberalism (and its metaphysical emphasis on transcendence) and also to the antitheses of liberalism, the various systems emphasizing immanence (principally, the welfare-corporate state and socialism). Second, it offers a new way of understanding the situation of modern society.

Unger believes the elements of a synthesis of transcendence and immanence are already present in contemporary society. To seize upon these elements and develop them to their fullest potential as the basis for community, according to Unger, is to find a political solution to the problem of the self. It is this task he turns to in the next and final chapter, on the theory of organic groups.

===Chapter 6: The Theory of Organic Groups===

There are two dangers that we encounter in our attempts to realize the ideal of the self, Unger explains: idolatry (represented by immanence) and utopianism (represented by transcendence). Unger's theory of organic groups will demonstrate shows how the ideal of self can avoid these dangers through the transformation of the welfare-corporate and socialist states. The theory of organic groups, Unger writes, “vindicates hope against resignation and disintegration.”

A major difficulty that the theory of organic groups encounters is how we can affirm an idea of the good in the face of the principle of subjective value. We need an account of the good that bypasses the dual problem of, on the one hand, the subjective concept of value and, on the other hand, the objective concept of value. The theory of the self underlying the theory of organic groups does this, by offering an account of the good that sees it as consisting in the manifestation and development of a universal human nature.

This account of the good has two main elements: an elaboration of the “species nature” of mankind, and an explanation of the spiral of increasing community. Unger's conception of the species nature of mankind does not rely on a doctrine of intelligible essences or an unchanging core in human beings. Rather, this species nature develops in history.

This account of the species nature of mankind of complemented by Unger's notion of the spiral of consensus that could first eradicate the evil of domination, and second, help develop community. Priority must be given to overcoming domination before focusing on developing community.

The organic group as Unger sketches it would provide an institution reflecting sympathetic social relations on three levels: it would be a community of life, reflecting the ideal of sympathy, a democracy of ends, reflecting shared values, and it would embody a division of labor that supports natural harmony, sympathy, and concrete universality. The central conception of the theory of organic groups is this ideal of universal community.

Although the problems occasioned by the conflict of immanent order and transcendence can never fully be reconciled, and the spiral of domination and community seeks an end it cannot fully achieve, Unger sees this ideal as a regulative ideal that translates into political possibility many key elements of sympathetic social relations.

The organic group, as Unger envisions it, would gradually replace meritocratic power by democratic power in the institutions of society and in occupational groups. Politics would be "the master principle of everyday life." The organic group would diminish natural talent in allocating power, instead viewing hierarchy as a political choice, not as a given.

The standards of choice to be used by the organic group would include the experience of other groups, as well as the good of the community. The organic group's approach to distributive justice would, in the beginning, use standards both of productive effort and the standard of need, but as the organic group progresses it could refine its standard with more accurate knowledge of the true content of the idea of need.

Unger's proposal envisions organic groups proliferating throughout society. Their proliferation would help avert any danger to individuality, by making all of life subject to public discourse and political choice.

The division of labor in the organic group would be one that expresses the concrete universality of each of the group's members: according to Unger, "allocation of tasks should allow each individual to develop his unique dispositions so as to serve and express values or practices whose legitimacy as signs of species nature he can recognize." The individual should not be confined to one narrow role, but should be afforded the chance to experiment with various forms of social life so as to possibly transcend his place in the social order. Specialization in the organic group needs to be "tempered, but not abolished," according to Unger.

Unger sees the theory of organic group as undergirded by a respect and defense of the individual, represented by three institutional principles: (1) Freedom of joining or leaving groups in the community of life; (2) Freedom to express ideas; and (3) Liberty of work.

One of the paradoxes of human existence, which will never fully be solved, is that community "needs to remain a particular group, yet become a universal one." This reflects the same irreducibility of the universal and particular that is found throughout human life.

Unger leaves many questions about organic groups unanswered: (1) what powers should organic groups have over their members, (2) how should groups be ordered among themselves, (3) what is the relation between intragroup solidarity and intergroup concord? (4) what is the significance of the imperfection of community?

Unger's view, the virtue of politics practiced in the manner he proposes, "is to make the ideal of the self into a form of social life." The doctrine of organic groups "describes the construction of a society in which the ideal is no longer confined to the dreams and diversions of private life, but has permeated the world of work and changed the character of social relations."

==Reception==

Jerome Neu, writing in the ''Texas Law Review'',&lt;ref&gt;Neu, Jerome. "Unger’s Knowledge and Politics." Texas Law Review 54 (1976): 441-58.&lt;/ref&gt; lauded ''Knowledge and Politics'' as "breathtaking in its sweep, impressive in its erudition, and vast in its ambitions.... The book is remarkable both for how much it undertakes and how much it achieves." Neu identified some weaknesses in the book, contending that while "Unger's succinct survey of positions in legal theory and their interconnections is illuminating, I think it may oversimplify matters." &lt;ref&gt;Neu 447&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Neu applauded the tight organization of the book, but allowed that "[w]hile Unger's architectonic gives structure to his argument, it (like Kant's) sometimes makes things more complicated than necessary." &lt;ref&gt;Neu 449&lt;/ref&gt; Neu also took issue with Unger's account of the interconnections between the basic principles of liberal psychology and liberal political theory, arguing that "the nature of the interconnection is somewhat obscure because it varies from points to point and cannot be covered in the general manner attempted by Unger." Overall, Neu gave high praise to ''Knowledge and Politics'', writing, "I fear that I may not have properly conveyed a sense of the book's richness of texture .... In all, the book is controlled and informed, and affords a brilliant display of the synthesizing and speculative philosophical intelligence at work.".&lt;ref&gt;Neu 457-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Karsten Harries, writing in the ''Yale Law Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;Harries, Karsten. "The Contradictions of Liberal Thought." (1976): 847-854.&lt;/ref&gt; offered a more skeptical assessment of the merits of ''Knowledge and Politics''. Harries took issue with Unger's claim to be engaging in "total criticism" of liberalism, contending that Unger actually offers "a challenging partial critique of premises we too often take for granted."&lt;ref&gt;Harries 849&lt;/ref&gt; Harries also argues that Unger is incorrect in asserting that the affirmation of intelligible essences or objective values is inconsistent with liberal thought.&lt;ref&gt;Harries 852&lt;/ref&gt; Harries concludes his assessment by expressing "serious doubts concerning Unger's critique of the liberal position."&lt;ref&gt;Harries 854&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book for the ''Fordham Law Review'',&lt;ref&gt;Richards, David AJ. "Knowledge and Politics." Fordham Law Review 44, no. 4 (1976): 873.&lt;/ref&gt; David A.J. Richards contended that "Unger's substantive moral conception is ... inadequately explained and explicated. Insofar as one can understand the substantive nature of his moral ideal, however, it seems deeply flawed, and indeed itself morally indefensible." Describing Unger's moral theory in ''Knowledge and Politics'' as "Platonic and Marxist,"&lt;ref&gt;Richards 874&lt;/ref&gt; Richards identified in the book an "organic analogy" between the state and a "complete, fully developed, and abundant human self."&lt;ref&gt;Richards 874&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, "[o]rganic analogies, whether in Plato, Marx, or Unger, are intrinsically totalitatian.".&lt;ref&gt;Richards 874&lt;/ref&gt; Richards went on to say that "Unger's theory, like Marx's, fundamentally misconstrues the ideals of political, social, and economic justice on the model of personal love."&lt;ref&gt;Richards 875&lt;/ref&gt; Richards concluded his review by speculating that behind ''Knowledge and Politics'' "lies a kind of poetic reverie for a lost love or childhood, which theory now apocalyptically validates."&lt;ref&gt;Richards 876&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Legal Services Corporation''' ('''LSC''') is a publicly funded, [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit corporation]] established by the [[United States Congress]]. It seeks to ensure equal access to justice under the law for all Americans by providing funding for civil [[legal aid in the United States|legal aid]] to those who otherwise would be unable to afford it. The LSC was created in 1974 with bipartisan congressional sponsorship and the support of the [[Nixon administration]], and is funded through the congressional appropriations process.

LSC has a board of eleven directors, appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], that set LSC policy. By law the board is bipartisan; no more than six members can come from the same party.&lt;ref name="lsc-board"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/about/board.php | title=Board of Directors Profiles | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSC has a president and other officers who implement those policies and oversee the corporation's operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/about/office_president.php | title=Office of the President | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Fiscal Year 2015, LSC had a budget of $375 million to fund civil legal aid. LSC is the largest single funder of civil legal aid in the country, distributing more than 90 percent of its total funding to 134 independent nonprofit legal aid programs.&lt;ref name="2013 budget"&gt;{{cite web|title=LSC Funding {{!}} LSC – Legal Services Corporation: America's Partner for Equal Justice|url=http://www.lsc.gov/congress/lsc-funding|publisher=Legal Services Corporation|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Background===
LSC is one of the organizational descendants of the former [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO).&lt;ref name="brock-96"&gt;{{cite book | last=Brock | first=David | authorlink=David Brock | title=[[The Seduction of Hillary Rodham]] | publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-684-83451-0}} pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]], a key part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] vision, established the OEO. From 1965 on, starting with a budget of $1 million,&lt;ref name="brock-96"/&gt; the OEO created 269 local legal services programs around the country,&lt;ref name="time072875"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913362,00.html | title=Corporation for the Poor | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | date=1975-07-28 | accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[California Rural Legal Assistance]],&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt; which made a name for themselves suing local officials and sometimes stirring up resentment against their federal funding.&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt;

By the early 1970s the [[Nixon administration]] began dismantling the OEO; funding for legal services for the poor began to wither, and supporters looked for an alternative arrangement.&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt; In 1971 a bipartisan congressional group, including Senators [[Ted Kennedy]], [[William A. Steiger]], and [[Walter Mondale]], proposed a national, independent Legal Services Corporation;&lt;ref name="nyt031871"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/18/archives/bipartisan-group-in-congress-urges-a-legal-services-corporation-for.html| title=Bipartisan Group in Congress Urges a Legal Services Corporation for the Poor | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1971-03-18 | accessdate=2008-02-03 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, administration officials such as Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] and chief domestic advisor [[John Ehrlichman]] were proposing their own somewhat similar solution.&lt;ref name="nyt031871"/&gt;

===Creation and the Ford era===
The idea behind the LSC was to create a new corporate entity that would be funded by Congress but run independently, with eleven board members to be appointed by the president subject to senate confirmation.&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt;

LSC was created by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 ({{USPL|93|355}}).&lt;ref name="lsc-act"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/laws/act.php | title=LSC Act and Other Statutes | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | date=1974-07-25 | accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The LSC Act contains certain rules and restrictions regarding what LSC grantees can do.&lt;ref name="lsc-act"/&gt;  The initial budget was set at $90 million.&lt;ref name="brock-96"/&gt;

Naming and confirmation of the first LSC board was delayed by inaction and opposition,&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt; but by July 1975 President [[Gerald R. Ford]] had named, and the Senate approved, the first board, with [[Cornell University Law School]] Dean [[Roger Conant Cramton]] as its first chair.&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt; Debate existed from the start among the board members as to whether LSC's role should be the OEO's one of using lawsuits and other means to attack broad underlying difficulties of the poor, or whether the focus should be more narrowly defined to addressing small, specific situations.&lt;ref name="brock-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time072875"/&gt; The LSC Act said that the organization was to pursue "equal access to justice," but Cramton wrote that while the law was intended to proscribe the blatantly political objects of the 1960s OEO work, it was worded ambiguously.&lt;ref name="brock-96"/&gt;

===Carter era===
In December 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] nominated [[Hillary Rodham]] to the board of directors of the LSC,&lt;ref name="carter-nom"/&gt; for a term to expire in July 1980.&lt;ref name="carter-nom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=7026 | title=Jimmy Carter: Nominations Submitted to the Senate, Week Ending Friday, December 16th, 1977 | work=American Presidency Project | accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodham, an attorney with [[Rose Law Firm]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and the wife of [[Arkansas Attorney General]] [[Bill Clinton]], had a background in children's law and policy and had worked in providing legal services for the poor while at [[Yale Law School]]. She had also done 1976 campaign coordination work for Carter in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="lh"&gt;[[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7432-2224-5}}, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bernstein-book"/&gt; This was a [[recess appointment]], so Rodham took her place on the board without immediate Senate confirmation. Rodham was nominated again in January 1978 as a regular appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29817 | title=Jimmy Carter: Nominations Submitted to the Senate, Week Ending Friday, January 27th, 1978 | work=American Presidency Project | accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1978, the Carter administration chose the thirty-year-old Rodham to become chair of the board, the first woman to become so.&lt;ref name="brock-96"/&gt;  The position entailed her traveling monthly from Arkansas to [[Washington, D.C.]] for two-day meetings.&lt;ref name="brock-96"/&gt;

During Rodham's Senate confirmation hearings, she subscribed to the philosophy that LSC should seek to reform laws and regulations that it viewed as "unresponsive to the needs of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodham was successful in getting increases in Congressional funding for LSC, stressing its usual role in providing low-income people with attorneys to assist them in commonplace legal issues and framed its funding as being neither a liberal nor a conservative cause.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', p. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; By her third year on the LSC board, Rodham had gotten the LSC budget tripled.&lt;ref name="brock-105"&gt;Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to LSC during this time came from both Republican Congressman [[James Sensenbrenner]], who favored a "[[judicare]]" approach of compensating private lawyers for work done for the poor,&lt;ref name="brock-105"/&gt; and [[The Conservative Caucus|Conservative Caucus]] head [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]], who objected to LSC representing [[gay]]s.&lt;ref name="brock-105"/&gt;

LSC funding was at its highest-ever mark, in inflation adjusted dollars, in fiscal 1980,&lt;ref name="bernstein-book"&gt;[[Carl Bernstein]], ''A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton'', [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], {{ISBN|0-375-40766-9}}. pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ejm30"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ejm.lsc.gov/ejmissue7/longclimbtojustice.htm | title=Long Climb to Justice | work=Equal Justice Magazine | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | date=Fall 2004 | accessdate=2008-03-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405181359/http://www.ejm.lsc.gov/ejmissue7/longclimbtojustice.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a budget of $303 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924030,00.html | title=Hybrid Help | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | date=1980-04-21 | accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 6,200 poverty lawyers filed suits using its funds on behalf of 1.5 million eligible poor clients;&lt;ref name="time112381"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922707,00.html | title=One More Narrow Escape | author=Bennett H.

===Reagan era===
LSC was strongly opposed by some political groups. As [[Governor of California]] in the 1960s, [[Ronald Reagan]] had advocated elimination of all federal subsidies for free legal services to the poor in civil cases,&lt;ref name="time112381"/&gt; and had tried to block a grant to [[California Rural Legal Assistance]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="time112381"/&gt; Indeed, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine would state, "Of all the social programs growing out of the Great Society, there is none that Ronald Reagan dislikes more than the Legal Services Corporation."&lt;ref name="time100383"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926255,00.html | title=An Organization at War with Itself | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | date=1983-10-03 | accessdate=2008-02-03 | first1=David S. | last1=Jackson | first2=Michael S. | last2=Serrill}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRLA's executive director would characterize Reagan's attitude towards the organization as akin to that of [[Darth Vader]].&lt;ref name="time100383"/&gt;

When President Reagan took office in January 1981, he attempted to eliminate the LSC by zero funding it.&lt;ref name="time112381"/&gt; Supporters of LSC rallied to defend it; [[American Bar Association]] president [[W. Reece Smith, Jr.]] led 200 lawyers to Washington to press its case.&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt;  The [[U.S. House Judiciary Committee]] blocked Reagan's zero-funding action in May 1981,&lt;ref name="nyt051481"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30C15F73C5C0C778DDDAC0894D9484D81 | title=House Panel Rebuffs Reagan and Backs Keeping Legal Aid For Poor | author=Stuart Taylor Jr. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1981-05-14 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did cut financing to $260 million for both of the next two years as well as place additional restrictions on LSC lawyers.&lt;ref name="nyt051481"/&gt; By the following month, the now Republican-controlled [[U.S. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee]] had cut proposed financing to $100 million,&lt;ref name="nyt061681"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30714F6385C0C758DDDAF0894D9484D81 | title=House Action Near in Fight Over Legal Aid | author=Stuart Taylor Jr. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1981-06-18 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of what ''[[The New York Times]]'' deemed an "increasingly bitter ideological struggle".&lt;ref name="nyt061681"/&gt; Moreover, Reagan administration officials accused LSC of having "concealed and understated" its lobbying activity and support for politically motivated legislation.&lt;ref name="nyt061681"/&gt;

In November 1981, the Reagan administration, although still hoping to eliminate LSC, decided to replace all eleven LSC board members with nominations of their own.&lt;ref name="nyt110881"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50E10FA355D0C7B8CDDA80994D9484D81 | title=Coast Lawyer Reported As Legal Aid Choice | author=Stuart Taylor Jr. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1981-11-08 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the new chairman they chose Ronald Zumbrun, president of the ideologically opposite [[Pacific Legal Foundation]],&lt;ref name="nyt110881"/&gt; which had previously defended the state of California against several legal aid lawsuits.&lt;ref name="nyt110881"/&gt; For fiscal 1982, LSC's budget was reduced by 25 percent to $241 million,&lt;ref name="time112381"/&gt; with new rules prohibiting most class action suits and lobbying.&lt;ref name="time112381"/&gt;  Zumbrun's nomination was sufficiently controversial that in January 1982, the Reagan administration dropped it, and instead made a [[recess appointment]] of William J. Olson to be chair.&lt;ref name="nyt010182"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F70E14F9385C0C728CDDA80894DA484D81 | title=Reagan Chooses Lawyer as Chief of Legal Aid Agency for the Poor | author=Irvin Molotsky | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1982-01-01 | accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olson had headed the Reagan transition team dealing with LSC and had personally recommended its abolition, so LSC advocates were not mollified.&lt;ref name="nyt010182"/&gt;

At the same time, the Reagan administration had named six other board members as recess appointments.&lt;ref name="nyt010182"/&gt; In February 1982, the Carter-appointed members of the previously existing board filed suit to against the recess appointments, claiming they were unlawful and that they should be enjoined from holding meetings.&lt;ref name="brock-110"&gt;Brock, ''Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodham hired fellow [[Rose Law Firm]] associate [[Vince Foster]] to represent her in the case&lt;ref name="brock-110"/&gt; and to seek a restraining order against Reagan.&lt;ref name="bernstein-book"/&gt; The Reagan nominees may &lt;!-- not sure Bernstein is right on this --&gt; have been prohibited from meeting with the Legal Service Corporation before confirmation.&lt;ref name="bernstein-book"/&gt;

Rodham also prodded Senate Democrats to vote against Reagan's nominees.&lt;ref name="bernstein-book"/&gt;  The nominees did undergo heavy criticism in Congress, with one labeled a bigot and Olson lambasted for his transition position.&lt;ref name="brock-110"/&gt;  In March 1982, yet another new chair was named, [[Indiana University]] law professor [[William F. Harvey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC153BF935A35750C0A964948260 | title= Legal Services Chief Picked | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=United Press International | date=1982-03-06 | accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Olson would remain on the board.&lt;ref name="nyt120982"/&gt;  Harvey and Rodham had a conference call in which Rodham reiterated her desire for the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="brock-110"/&gt;  That action, ''McCalpin v.

In September 1983 the [[General Accounting Office]] found that in early 1981, LSC officials and its local affiliates had used federal funds in assembling opposition to Reagan's efforts to eliminate LSC, and that this use had been in violation of the LSC Act's restrictions against such political activity.&lt;ref name="nyt092183"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50F12F73A5C0C728EDDA00894DB484D81 | title=Ex-Legal Aid Officials Accused of Fund Abuse | author=Stuart Taylor Jr. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1983-09-21 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such actions against the LSC Act were not crimes, and the GAO report did not claim any crimes had taken place.&lt;ref name="nyt092183"/&gt; The investigation had been initiated by the LSC of 1983 ordering a series of "raids" on their own offices to attempt to discover evidence of LSC of 1981 actions questionable,&lt;ref name="time100383"/&gt; prompting ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to declare LSC "an organization at war with itself."&lt;ref name="time100383"/&gt;

More recess appointments were made by Reagan in late 1983, in 1984, and in early 1985, with again none of them being confirmed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="mvd"/&gt; Indeed, LSC's board would go a total of three and a half years populated by recess appointments.&lt;ref name="mvd"/&gt;  Finally in June 1985 the Senate confirmed the latest batch of Reagan nominations.&lt;ref name="mvd"/&gt; The Carter board lawsuit, since renamed and appealed as ''McCalpin v. Durant'' to the [[United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit]], was then decided later in June 1985 as moot.&lt;ref name="mvd"/&gt;

===George H. W. Bush era===
Overt White House hostility towards LSC ended with the [[George H. W. Bush administration]], with calls for level funding rather than decreases.&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt; Under board chair George Wittgraff, LSC began to ease relations with private lawyers and with state grantees.&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt;  In fiscal 1992, LSC saw a funding increase back to $350 million.&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt;

===Clinton era===
The first two years of the [[Clinton administration]] saw more growth for LSC, as former chair McCalpin returned to the board and the previous former chair was now [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt;  Funding rose to a high mark in absolute terms of $400 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt;

Things turned upon the advent of the [[Republican Revolution]].&lt;ref name="ejm30"/&gt; In fiscal 1996, once the Republican party had taken over Congress the year prior, LSC had its funding cut again, from $400 million to $278 million.&lt;ref name="wapo060196"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-785874.html | title=Attacked as Left-Leaning, Legal Services Suffers Deep Cuts | author=William Booth | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=1996-06-01 | accessdate=2008-02-07 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new set of much more extensive restrictions were added to LSC grantees. The organization's supporters expressed disappointment that the Clinton administration did not make LSC a critical priority in its budget battles with the Republican Congress, especially given Hillary Clinton's former role in it.&lt;ref name="wapo060196"/&gt;

As part of a comprehensive "[[welfare reform]]" of federal welfare laws beginning in 1996, most significantly the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], Congress imposed restrictions on the types of work that LSC grantee legal services organizations could engage in. For example, LSC-funded organizations could no longer serve as counsel in class action lawsuits&lt;ref name="wapo060196"/&gt; challenging the way public benefits are administered. Additionally, LSC grantees faced tightened restrictions on representing immigrants, specifically those illegally in the country.&lt;ref name="wapo060196"/&gt; However, in 2001, the restriction on welfare advocacy was ruled unconstitutional in ''[[Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez]]''.

However, non-LSC funded organizations are not subject to these restrictions leading the legal services community to adopt a two-track approach: LSC restricted counsel taking on individual clients but not engaging in class actions, and non-restricted counsel (using private donor funding) both taking on individuals as well as engaging in otherwise restricted litigation. Poverty lawyers in both tracks still work together where they can, being careful not to run afoul of LSC restrictions.

===George W. Bush era===
According to LSC's 2009 report "Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans," all legal aid offices nationwide, LSC-funded or not, were together able to meet only about 20 percent of the estimated legal needs of low-income people in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsc.gov/press/documents/LSC%20Justice%20Gap_FINAL_1001.pdf ''Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans''], pages 4 and 9. Legal Services Corporation, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2007, LSC had a budget of some $350 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lsc.gov/about/FY07app.php | title=FY 2007 Appropriation | publisher=Legal Services Corporation | accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama era===
[[File:FEMA - 45644 - Mass Care Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signing at FEMA Headquarters.jpg|thumb|John Eidleman, Senior Program Counsel of Legal Services Corporation, standing next to [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] Administrator W. Craig Fugate and [[American Red Cross]] President and CEO [[Gail J. McGovern]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 22, 2010.]]

In 2009 during the [[Obama administration]], the LSC was on the path to getting a $50 million increase in its $390 million budget.&lt;ref name="cbs072809"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/28/eveningnews/main5194529.shtml | title=Legal Services Investigated for Waste | author=Sharyl Attkisson | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the LSC came under criticism from Senator [[Charles Grassley]], who said, "There's just a lot of money being wasted," citing several [[General Accounting Office]] and [[Inspector General]] reports.&lt;ref name="cbs072809"/&gt;

By fiscal 2011, the annual budget amount for the LSC was $420 million.&lt;ref name="lthskj"&gt;[http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2011/02/obama-proposes-legal-services-corp-budget-increase.html Obama Proposes Legal Services Corp.

On December 16, 2014, the President signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY 2015 that includes $375 million for LSC.&lt;ref name="2013 budget"/&gt;

===Trump era===
In February 2017, the Trump administration identified LSC as one of a number of programs that could be eliminated in its proposed budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lafraniere|first1=Sharon|last2=Rappeport|first2=Alan|title=Popular Domestic Programs Face Ax Under First Trump Budget|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/us/politics/trump-program-eliminations-white-house-budget-office.html|work=The New York Times|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However despite this intentioning, the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018]] "Omnibus bill" that passed Congress and was signed by the executive in March 2018 actually contained a modest increase for the LSC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/23/heres-whats-in-the-budget-bill-nobodys-bothered-to-read-217701&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions==
Due to the up-and-down nature of LSC's political history, there are many restrictions on lobbying, advocacy, and general impact work which apply to LSC-funded organizations.  Here they are broken into categories of expressly forbidden, forbidden with LSC funds, and expressly permitted.

In the language of the regulation, recipient organizations may not attempt to influence the passage or defeat of a bill, constitutional amendment, initiative, referendum, executive order, or provision which appropriates funds or defines the functions or authority of LSC or the recipient (45 CFR 1612.3).&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* This includes using resources from a recipient organization to support lobbying efforts on employees' own time – don't even take an envelope! (45 CFR 1612.3(c))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* The caveat is that organizations may lobby at the State and local level with non-LSC funds regarding funding for their organization (45 CFR 1612.6(f)).&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

* Form or organize an association, labor union, or other similar organization. This is distinct from holding informational meetings for attorneys or forming organizations of eligible clients for advice on service delivery (both of which are allowed). You may also advise your clients on the legal procedures for forming these types of organizations themselves, and even help them with documents like bylaws (45 CFR 1612.9).&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Represent clients in criminal proceedings (unless you are appointed by a court or a situation arises out of your representation of the client in a civil case) (45 CFR 1613)&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

* Provide legal assistance to ineligible aliens (45 CFR 1626.3; see 45 CFR 1626.5 to judge eligibility), unless the alien in question is, or is the parent of someone subject to battery or extreme cruelty by a spouse, parent, or member of their spouse's or parent's family residing in the same household.

:* [[Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez|LSC v. Velasquez (2001)]] was considered a victory by those trying to chip away at LSC regulations. It didn't change the overall prohibition, but it deleted the restriction barring litigation which attempts to change welfare law in the context of representing an individual client (45 CFR 1693.4).&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

'''Recipients may, with non-LSC funding:'''

In many of their regulations, LSC only states activities that their funding cannot be used to support. In 45 CFR 1610.2(c)–(h), however, several different types of non-LSC funding are defined:

:“(c) IOLTA funds means funds derived from programs established by State court rules or
:legislation that collect and distribute interest on lawyers' trust accounts.
:(d) Non-LSC funds means funds derived from a source other than the Corporation.
:(e) Private funds means funds derived from an individual or entity other than a
:governmental source or LSC.
:(f) Public funds means non-LSC funds derived from a Federal, State, or local government or
:instrumentality of a government. For purposes of this part, IOLTA funds shall be treated in
:the same manner as public funds...
:(h) Tribal funds means funds received from an Indian tribe or from a private nonprofit
:foundation or organization for the benefit of Indians or Indian tribes."&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

With these definitions in mind, 45 CFR 1610.4 goes on to specify what each type of funding can be used for:
* Tribal funds can be used for whatever purpose they were granted (45 CFR 1610.4(a))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Public, IOLTA, and Private funds can be used for whatever purpose they were granted, as long as it doesn't violate LSC's regulations (45 CFR 1610.4(b)-(c))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Non-LSC funds generally can be used to assist clients who are not financially eligible under LSC guidelines (45 CFR 1610.4(d))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

In addition, the category of general non-LSC funds may be used to:
* Support a political party, association, candidate, ballot measure, initiative, or referendum – but not during working hours or at the recipient's office location (45 CFR 1608.3(b))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Respond to a written request from an agency, legislative body, elected official, etc. to participate in rulemaking or to provide oral or written testimony in order to provide information which may include analysis and/or comments on legislation (45 CFR 1612.6(a))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* However, you can only provide your testimony to the requesting party or parties – it cannot be distributed to a wider audience (45 CFR 1612.6(b));&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* You may not arrange for the written request (45 CFR 1612.6(c));&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* And, you must report this activity to LSC (45 CFR 1612.6(d)).&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Recipients may also provide oral or written comments to an agency in a public rulemaking session without having been requested (45 CFR 1612.6(e))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Lobby at the State or local level regarding the recipient's funding (45 CFR 1612.6(f))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Assist an ineligible alien or his or her child who has been subjected to battery and/ or extreme cruelty by the alien's parent, spouse, or a member of the parent's or spouse's family residing in the same household as the alien. To qualify, the alien him- or herself cannot have participated in the abuse, and the representation must be related to preventing or ending the abuse (45 CFR 1626.4(a)).&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Comment in a public rulemaking proceeding or respond to a written request for testimony in a legislative session or committee meeting concerning welfare reform (45 CFR 1639.5)&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Participate in legal activity which seeks to obtain or compel an individual or institution to provide or assist with euthanasia or assisted suicide (45 CFR 1643.3) or a "nontherapeutic abortion" (term not defined) (LSC Act §1007(b)(8)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.lsc.gov/about/lsc-act-other-laws/lsc-act LSC Act | LSC – Legal Services Corporation: America's Partner for Equal Justice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the 1996 Appropriations Act §504(a)(14))&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3019eas/pdf/BILLS-104hr3019eas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Participate in legal activity seeking to desegregate elementary or secondary schools (LSC Act §1007(b)(9))&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Participate in legal activity relating to violation(s) of the Military Selective Service Act or desertion from the Armed Forces of the United States (LSC Act §1007 (b)(10))&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Recipients may, with any funding:'''
* Accept fee-generating cases in situations in which local pro bono attorneys or the referral service are not viable options (45 CFR 1609.3)&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* In terms of accounting, fees garnered from these services must go into the same category as the recipient's LSC grant in the same proportion that LSC funds supported the activity (versus other funds) (45 CFR 1609.4)&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
:* This regulation was changed in Section 533 of the 2010 Appropriations Act from a statutory prohibition (which had been implemented in the 1996 Appropriations Act Section 504(a))
* Accept reimbursement from clients for out-of-pocket expenses related to their case, if the client has agreed to pay ahead of time and in writing (45 CFR 1609.5(a))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Represent eligible clients at the administrative level (45 CFR 1612.5(a))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Initiate or participate in litigation challenging a governmental agency's rules, regulations, policies, etc. (45 CFR 1612.5(b))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Communication with an agency to receive information (45 CFR 1612.5(c)(2))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

* Advise a client of his or her right to contact an elected official (45 CFR 1612.5(c)(6))&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;
* Provide assistance to eligible aliens (45 CFR 1626.5; also lists criteria for eligibility), as well as specific categories of other aliens (45 CFR 1626.10 and 1626.11)&lt;ref name="lsc.gov"/&gt;

==Board of directors==
LSC is headed by an 11-member Board of Directors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="lsc-board"/&gt; By law, the Board is bipartisan: no more than six members may be of the same political party.&lt;ref name="lsc-board"/&gt;  The current composition of the board is:
* Board Chair: [[John G. Levi]]

:''Go directly to the [[Constitutions of Spain#Table|Table]]''

Spain has [[Promulgation|proclaimed]] a number of Constitutions. The current [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Magna Carta]] of 1978 is the culmination of the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. 

The idea of a national constitution for Spain arose from the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] initiated as a result of the [[French Revolution]] 

The earliest document recognized as such was [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|La Pepa]] passed in 1812 as a result of the [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814), which was a [[War|military conflict]] between the [[First French Empire]] and the allied powers of the [[Spanish Empire]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] for control of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

During the [[Francoist State]], there were many attempts to create stable institutions that did not (at least directly) emanate from Fransisco Franco as they did in the post-war period. The Fundamental Laws of the Realm (Spanish: ''Leyes Fundamentales del Reino'') were a constitution in parts enacted through nearly 20 years starting in the 1950s. They established the very institutions that would later, under [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] and Prime Minister [[Adolfo Suárez]], commit "constitutional suicide" and pass the Political Reform Act, starting the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. Most of those Laws theoretically provided for a quite free state, but ultimately the power of the [[Caudillo]] was supreme.

Finally, the constitution in force is similar to the (unwritten) British democratic monarchy model, but the [[Catalan self-determination referendum, 2014]] has provoked calls for an entirely democratic federal republican model.
Below there is a comprehensive [[Constitutions of Spain#Table|table]], but this is an overview: 
* 1808–1814 Napoleonic restructuring from royal edict to bicameral parliament
* 1812 La Pepa The first attempt at decentralization or republicanism
* 1814 La Pepa derogated by the [[Monarchy of Spain|King]]
* 1834 Absolute monarchy
* 1837 Constitutional monarchy
* 1845 Regency empowerment
* 1856 Failed attempt at democracy
* 1869 Another failed attempt at democracy
* 1873 [[First Spanish Republic|1st Democratic Republic]]
* 1876 Failed attempt to become a federal republic
* 1931 [[Second Spanish Republic|2nd Democratic Republic]]
* 1936 Martial law under [[Francisco Franco]]
* 1939 – 1978 [[Francoist Spain]]
* 1978 Transition to [[History of Spain (1975–present)|democratic monarchy]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">'''''Miller v. National Broadcasting Co.''''' {{law report|232|Cal. Rptr|668}} (1986) is a [[US tort law]] case on [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]].

==Background==
On October 30, 1979 an [[NBC]] camera crew was following a group of [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] firefighters and [[paramedics]]. A call came in about a man having a [[heart attack]]. The camera crew and the paramedics rushed to the home of Brownie and Dave Miller. The camera crew, without consent from anyone, rushed into the house with the paramedics and taped footage of Mr. Dave Miller having what would be a fatal heart attack. The crew later that night would put the footage on the air, also without consent. Brownie Miller filed suit against NBC, Ruben Norte (a producer for NBC) and the city of [[Los Angeles]] for trespass, invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress.

==Legal Issue==
Does the media, even though they obtain consent from the group they are following (Police, firefighters, paramedics, etc.) have the same access privileges as the police of paramedics do if they are following them on scene?

==Decision==
The Court ruled, ultimately, in favor of the plaintiff on the charges of Invasion of Privacy and infliction of Emotional Distress.

===Reasoning===
&lt;blockquote&gt;One seeking emergency medical attention does not thereby "open the door" for persons without any clearly identifiable and justifiable official reason who may wish to enter the premises where the medical aid is being administered…the clear line of demarcation between the public interest served by public officials and that served by private business must not be obscured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disposition==
Reversed- The [[California Courts of Appeal]] reversed the summary judgment of the District Court in favor of the defendants and ruled in favor of Brownie Miller.

'''''National Broadcasting Co. v. United States''''', 319 U.S. 190 (1943),{{ref|citation}} was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held on May 10, 1943 that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] had the power to issue regulations pertaining to associations between broadcasting networks and their affiliated stations, otherwise known as "chain networks."  The case is important in the development of [[American administrative law]].

==Legal principles==
The scope of authority held by an agency is determined by the agency's [[organic statute (USA)|organic statute]].  Where Congress grants an agency the power to maintain and regulate an area guided by the "public interest, convenience, or necessity," such a grant of power can include the regulation of areas not explicitly contemplated by the organic statute, as long as they are within the scope of the purpose of the original statute.

Note: The approach in this case takes a much more expansive approach than the earlier case of ''[[ICC v. Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway Co.]]'' which provided for more limited powers for administrative agencies.  Specifically, ''ICC'' held that regulative powers must be expressly granted by statute and not implied, while ''NBC'' held that the issuance of regulations, though not expressly granted, are an  acceptable way for the agency to fulfill its statutory obligations to serve the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."

==Facts and procedural posture==
The FCC established [[Federal Communications Commission#Report on Chain Broadcasting|Chain Broadcasting Regulations]] in 1941, which specifically governed the licensing and content of chain broadcasting stations.  [[NBC]] sued to enjoin the enforcement of the regulations.  The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] dismissed the complaint, ruling for the government, and NBC appealed.

The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, ruling that the government had the power to enact and enforce the regulations in question.

==Analysis==
The FCC's authority stemmed from its organic statute, the [[Communications Act of 1934]].  The Act provided that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the purpose of this Act, among other things, to maintain the control of the United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission; and to provide for the use of such channels, but not the ownership thereof, by persons for limited periods of time, under licenses granted by Federal authority, and no such license shall be construed to create any right, beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the license.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Act also provided that the criterion governing the exercise of the Commission's license power is the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."

NBC argued that the FCC's power was limited to the technical aspects of radio transmission.  The Court found that it was not, but instead "we are asked to regard the Commission as a kind of traffic officer, policing the wave lengths to prevent stations from interfering with each other."

NBC argued that the Act did not explicitly allow the Commission to develop regulations for chain broadcasting.  The Court admitted this, but held that an explicit grant of power was not necessary in this context, because the field was new and dynamic, and that by granting power to the FCC, it intended "not niggardly but expansive powers."

NBC argued that the grant of power to the FCC was unconstitutionally vague, because it did not provide definite guidelines.  The Court found that the guidelines were the service of "public interest, convenience, or necessity," and that those guidelines were constitutionally sufficient.

The Court concluded that the Chain Broadcasting Regulations were simply the particularization of the Commission's conception of the "public interest" sought to be safeguarded by Congress in enacting the Communications Act.

==Context==
The Opinion of the Supreme Court was not unanimous and it led to a conflict with an earlier decision in ''Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station. 309 U.S. 470'' on March 25, 1940.

In ''Sanders Brothers'', the FCC interpreted Supreme Court decisions concerning broadcasting to mean that potential economic injury to an existing licensee was not grounds for refusing to license a competitor. (This FCC interpretation remained in place from 1940 to 1958.)

The Opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by [[Felix Frankfurter]] with Justices [[Hugo Black]] and Rutledge taking no part in the discussion or decision. Justice Murphy offered a dissenting Opinion by stating that the Court was effectively giving the FCC a power to regulate networks which had not been given to the FCC by Congress. Murphy stated that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''... we exceed our competence when we gratuitously bestow upon an agency power which the Congress has not granted. Since that is what the Court in substance does today, I dissent.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The decision effectively gave the FCC power to regulate the networks. As a result of this 1943 decision, NBC was forced to sell one of its networks and it was this action which then led to the creation of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC).

== Origin ==
On October 19, 2016, during the final presidential debate, [[Hillary Clinton]] explained her hopes to improve the Social Security program by increasing taxes on the wealthy, commenting that her own Social Security contributions would accordingly go up along with those of her opponent, Donald Trump's, "assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it". Trump immediately retorted "Such a nasty woman". His comment sparked an immediate reaction on various social media platforms, having the biggest response from Twitter. Women, and some men, embraced Trump's insult and turned it into a hashtag. Some users even referenced [[Janet Jackson]]'s 1986 single "[[Nasty (Janet Jackson song)|Nasty]]". Considered the female equivalent of Trump's "[[bad hombres]]", "nasty woman" became an international rallying cry for feminist women in defiance of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/190716-the-origins-of-nasty-as-a-word-insult-to-women|title=The Origins Of "Nasty" As A Word &amp; Insult To Women|last=Thorpe|first=JR|access-date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nasty Women Movement spawned from women coming together to battle injustice and inequality personally, professionally and socially. The movement champions intersectionality, the LGBTQ+ community and religious freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2082736/nasty-women-project-book-shows-how-trump-galvanised|title=Nasty Women Project: book shows how Trump galvanised an entire sex|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nasty Woman Movement''' is a movement that launched in 2016 as a result of a comment made by then-Presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]]. The phrase has been used by many feminists that describe themselves as being "just as nasty-maybe even more nasty- than the woman [Hillary Clinton] Trump had attempted to denigrate, via a weaponized mutter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Megan|title='Nasty': A Feminist History|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/nasty-a-feminist-history/504815/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with the goals of the Women's Movement through a poem, 'nasty woman,' which was recited at the [[Women's March on Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Seth|title=Ashley Judd Recites 'I am a Nasty Woman' Poem at Women's March on Washington|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/ashley-judd-nasty-woman-womens-march-video-watch-1201966160/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its intent is to reclaim the pejorative term, nasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinstein|first1=Julia|title=Women Are Reclaiming Their "Nastiness" After Trump Called Clinton "Nasty" During The Debate|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/miss-clinton-if-ya-nasty|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The phrase [nasty woman] became a rallying cry for women everywhere,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carothers|first1=Cassie|title=Women Reclaim 'Nasty Woman' as Their own Rallying Cry|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/aghast-at-trump-women-reclaim-nasty-women-as-their/|publisher=Global Citizen|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has generated merchandise that bears the term 'nasty woman.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatch|first1=Jenavieve|title=18 Perfect Pieces Of Merch For The Nasty Woman In All Of Us|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-perfect-pieces-of-merch-for-the-nasty-woman-in-all-of-us_us_5807c5c4e4b0b994d4c3705c|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, projects and exhibitions have used the term for their efforts to fundraise for [[Planned Parenthood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearson|first1=Catherine|title=A Guide to Feminist Swag That Gives Back to Planned Parenthood|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/help-support-planned-parenthood-with-some-amazing-feminist-swag_us_586fec62e4b02b5f8588b7de|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the Women's March's support for the healthcare provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoder|first1=Katie|title=Women's March Co-Chair: 'Hands off Planned Parenthood' is Priority|url=http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/katie-yoder/2017/01/17/womens-march-co-chair-hands-planned-parenthood-priority|publisher=[[Media Research Center]]|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some celebrities favor the phrase, wearing 'nasty woman' T-shirts and expressing their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolfgang|first1=Ben|title=Clinton Seizes Upon 'Nasty Woman' as Trump takes Verbal Self-Destruction to New Heights|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/26/hillary-clinton-seizes-upon-nasty-woman-as-trump-t/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support was most notable on [[Twitter]], where the phrase was, approvingly, tweeted about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weaver|first1=Hilary|title=Celebrities React to Trump Calling Clinton "Such a Nasty Woman"|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/10/celebrities-strong-reactions-to-such-a-nasty-woman|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=April 24, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
Various offshoot independent projects from the Nasty Women Movement have raised funds for the organization [[Planned Parenthood]]. The fundraising is in direct response to President [[Donald Trump]]'s conservative [[pro-life]] agenda to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood due to their abortion services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1357/defund-planned-parenthood/|title=Updated - Trump-O-Meter: Defund Planned Parenthood|last=Gillin|first=Joshua|date=|work=PolitiFact|access-date=April 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Nasty Woman" Apparel ===
Sales from the viral "Nasty Woman" T-shirt created by Google Ghost and worn by various celebrities and many others involved in the movement have thus far raised over $130,000 for Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://people.com/bodies/nasty-woman-t-shirts-raise-over-100000-for-planned-parenthood/|title=Sales of 'Nasty Woman' T-Shirts Raise More Than $100,000 for Planned Parenthood|last=|first=|date=December 21, 2016|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=April 17, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Ghost has since then created other products revolving around the Nasty Women Movement and continues to donate 50% of all their merchandise sales to Planned Parenthood.

We will not tolerate any move backwards in time in terms of the policies that affect my body, my health, my quality of life, my freedom." &lt;ref name="Furman-Art Exhibit Article" /&gt;  The creators asked artists to price their pieces at $100 or less so anyone can afford them. Fiore explained, "I want audience members who have never bought a work of art before to come to the exhibition and be moved by the experience and fall in love with a piece and think "$30, yeah I can afford that, and I'm helping Planned Parenthood!" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_uk/article/nasty-women-exhibition-post-election-anxiety|title=The Nasty Women Exhibition is Art's Answer to Trump's Nearing Presidency|last=|first=|date=|website=Creators (Vice)|language=en-us|access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, the Nasty Women exhibitions have raised over $180,000 for Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nastywomenexhibition.org/|title=Nasty Women|website=Nasty Women|language=en-US|access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''referendum to approve a new constitution''' was held in [[Qatar]] on 29 April 2003. The constitution was overwhelmingly approved, with almost 98% in favour. The population of the country was estimated to be around 790,000 at the time of the referendum with only 85,000 registered voters. Voter turnout was 84.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionguide.org/results.php?ID=341 IFES Election Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quick succession relief''' applies where there are two charges of [[Inheritance tax]] within five years. Inheritance tax is normally chargeable on the [[Estate (law)|death estate]] when an individual dies. The death estate is the sum of assets less allowable debts and funeral expenses. Allowable debts are those incurred for full consideration and those imposed by law e.g. tax.

Quick succession relief is calculated as:
:Tax paid on first transfer x net transfer
:gross transfer x relevant %

The net transfer is the amount actually received by the transferee after Inheritance tax. The gross transfer is the amount chargeable to the Inheritance tax. The relevant % relates to the period of time between the first transfer and the date of death:
;Relief %
:One year or less  = 100%
:One year but less than two years = 80%
:Two years but less than three years = 60%
:Three years but less than four years = 40%
:Four years but less than five years  = 20%

'''''R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport'''''&lt;ref&gt;By convention, for judicial review cases the monarch appears in the title of the case as the nominal bringer of the action. In reality the action was brought by Factortame Limited against the Secretary of State.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[judicial review]] case taken against the [[United Kingdom government]] by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached [[European Union law]] by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK. The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law.

The litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages:
*''Factortame I'', where the High Court and then the House of Lords both made a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]] on the legality of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]]'s ("MSA") requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75% UK owned. After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law, ''Factortame'' saw the House of Lords confirm the [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]] of [[EU law]] over national law in the areas where the EU has [[Principle of conferral|competence]] because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The House of Lords judgment is referred to as ''R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 2)'' [1991] 1 AC 603.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Factortame II'', where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law.
*''Factortame III'', where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law.
*''Factortame IV'', where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the ''[[Francovich v Italy]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1990) C-6/90&lt;/ref&gt; principle, that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss (also known as the doctrine of [[state liability]]).
*''Factortame V''&lt;!--which court?--&gt;, holding that claims after 1996 were statute-barred, since claims against a member state were like other claims in [[tort]] under the [[Limitation Act 1980]].

==Facts==
The EU's [[Common Fisheries Policy]], which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all [[member states]] and introducing [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|structural funds]] to ensure modernisation of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/displayFtu.do?language=en&amp;id=74&amp;ftuId=FTU_4.4.1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015910/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/displayFtu.do?language=en&amp;id=74&amp;ftuId=FTU_4.4.1.html |archivedate=11 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their [[exclusive economic zone]], which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985,&lt;ref name=tcl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortamebackground.html|title=Thomas Cooper Law: "FACTORTAME BACKGROUND"|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116105902/http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortamebackground.html|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on [[overfishing|fishing stocks]] led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of "[[total allowable catch]]es" which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the [[British Fishing Boats Act 1983]] (BFBA).&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt; In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen.&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt;

From 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy [[fishing vessel]] registration requirements contained in the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894]].  Although the 1894 Act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 Act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortameabout.html|title=Thomas Cooper Law: "ABOUT FACTORTAME"|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116105900/http://www.thomascooperlaw.com/factortameabout.html|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as "quota hopping".

In order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked [[preliminary questions]] to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG - see [[Agegate]] (C-3/87, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1989:650}}) and [[Jaderow]] (C-216/87, {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1989:651}}).&lt;ref name=tcl/&gt; In 1988 the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] and the [[Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations]] were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had "a genuine and substantial connection" with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any [[Chartering (shipping)|charterer]], manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A "qualified person or company" was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, "qualified persons".

As from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame's vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for [[Judicial review in English Law|judicial review]] was brought by its owners in the [[Divisional Court]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] in December 1988.

==''Factortame I''==
Factortame Ltd sought, first, a [[preliminary injunction]] declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to [[direct effect|directly effective]] rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the [[Treaty of Rome]]), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43&amp;ndash;48), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Secretary of State]] from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased.

HMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries.  In the event this assertion proved false.

===High Court===
On 10 March 1989 the Divisional Court ([[Patrick Neill, Baron Neill of Bladen|Neill LJ]] and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) for a [[preliminary ruling]] under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: [[European Union law]]). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of [[English law]] and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the ''[[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]''. HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal ([[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson MR]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham LJ]] and [[Michael Mann (judge)|Mann LJ]]) reversed the Divisional Court's decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged "to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right". Furthermore, it did not believe that the Divisional Court had "acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established". The Divisional Court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ.

===House of Lords===
The case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] ([[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Lord Bridge]], [[Henry Brandon, Baron Brandon of Oakbrook|Lord Brandon]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Oliver]], [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] and [[Charles Jauncey, Baron Jauncey of Tullichettle|Lord Jauncey]]) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an [[Act of Parliament]]. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have "conferred upon them rights directly contrary to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]'s sovereign will". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.

Nevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts "against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law" to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the Divisional Court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law.

===European Court of Justice===
The action was lodged at the [[ECJ]] on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only 6 months from its commencement before the Divisional Court to the House of Lords' judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame.

[[Advocate-General]] [[Giuseppe Tesauro|Tesauro]] argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1990:216}}). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in [[Simmenthal]] (case 106/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ's case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not "be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect" (case 61/79, [[Denkavit]], {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1978:49}}). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords' argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate-General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights.

On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as "full court" of 11 justices) ''en banc'' gave its ruling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/1990/C21389.html bailii.org: 1st ECJ decision in re Factortame]. {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1990:257}} Tesauro, AG; [[David Vaughan (attorney)|David Vaughan]], [[Gerald Barling]], [[David Anderson (attorney)|David Anderson]], and [[Stephen Swabey]] for the Applicant; [[Timothy J G Pratt]], Sir [[Nicholas Lyell]], [[Christopher Bellamy]], [[Christopher Vajda]] for the Respondent; as well as the state of Ireland, the [[European Commission]], and Rawlings Trawling Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; rephrasing the question posed as "whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule". Following the Advocate-General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.

On 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ's ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on Parliamentary sovereignty. [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]] acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]]).

In deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ's first ruling that Factortame's arguments had "considerable force". Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law.

Addressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ's decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, [[Nigel Bridge, Baron Bridge of Harwich|Lord Bridge]] remarked that such comments were "based on a misconception", and that under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the law regulating the UK's membership of the EU, it had "always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law". In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies.

These comments&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bridge]] [1991] 1 AC 603, 658; quoted in {{cite book  | last = Craig  | first = Paul  | authorlink = Paul Craig (law professor)  |author2=Gráinne de Búrca | title = EU Law, Text, Cases and Materials  | edition = 4th| year = 2007| publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-927389-8 |quote=Some public comments on the decision of the Court of Justice, affirming the jurisdiction of the courts of member states to override national legislation if necessary to enable interim relief to be granted in protection of rights under Community law, have suggested that this was a novel and dangerous invasion by a Community institution of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament. But such comments are based on a misconception. If the supremacy within the European Community of Community law over the national law of member states was not always inherent in the EEC Treaty it was certainly well established in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice long before the United Kingdom joined the Community. Thus whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary. Under the terms of the 1972 Act it has always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court, when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law. ... Thus there is nothing in any way novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in those areas to which they apply ...|page=367f}}&lt;/ref&gt; were perceived by [[Henry William Rawson Wade|Sir William Wade]] as "revolutionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Wade | first = Sir William | authorlink = Henry William Rawson Wade |author2=Forsyth, Christopher  | title = Administrative Law | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford  | isbn = 978-0-19-876525-7 | page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed.

Such an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' and ''[[Hunt v Hackney Borough Council]]'' to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and "statutory" or "constitutional" acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in ''Thoburn''.) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972.

Furthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by [[Lord Diplock]] in the case of ''[[Garland v British Rail Engineering]]''). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of ''[[Macarthys v Smith]]'', [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.

==''Factortame II'' compatibility==
On 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221/89 on the question referred by the High Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:320}}, 2nd ECJ decision in re Factortame.  David Vaughan, Gerald Barling, David Anderson, and Stephen Swabey for the Applicant, Timothy J.G. Pratt, Sir [[Nicholas Lyell]], [[Christopher Bellamy]], [[Christopher Vajda]], and [[Andrew Macnab]] for the Respondent, and six national governments plus the [[European Commission]]. Opinion [[Advocate-General]]: {{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:113}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General [[Jean Mischo|Mischo]]'s opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that "it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law". In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality.

In the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual's residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as "the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]". In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law.

The UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a "real economic link" existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to "concern only the relations between the vessel's operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries". In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions.

==''Factortame III'' state liability==
{{main|Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany}}
Following the ECJ's second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the [[Bundesgerichtshof|German Federal Court]] had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of ''[[Brasserie du Pêcheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland]]'' and so the two cases (C46/93 and C48/93) were joined.

At this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in ''[[Francovich principle|Francovich]]'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1991:428}}), which established the principle that "a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law". The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to "the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States".

In its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1996:79}}, Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93: Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Factortame Ltd and Others" 5 Mar 1996. Tesauro, AG; 6 other EU member state governments; the [[European Commission]], 8 lawyers for 97 Claimants, and [[J.E. Collins]], [[Stephen Richards (judge)|Stephen Richards]], [[Christopher Vajda]] and [[Rhodri Thompson]] for the Respondent.&lt;/ref&gt; the court of nine justices ''en banc'' reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question.

The court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are:

# the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals;
# the breach must be sufficiently serious;
# there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.

In the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be "sufficiently serious" it must be "manifest" and "grave". National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance.

==''Factortame IV'' right to damages==
The matter came back to the Divisional Court ([[John Hobhouse, Baron Hobhouse of Woodborough|Hobhouse LJ]], [[Lawrence Collins|Collins J]] and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for [[exemplary damages]]. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal ([[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf MR]], [[Konrad Schiemann|Schiemann LJ]] and [[Robert Walker, Baron Walker of Gestingthorpe|Walker LJ]]) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/75815.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Spanish win legal fish fight|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HMG appealed again to the House of Lords ([[Gordon Slynn, Baron Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn]], [[Donald Nicholls, Baron Nicholls of Birkenhead|Lord Nicholls]], Lord Hoffmann, [[James Clyde, Baron Clyde|Lord Clyde]] and [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]]).

The House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG's reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act's application. The case would now go back to the Divisional Court for the amount of damages to be determined.

In March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed £285 million, received £55 million including interest of some £26 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010208/text/10208w02.htm |title=House of Lords, Hansard Debates, 8 February 2001 |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Factortame V'' limitation issues==
On 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the [[Technology and Construction Court]] (a division of the High Court) held, under the [[Limitation Act 1980]], Factortame's claims against the UK government were "actions founded on tort", and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.

The judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for [[Measure of damages under English law#Special classes of damages|injury to feelings]] and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem.

==Significance==
The ''Factortame'' case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]]. [[Henry William Rawson Wade|Sir William Wade]] argues that the Factortame judgment alters the [[Rule of Recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sovereignty - Evolution or Revolution?|journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]]|year=1996|first=Sir William|last=Wade|authorlink=Henry William Rawson Wade|volume=112|issue=|page=574|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice has ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which apply to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. In current practice, the UK recognises the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in ''[[Macarthys Ltd v Smith]]'', Lord Denning MR said, "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act—with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it—or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Denning in ''Macarthys Ltd v Smith'' [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in {{cite book | last = Steiner | first = Josephine |author2=Lorna Woods |author3=Christian Twigg-Flesner  | title = EU Law  | edition = 9th  | year = 2006  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-927959-3|chapter=Section 4.4.2: Effect of the European Communities Act 1972, s.2(1) and (4) |quote=If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act    with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it   or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament. |page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeuleg/38-xiv/5020802.htm| title = Select Committee on European Scrutiny Minutes of Evidence: Examination of Witnesses (Questions 229-239): Rt hon Jack Straw MP and Mr David Frost| accessdate =2008-01-09 | author = Jack Straw MP| authorlink = Jack Straw| date = 2005-02-08| work = House of Commons Publications|quote = I think your Committee will be familiar with what Lord Denning, then Master of the Rolls, said in ''[[McCarthy v Smith]]'': "If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision of it or with the intention of acting inconsistently with it—it says so in express terms—I should have thought it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute in our Parliament." That much is clear. Other consequences would follow in those circumstances, which arise from our signature on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaty, Article 27, which says that you have to respect the international obligations into which you have entered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of the UK's ultimate sovereignty was supported by [[John Laws (judge)|Lord Justice Laws]] in the ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' case, when he said that "there is nothing in the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act]] which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament's legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions."

That European law has primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6/64 ''[[Costa v ENEL]]'' (1964), the ECJ stated that "the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields". In Case 26/62 ''[[Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen]]'' (1963) their ruling states that "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights".

The question of who has the ultimate ''[[kompetenz-kompetenz]]'' (i.e. the right to decide the limits the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction) has not been settled.

== Controversy ==
As CEO of America's Natural Gas Alliance, Hopper resigned under pressure from the board with NGI reporting and citing, "The ANGA board was extremely disappointed with her performance."  Natural Gas Intel reported, " several senior staff at ANGA have recently jumped ship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/91066-anga-ceo-hopper-pressured-to-resign|title=ANGA CEO Hopper Pressured to Resign|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gretchen Carlson]], and a newly elected board, installed Hopper as CEO under scrutiny from state organizations and former Miss Americas who had wanted a national search for new staff leadership.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/08/miss_america_letter_call_for_gretchen_carlson_resi.html|title=11 former Miss Americas call for resignation of Gretchen Carlson from pageant|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven former Miss Americas say that following the email scandal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/08/miss_america_letter_call_for_gretchen_carlson_resi.html|title=11 former Miss Americas call for resignation of Gretchen Carlson from pageant|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in the exit of the former CEO and chairman of the board in December, they were given the opportunity to install "our very own sisters." Former titleholders assumed temporary co-chair roles on the board. From there, Carlson was supposed to head up a national search to find a new CEO.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Hopper orchestrated the removal of previous [[Miss America|Miss America Organization]] leadership by leaking internal emails to [[Dick Clark Productions]] eventually leading to the organization dropping the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/12/miss_america_organization_rocked_by_leaked_emails.html|title=Miss America Organization rocked by leaked emails and damning report on CEO's behavior|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a few short months into her tenure as President and CEO of the Miss America Organization, 22 states held a vote of no confidence&lt;ref name="Bauerlein"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/miss-america-organization-split-by-metoo-era-swimsuit-decision-1531047601|title=Miss America Organization Split by #MeToo Era Swimsuit Decision|last=Bauerlein|first=Valerie|date=2018-07-08|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the leadership of both Hopper and Chairwoman [[Gretchen Carlson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/08/miss-america-board-led-by-gretchen-carlson-facing-revolt-by-state-pageant-officials.html|title=Miss America board, led by Gretchen Carlson, facing revolt by state pageant officials|last=Lieu|first=Amy|date=2018-07-08|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; demanding their resignations, citing a lack of transparency and adherence to best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/08/miss-america-camps-clash-over-pageants-new-swimsuit-free-direction/766282002/|title=Miss America insiders clash over pageant's new, swimsuit-free direction|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The calls for resignation came as several board members abruptly were forced to resign.  Former Miss Americas [[Katherine Shindle|Kate Shindle]] and [[Laura Kaeppeler|Laura Kaeppeler Fleiss]] listed “toxic culture” as their reason for departing from the board in June 2018. Former Miss North Carolina Jennifer Vaden Barth and Former Miss Maine Valerie Crooker Clemens, detailed they were forced to resign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/will-gretchen-carlson-be-removed-miss-america-board-members-want-her-out-1013252|title=Miss America Chairwoman Gretchen Carlson receives internal backlash for axing the swimwear segment|date=2018-07-08|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Gretchen Carlson|Carlson]] issued a letter stating they were trying to gain control of the organization, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;ref name="Bauerlein" /&gt;

On August 10, 2018, 11 former Miss Americas released a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/08/miss_america_letter_call_for_gretchen_carlson_resi.html|title=11 former Miss Americas call for resignation of Gretchen Carlson from pageant|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for both [[Gretchen Carlson|Carlson]] and Hopper to resign. Just several days later, Miss America 2018 [[Cara Mund]] wrote a letter to her fellow Miss America titleholders alleging that Carlson and Hopper “silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as [[Miss America]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/08/17/no-miss-america-should-be-humiliated-before-giving-up-crown-cara-mund-blasts-pageant-leadership/|title=‘No Miss America should be humiliated’: Before giving up crown, Cara Mund blasts pageant leadership|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cara Mund|Mund]] went on to say that after the new board took over in January, she “was given three talking points” and told to stick to them: That “Miss America is relevant”; that “the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement started with a Miss America” (Carlson, who sued her [[Fox News]] boss [[Roger Ailes]] for sexual harassment in 2016); and that both she and Carlson were graduates of elite colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-miss-america-bullied-20180817-story.html|title=Reigning Miss America says she was bullied, manipulated by pageant leadership|last=Parry|first=Wayne|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisourcepar|Sanquhar Declaration}}
The '''Sanquhar Declaration''' was a speech read by Michael Cameron in the presence of his brother, the [[Covenanter]] leader [[Richard Cameron (religious leader)|Richard Cameron]], accompanied by twenty armed men in the public square of [[Sanquhar]], Scotland, in 1680, disavowing allegiance to [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the government of Scotland, in the name of "true [[Protestant]] and [[Presbyterian]] interest", opposition to government interference in religious affairs.

This symbolic demonstration, essentially a declaration of war, was among the first of a series of events that led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the end of the reign of the [[House of Stuart]].

'''Ship money ''' was a [[tax]] of [[medieval]] origin levied intermittently in the [[Kingdom of England]] until the middle of the 17th century. Assessed typically on the inhabitants of coastal areas of England, it was one of several taxes that English [[monarch]]s could levy by [[royal prerogative|prerogative]] without the approval of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. The attempt of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] from 1634 onwards to levy ship money during peacetime and extend it to the inland counties of England without Parliamentary approval provoked fierce resistance, and was one of the grievances of the English propertied class in the lead-up to the [[English Civil War]].

==Traditional practice==

The [[Plantagenet]] kings of England had exercised the right of requiring the maritime towns and counties to furnish ships in time of war, and this duty was sometimes commuted for a money payment.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Ship-money |volume=24 |page=982 |first=Ronald John |last=McNeill |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several statutes of [[Edward I]] and [[Edward III]], notably their confirmations of [[Magna Carta]], had made it illegal for [[the Crown]] to exact any taxes without the consent of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], the prerogative of levying ship money in time of war had never fallen wholly into abeyance. In 1619 [[James I]] aroused no popular opposition by levying £40,000 of ship money on London and £8550 on other seaport towns.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Opposition==

In 1628, Charles I, having prorogued Parliament in early summer and after his assent to the [[Petition of Right]], proceeded to levy ship money on every county in England without Parliament, issuing writs requiring £173,000 to be returned to the exchequer.  This was the first occasion when the demand for ship-money aroused serious opposition,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in view of the declaration in the petition that

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Y]our subjects have inherited this freedom, that they should not be compelled to contribute to any tax, tallage, aid, or other like charge not set by common consent, in parliament.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Charles' requests to [[sheriffs]] were rejected by the overburdened inland populations; [[William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Northampton]], [[Lord Lieutenant|Lord-Lieutenant]] of Warwickshire, and the [[William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury|Earl of Banbury]] in Berkshire, refused to assist in collecting the money; and Charles withdrew the writs.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1634, Charles made a secret treaty with [[Philip IV of Spain]] to assist him against the Dutch.  To raise funds for this assistance [[William Noy]], the [[Attorney-General]], suggested that a further resort should be had to ship money. Noy set himself to investigate such ancient legal learning as was in existence in support of the demand, and unearthed old records of ship money in the [[Tower of London]]; some historians, such as [[Henry Hallam|Hallam]], have seen Noy's investigations as evidence that before Charles' levying of ship money the tax had been disused and forgotten for centuries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The King obtained an opinion in favour of the legality of the writ from [[Lord Keeper]] [[Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry|Coventry]] and the [[Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]], whereupon the writ was issued in October 1634 and directed to the justices of London and other seaports, requiring them to provide a certain number of ships of war of a prescribed tonnage and equipment, or their equivalent in money, and empowering them to assess the inhabitants for payment of the tax according to their substance.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Three writs ===
The distinctive feature of the writ of 1634 was that it was issued, contrary to all precedent, in time of peace. Charles desired to conceal the true aim of his policy, which he knew would be detested by the country, and he accordingly alleged as a pretext for the impost the danger to commerce from pirates, and the general condition of unrest in Europe.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The citizens of London immediately claimed exemption under their charter, while other towns argued as to the amount of their assessment; but no resistance on constitutional grounds appears to have been offered to the validity of the writ, and a sum of £104,000 was collected.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On October 9, 1635, a second writ of ship tax was issued, directed on this occasion, as in the revoked writ of 1628, to the sheriffs and justices of inland as well as of maritime counties and towns, demanding the sum of £208,000 which was to be obtained by assessment on personal as well as [[real property]], payment to be enforced by [[distraint]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

This demand excited growing popular discontent, which now began to see in it a determination on the part of the King to dispense altogether with parliamentary government. Charles, therefore, obtained a written opinion, signed by ten out of twelve judges consulted, to the effect that in time of national danger, of which the Crown was the sole judge, ship money might legally be levied on all parts of the country by writ under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The issue of a third writ of ship money on 9 October 1636 made it evident that the ancient restrictions that limited the levying of the tax to the maritime parts of the Kingdom and to times of war (or imminent national danger) had been finally swept away, and that the King intended to convert it into a permanent and general form of taxation without parliamentary sanction. The judges again, at Charles's request, gave an opinion favourable to the prerogative, which was read by [[Earl of Coventry|Lord Coventry]] in the [[Star Chamber]] and by the judges on [[Assize Court|assize]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Refusal, then repeal===
[[File:John Hampden - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|right|John Hampden]]
Ship money was enough of a financial success to help Charles to meet peacetime government expenditures in the 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won’t Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9-16&lt;/ref&gt; Payment was, however, refused by [[John Hampden]], a wealthy [[Buckinghamshire]] gentleman landowner. The case against the latter (''[[R v Hampden]]'')&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Thomas Bayly Howell]] |title=State Trials |volume=3 |pages=825–1316 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ngDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA525}}&lt;/ref&gt; was finally heard before all 12 judges in the [[Court of Exchequer Chamber]], after [[John Denham (judge)|Denham]] had expressed his doubts to [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer|Davenport]], who was wary of the four judge panel which would have sat in a less unusual case.&lt;ref&gt;C.V. Wedgwood ''The King's Peace'' Collins (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; Hampden was defended by [[Oliver St John]] and [[Robert Holborne]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The Solicitor-General, [[Sir Edward Littleton, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Littleton]], and the Attorney-General, [[John Bankes|Sir John Banks]], prosecuted. [[John Hampden|Hampden]] lost the case, seven judges to five.:&lt;ref&gt;''Salmon's State Trials'', vol 1, p. 698&lt;/ref&gt;

* For the King:
** [[Richard Weston (Royalist)|Sir Richard Weston]]
** [[Justice of the Common Pleas|Sir Francis Crawley]]
** [[Robert Berkeley (judge)|Sir Robert Berkley]]
** [[Justice of the Common Pleas|Sir George Vernon]]
** [[Thomas Trevor (1586-1656)|Sir Thomas Trevor]]
** [[William Jones (judge)|Sir William Jones]]
** [[Sir John Finch]]
* For Hampden:
** [[Justice of the King's Bench|Sir George Crooke]]
** [[Sir Richard Hutton]]
** [[John Denham (judge)|Sir John Denham]]
** [[John Bramston, the elder|Sir John Brampston]]
** [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer|Sir Humphrey Davenport]]

Charles and his ministers continued to levy Ship Money despite increasingly widespread opposition. The narrowness of the case encouraged others to refuse the tax, and by 1639, less than 20% of the money demanded was raised.  As matters deteriorated in England and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] starting with the [[Bishops' War]], ship money would prove insufficient to finance the king's military needs.  It would later be stopped by the [[Long Parliament]] when they voted the [[Ship Money Act 1640]]. Hampden went on to Parliamentary and [[English Civil War|Civil War]] leadership, only to die early on at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]]. Finally, half a century later, in the aftermath of the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] prohibited all forms of extra-Parliamentary taxation.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Somalia]] on 25 August 1979. The new constitution replaced the one approved in [[Somali constitutional referendum, 1961|1961]], and introduced a [[one-party state]] with a [[presidential system]] of government. It was approved by 99.78% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/so.html Elections in Somalia] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1931Fabrik_Ordnung1.jpg|thumb]]
The '''Swiss labor law''' covers all standards governing the [[employment]] of some kind. The regulation of the employment by private employers is largely harmonized at the [[Federal government|federal]] level, while public-sector employment still prevails a variety of [[cantonal]] laws. In particular, the civil standardization is distributed to a variety of laws. Of greater importance, particularly the new [[Swiss Federal Constitution|Federal Constitution]] of 1999, the [[Swiss Code of Obligations|Code of Obligations]], the [[Labour Code]] as well as in the public sector, the [[Federal Personnel Act]].

==Legal sources==
The following laws define the conditions under which people in Switzerland may be employed:&lt;ref&gt;J. Brühwiler: Arbeitsrecht in der Schweiz&lt;/ref&gt;

*The new [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] regulates some normative principles and the skills of the individual authorities, namely the competence of the Confederation and the cantons.
*Fundamentally, the individual labor contract law, is written down in the [[Swiss Code of Obligations]] (OR). Basically is bases on the agreement between employers and employees. However, a number of basic legal norms (necessary norms) must be respected, and have precedence in case of dispute. The [[collective labor agreement]] for its part, is also set in its environment in the OR.
*The Federal Law declaring collective agreements governs the official ways to declare collective agreements for industries and companies binding.
*Also compelling public law is the labor law is that the employee-side guarantees minimum protection standards regarding [[working hours]]. Today, it is usually undercut by collective employment arrangements.
*The [[Health protection at work|Health Protection at Work]] shall not apply in Switzerland as labor law, but is treated under the accident insurance law ([[SUVA]]).
*The working conditions of foreign workers (ISVA minimum standards in employment contracts) are posted only for individual projects / assignments in Switzerland. It is mainly wage and social dumping preventio.
*The federal law against undeclared work to prevent this regard abuses by employers 'and workers' side.
*If the State is the employer, the primary provisions of public law must be observed. The private law rules are only a subsidiary or analog-applied law. Since the cantons in the arrangement of their administrative law are largely autonomous, all cantons have their own regulations for public employment. At the federal level, the [[Federal Personnel Act]] (BPG) in particular  and as far as liability issues are concerned to note the [[Government Liability Act]] (VG).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">The '''Treaty of Frederiksborg''' ({{lang-da|Frederiksborgfreden}}) was a [[treaty]] signed at [[Frederiksborg Palace|Frederiksborg Castle]], Zealand, on 3 July 1720&lt;ref name=Heitz244&gt;Heitz (1995), p.244&lt;/ref&gt; (14 July 1720 according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]), ending the [[Great Northern War]] between [[Denmark-Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. Their Danish-Swedish part of the conflict began in 1700 but peace was restored the same year. Denmark rejoined the war in 1709 in a campaign to regain their lost provinces, [[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]. However the Swedish general [[Magnus Stenbock]] managed to defend the provinces without presence of the king, [[Charles XII]]. On other fronts Sweden was not so lucky, primarily at the hands of Russia in 1721, and the destruction of the Swedish army from [[Stralsund]], [[Swedish Pomerania]].

Sweden paid 600,000 [[Riksdaler]] in damages (as deposit for this money, Denmark temporary had held [[Wismar]], in [[Swedish Pomerania]]), broke her alliance with [[Holstein]] and forfeited her right to duty-free passage of [[Øresund]]. Denmark also gained full control over [[Schleswig]], while Danish-held areas of [[Swedish Pomerania]] were returned to Sweden.&lt;ref name=Heitz244/&gt; The [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] from 1660, ''Malmö Recess'' 1662, [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1679)]] and Stockholm also in 1679 (known as [[Peace of Lund]]) was now ratified for the fifth time.&lt;ref&gt;333Årsboken {{ISBN|91-7586-384-7}} , pages 248-255 (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wireless Internet service provider|Wireless ISPs]] generally use 5.725-5.825&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;br/&gt;
In the USA licensed amateur radio operators are authorized 5.650-5.925 GHz by Part 97.303 of the FCC rules.

U-NII is an [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulatory domain for 5- GHz wireless devices. U-NII power limits are defined by the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] Title 47 (Telecommunication), Part 15 - Radio Frequency Devices, Subpart E - Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure Devices, Paragraph 15.407 - General technical requirements. Regulatory use in individual countries may differ.

The European [[HIPERLAN|HiperLAN]] standard operates in same frequency band as the U-NII.

''Except where noted, all information taken from Annex J of IEEE 802.11-2007 modified by amendments k, y and n. Because countries set their own regulations regarding specific uses and maximum power levels within these frequency ranges, it is recommended that local authorities are consulted as regulations may change at any time.''

In 2007, the FCC began requiring that devices operating in channels 52, 56, 60 and 64 must have [[Dynamic Frequency Selection]] (DFS) capabilities. This is to avoid communicating in the same frequency range as some [[radar]]. In 2014, the FCC issued new rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/document/5-ghz-unlicensed-spectrum-unii|title=5 GHz Unlicensed Spectrum (UNII)|date=12 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for all devices due to interference with government weather radar systems. Fines and equipment seizure were listed as punishment for non-compliance.
