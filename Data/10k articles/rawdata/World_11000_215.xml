The '''ASEAN–Australia Development Cooperation Program''' (AADCP or AADCP II) is a seven-year program which jointly managed by ASEAN Secretariat and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID – aimed to helping ASEAN establish a regional Economic Community by 2015.

==History==
AADCP's precursor, a program called the ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program (AAECP), was founded in 1974. AADCP can be seen as a next phase of regional co-operation between Australia and Southeast Asia. The program was established after the membership of [[Burma]] (Myanmar), [[Cambodia]] and [[Lao PDR]] into the bloc. Planning for the new agency initially began in 1999 while its operations were scheduled to begin in 2005. During August 2002, Australia signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ASEAN committing A$45 million to the next phase.&lt;ref name= "AACDP" &gt;[http://www.aadcp.org/ ASEAN Australia Development Cooperation Program official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The purpose of AACDP is to promote co-operation between Australia and ASEAN in areas of agreed regional development priorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadcp.org/whatisaadcp.html AADCP, What is AADCP?]&lt;/ref&gt; It is funded by Australia's overseas aid agency, AusAID, a principal [[foreign aid]] management agency of the [[Australian government]], supervised by the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]. It was continued to keep pace with economic progress in Southeast Asia and to promote the strong relations between ASEAN and Australia.&lt;ref name= "AACDP" /&gt; Offices of AADCP are located in [[Jakarta]].

'''African Harps''', particularly [[arched harp|arched or "bow" harps]], are found in several [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions]], particularly in the north-east. Used from early times in [[Africa]], they resemble the form of [[Ancient Egyptian music|harps in ancient Egypt]] with a vaulted body of wood, parchment faced, and a neck, perpendicular to the resonant face, on which the strings are wound.

==Enanga==
[[File:Afrikaabteilung in Ethnological Museum Berlin 52.JPG|thumb|left|An arched harp from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]]]
{{main|Enanga}}
The '''ennanga''', '''nanga''', '''nnanga''' or '''enanga''' is a type of arched harp played by the [[Ganda people]] of [[Uganda]]. The [[sound box]] is made of a single piece of wood and roughly hemispherical. The top of the box is a stretched resonant membrane made of [[antelope]] skin, tied to a piece of hide at the bottom of the box.  The neck is attached to the inside of the box, exits through a small round opening on the membrane, and curves upward for about 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;cm. Seven or eight strings are attached to a piece of wood inside the box, and extend through the skin to tuning pegs inserted along the neck.  Sometimes small metallic rattling pieces are attached to the pegs, to color the sound. It is usually used to accompany men's singing.

'''Abalanga''' (harpist) are skilled performers and composers who work within a very structured paradigm to ensure that no two '''abalanga''' performances are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachel|first1=Muehrer|title=Playing techniques of the nnanga of Buganda|journal=African Music: Journal of the International Library of African Music|date=2012|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–76|doi=10.21504/amj.v9i2.1804|url=http://journal.ru.ac.za/index.php/africanmusic/article/view/1804|accessdate=3 September 2016|publisher=International Library of African Music, Rhodes University|location=Grahamstown|issn=0065-4019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kundi==
[[File:Egyptian harp.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Egyptian harp in the [[British Museum]]]]
The '''kundi''' is the five-string harp of the [[Azande]] and related people of Central Africa. It is an instrument traditionally played by young men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icommons.org/bringnbraai/|title=Bring n Braai|author=Daniela|accessdate=25 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090429051315/http://www.icommons.org/bringnbraai/| archivedate= 29 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar type of harp played by the [[Nzakara]] people.  The instruments are well known for their ornately carved heads. The instrument has generally fallen from popularity, though in 1993 some older players were recorded on the album ''Music from the Bandia Courts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gérard Assayag|author2=Hans G.

'''Ahold Czech Republic, a. s.''', [[trade name|doing business as]] '''Albert''', is a division of the [[Netherlands]]-based [[Ahold Delhaize]] group, operating in the [[Czech republic]]. The company entered the market in 1990 as Euronova a. s. Ahold Czech Republic is responsible for running the supermarket chain Albert, with about 330 locations.

==History==
The first Ahold Czech Republic, then still Euronova, store was opened in 1991, under the brandname Mana. This Mana outlet in [[Jihlava]] was the first supermarket in the [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/pred-25-lety-v-cesku-otevrel-prvni-supermarket-fou-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A160602_165334_ekonomika_nio|title=Před 25 lety v Česku otevřel první supermarket. Jak se tehdy nakupovalo?|date=2016-06-02|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ahold took over 56 outlets of the Austrian-based [[Julius Meinl]] supermarket, which left the Czech market, and subsequently remodelled them to their Albert brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/ahold-ziskal-obchody-meinl-za-911-milionu-fco-/ekoakcie.aspx?c=A061103_122346_ekoakcie_str|title=Ahold získal obchody Meinl za 911 milionů|date=2006-11-03|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the company dropped the Hypernova brand, re-branding all hypermarket operations to the name Albert Hypermarket.&lt;ref name=praguetv&gt;http://prague.tv/en/s72/Directory/c209-Shopping/n1604-prague-in-depth-shopping-supermarkets-and-hypermarkets&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 Ahold Czech Republic a.s. acquired 49 stores from [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]], 36 hypermarkets and 14 supermarkets for 5.25 billion Czech Crowns  5.165.213.000,00 CZK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/ahold-koupi-ceske-obchody-firmy-spar-d7y-/ekonomika.aspx?c=A140311_072432_ekonomika_js|title=SPAR odchází z českého trhu, z padesáti prodejen budou Alberty|date=2014-03-11|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this move Albert is now the biggest supermarket chain in the Czech Republic, totaling 330 outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aholddelhaize.com/en/brands/central-and-southeastern-europe/albert-czech-republic/|title=Albert, Czech Republic|website=Ahold Delhaize|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prague TV guide mentioned in 2015 both the original pioneering and current outdatedness of the Albert stores.&lt;ref name=praguetv/&gt;

The '''Badawiyyah''', [[Sufi]] [[tariqah|tarika]], was founded in the thirteenth century in [[Egypt]] by [[Ahmad al-Badawi]] (1199-1276). As a tarika, the Badawiyyah lacks any distinct doctrines. &lt;ref name="Ahmadiyyah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=el-Aswad|first1=El-Sayed|title=Muslim Worldviews and Everyday Lives|date=July 13, 2012|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780759121195|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnzhXfJfkAMC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Tanta,+Egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim1ryrk67QAhVMMSYKHXRhCJc4HhDoAQgqMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanta%2C%20Egypt&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, extremely popular during both [[History of Ottoman Egypt|the Mamluk and Ottoman periods of Egypt]]. [[Mamluk]] Sultans often supported elaborate 'Mawlids' at the resting place of [[Sheikh]] Ahmed al-Badawi (or ''Seyyid Badawi'' as he is more commonly known) in the [[Nile Delta]] town of  [[Tanta]].

During the Ottoman period, this order spread to [[Turkey]] and there were several [[Zawiyya|Tekkes]] or zawiyas in [[Istanbul]] many of which survived until the founding of the Turkish republic.

The mawlid of Seyyid Badawi is still celebrated in Egypt every year where the population of Tanta swells to almost double. Tents are placed in the streets around the [[Mosque]] of Seyyid Badawi where [[Qur'an]] recitations and sermons by important scholars from [[al-Azhar Mosque]] are delivered.

The '''Bank of Botswana''' ('''BoB''') is the [[central bank]] of [[Botswana]].

When Botswana gained independence from Britain in 1966, the country was part of the [[Common Monetary Area|Rand Monetary Area]] (RMA). In 1974 Botswana withdrew from the RMA, and the Bank of Botswana and Financial Institution Acts established the legal framework for a central bank in Botswana to be established in 1975. The [[Botswana pula|pula]] was launched as a national currency in 1976, and in 1977 the Bank of Botswana became the government banker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fred|last=Morton|first2=Jeff|last2=Ramsay|first3=Part Themba|last3=Mgadla|title=Historical Dictionary of Botswana|series=African Historical Dictionaries|volume=108|location=Metuchen, New Jersey|publisher=Scarecrow Press|edition=4th|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8108-5467-3|contribution=Bank of Botswana (BoB)|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barák Workers Association''' ({{lang-de|Arbeitervereinigung Barák}}) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] educational organization in Austria during the [[interbellum]] years. The association was linked to the [[Czech National Social Party|Czech National Socialist Party]], and was an important pillar of the party in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Brousek, Karl M.

[[Image:Jurij Dalmatin - book cover of the first complete translation of The Bible in Slovene language.jpg|thumbnail|Dalmatin's Bible]]
[[Image:Lukacs evangeliuma vendul.JPG|thumbnail|Catholic version by [[Mikloš Küzmič]].]]

The first translation of a sentence from the Bible ([[The Sheep and the Goats#Text of the passage|Mt 25:34]]) to Slovene appeared in the [[Freising Manuscripts]], dating to the 10th or the 11th century. The versions of the Bible for [[Slovenes]] are most closely connected with the activity of the Reformer of [[Carniola]], [[Primož Trubar]] and his associates and successors. They were intended for the [[Protestant]] Slovenes. Trubar translated the [[Gospel of Matthew]], which was printed at [[Reutlingen]] in 1555. In 1557, the first part of the New Testament was published at [[Tübingen]], the second part in 1560, and the last part in 1577. The complete New Testament was reissued in 1582. The Psalms appeared in 1566.

[[Jurij Dalmatin]], who was mentored by Trubar, translated the Old Testament and an edition of the entire Scriptures to Slovene. This was published under his direction at [[Wittenberg]] in 1583. [[István Küzmics]] published a New Testament for the [[Hungarian Slovenes]] ''([[Nouvi Zákon]])'' in the [[Prekmurje dialect]] at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in 1771. [[Miklós Küzmics]] published the catholic version ''([[Szvéti evangyeliomi]], Summa sztároga i nouvoga testamentoma szvéte histórie).'' An edition published at [[Kőszeg]] (Guns) in 1848 includes the Psalms ''(Knige 'zoltárszke),'' from [[Sándor Terplán]] and the translation of Moses's books and Josua's book ''(Moses i Josua)'' in 1929 from [[János Kardos]]. Other Prekmurje translators were [[István Szelmár]], [[Péter Kollár]], and [[János Szlepecz]].

In 1784, part of the New Testament for use by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] was printed at [[Ljubljana]] after being translated from the Vulgate by several hands. The second part of the New Testament was issued in 1786, and the Old Testament between 1791 and 1802.

[[Image:Brevis Commentarivs,p15.png|thumb|Page of the book.]]

'''''Brevis commentarius de Islandia''''' ([[English language|English]]: "Brief Commentary on Iceland") is a book in [[Latin]] written and published in [[Denmark]] in 1593 by the [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] scholar [[Arngrímur Jónsson]]. It is a "Defense of Iceland", in which he criticized the works of numerous authors who had written about the people and the country of Iceland. His main target was a poem by [[Gories Peerse]], a merchant who had written an entertaining and somewhat slanderous poem about Icelandic geography and ethnography. Arngrímur also criticized substantial works such as the ''Cosmographie'' of the German scholar [[Sebastian Münster]].

The ''Brevis commentarius de Islandia'' was reprinted in 1598 in [[Richard Hakluyt]]'s ''[[Principal Navigations of the English Nation]]''. This defense of Iceland and subsequent works were important for introducing European scholars to the ancient literature of Iceland and the richness of the manuscripts present there.

The '''Chiericati family''' were an affluent noble family from Vicenza, Italy during the 16th century.  The most notable were the three brothers who divided the family holdings and estates. Two of the brothers were to be [[patron]]s of [[Andrea Palladio]].

Count '''Girolamo Chiericati''' (??? - 1557) was an elected commissioner of Palladio's [[Basilica Palladiana|Basilica]]. He was among those who favoured giving important civic commissions to the inexperienced Palladio, personally [[champion]]ing his cause in municipal debate. He also commissioned the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] in 1550 on family land in Vicenza. After his death his son '''Valerio Chiericati'''  inherited the Palazzo Chiericati.

'''Giovanni Chiericati''' commissioned from Palladio the [[Villa Chiericati]] in the 1550s but did not live long enough to see it completed.

The '''Czech National Symphony Orchestra''' (ČNSO) ({{lang-cs|Český národní symfonický orchestr}}) is a [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]] in [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]].  It was established in 1993 by [[trumpet]] player [[Jan Hasenöhrl]]. [[Libor Pešek]] is the orchestra's chief conductor, having taken over in 2007 from American conductor [[Paul Freeman (conductor)|Paul Freeman]] who commenced with the orchestra in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech National Symphony Orchestra|url=http://www.cnso.cz/EN/orchestra.html|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Czech National Symphony Orchestra in popular music ==
In 1996, the orchestra played on the [[Ulf Lundell]] album ''[[På andra sidan drömmarna]]''.

When [[Lotta Engberg]] turned 40 years old in 2003, she went to Prague to record the [[ballad]] ''Nära livets mening'' together with the orchestra.  The song was included on the 2005 album ''[[Kvinna &amp; man]]'', as the last track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dansbandsbloggen.se/2005/03/pkostat-och-vlgjort-och-vldigt.html Dansbandsbloggen 8 March 2005 - ''Påkostat och välgjort''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008191706/http://www.dansbandsbloggen.se/2005/03/pkostat-och-vlgjort-och-vldigt.html |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 2003, in a [[Symphonic Game Music Concert]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], the orchestra became the first act to perform music written for video games live outside Japan.

In 2013, the orchestra recorded [[Ennio Morricone]]'s soundtrack to [[Giuseppe Tornatore]]'s ''[[The Best Offer]]''. In 2015 they toured with the composer during his 60th anniversary tour.
In July 2015, Morricone conducted the orchestra during the recording sessions of his film score to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[The Hateful Eight]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3127">'''Lecba Elizier Cadet''' (born c. May 1897)&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Island immigration records give his age on October 17, 1917, as "20 years, 5 months".&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Haitian people|Haitian]] [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] priest&lt;ref&gt;''Le Musée Vivant'' 24 Année Série D Numero 8, October–December 1960, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; who, in 1919 attended the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and [[Pan-African Congress#1st Pan-African Congress|First Pan African Congress]] on behalf of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA).&lt;ref&gt;''Race First'', by [[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]], Dover, Massachusetts: Majority Press, 1976, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family, education, and early life==
Eliezer was born in [[Port-de-Paix]], [[Haiti]], the son of Mesinor Pierre Cadet, a wealthy [[dyewood]] manufacturer.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Robert A.|title=The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers: 1826-August 1919|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the College of [[Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague]] and subsequently supported himself as a car mechanic in [[Paris]]. There he met [[Nancy Cunard]].&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Ian|title=Bonjour Blanc: A Journey Through Haiti|date=2012|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris Peace conference==
Initially, the [[International League for Darker People]], an umbrella organisation comprising the UNIA, had planned to send [[Ida B. Wells]] and [[A. Philip Randolph]] as delegates, with Cadet as interpreter. But as US authorities denied both Wells and Randolph passports and visas, the UNIA's Cadet, a Haitian national, became the organisations' sole delegate.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Grant: ''Negro With a Hat. The Rise and Fall of Marcus Garvey'', Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 174 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Cadet left the US at the end of February 1919 for [[Le Havre]], returning on December 1, 1919, to New York.&lt;ref&gt;According to Ellis Island immigration records.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Paris, his efforts to contact official delegates were mostly unsuccessful, except for a meeting with Liberian delegate [[Charles D. B. King]], who refused to support the UNIA's demand that control of the former German colonies should be given to Africans and the African diaspora. Cadet's reports to [[Marcus Garvey]], claiming that his efforts had been sabotaged by the [[NAACP]]s delegate [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], led to a break between Garvey and Du Bois.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Grant: ''Negro With a Hat. The Rise and Fall of Marcus Garvey'', Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 176-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Cadet went on to become a [[Hougan]] (Vodou priest) associated with the [[loa]] [[Damballa]].&lt;ref name = Hill/&gt;

FICIX was founded in 1993 and was originally called the "Finnish Commercial Internet Exchange". The name was changed to the current form in 2001, when a non-profit organization was founded to maintain operations.

FICIX-1 is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]]. Established in 1999, FICIX-2 is located in [[Pasila]], [[Helsinki]]. FICIX-3 is located in [[Oulu]] and was established in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hightechforum.kaleva.fi/index.cfm?alue=10&amp;Id1=721655&amp;OpenStory=1&amp;lang=1 HighTech Forum – Ouluun uusi ip-yhdysliikennepiste&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129225307/http://hightechforum.kaleva.fi/index.cfm?alue=10 |date=2007-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FICIX also operates the three [[root nameserver]]s located in Finland, I (in Espoo), K (in Helsinki), and J (in Oulu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ficix.fi/tiedotteet/tiedote-080407.txt | title = Ouluun uusi IP-yhdysliikennepiste ja juurinimipalvelin | language = Finnish | date = 2008-04-07 | accessdate = 2009-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090513045910/http://www.ficix.fi/tiedotteet/tiedote-080407.txt | archivedate = 2009-05-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German National Movement in Liechtenstein''' ({{lang-de|Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Liechtenstein}}, '''VDBL''') was a [[Nazism|National Socialist]] party in [[Liechtenstein]] that existed between 1938 and 1945.&lt;ref name="Liechtenstein National Archives" /&gt;  

==Formation and ideology==
The VDBL formed after the [[Anschluss]] of Austria in 1938, and advocated for the integration of Liechtenstein into the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]].

The organization disseminated its ideology through its newspaper, ''[[Der Umbruch]]''. 

A slogan associated with the party was ''Liechtenstein den Liechtensteinern!'' (Liechtenstein for the Liechtensteiners!). This implied a radical populism that would threaten the allegiance of the people of Liechtenstein to ruling [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz Josef II]]. 

==Coup attempt and party demise==
In March 1939, the VDBL staged an amateurish coup attempt, first trying to provoke a German intervention by burning [[swastika]]s, followed by declaring an ''[[Anschluss|Anschluß]]'' with Germany. The leaders were almost immediately arrested and the hoped-for German invasion failed to materialise.&lt;ref name="Liechtenstein National Archives" /&gt;  

The inability of the party to participate in the [[Liechtenstein general election, 1939|1939 elections]] (after a pact between the main parties to keep the election date a secret), combined with the drastic decrease in [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathies following the outbreak of [[World War II]] led to a temporary demise of the party. However, in June 1940 it was reconstituted under the leadership of Dr. [[Alfons Goop]]. During 1941 and 1942, the party was involved in vehement anti-Semitic agitation, urging a solution to the country's presumed "[[Jewish Question]]", accusing Jewish families in Liechtenstein of spying for the Allies. By early 1943, the VDBL had become an embarrassment to Germany: its recruitment for the [[Waffen-SS]] compromised Liechtenstein's neutrality, disquieting the Swiss. The [[Federal_Foreign_Office#Third_Reich|German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in March 1943 forced the VDBL to hold talks with the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] (VU), in [[Friedrichshafen]] under auspices of the Waffen-SS, in order to reach a fusion of both parties, which shared an anti-[[Bolshevik]] and anti-clerical programme. Severely disappointed, Goop resigned as party leader. In the end the VU only consented to some "cultural cooperation". When Germany's war fortunes declined, in July 1943 ''Der Umbruch'' was forbidden by the authorities. In 1946, party leaders were prosecuted for the 1939 coup attempt. Goop was in 1947 condemned for [[high treason]], to an imprisonment of thirty months.&lt;ref name="Liechtenstein National Archives" /&gt;

The '''History of Lower Normandy''' concerns that part of [[Normandy]] termed  [[Lower Normandy]] (in [[French language|French]] ''Basse-Normandie'') which was created as a new region of France in 1956, when the traditional province of Normandy, with an integral history reaching back to the 10th century, was divided into Lower and [[Upper Normandy]]. The region comprises three ''[[département]]s'', [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[Manche (département)|Manche]] and [[Orne]].

{{Violence against women}}
The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has designated November 25 as the '''International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women''' ([[UN General Assembly Resolution|Resolution 54/134]]).&lt;ref name="United" /&gt; The premise of the day is to [[raising awareness|raise awareness]] of the fact that women around the world are subject to [[rape]], [[domestic violence]] and [[violence against women|other forms of violence]]; furthermore, one of the aims of the day is to highlight that the scale and true nature of the issue is often hidden. For 2014, the official Theme framed by the [[UN Secretary-General]]’s campaign UNiTE to End Violence against Women, is ''Orange your Neighbourhood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Days|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism|work=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=21 November 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, the date is based on the date of the 1960 assassination of the three [[Mirabal sisters]], political activists in the [[Dominican Republic]]; the killings were ordered by Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] (1930–1961).&lt;ref name="United" /&gt; In 1981, activists at the [[Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Encuentros]] marked November 25 as a day to combat and [[raising awareness|raise awareness]] of [[violence against women]] more broadly; on December 17, 1999, the date received its official [[United Nations]] (UN) resolution.&lt;ref name="United"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/endviolenceday/|work=United Nations|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gasa|first1=Nomboniso|title=Women’s bodies are a terrain of struggle|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/womens-bodies-are-a-terrain-of-struggle-1183016|accessdate=22 May 2017|agency=IOL|publisher=''[[The Sunday Independent (South Africa)|The Sunday Independent]]''|date=21 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522204506/http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/womens-bodies-are-a-terrain-of-struggle-1183016|archivedate=22 May 2017|location=Cape Town, South Africa|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN and the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] have encouraged governments, international organizations and NGOs to organize activities to support the day as an [[international observance]].&lt;ref name="IPU resolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Parliaments Can and Must Promote Effective Ways of Combating Violence Against Women in All Fields|url=http://www.ipu.org/un-e/ipu-114-3-e.pdf|work=The 114th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union|publisher=IPU|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[UN Women]] (the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women) observes the day each year and offers suggestions for other organizations to observe it. For 2014, the focus is on how violence cuts across all 12 of the critical areas of concern of the [[Beijing Declaration]] and Platform for Action, which turns 20 next year.&lt;ref name="UN Women"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/end-violence-against-women|work=UN Women|publisher=UN Women||accessdate=21 November 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her message for 25 November 2014, UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1995, close to 20 years ago, 189 governments came together in Beijing. They adopted a Platform for Action that spelled out key strategies to end violence against women, empower women, and achieve gender equality. ... The promises from 20 years ago are still valid today. Together we must make 2015 the year that marks the beginning of the end of gender inequality. Now is the time for action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Women Executive Director's Message for 2014|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/11/ed-message-for-25-november|work=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=21 November 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his message on the day in 2013, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I welcome the chorus of voices calling for an end to the violence that affects an estimated one in three women in her lifetime. I applaud leaders who are helping to enact and enforce laws and change mindsets. And I pay tribute to all those heroes around the world who help victims to heal and to become agents of change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary-General's Message for 2013|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/endviolenceday/2013/sgmessage.shtml|work=United Nations|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 November 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Data on violence against women==

===Australia===
A March 2013 article on "The Conversation" online media outlet featured an article entitled "Ending violence against women is good for everyone" in relation to the observance of [[International Women's Day]] on that year. The article claimed that, while a general Australian belief exists that violence against Australian women is less severe in comparison to other nations, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] had revealed in a report that "one in three Australian women will experience physical violence in their lifetime, while 23% to 28% will experience sexual or emotional harm."&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending violence against women is good for everyone|url=http://theconversation.edu.au/ending-violence-against-women-is-good-for-everyone-11659|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=10 March 2013|author=Linda Murray|author2=Lesley Pruitt|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statistics were taken from a report, published in 2005 (reissue), entitled "Personal Safety Survey Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Safety Survey Australia|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/056A404DAA576AE6CA2571D00080E985/%24File/49060_2005%20(reissue).pdf|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=10 March 2013|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|format=PDF|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conversation article by Linda Murray and Lesley Pruitt then provided further Australia-specific data: "Violence is the leading cause of death, illness and disability for Australian women aged 15 to 44. It’s responsible for more illness and premature death than any other preventable cause, such as hypertension, obesity, or smoking."&lt;ref name="Pruitt" /&gt; The article refers to ''The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022'' that was published by the Australian government in September 2012&lt;ref name="Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their children|url=http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/our-responsibilities/women/programs-services/reducing-violence/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children/national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children|work=The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=10 March 2013|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the foreword of the Plan states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The National Plan sets out a framework for action over the next 12 years. This plan shows Australia’s commitments to upholding the human rights of Australian women through the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Declaration to End Violence Against
Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.&lt;ref name="Plan" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2014, Australia's VicHealth released the results of the National Community Attitudes towards Violence Against Women Survey. This was the third of a series of such surveys, the first dating from 1995, and the second from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Publications/Freedom-from-violence/2013-National-Community-Attitudes-towards-Violence-Against-Women-Survey.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924141242/http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Publications/Freedom-from-violence/2013-National-Community-Attitudes-towards-Violence-Against-Women-Survey.aspx |archive-date=2014-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/search/2013-national-community-attitudes-towards-violence-against-women-survey Findings from the 2013 National Community Attitudes towards Violence Against Women Survey (NCAS), 17 Sep, 2014 Last updated: 21 Nov, 2017 at vichealth.vic.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The information was gathered by telephone interviews with over 17,500 Australian men and women aged over 16 years, and indicated a continuing need for future prevention activity.

===Italy===
The latest data from the Italian Institute of Statistics point out that, in 2017, more than 49 thousand women asked for help to the anti-violence centers (63.7% with children, almost of them minors and 27% foreign citizen). And of these, more than 29 thousand have started a journey out of violence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.istat.it/it/violenza-sulle-donne/la-fuoriuscita-dalla-violenza/centri-antiviolenza|title=Centri antiviolenza e case rifugio|website=istat.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Human Rights Day==
The date of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women also marks the start of the "[[16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence|16 Days of Activism]]" that precedes [[Human Rights Day]] on December 10 each year.

'''Isterband''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "[[lard]]-strips") is a coarsely ground, lightly [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]] [[sausage]] from Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spisa.nu/action/subProductGroup?moreProductGroups=true&amp;productGroupId3=69&amp;productGroupId4=14376|title=Isterband|work=Spisa.nu|language=Swedish|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JBpv19qr|archivedate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of [[pork]], [[barley]] [[groats]] and [[potato]]. There are many varieties of isterband in [[Swedish cuisine]], such as "småländska isterband" from the region of [[Småland]], "syrliga isterband" with a slightly sour taste, and "lättisterband" with a low calorie content. Isterband is often served together with creamed dill potatoes and pickled [[beet]]root.

The '''Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra''' is a noted orchestra based in [[Ostrava]] in the northeast of the [[Czech Republic]]. It is named after the famous Czech composer [[Leoš Janáček]]. For previous US-projects it has performed under the name ''Czech Symphony Orchestra'' and ''Czech Radio Orchestra''. Its current conductor is [[Heiko Mathias Förster]].

The orchestra was established in 1954 and has toured all across the world. At present it is a 116 piece orchestra and since 1997 the orchestra has concentrated on performing recent compositions by composers such as [[Earle Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Maria de Alvear]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Petr Kotik]], [[Alvin Lucier]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Somei Satoh]], [[Martin Smolka]], [[Karlheinz]] [[Stockhausen]], [[Toru Takemitsu]], [[Edgard Varese]], and [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]].

In 2008, the orchestra performed the world premiere of the [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)#Derivative works|Rachmaninoff/Warenberg: Piano Concerto "No. 5"]] a work derived from [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 2]], arranged as a concertante for piano and orchestra by Alexander Warenberg. The recording was issued on the [[Brilliant Classics]] label and was largely well-received despite not being an original work of Rachmaninoff's. The orchestra was led by its present director of music [[Theodore Kuchar]] with Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy as soloist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arkivmusic.com|url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=190899|work=Rachmaninoff/Warenberg: Piano Concerto "no 5"|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jones' Battery''' is one of the best preserved of the "retired" [[artillery battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].  It was named after Sir [[John Thomas Jones]] who once controlled the fortifications here.&lt;ref name="Jones1827"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=John Thomas|title=Journals of Sieges Carried on by the Army Under the Duke of Wellington, in Spain, Between the Years 1811 and 1814: With Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvwxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA476|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=1827|publisher=T. Egerton|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Jones' Battery is close to the [[Moorish Castle]]. It was one of the first set of retired batteries which were proposed by General Sir [[John Thomas Jones|John Jones]]. Jones was an important fortifications expert well respected by military engineers. These "retired" batteries were the first to be set away from the shoreline in order that they could get increased range by taking advantage of the steep slopes of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. In addition the batteries location was less obvious to the enemy. Jones also built similar batteries at the Civil Hospital and at [[Raglan's Battery]] overlooking the harbour.&lt;ref name="Finlayson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fa &amp; Finlayson|title=The Fortifications of Gibraltar 1068-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC5QBR0oB04C&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-016-1|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859 this battery had eleven guns.&lt;ref name=map1859&gt;{{cite web|title=1859 Map of the Fortifications of Gibraltar|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/1859_Gibraltar_fortifications_map.jpg|publisher=UK National Archives MPH 1/23|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery was reportedly well preserved in 2006 as it still had the main wall, expense magazines, parapet and embrasures could be seen just off a road to the ''Moorish Castle Estate''.&lt;ref name="Finlayson55"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fa &amp; Finlayson|title=The Fortifications of Gibraltar 1068-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC5QBR0oB04C&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-016-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jones' idea eventually led to guns being sighted on the very top of the rock.&lt;ref name="Finlayson2006"/&gt;

'''Knabenschiessen''' is a traditional [[Schützenfest|target shooting competition]] in [[Zürich]],&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1616393,00.html?iid=fb_share|title=Heidi Get Your Gun |last=Bachmann|first=Helena|date=May 1, 2007|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; held on the second weekend of September each year.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/trail-of-the-unexpected-swiss-sports-529907.html|title=Trail Of The Unexpected: Swiss Sports|last=Packe|first=Cathy|date=26 March 2005|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival, officially held for the first time in 1889, is one of the oldest in Switzerland, dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

The competition is open to 13- to 17-year-olds who either reside or are enrolled in a school in the [[canton of Zürich]]. Originally reserved for boys (''Knaben''), the competition has been open to female participants since 1991. The shooting is with the [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] [[service rifle|ordnance rifle]], [[SIG SG 550]]. The competition is held in the shooting range at ''Albisgütli'' to the south-west of the city center, on the slope of [[Uetliberg]]. It is surrounded by a large fair.

[[File:Portuguese Morocco.PNG|thumb|300px|[[Morocco-Portugal relations|Portuguese possessions in Morocco]] (1415-1769).]]
'''Moroccan–Portuguese conflicts''' refer to a series of battles between [[Morocco]] and [[Portugal]] throughout history. 

The first military conflict, in 21 August 1415, took the form of a [[Conquest of Ceuta|surprise assault on Ceuta]] by the 45,000 Portuguese soldiers who traveled on 200 ships. It was later followed by the [[Siege of Ceuta (1419)|Siege of Ceuta]] in 1419. These events marked the beginning of the decline of the [[Marinid dynasty]] and the start of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. 

The major battle, [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]], fought at [[Ksar-el-Kebir]] on 4 August 1578, was a catalyst for the [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis]]. This resulted in a [[Iberian Union|dynastic union]] between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. 

The conflicts ended when Portugal gave up [[El Jadida|Mazagan]] in 1769.

'''Pornography in Europe''' has been dominated by a few pan-European producers and distributors, the most notable of which is the [[Private Media Group]] that successfully claimed the position previously held by [[Color Climax Corporation]] in the early 1990s. Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from [[Portugal]] (e.g. ''Naturalvideo'') to [[Serbia]] (e.g. ''Hexor''), who face varying levels of competition with international producers. The legal status of pornography varies widely in Europe; its production and distribution are illegal in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Bulgaria, while [[Hungary]] is noted for having liberal pornography laws.

== Albania ==
In [[Albania]], pornography is illegal only for producing, delivery, advertising, import, selling and publication of pornographic materials in persons under 18 years old. Child pornography is strictly prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code of the Republic of Albania|url=http://pbosnia.kentlaw.edu/resources/legal/albania/crim_code.htm|work=Article 117|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Austria ==
In 1990, the "Federal Act Against Obscene Publications and for the Protection of Youth Morally Endangered" was passed to regulate pornography in Austria. In 1994 a prohibition on child pornography was added to the law. Under these regulations the minimum age for buying softcore pornography in Austria is 16 and the minimum age for buying hardcore pornography is 18. Publication for profit of violent pornography or material depicting bestiality is illegal under the regulations, but possession and non-commercial exchanges of these types of pornography are legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC|first1=Robert T.|last1=Francoeur|first2=Raymond J.|last2=Noonan|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2004|isbn=9780826414885|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Belarus ==
Pornography is illegal in [[Belarus]]. Production, distribution, promotion, exhibition as well as possession with intent of distribution or promotion of pornographic materials or objects of pornographic nature is punished by Belarusian criminal law and results in compulsory community service, fine or up to 4 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravo.kulichki.com/vip/uk/00000025.htm#g30 Republic of Belarus Criminal Code&amp;nbsp;— Article 343. "Production and distribution of pornografic materials or objects of pornographic nature".] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography is legal in [[Belgium]]. Pornographic  products, mainly magazines and DVDs, are typically imported from the 3 neighbouring European countries of France, Germany, and the Netherlands, or from North America. There is also a little local production, mostly amateur.{{citation needed|date= November 2016}}

== Bulgaria ==
In the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] (1946–1990) pornography was only available to a comparatively limited number of people. What pornographic materials there were (mostly magazines and videocassettes) were smuggled into the country. The abandonment of censorship in the early post-communist period resulted in pornography becoming widely available. In the early 1990s pornographic magazines were sold at newsstands, pirated foreign pornographic videocassettes became available and foreign pornographic television stations were accessible. The first Bulgarian pornographic film was made in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recent Social Trends in Bulgaria, 1960-1995|last=Ninov|first=Borislav|editor-last1=Genov|editor-first1=Nikolai|editor-last2=Krasteva|editor-first2=Anna|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2001|isbn=9780773568259|series=Comparative Charting of Social Change|volume=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwsSPUrDfb0C|pages=395–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==

In 1976, a law that put considerable sanctions on pornographic films in distribution and taxation, known popularly as ''Code X'' was imposed, creating a situation that led pornography to develop itself on its own right. Since then, pornography has been a growing economy in [[France]], now existing in various forms from magazines to satellite TV broadcasting.

==Germany==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}
In the early years of [[Germany|German]] pornography began with the softcore film ''Graf Porno und seine Mädchen'' (Count Porno and his girls) in 1968. The movie's success (more than 3 million admissions) lead to a whole series of films that was and is referred to in German media as the ''Sex-Welle'' (sex wave). The most well known film of this period is ''[[Schulmädchen-Report]]: Was Eltern nicht für möglich halten'' (The School-Girl Report, what the parents don't believe possible) by [[Ernst Hofbauer]] in 1970. The sex scenes had become bolder with time and by 1975, when the legal ban of pornography was lifted, the era of German [[hardcore pornography]] began.

Director [[Hans Billian]] was the protagonist of the period and the films were usually in line with the so-called "[[Bavarian porn|Bavarian porn sex comedies]]", often depicting male performers as comic characters, like Sepp Gneißl in ''Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber'' (1977). This era was also characterised by several [[Josephine Mutzenbacher]] films.

Today's German pornography is generally very similar to the American "[[glamour (charm)|glamour]]" pornography though often tailored primarily for the German market. In contrast several German labels focus on a more "home-made" amateur flair, often focusing on intense hardcore themes such as [[gang bang]]s, [[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]] and [[urine fetishism]]; most notably 'German Goo Girls' and other series by [[John Thompson Productions]].

Due to popular belief outside of Germany, [[coprophilia|fecal pornography]] known as "Scheisse porn" (using the German slang word for faeces) or, more commonly, as "[[Coprophilia|Kaviar]]" (a generic term) supposedly is particularly popular in Germany, with companies like ''SG-Video'' and performers like Austrian [[Veronica Moser]] and [[Simon Thaur]] or English [[Ben Chambers]] specializing in the concept. Although German companies have their fair world market share in producing for this niche market, the major percentage is sold into export.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[MindGeek]]'s age-verification software AgeID, which is used to verify the ages of users of pornographic Internet websites, has been in use in Germany since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn check critics fear data breach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43292457|date=6 March 2018|author=Zoe Kleinman|work=BBC News|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, selling pornographic material to people under 18 years old is illegal, but in practice the law is not always enforced. Since 2008 there is also a legal little local production. Child pornography is strictly illegal.

==Hungary==
{{Main article|Pornography in Hungary}}
In [[Hungary]], the production of pornography mainly dates from the period after the [[History of Hungary#Free elections and a democratic government since 1989|fall of communism]] in 1989. The production and distribution of pornography was illegal under communism, but the laws were liberalised with the emergence of democracy.{{sfn|Sigel|2005|loc=The Hungarian Example|p=180}} Permissive government policies soon propelled the country to the forefront of the European pornography industry. Several foreign directors were attracted to the country's liberal legislation, cheap production costs and large supply of attractive female performers.{{sfn|Sigel|2005|loc=The Hungarian Example|p=179}} Eventually, domestic producers began to prosper as well, and several female actresses made big names for themselves within the industry. Hungarian pornography is different from that produced in America in the more natural appearance of its performers. The sex scenes also tend to be more extreme, with frequent use of [[anal sex]] and various forms of [[Double penetration|multiple penetration]].{{sfn|Sigel|2005|loc=The Hungarian Example|pp=187–9}}

{{main|Pornography in Italy}}
Although [[Italy]] had accumulated a lot of [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] pornography in the 1970s, hardcore pornography was not a usual trend until the 1980s. The first pornographic film in Italy was ''[[Il Telefono rosso]]'' (The red telephone) in 1983 by [[Riccardo Schicchi]] with [[Ilona Staller]] (aka "Cicciolina"). The film caused much controversy and it was restrained from legal release until 1986 with an alternate revision of Italian censorship laws.

In [[Malta]], pornography and obscene material was outlawed until later 2016, regardless of whether it has a commercial interest or whether it is directed to an adult audience. The relevant law in this respect was Article 208 (1) of the Criminal Code of Malta which prohibited the manufacture, print, importation, circulation and exportation of pornographic or obscene print, painting, photograph, film, book, card or writing, or any other obscene article whatsoever, whether for gain, or for distribution, or for display in a public place.

== Norway ==
In Norway, hardcore material was illegal until 2006 [[de jure]] to distribute, or sell, but legal to possess. Production, however, was not explicitly illegal, thus both photo and movie shoots occurred. One could acquire pornography abroad, on the Internet, or via satellite TV. Illegal porn shops also existed, especially in larger cities. To satisfy legal requirements, editors of erotic magazines, domestic TV channels, and cable TV obscured ''sexual organs in activity'' using black rectangles and the like. After the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] unanimously acquitted a former magazine editor on 7 December 2005 for publishing unobscured hardcore pornography in 2002, it became understood that printed hardcore pornography was no longer illegal. Pornography became legal on March 14th, 2006. Regular and cable TV tend to abide by the old standards, seeing that edited TV is regulated by a separate law and thus is not affected by the Supreme Court decision. Video-on-demand, however, is not regulated by the TV laws, and, thus, pornography is legal to order.

The depiction of illegal sexual activities, including those involving children, animals, necrophilia, rape, violence, or the use of force, remains illegal.&lt;!--Some references in Norwegian:--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/12/07/451567.html | title=Høyesterett sier ja til porno&amp;nbsp;— Dagbladet.no | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1174004.ece | title=Porno-frifinnelse i Høyesterett | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/5301377.html | title=NRK.no&amp;nbsp;— Kultur | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Illegal to show hardcore material on cable TV while satellite TV remains a grey area and graphically demonstrates the legal ambivalence Norway has towards hard pornography.

== Poland ==
In Poland, as of September 1998, Article 202 of the national Penal Code makes pornography legal except for the production or possession of pornographic materials containing minors, bestiality (zoophilia), and "scenes of violence/rape". Also illegal is presenting or showing pornographic materials to people who do not want to have any contact with them, and to persons under 15 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU19970880553 Art. 200 § 3 and art. 202 of the Penal Code]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portugal ==
In Portugal, hardcore pornographic movies can only be shown in adult cinemas. Videos and magazines are openly sold in newsstands but are forbidden by law to be supplied to minors under the age of 18 years. Additionally, hardcore pornographic movies are banned from open-channel TV and can only be broadcast through encrypted/[[pay-per-view]] channels.

Child pornography (i.e., pornography depicting children or juveniles below the age of 18) is illegal. Although the national age of consent is 14, the age of legal responsibility (i.e., the age a person can sign contracts consenting to appear in pornography) is 18.

== Romania ==
Pornography is legal in [[Romania]]. Magazines must be enclosed in plastic bags (or something equivalent) with a small red square printed on the enclosing material. Pornographic TV channels offered by cable operators must be encrypted. Pornographic materials cannot be sold to minors under 18.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Russia==
Most Russian pornography is produced in [[Moscow]] and in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] where the largest [[adult film]] producer, ''SP-Company'', is based. The types of Russian adult films may range from [[gonzo pornography]] to adaptations of Russian classics (''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' (by Tatiana Taneyeva (2003)), ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (by [[Armen Oganezov]] &amp; [[Sergei Pryanishnikov]] (2002)) etc.) and these productions basically aim the domestic market. Much of the pornography is produced for the international internet market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

According to Russian law, consumption of pornography is allowed though the production of it is not. The illegal production, distribution, and "public demonstration" of pornography is punishable by a 2- to 6-year prison term. [[Roskomnadzor]], the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015 the agency required the blocking of the Russian-language version of [[Pornhub]] and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia Blocks Access to Popular Porn Sites|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/26316-russia-pornhub-roskomnadzor-blacklist-media.html|date=15 September 2016|work=Transitions Online|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spain ==
Pornography was illegal in [[Francoist Spain]], although some people travelled to France to see films such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' and some group tours to French [[X-rated]] cinemas were organised. The censorship of that period ended in 1977 and the S-rating for films was introduced, allowing films with soft porn elements to be shown in mainstream cinemas. The film genre that arose was known as ''destape'' (undressing) and included popular films such as ''Las eróticas vacaciones de Stela'' (Stela’s Erotic Vacations), ''El mundo maravilloso del sexo'' (The Marvellous World of Sex), ''Trampa sexual'' (Sexual Trap) and ''La orgía'' (The Orgy). The magazine ''[[Interviú]]'', founded in 1976, had revealing covers of famous actresses and included nude photographs inside. In 1983 the "S" rating was replaced by the more permissive X-rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Spain’s sexual awakening: How a soft porn epidemic helped the country fly|url=https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/how-erotic-film-boom-helped-spain-fly-1-5604358|date=17 July 2018|author=Jesse Barker|newspaper=The News European|access-date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography is now legal in Spain, and enforcement of obscenity laws is lax. It is illegal to display pornographic material at newsstands. In many cities and towns there are a big variety of sex shops or erotic shops. E-commerce merchants from all around the world use [[I.P.S.P.]] (Internet clearing services) from Spanish banks.

Some shops follow a voluntary limit and do not sell to minors. Material that involves animals is legal, though it is subject to animal-welfare laws. [[BDSM#Nordic countries|BDSM]] is classified as an "illegal depiction of violence" (''olaga våldsskildring'').{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

It is illegal for people under the age of 18 to act or pose for pornography in Sweden. Pornographic photographs and films depicting children are illegal even if the material was legal in the originating country.

== Switzerland ==
Pornography in [[Switzerland]] is defined by the Article 197 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch (Switzerland)|Swiss criminal code]]. The first alinea states that «''Any person who offers, shows, passes on or makes accessible to a person who is under the age of 16 pornographic documents, sound or visual recordings, depictions or other articles of a similar nature or pornographic representations, or broadcasts any of the same on radio or television is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.''» Furthermore, it is illegal to produce, import, store, market, advertise, exhibit, offer, show, pass on or make accessible pornography that depicts sexual acts involving children (under 16 years old) or animals, human excrement, or acts of violence, called "hard pornography".

Since July 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/kobik/fr/home/dokumentation/informationen/2014-07-01.html La consommation de pornographie dure est punissable à partir du 1er juillet 2014], Cybercrime Coordination Unit Switzerland, [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]], retrieved 29-08-2014&lt;/ref&gt; human excrement and urine are not considered being "hard pornography" anymore. Until June 2014, actors aged 16 and above could participate in a pornography production; however, since July 2014, if a person "looks" or is under 18 years of age, the material is considered as pedo-pornography. This is due to the Swiss ratification of the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse|Lanzarote Convention]].

The age of viewing pornography stays fixed at 16 years old (Art. 197 al. 1 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch (Switzerland)|Swiss criminal code]]).

The same materials cited above are nevertheless not regarded as pornographic if they have a cultural or scientific value that justifies their protection by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19370083/index.html#a197 Swiss Criminal Code Art. 197 - Pornography], admin.ch.

== Turkey ==
{{Main article|Pornography in Turkey}}
Turkey, which is a [[secular state]] with a Muslim majority, was the first country to legally produce pornographic materials in the [[Muslim world]]. After a long period of producing Italian-inspired softcore comedies in the 1970s, the hardcore film ''[[Öyle Bir Kadın Ki]]'' was distributed in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Ukraine ==

Pornography was outlawed in [[Ukraine]] in 2009 when the then president [[Victor Yushchenko]] signed new legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/07/ukraine_bans_filth/ |title=Ukraine slaps ban on all porn |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been overwhelmingly approved by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/russia-and-its-neighbors/090708/gambling-porn-ukraine |title=In Ukraine, this photo may be porn |publisher=GlobalPost |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possession, distribution, sale and manufacture of pornographic materials are illegal, with laws strictly enforced. Possession of pornographic material can carry a fine or up to 3 years imprisonment. Pornography is defined by the law as "vulgar, candid, cynical, obscene depiction of sexual acts, pursuing no other goal, the explicit demonstration of genitals, unethical elements of the sexual act, sexual perversions, realistic sketches that do not meet moral criteria and offend honor and dignity of the human by inciting low instincts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/44052/ |title=‘Pornography’ banned, but not defined |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography for "medical purposes" remains legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/28624/ukraine-bans-pornexcept-for-medical-purposes/ |title=Ukraine bans porn…except for medical purposes |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wiska]], one of Ukraine's internationally known [[pornstar]]s, alleges continuous and unconstitutional persecution for her work abroad, and has unsuccessfully applied for [[political asylum]] in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsn.ua/glamur/chehiya-ostatochno-vidmovila-kolishniy-pornoaktorci-wiska-v-statusi-bizhenki-304738.html Чехія остаточно відмовила колишній порноакторці Wiska в статусі біженки] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main article|Pornography in the United Kingdom}}

"In Britain, where pornography is already more restricted than it is anywhere else in the English-speaking world or in Western Europe", wrote [[Avedon Carol]] in 1995, "sexual media is easily smeared for an audience that is seldom given an opportunity to see what really is sold under the name of 'pornography'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Carol|first=Avedon|url=http://www.fiawol.demon.co.uk/FAC/harm.htm |title=The Harm of Porn |magazine=The Law |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103032928/http://www.fiawol.demon.co.uk/FAC/harm.htm |archive-date=3 November 2013 |date=June–August 1995 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the current British legislative framework including the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] (in England and Wales), the [[Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982]] and the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]] leads to a confusing situation in which there is a theoretical ban on the publication and distribution (but not possession) of pornographic material in any form, which is in practice unenforcable due to the vagueness of the legal test of material that "depraves and corrupts". In practice, hardcore material on video and DVD was until recently banned by the requirement under the Video Recordings Act to be certified by the [[BBFC]], while mainstream hardcore material in other forms such as magazines and websites is essentially unrestricted. Continental European, American and British hardcore pornographic magazines are now openly sold in many British newsagents, for instance. Due to liberalisation in BBFC policy, mainstream hardcore DVDs now receive [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18]] certificates, legalising them but restricting their sale to licensed sex shops such as those in [[Soho]].

British-made pornography tends to focus on a rough-and-ready semi-amateur look rather than the more stylized glamorous look of Continental European pornography.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The UK is still the only Member State of the European Union that prohibits private imports of adult pornography by consumers coming from other Member States of the European Union. In the 2004–2005 fiscal year, the agents of Her Majesty Revenue &amp; Customs seized 96,783 items of pornographic media carried by people travelling into the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/hmrc-report2005.pdf |title=HM Revenue &amp; Customs Annual Report 2004-05 and Autumn Performance Report 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the UK porn industry was estimated to be worth about £1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An acceptable career?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4305257.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2017|date=1 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in [[Normandy]], [[England]] and [[Wales]].

==Victor at Hastings in 1066==
He is one of the few proven [[companions of William the Conqueror]] known to have fought at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patp.us/genealogy/conq/toeni.aspx], [http://patp.us/genealogy/conq/giffard.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition says he gave up the role of [[standard bearer]], his hereditary office, to Walter Giffard, in order to be able to fight closer to [[William, duke of Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10151/10151-h/10151-h.htm], [http://www.normannia.info/pdf/larue1842a.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607013949/http://www.normannia.info/pdf/larue1842a.pdf |date=2007-06-07 }}, in French, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
He married [[Isabel of Conches|Isabel de Montfort]], daughter of [[Simon I de Montfort]]. There was a feud with [[Guillaume d'Evreux]] and his wife Helvise de Nevers, recorded by [[Ordericus Vitalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/NORMAN%20NOBILITY.htm |title-date= |title= Jerusalem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came to open war in 1091–92, when Guillaume attacked Conches. A settlement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]], ''William Rufus'' (1983) p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; They later co-operated in attacking [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester]]'s [[county of Meulan]].

==In England==
He had widely spread holdings, as recorded in the [[Domesday Survey]]. His seat was at [[Flamstead]] in [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/landownerss-t.html The Domesday Book Online – Landowners S-T&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He held [[Clifford Castle]]. It is also believed that he held assets in the village of [[Hose, Leicestershire]], which was split into two manors, Tosny's and that of the title holder of the Norman [[Belvoir Castle]].

==Family==
[[Robert de Stafford]] was his brother.

His second son, [[Raoul IV de Conches]], was his surviving heir. He married [[Alice of Huntingdon]], daughter of [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria]], and [[Judith of Lens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~cousin/html/p107.htm My Lines – Person Page 107&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saiga Conservation Alliance''' '''SCA''' is a network of researchers and [[conservationists]] working to study and protect the critically [[endangered]] [[Saiga]] [[Antelope]] (Saiga tatarica)and their [[habitat]]. The [[Saiga]] are often seen a major [[flagship species]] of the [[Central Asian]] and pre-Caspian steppes. In the last ten years, saiga populations have declined by 96%, which is the fastest decline ever recorded for a mammal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===CMS Project Monitoring===
SCA was contracted by the [[United Nations]] Environment Programme's (UNEP) Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS)to monitor progress of saiga conservation. Part of this projects involves maintaining a database of saiga experts and conservationist as well as compiling data and disseminating it world-wide.

===Russia===

==Broadcasting==
[[File:Sky minidish.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sky [[Minidish]]]]

===Transmission===
When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the [[Astra 2A]] satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2°E]]. This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as [[Eutelsat]]'s Eurobird 1 (now [[Eutelsat 28A]]) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/Eutelsat-28A.html Sky on Eutelsat 28A &amp; Astra 1N/2A/2B at 28.2°E - LyngSat]&lt;/ref&gt; The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom and Ireland.

New Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 28A) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering &amp;mdash; However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.

Sky is currently transmitted from the [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites located at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] ([[Astra 2A|2A]]/[[Astra 2C|2C]]/[[Astra 2E|2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]) and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellite at 28.5°E.

===Standard definition broadcasts===
Sky's standard definition broadcasts are in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-compliant [[MPEG-2]], with the [[Sky Movies]] and [[Sky Box Office]] channels including optional [[Dolby Digital]] soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using [[MPEG-4]] and most of the HD material uses the [[DVB-S2]] standard. Interactive services and 7-day [[EPG]] use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including [[modem]]s for a return path. [[Sky News]], amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-[[video on demand]] interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.

===Digital satellite receivers===
Sky utilises the [[VideoGuard]] pay-TV scrambling system owned by [[NDS Group|NDS]], a [[Cisco Systems]] company. There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] CAMs ([[conditional-access module]]s). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others. This extends to the [[Personal video recorder]] (PVR) offering (branded [[Sky+]]).

===Electronic programme guide===

====Technology====
Sky maintains an [[electronic programme guide]] (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. Channels available on Sky are assigned a three digit [[logical channel number]] which can be entered on a remote control to access the channel and determines in what order channels are listed.

The EPG in Ireland gives priority to Irish channels. All channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky Ireland.

Sky Ireland has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to Sky's EPG for a fee. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder, or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel's content or carriage issues such as picture quality.

In October 2007, Sky's parent company Sky plc (then BSkyB) announced that they would not accept new applications to launch channel on their EPG, citing "very significant memory constraints" on many of its older digiboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/05/bskyb.business|title=Sky to reject new channel applications|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Sky Ireland launched a new EPG for Sky+ HD boxes. The update boasts a new modernised look and improved functionality.

==Sky Ireland EPG==
The Sky [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] lists all channels carried on the Sky platform. Many channels are free, others are available only with a subscription.

==Sky Ireland Channels==
Channels on this list are owned by Sky and broadcast adverstising specifically for the Irish market.

*[[Sky 1|Sky One]]
*[[Sky 2|Sky Two]]
*[[Sky Atlantic]]
*[[Sky Living]]
*[[Sky News]]
*[[Pick (TV channel)|Pick]]
*[[Challenge TV]]
*[[At the Races]] (part owned by Sky)
*[[Sky Sports]]

Some other channels available on the Sky platform also carry Irish advertising, such as the channels provided by Channel 4. 

===Restrictions===
Sky subscribers in Ireland have a different choice of channels compared subscribers in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. The standard Irish channels [[RTÉ One]], RTÉ One +1, [[RTÉ Two]], [[RTÉjr]], [[RTÉ News Now]], [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], [[TG4]], [[3e]] and [[be3]] are available to all Irish subscribers. These channels are Videoguarded (not Free-to-air), but are included with any TV package. These channels are also available on [[Saorview]] and [[Saorsat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saorview.ie/about-saorview/saorsat/|title=SAORSAT|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020533/http://www.saorview.ie/about-saorview/saorsat/|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] family of channels have to be added manually to Sky boxes in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Sky Ireland Broadband==
In February 2013 BSkyB launched its broadband and telephone product in Ireland, and have made significant headway into the Irish market as one of the few providers offering 'triple play' (phone, broadband and digital TV) to the public. As Sky's broadband and phone services use the existing telephone network ([[Local Loop Unbundling|LLU]] and non-LLU) and is widely available as a result.  Sky Ireland has offered fibre broadband, using the network of former incumbent, [[eircom|eir]], with speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s since 26 December 2014.

'''Slavery in China''' has taken various forms throughout history. Slavery was reportedly abolished as a legally recognized institution, including in a 1909 law&lt;ref name="EncAnt"&gt;Hallet, Nicole.

==History of slavery in China==
===Shang dynasty (second millennium BC)===
The earliest evidence of slavery in China dates to the [[Shang dynasty]] when, by some estimates, approximately 5 percent of the population was enslaved. The Shang dynasty engaged in frequent raids of surrounding states, capturing slaves who would be killed in ritual sacrifices. Scholars disagree as to whether these victims were also used as a source of slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Readings on Global Slavery, Damian Alan Pargas, Felicia Roşu (ed), p 523&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warring States Period (475–221 BC)===
The [[Warring States period]] saw a decline in slavery, which had been popular in the previous centuries. The slave system had shifted to a feudal system, despite this, slavery was still widespread during the period, despite being on the decline.&lt;ref&gt;The First Emperor of China by Li Yu-Ning(1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of private ownership of land in the state of Lu in 594 BC, which brought a system of taxation on private land, and saw the emergence of a system of landlords and peasants, the system of slavery began to decline over the following centuries, as other states followed suit.

===[[Qin dynasty]] (221–206&amp;nbsp;BC)===
The Qin government confiscated the property and enslaved the families as punishment.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=252}}

===Han dynasty (206&amp;nbsp;BC – 220&amp;nbsp;AD)===
{{further|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}
One of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gao]]'s first acts was to [[manumission|manumit]] agricultural workers enslaved during the [[Warring States period]], although domestic servants retained their status.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt;

Men punished with castration during the [[Han dynasty]] were also used as slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |id=8IktAAAAIAAJ |plainurl=yes }}|title=Osiris, Volume 10|author=History of Science Society|year=1952|publisher=Saint Catherine Press|location=|isbn=|page=144|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving from earlier [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] laws, the Han dynasty set in place rules that the property and families of criminals doing three years of hard labor or sentenced to castration were to have their families seized and kept as property by the government.{{sfn|Barbieri-Low|2007|p=146}}

===Xin dynasty (9–23 AD)===
In the year AD 9, the Emperor [[Wang Mang]] usurped the Chinese throne and instituted a series of sweeping reforms, including the abolition of slavery and radical land reform. Slavery was reinstated in AD 12 before his assassination in AD 23&lt;ref&gt;

===Three Kingdoms (220–280 AD)===
During the [[Three Kingdoms period]], a number of statuses intermediate between freedom and slavery developed, but none of them are thought to have exceeded 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt;

===Tang dynasty (618–907 AD)===
[[File:Chinese Slave trade.jpg|thumb|A contract from the Tang dynasty that records the purchase of a 15-year-old slave for six bolts of plain [[silk]] and five [[Chinese coins]]. Found in the [[Astana Cemetery]] in [[Turfan]].]]
Tang law forbade enslaving free people, but allowed enslavement of criminals and foreigners.{{sfn|Schafer|1963|p=44}} Free people could however willingly sell themselves. The primary source of slaves came from southern tribe and young slave girls were the most desired on the market. Although various officials such as Kong Kui, the governor of Guangdong, banned the practice, the trade continued.{{sfn|Schafer|1963|p=45}} Other peoples sold to Chinese included Turks, Persians, and Korean women, who were sought after by the wealthy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=39}}{{sfn|Schafer|1963|p=44}} On the silk road slave girls were a major item and much more expensive than silk. Silk was up to five times less than the value of a slave girl.{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{how|date=October 2018}} [[Iranians in China|Central Asian slave girls]] were exported from Central Asia Iranian areas to China. It is believed that the wealthy merchants and aristocratic noblemen of the Chinese capital of Chang'an were the consumers for the huge amount of Central Asian slave women brought by the [[Sogdians]] to China to sell to the Chinese. The Central Asian foreign women in the Sogdian owned wineshops in the Chinese capital are also believe to have been slaves since Chinese poets depicted them as homesick, sad and melancholy and they would service travelers by keeping them company overnight. Merchants and literati would frequent the wineshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=温 |first1=翠芳 |last2= |first2= |date=2006 |title=唐代长安西市中的胡姬与丝绸之路上的女奴贸易 |url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/ac8ea42c7375a417866f8fbc.html |journal= |volume= |issue=2 |pages=19-21 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sogdians reaped massive profits from selling slave girls and so did the Chinese government by taxing the sale of the slaves. Slave girls were one of the major products Chinese bought from Sogdians. Persian poets often wrote about wine and women since the wineservers were often girls and this wine culture with girl servers seems to have spread to China. There were many Sogdian wineshops and Persian shops in Chang'an along with a large slave market. The wineshops were staffed with young girls who served wine to customers and danced for them. Most of the slave girls were 14 or 15 years old. They provided services like sex, dancing, singing, and served wine to their customers in Chang'an as ordered their masters who ran the wineshops. A Sogdian merchant, Kang Weiyi 康尾義 had Indians, Central Asians, and Tokharistanis (Bactrians) among the 15 slave girls he was bringing to sell in the Chinese capital of Chang'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kknews.cc/history/epg26yy.html |title=唐代長安城中販賣給漢人的胡姬與絲綢之路上的女奴貿易 |last= |first= |date=2018-03-31 |website=每日頭條 |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=郭  |first1=雪妮 |last2= |first2= |date=2012  （北京师范大学文学院北京100875） |title=酒肆论文摘要,唐代“胡姬”诗与现代日本的西域想象 |url=http://www.lunwendaquan.com/hanyuyanwenxue/152569.html |journal=长安学刊 |volume= |issue=003 |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song dynasty (960–1279 AD)===
{{further|Jingkang Incident}}
The Song's warfare against northern and western neighbors produced many captives on both sides, but reforms were introduced to ease the transition from bondage to freedom.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt;

===Yuan dynasty (1271–1368 AD)===

===Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD)===
The [[Hongwu Emperor]] sought to abolish all forms of slavery&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt; but in practice, slavery continued through the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt;

The [[Java]]ns sent 300 black slaves as tribute to the Ming dynasty in 1381.{{sfn|Tsai|1996|p=152}} When the [[Ming dynasty]] crushed the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)|Miao Rebellions]] in 1460, they [[Castration|castrated]] 1,565 Miao boys, which resulted in the deaths of 329 of them. They turned the survivors into [[eunuch]] slaves. The [[Guizhou]] Governor who ordered the castration of the Miao was reprimanded and condemned by [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming]] for doing it once the Ming government heard of the event.{{sfn|Tsai|1996|p=16}}{{sfn|Harrasowitz|1991|p=130}} Since 329 of the boys died, they had to castrate even more.{{sfn|Mitamura|1970|p=54}} On 30 Jan 1406, the Ming [[Yongle Emperor]] expressed horror when the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyuans]] castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs in order to give them to Yongle. Yongle said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and didn't deserve castration, and he returned the boys to Ryukyu and instructed them not to send eunuchs again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade  |first=Geoff |last2= |first2= |date=July 1, 2007 |title=Ryukyu in the Ming Reign Annals 1380s-1580s |url= http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/docs/wps/wps07_093.pdf |ssrn= 1317152 |archivedate= September 5, 2009 |journal= |publisher= Asia Research Institute National University of Singapore |volume= |series=Working Paper Series|issue=  93 |page= 75 |doi= |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Ming rulers, as a way of limiting slavery because of their inability to prohibit it, passed a decree that limited the number of slaves that could be held per household and extracted a severe tax from slave owners.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt;

===Qing dynasty (1644–1912 AD)===
The [[Qing dynasty]] initially oversaw an expansion in slavery and states of bondage like the [[booi aha]].&lt;ref name="ChImp"/&gt; They possessed about two million slaves upon their conquest of China.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt; However, like previous dynasties, the Qing rulers soon saw the advantages of phasing out slavery, and gradually introduced reforms turning slaves and serfs into peasants.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt; Laws  passed in 1660 and 1681 forbade landowners from selling slaves with the land they farmed and prohibited physical abuse of slaves by landowners.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt; The [[Kangxi Emperor]] freed all the Manchu's hereditary slaves in 1685.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt; The [[Yongzheng Emperor]]'s "Yongzheng emancipation" between 1723 and 1730 sought to free all slaves to strengthen his authority through a kind of social leveling that created an undifferentiated class of free subjects under the throne, freeing the vast majority of slaves.&lt;ref name="EncAnt"/&gt;

The abolition of slavery in many countries following the [[British emancipation]] led to increasing demands for cheap Chinese laborers, known as "[[coolie]]s". Mistreatment ranged from the near-slave conditions maintained by some crimps and traders in the mid-1800s in [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] and [[Spanish Cuba|Cuba]] to the relatively dangerous tasks given to the Chinese during the construction of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="ChImp"/&gt;

Among his other reforms, [[Taiping Rebellion]] leader [[Hong Xiuquan]] abolished slavery and prostitution in the territory under his control in the 1850s and 1860s.&lt;ref name="ChImp"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Slavery exists in China, especially in Canton and Peking&amp;nbsp;... I have known a male slave. He is named Wang and is a native of [[Kansu]], living in [[Kuei-chou]] in the house of his original master's son, and with his own family of four persons acknowledged to me that he was a slave, ''Nu-p'u''. He was a person of considerable ability, but did not appear to care about being free. Female slaves are very common all over China, and are generally called . . .
YA-TOU 丫頭. Slave girl, a female slave. Slave girls are very common in China; nearly every Chinese family owns one or more slave girls generally bought from the girl's parents, but sometimes also obtained from other parties.
It is a common thing for well-to-do people to present a couple of slave girls to a daughter as part of her marriage dowery. Nearly all prostitutes are slaves. It is, however, customary with respectable people to release their slave girls when marriageable. Some people sell their slave girls to men wanting a wife for themselves or for a son of theirs.
I have bought three different girls; two from [[Sichuan|Szű-chuan]] for a few [[taels]] each, less than fifteen dollars. One I released in [[Tientsin]], another died in Hongkong; the other I gave in marriage to a faithful servant of mine. Some are worth much money at Shanghai."&lt;ref&gt;''Mesny's Chinese Miscellany'', Vol. IV, 1905, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===20th century===
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the [[Yi people]] (also known as Nuosu) of China terrorized Sichuan to rob and enslave non-Nuosu including [[Han people]]. The descendants of the Han slaves, known as the White Yi (白彝), outnumbered the Black Yi (黑彝) aristocracy by ten to one.{{sfn|Ramsey|1987|p=252}} There was a saying goes like: "the worst insult to a Nuosu is to call him a "Han" (with the implication being that "your ancestors were slaves")".{{sfn|Du|2013|p=150}}{{sfn|Lozny|2013|p=346}}

The '''''Sri Tiga'' class''' is a class of fast troop vessels of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] (RMN) with the length of 38m and displacing 117 tons. A total of two ships are currently in service.

==Development==
The Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) commissioned their two locally built KD Sri Gaya and KD Sri Tiga in 2001.Both ships build by local company [[Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation Berhad|Boustead Naval Shipyard Malaysia]] (BHIC). All ships named after islands in Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://defense-studies.blogspot.my/2011/02/sri-gaya-class-fast-troop-vessel.html?m=1|title=Sri Gaya class : Fast Troop Vessel Angkatan Laut Malaysia|website=defense-studies.blogspot.my|language=id|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
This ship is made of aluminum, lighter material than steel plate but more secure than fiberglass and needs only minimal maintenance.  The crew of this ship is small, leaving more space for carrying troops.

The ship is powered by four waterjets and four machines, able to reach a speed of 25-28 knots.  This is high for this size of military troop transport ship.  The ship weighs 117 tons and is 38 meters long and 7.2 meters wide.   It can carry 32 fully armed troops and equipment at a cruising speed over 1000 km of 14 knots.

For self-defense, this ship is equipped with 20mm cannon.  Other weaponry such as grenade launcher and anti-tank guided missile can be added.  This ship's modular design allows it to serve multiple purposes, including fast attack, fast troop vessel, light logistic vessel, general cargo, marine ambulance, diving platforms, and patrol.

==Major Operation==
In May 2018, the ''KD Sri Tiga'' held a meeting with the [[Philippine Navy]] ship, the [[BRP Cebu (PS-28)|BRP Cebu]] at the maritime border between Malaysia and the [[Philippines]] to exchange intelligence information as part of the ''Trilateral Maritime Patrol Programme'' in the Eastern Security Zone (Esszone) of [[Sabah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2018/05/24/msian-filipino-naval-ships-meet-maritime-border-exchange-intelligence "M'sian, Filipino Naval Ships to Meet at Maritime Border to Exchange Intelligence"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Cavalcade of Scaër''' ({{lang-fr|La Cavalcade de Scaër}}; or '''The Cavalcade''') is a [[carnival]] festival that takes place in the town of [[Scaër]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Finistère]] [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] in northwestern [[France]]. Every odd year since 1923, during the [[Pentecost]] weekend (Sunday and Monday), about 5,000 inhabitants of Scaër welcome about 50,000 spectators for The Cavalcade carnival, which the town owes its nickname {{lang-fr|"Scaër la Joyeuse"}} ("Scaër the Merry").

{{Politics of Burundi}}

The '''United Nations Operation in Burundi''' ('''ONUB''') was established by [[United Nations Security Council]] in May 2004 to ensure the continuation of the [[Arusha Accords (Burundi)|Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement]] signed on 28 August 2000.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES15452004"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1545(2004) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2004 |resolution_number=1545 |accessdate=2008-08-28|date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, by the terms of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1545|Resolution 1545]] which established the mission, it was authorized to use "all necessary means" to ensure the respect of ceasefire agreements, carry out [[disarmament]] and protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES15452004_page4"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1545(2004) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2004 |resolution_number=1545 |page=4 |accessdate=2008-08-28|date=21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, ONUB consisted of 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police, and support personnel in the form of 200 military observers and 125 military staff officers.

The mission ended 1 January 2007 when many of its functions were transferred to the [[United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi]] (BINUB).&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17192006"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1719(2006) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2006 |resolution_number=1719 |accessdate=2008-08-28|date=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Workers' House ''' ({{lang-fa|خانه کارگر}}) is the [[Iran]]ian ''de facto''&lt;ref name="LB"&gt;{{Citation|first1=Ramin|last1=Jahanbegloo|title=Civil Society and Democracy in Iran|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2011|pages=249|isbn=0739172239}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[national trade union center]] affiliated with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU) and a registered [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] worker's [[Political organization#Labor unions|political organization/labour union]].&lt;ref name="International Business Management"&gt;{{Citation|first1=Mostafa|last1=Seraji|first2=K.

Formed in 1958 by union of some workers' guilds, the union has been historically a worker wing affiliated with various parties.&lt;ref name="International Business Management"/&gt; In 1981, it was dominated by [[Islamist]] workers.&lt;ref name="NJIHR"/&gt;

In 1998, Worker’s House stated that ⅓ of Iranian workers were its members, however 
there is no independent verification for this claim.&lt;ref name="NJIHR"/&gt;

[[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) recognizes the dependence of the union on the government.&lt;ref name="LB"/&gt; After confrontation with the [[Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13)|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], the union has been losing its state-supported status.&lt;ref name="NJIHR"/&gt;

The union also operates the ''[[Iranian Labour News Agency]]'' (ILNA) since 2002 with an aim to 'inform dissemination for the toiling stratum of labourers, and with justice-centered discourse as its motto'. ''[[Work and Worker]]'' daily is also published by [[Ali Rabiei]], a key member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Hossein |last1=Shahidi|title=Journalism in Iran: From Mission to Profession|publisher=Routledge |year=2007|pages=64, 104|isbn=1134093918}}&lt;/ref&gt;
