'''Agropedia''' is an online knowledge repository for information related to [[agriculture in India]]. It includes universal meta models and localized content for a variety of users with appropriate interfaces built in collaborative mode in multiple languages.{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} This national portal, designed as an "agricultural Wikipedia" hosts wide range of agricultural information on a variety of crops, with an aim to empower farmers with crop information.

Backed by [[Government of India]] and sponsored by the [[World Bank]] through the ''National Agricultural Innovation Project'' of the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] (ICAR), the open access online resource project was launched on 12 January 2009. Eventually it aims to use weekly alerts from scientists on different crops, to send text messages to farmers across India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Pantnagar-Univ--IIT-s-ICT-project-for-farmers/471360 Pantnagar Univ, IIT’s ICT project for farmers] [[Indian Express]], Jun 05, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/news/india-debuts-agricultural-wikipedia-.html India debuts 'agricultural Wikipedia'] Science and Development Network.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibop-asia.net/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=131 India launches Agropedia] iBoP Asia.

==Development==
Originally titled "Agropedia Indica", the development of the project was undertaken by team involving various premier institution of India, and spearheaded by Professor Jayantha Chatterjee, of [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]] (IIT Kanpur).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jN6w56C8hqEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Agropedia&amp;as_brr=0 Agropedia: Using Social Media to improve Indian Farming] ''Content Nation: Surviving and Thriving as Social Media Technology Changes Our Lives and Our Future'', by John Blossom. Published by John Wiley and Sons, 2009. {{ISBN|0-470-37921-9}}. ''Page 67''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially envisioned by T. V. Prabhakar also of IIT Kanpur, over three years before, who remained its lead architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/01/india-new-wiki-based-repository-for.html India's new wiki-based repository for agricultural research ] [[Earlham College]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opaals.iitk.ac.in/deal/Rice%20KM.htm Workshop on Knowledge Models for Agropedia Indica&amp;nbsp;– Rice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022155203/http://opaals.iitk.ac.in/deal/Rice%20KM.htm |date=October 22, 2008 }} [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Feb 14-16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is nurtured under the aegis of the National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) to accelerate technology-led pro-poor growth and diffusion of new technologies for improving agricultural yield and rural livelihood in India.  It is a collaborative project of seven consortium partners' viz. ''ICRISAT''- Hyderabad, ''NAARM- Hyderabad'', ''[[IIT Kanpur]]'', ''[[IIT Bombay]]'', ''GBPUAT- Pantnagar'', ''UAS- Raichur'' and IIITM-Kerala. ICRISAT is the Consortium coordinator which works as a channel for communication and overall facilitation. IITK develops the software architecture and deploys it complete with user interface. Content will be provided by the implementing partners, GBPUAT, UAS-Raichur and ICRISAT. IITB and IIITM-Kerala have assured to provide some content through certain web services. The resources of NAARM could be used to introduce and popularize the agropedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/full6.asp?foldername=20090228&amp;filename=news&amp;sec_id=25&amp;sid=45 Agropedia]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Down To Earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Asyut Treasure''' is the name of an important [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] hoard of jewellery found near the city of [[Asyut]], central [[Egypt]]. Discovered in mysterious circumstances in the early twentieth century, the treasure is now divided between the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Kunstgewerbemuseum]] in [[Berlin]], the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-and-institutions/kunstgewerbemuseum/home.html Kunstgewerbemuseun website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103235135/http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-and-institutions/kunstgewerbemuseum/home.html |date=November 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=90180&amp;peoA=90180-3-9 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/464070?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=Pectoral&amp;pos=1 Metropolitan Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1909, a large gold hoard from late antiquity was found either at Tomet near Asyut, or at the ancient site of [[Antinopolis|Antinoë]], on the eastern bank of the [[Nile]] in central Egypt. The exact circumstances of the find remain obscure as the treasure was not excavated by professional archaeologists. The very high quality of the pieces, some of which were embossed with medallions of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], link the Asyut Treasure to the imperial court in [[Constantinople]]. The assemblage of gold jewellery was possibly brought from the capital to the supposedly safer environment of Egypt in the early 7th century, before it was hidden there from the [[Arab invasions]] in the mid 7th century.

==Description==
Thirty six objects have been attributed to the treasure that range in date from the third to the sixth century. Twelve pieces came to [[Berlin]], including a large bejewelled [[gorget|pectoral]], two elaborate necklaces and several pairs of bracelets, all the gift of Friedrich Ludwig von Gans in 1912/13. Six objects were donated in 1916 to the [[British Museum]] by Mrs Burns, sister of the philanthropist [[J Pierpont Morgan]]. They include a massive [[Jewellery chain|body-chain]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold_breast_chain.aspx British Museum highlights]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest piece of jewellery known from the early [[Byzantine art|Byzantine period]], plus a matching pair of earrings and necklace, and two spiral bracelets in the form of [[snake]]. The remainder of the treasure is held by the [[Metropolitan Museum]], many of which were donated by Pierpont Morgan in 1917. It includes one of the most famous pieces –  a plain neck ring attached to a frame, set with a large central [[medallion]] of a Byzantine emperor with the obverse showing the figure of [[Constantinopolis]] seated on a throne. Other pieces in the Met include another gold pectoral set with the [[semissis]] of Emperor [[Maurice Tiberius]], and two matching pairs of bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/galleries/medieval/302 Metropolitan Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bradshaw's''''' was a series of railway [[Public transport timetable|timetables]] and travel [[guide book]]s published by W.J. Adams of London. [[George Bradshaw]] initiated the series in 1839; after his death in 1853 the ''Bradshaw's'' range of titles continued until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=John Leighton |title=Early Railway Guides: a Retrospective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4YhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA774 |work=Chambers's Journal |volume=9 |date=3 November 1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bradshawsguides.com/the-bradshaw-lagacy.html |title=Bradshaw Legacy |work=Bradshaw's Guides |publisher=Old House Books &amp; Maps |location=UK |accessdate=24 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917211726/http://bradshawsguides.com/the-bradshaw-lagacy.html# |archive-date=17 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Bradshaw's name was already known as the publisher of ''Bradshaw's Maps of Inland Navigation'', which detailed the [[canal]]s of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], when, on 19 October 1839, soon after the introduction of railways, his Manchester company published the world's first compilation of railway timetables. The cloth-bound book was entitled ''Bradshaw's Railway Time Tables and Assistant to Railway Travelling'' and cost [[£sd|sixpence]] ({{frac|2|1|2}}p). In 1840 the title was changed  to ''Bradshaw's Railway Companion'', and the price raised to [[Shilling (British coin)|one shilling]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} A new volume was issued at occasional intervals and from time to time a supplement kept this up to date. The original Bradshaw publications were published before the limited introduction of standardised [[Railway time]] in November 1840, and its subsequent development into [[Standard time#Great Britain|standard time]]. The accompanying map of all lines in operation (and some "in progress") in [[England]] and [[Wales]], is cited as being the world's first national railway map.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/great-railway-maps-of-the-world/9780241954089/ Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1841, acting on a suggestion made by his London agent, William Jones Adams, Bradshaw reduced the price to the original sixpence, and began to issue the guides monthly under the title ''Bradshaw's Monthly Railway Guide''. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Many railway companies were unhappy with Bradshaw's timetable, but Bradshaw was able to circumvent this by becoming a railway shareholder and by putting his case at company AGMs.&lt;ref name="steamindex"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Kevin P |title=Biographies of chairmen, managers &amp; other senior railway officers |publisher=SteamIndex |date=26 November 2011 |url=http://www.steamindex.com/people/managers.htm |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the book, in the familiar yellow wrapper,{{sfn|Boase|1886|p. 175}} became synonymous with its publisher: for Victorians and Edwardians alike, a railway timetable was "a Bradshaw", no matter by which railway company it had been issued, or whether Bradshaw had been responsible for its production or not.

[[File:1850 Bradshaw Whitby.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Timetable for York, Scarborough, Pickering &amp; Whitby. Timetable shows times for both weekdays and Sundays, distances in miles, and fares.|Timetable from the 1850 Bradshaw]]

The eight-page edition of 1841 had grown to 32 pages by 1845 and to 946 pages by 1898 and now included maps, illustrations and descriptions of the main features and historic buildings of the towns served by the railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middletonpress.co.uk/books/bradshaw/bradshaws-guide-1866.html?source=merchant-feed&amp;campaign=pla&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CKH4hPXSkbsCFQEXwwodQSAAYg|title=Bradshaw's Guide 1866|last=Anon|work=Middleton Press|publisher=Middleton Press|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1845, the issue number jumped from 40 to 141:&lt;ref name="steamindex" /&gt; the publisher claimed this was an innocent mistake, although it has been speculated as a commercial ploy, where more advertising revenue could be generated by making it look longer-established than it really was. Whatever the reason for the change, the numbering continued from 141.

When in 1865 ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' praised Bradshaw's publications, it stated that "seldom has the gigantic intellect of man been employed upon a work of greater utility." 
At last, some order had been imposed on the chaos that had been created by some 150 rail companies whose tracks criss-crossed the country and whose largely uncoordinated network was rapidly expanding. 
Bradshaw minutely recorded all changes and became the standard manual for rail travel well into the 20th century.

By 1918 Bradshaw's guide had risen in price to two shillings (10p) and by 1937 to half a crown (12½p). Although historic money values are difficult to calculate, this would have been equivalent to perhaps £6.00 at 2009 values.

==Later history==
Bradshaw's timetables became less necessary from 1923, when more than 100 surviving companies were "grouped" into the [[Big Four British railway companies|Big Four]]. This change reduced dramatically the range and number of individual timetables produced by the companies themselves. They now published a much smaller number of substantial compilations which between them covered the country.

Between 1923 and 1939 three of the Big Four transferred their timetable production to Bradshaw's publisher Henry Blacklock &amp; Co., and most of the official company timetables therefore became reprints of the relevant pages from Bradshaw. Only the [[Great Western Railway]] retained its own format.

Between the two [[world war]]s, the verb 'to Bradshaw' was a derogatory term used in the [[Royal Air Force]] to refer to pilots who could not navigate well, perhaps related to a perceived lack of ability shown by those who navigated by following [[Track (rail transport)|railway lines]].

When the railways were nationalised in 1948, five of the six [[British Railways]] Regions followed the companies' example by using Blacklock to produce their timetable books, but production was eventually moved to other publishers. This change must have reduced Blacklock's revenue substantially. Parts of Bradshaw's guide began to be reset in the newer British Railways style from 1955, but modernisation of the whole volume was never completed. By 1961 Bradshaw cost 12s 6d (62½p), and a complete set of BR Regional timetables could be bought for 6s (30p).

The conclusion was inevitable, and the last edition, No. 1521, was dated May 1961. The ''[[Railway Magazine]]'' of that month printed a valedictory article by Charles E. Lee.

Reprints of various Bradshaw's guides have been produced.

==References in literature==
19th-century and early 20th-century novelists make frequent references to a character's "Bradshaw". [[Dickens]] refers it in his short story ''The Portrait-Painter's Story'' (1861). In ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]'', [[Phileas Fogg]] carries a Bradshaw. In [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s "The Book Bag" the narrator states "I would sooner read the catalogue of the Army and Navy Stores or Bradshaw's Guide than nothing at all, and indeed have spent many delightful hours over both these works"

[[Crime writer]]s were fascinated with trains and timetables, especially as a new source of [[alibi]]s. Examples are [[Ronald Knox]]'s ''The Footsteps at the Lock'' (1928) and novels by [[Freeman Wills Crofts]]. One mention is by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'': "the vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited."  Other references include another Sherlock Holmes story, ''[[The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]]''; [[Lewis Carroll]]'s long poem ''[[Phantasmagoria]]''; and [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which makes note of Count Dracula reading an "English Bradshaw's Guide" as part of his planning for his voyage to England.  In the 1866 [[comic opera]] ''[[Cox and Box]]'', the following exchange takes place: 
:BOX: Have you read this month's ''Bradshaw'', sir?
:COX: No, sir. My wife wouldn’t let me.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, F. C. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/cox_and_box/savoy.pdf ''Cox and Box''], 1866, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a reference in ''[[Death in the Clouds]]'' (1935) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "Mr Clancy, writer of detective stories ... extracted a Continental Bradshaw from his raincoat pocket ... to work out a complicated alibi." Bradshaw is also mentioned in her ''The Secret Adversary''.  In [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' (1938), the second Mrs de Winter observes that "Some people have a vice of reading Bradshaws. They plan innumerable journeys across country for the fun of linking up impossible connections." (chapter 2).  Another reference is in an aside in ''[[Riddle of the Sands]]'' (1903) by [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]: "... an extraordinary book, Bradshaw, turned to from habit, even when least wanted, as men fondle guns and rods in the close season."

In [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'', the protagonist Gabriel Syme praises Bradshaw as a poet of order: "No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give me Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I say!" In [[Max Beerbohm]]'s ''[[Zuleika Dobson]]'' (1911), a satirical fantasy of Oxford undergraduates, a Bradshaw is listed as one of the two books in the "library" of the irresistible Zuleika.

Bradshaw is mentioned in modern novels with a period setting, and in [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''The Shadow in the North'' ([[Sally Lockhart]] Quartet).

In [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s 1891 novel ''[[Diary of a Pilgrimage]]'', an aside called '''A Faithful Bradshaw''' is contained. This section describes a comical incident where the author gets always misled by referring to outdated guides.

==''Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide''==
In June 1847 the first number of ''Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide'' was issued, giving the timetables of the Continental railways. It grew to over 1,000 pages, including timetables, guidebook and hotel directory. It was discontinued in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. Briefly resurrected in the interwar years, it saw its final edition in 1939. The 1913 edition was republished in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bradshaws-Continental-Railway-Guide/dp/1908402474 |title=Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide: 9781908402479: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bradshaw's and other printed timetables today==
In December 2007, the Middleton Press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtimes.biz/index.html Bradshaw-Mitchell's Rail Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; took advantage of [[Network Rail]]'s willingness to grant third-party publishers the right to print paper versions of the National Rail timetable. Network Rail had discontinued official hard copies in favour of [[PDF]] editions, which could be downloaded without charge.

As a tribute to Bradshaw, Middleton Press named its timetables the ''Bradshaw-Mitchell's Rail Times''. A competing edition reproduced from Network Rail's artwork, is published by TSO,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/ TSO Online Bookshop - Bookshop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a same-size reproduction of the Network Rail artwork, although the size is only about 70% in the Middleton Press versions to reduce the page count. A third publisher, UK Rail Timetables,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrtl.co.uk/about.html UK Rail Timetables Ltd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The main timetable for [[Indian Railways]] is still known as the ''Newman Indian Bradshaw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jainbookagency.com/newdetails.aspx?id=38216|title=Newman Indian Bradshaw - A Guide for Railway Travellers in India |last=Anon|publisher=Jain Book Agency|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California Genealogical Society (CGS)''' is a [[non-profit]], all-volunteer organization that seeks to aid, educate and encourage research in family history. The society offers research services, online one-of-a-kind genealogical indexes and databases, and a research library housing over 38,000 reference materials from California, the United States, and around the world. It is the oldest continually-operating genealogy society in California.&lt;ref name="oaktrib"&gt;"Genealogical Society marks 110 years of researching family", ''The Oakland Tribune'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's library is located in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]'s historic Breuner Building at 2201 Broadway, Suite LL2. The library is rich in genealogy reference materials, both standard and unique, covering people and places in California and the rest of the country. CGS is a member of the [[Federation of Genealogical Societies (FGS)]].

==History==
The California Genealogical Society was founded on February 12, 1898,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LF4TAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22california%20genealogical%20society%22&amp;pg=RA2-PR44#v=onepage&amp;q=%22california%20genealogical%20society%22&amp;f=false ''Proceedings of the New England Historic Genealogical Society'', 1900]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Francisco]] by a group of New Englanders. The society moved from San Francisco to Oakland in 1997.&lt;ref name="oaktrib"/&gt;

==Website==
The CGSL website features The California Names Index, a free, searchable database containing more than 350,000 names from state, county, and local references found in the library. It is an ongoing project and names are added regularly.

[[File:Dunhuang Yiqiejing yinyi.svg|thumb|[[Dunhuang manuscript]] (c. 8th century) page from the ''[[Yiqiejing yinyi (Xuanying)|Yiqiejing yinyi]]'', the oldest extant Chinese dictionary of [[Glossary of Buddhism|Buddhist technical terminology]]]]
'''Chinese dictionaries''' date back over two millennia to the [[Han Dynasty]], which is a significantly longer [[lexicographical]] history than any other language. There are hundreds of dictionaries for the [[Chinese language]], and this article introduces some of the most important.

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese (language)|Chinese language]] has two words for dictionary: ''zidian'' (character/logograph dictionary) for written forms, that is, [[Chinese character]]s, and ''cidian'' (word/phrase dictionary), for spoken forms.

For [[character dictionary|character dictionaries]], ''zidian'' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:字典|字典]]|p=zìdiǎn|w=tzŭ⁴-tien³|l=character dictionary}}) combines ''zi'' ([[Wikt:字|字]] "character, graph; letter, script, writing; word") and ''dian'' ([[Wikt:典|典]] "dictionary, encyclopedia; standard, rule; statute, canon; classical allusion").

For word dictionaries, ''cidian'' is interchangeably written ([[Wikt:辭典|辭典]]/辞典; ''cídiǎn''; ''tzʻŭ²-tien³''; "word dictionary") or ([[Wikt:詞典|詞典]]/词典; ''cídiǎn''; ''tzʻŭ²-tien³''; "word dictionary"); using ''cí'' ([[Wikt:辭|辭]]; "word, speech; phrase, expression; diction, phraseology; statement; a kind of poetic prose; depart; decline; resign"), and its graphic variant ''cí'' ([[Wikt:詞|詞]]; "word, term; expression, phrase; speech, statement; part of speech; a kind of tonal poetry"). ''Zidian'' is a much older and more common word than ''cidian'', and Yang (1985:xxii) notes ''zidian'' is often "used for both 'character dictionary' and 'word dictionary'."

==Traditional Chinese lexicography==
The precursors of Chinese dictionaries are primers designed for students of Chinese characters. The earliest of them only survive in fragments or quotations within [[Chinese classic texts]]. For example, the ''[[Shizhoupian]]'' was compiled by one or more historians in the court of [[King Xuan of Zhou]] (r. 827 BCE – 782 BCE), and was the source of the 籀文 zhòuwén variant forms listed in the Han Dynasty [[Shuowen Jiezi]] dictionary. The ''[[Cangjiepian]]'' "Chapters of [[Cang Jie]]"), named after the legendary inventor of writing, was edited by [[Li Si]], and helped to standardize the [[Small seal script]] during the [[Qin Dynasty]].

The [[collation]] or [[lexicographical order]]ing of a dictionary generally depends upon its [[writing system]]. For a language written in an [[alphabet]] or [[syllabary]], dictionaries are usually ordered alphabetically. [[Samuel Johnson]] defined ''dictionary'' as "a book containing the words of any language in alphabetical order, with explanations of their meaning" in [[A Dictionary of the English Language|his dictionary]]. But Johnson's definition cannot be applied to the Chinese dictionaries, as Chinese is written in [[Chinese character|character]]s or [[logograph]], not alphabets. To Johnson, not having an alphabet is not to the Chinese's credit, as in 1778, when [[James Boswell]] asked about the Chinese characters, he replied (Boswell 1907:822) "Sir, they have not an alphabet. They have not been able to form what all other nations have formed." Nevertheless, the Chinese made their dictionaries, and developed three original systems for lexicographical ordering: semantic categories, graphic components, and pronunciations.

===Semantically organized dictionaries===
The first system of dictionary organization is by semantic categories. The circa 3rd-century BCE ''[[Erya]]'' (爾雅 "Approaching Correctness") is the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, and scholarship reveals that it is a pre-Qin compilation of glosses to classical texts. It contains lists of synonyms arranged into 19 semantic categories (e.g., "Explaining Plants", "Explaining Trees"). The [[Han Dynasty]] dictionary ''[[Xiao Erya]]'' (小爾雅 "Little Erya") reduces these 19 to 13 chapters. The early 3rd century CE ''[[Guangya]]'' (廣雅 "Expanded Erya"), from the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty, followed the ''Erya''{{'}}s original 19 chapters. The circa 1080 CE ''[[Piya]]'' (埤雅 "Increased Erya"), from the [[Song Dynasty]], has 8 semantically-based chapters of names for plants and animals. For a dictionary user wanting to look up a character, this arbitrary semantic system is inefficient unless one already knows, or can guess, the meaning.

Two other Han Dynasty lexicons are loosely organized by semantics. The 1st century CE ''[[Fangyan]]'' (方言 "Regional Speech") is the world's oldest known dialectal dictionary. The circa 200 CE ''[[Shiming]]'' (釋名 "Explaining Names") employs paranomastic glosses to define words.

===Graphically organized dictionaries===
The second system of dictionary organization is by recurring graphic components or [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]. The famous 100–121 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (說文解字 "Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters") arranged characters through a system of 540 ''bushou'' (部首 "section header") radicals. The 543 CE ''[[Yupian]]'' (玉篇 "Jade Chapters"), from the [[Liang Dynasty]], rearranged them into 542. The 1615 CE ''[[Zihui]]'' (字彙 "Character Glossary"), edited by Mei Yingzuo (梅膺祚) during the [[Ming Dynasty]], simplified the 540 ''Shuowen Jiezi'' radicals to 214. It also originated the "radical-stroke" scheme of ordering characters on the number of residual graphic [[Stroke order|strokes]] besides the radical. The 1627 ''[[Zhengzitong]]'' (正字通 "Correct Character Mastery") also used 214. The 1716 CE ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]'' (康熙字典 "Kangxi Dictionary"), compiled under the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]], became the standard dictionary for Chinese characters, and popularized the system of [[List of Kangxi radicals|214 radicals]]. As most Chinese characters are semantic-phonetic ones (形聲字), the radical method is usually effective, thus it continues to be widely used in the present day. However, sometimes the radical of a character is not obvious. To compensate this, a "Chart of Characters that Are Difficult to Look up" (難檢字表), arranged by the number of strokes of the characters, is usually provided.

===Phonetically organized dictionaries===
The third system of lexicographical ordering is by character pronunciation. This type of dictionary collates its entries by [[syllable rime]] and [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], and comprises the so-called "[[rime dictionary]]". The first surviving rime dictionary is the 601 CE ''[[Qieyun]]'' (切韻 "Cutting [Spelling] Rimes") from the [[Sui Dynasty]]; it became the standard of pronunciation for [[Middle Chinese]]. During the Song Dynasty, it was expanded into the 1011 CE ''[[Guangyun]]'' (廣韻 "Expanded Rimes") and the 1037 CE ''[[Jiyun]]'' (集韻 "Collected Rimes").

The clear problem with these old phonetically arranged dictionary is that the would-be user needs to have the knowledge of rime. Thus, dictionaries collated this way can only serve the literati.

A great number of modern dictionaries published today arrange their entries by [[pinyin]] or other methods of romanisation, together with a radicals index. Some of these pinyin dictionaries also contain indices of the characters arranged by number and order of strokes, by the [[four corner method|four corner encoding]] (四角碼) or by the [[cangjie method|cangjie encoding]] (倉頡碼).

Some dictionaries employ more than one of these three methods of collation. For example, the ''[[Longkan Shoujian]]'' (龍龕手鑑) of the [[Liao Dynasty]] uses radicals, which are grouped by tone. The characters under each radical are also grouped by tone.

===Functional classifications===
Besides categorizing ancient Chinese dictionaries by their methods of collation, they can also be classified by their functions. In the traditional bibliographic divisions of the imperial collection ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'', the ''Xiaoxuelei'' (小學類 "Category of Minor Studies", which includes books on philology and "pre-modern linguistics") subdivides dictionaries into three types: ''Xungu'' (訓詁 "exegesis"), ''Zishu'' (字書 "character book") and ''Yunshu'' (韻書 "rime book").

The ''Xungu'' type comprises ''Erya'' and its descendants. These exegetical dictionaries focus on explaining meanings of words as found in the Chinese classics.

The ''Zishu'' dictionaries comprise ''Shuowen Jiezi'', ''Yupian'', ''Zihui'', ''Zhengzitong'', and ''Kangxi Zidian''. This type of dictionary, which focuses on the shape and structure of the characters, subsumes both "[[orthography]] dictionaries", such as the ''[[Ganlu Zishu]]'' (干祿字書) of the Tang Dynasty, and "[[Chinese scripts|script]] dictionaries", such as the ''Liyun'' (隸韻) of the Song Dynasty. Although these dictionaries center upon the graphic properties of Chinese characters, they do not necessarily collate characters by radical. For instance, ''Liyun'' is a [[clerical script]] dictionary collated by tone and rime.

The ''Yunshu'' type focuses on the pronunciations of characters. These dictionaries are always collated by rimes.

While the above traditional pre-20th-century Chinese dictionaries focused upon the meanings and pronunciations of words in classical texts, they practically ignored the spoken language and vernacular literature.

==Modern Chinese lexicography==
The ''Kangxi Zidian'' served as the standard Chinese dictionary for generations, is still published and is now online. Contemporary lexicography is divisible between bilingual and monolingual Chinese dictionaries.

===Chinese–English dictionaries===
[[File:Morrison-Chinese-Dictionary-p-4.jpg|thumb|A page from the 1865 reprint of [[Morrison's Chinese dictionary]], the first major Chinese–English dictionary. In this section, words are arranged alphabetically based on Morrison's transcription of Chinese.]]
The foreigners who entered China in late Ming and Qing Dynasties needed dictionaries for different purposes than native speakers. Wanting to [[Western study of the Chinese language|learn Chinese]], they compiled the first grammar books and bilingual dictionaries. Westerners adapted the Latin alphabet to represent Chinese pronunciation, and arranged their dictionaries accordingly.

Two [[Bible]] translators edited early Chinese dictionaries. The Scottish missionary [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] wrote [[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language]] (1815–1823). The British missionary [[Walter Henry Medhurst]] wrote a Hokkien ([[Min Nan]]) dialect dictionary (1832) and the ''[[Chinese and English Dictionary]]'' (1842). Both were flawed in their representation of pronunciations, such as [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] stops. The British philologist and diplomat [[Samuel Wells Williams]] applied the method of dialect comparison in his dictionary (1874), and refined distinctions in articulation. The American missionary and diplomat [[Samuel Wells Williams]] compiled the (1874) ''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'', which gave variant regional pronunciations in addition to standard Peking pronunciation.

The British consular officer and linguist [[Herbert Giles]] criticized Williams as "the lexicographer not for the future but of the past" (Wilkinson 2013: 85), and took nearly twenty years to compile his ''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' (1892, 1912), one that Norman (1988:173) calls "the first truly adequate Chinese–English dictionary". It contained 13,848 characters and numerous compound expressions, with pronunciation based upon Beijing Mandarin, which it compared with nine southern dialects such as [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Fuzhou dialect]]. It has been called "still interesting as a repository of late Qing documentary Chinese, although there is little or no indication of the citations, mainly from the Kangxi zidian." (Wilkinson 2013: 85.) Giles modified the Chinese romanization system of [[Thomas Francis Wade]] to create the [[Wade-Giles]] system, which was standard in English speaking countries until 1979 when pinyin was adopted. The Giles dictionary was replaced by the 1931 dictionary of the Australian missionary [[Robert Henry Mathews]]. ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', which was popular for decades, was based on Giles and partially updated by Y.R. Chao in 1943 and reprinted in 1960. (Wilkinson, 2013: 85)

Trained in American [[structural linguistics]], [[Yuen Ren Chao]] and [[Yang Lien-sheng|Lien-sheng Yang]] wrote a ''[[Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese]]'' (1947), that emphasized the spoken rather than the written language. Main entries were listed in [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]], and they distinguished [[free morpheme]]s from [[bound morpheme]]s.  A hint of non-standard pronunciation was also given, by marking final stops and initial voicing and non-palatalization in non-Mandarin dialects.

The Swedish sinologist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] wrote the seminal (1957) ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' with his reconstructed pronunciations for Middle Chinese and [[Old Chinese]].

Chinese lexicography advanced during the 1970s. The translator [[Lin Yutang]] wrote the semantically sophisticated ''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' (1972) that is now available online. The author [[Liang Shih-Chiu]] edited two full-scale dictionaries: Chinese-English (Liang and Fang 1971) with over 8,000 characters and 100,000 entries, and English-Chinese (Liang 1975) with over 160,000 entries.

The linguist and professor of Chinese, [[John DeFrancis]] edited a groundbreaking Chinese–English dictionary (1996) giving more than 196,000 words or terms alphabetically arranged in a single-tier pinyin order. The user can therefore in a straightforward way find a term whose pronunciation is known rather than searching by radical or character structure, the latter being a 2-tiered approach. This project had long been advocated by another pinyin proponent, [[Victor H. Mair]] in his [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp001_chinese_dictionary.pdf The Need for an Alphabetically Arranged General Usage Dictionary of Mandarin Chinese] (1986).

===Chinese–Chinese dictionaries===
When the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] began in 1912, educators and scholars recognized the need to update the 1716 ''Kangxi Zidian''. It was thoroughly revised in the (1915) ''[[Zhonghua Da Zidian]]'' (中華大字典 "Comprehensive Chinese-Character Dictionary"), which corrected over 4,000 ''Kangxi Zidian'' mistakes and added more than 1,000 new characters. Lu Erkui's (1915) ''[[Ciyuan]]'' (辭源 "Sources of Words") was a groundbreaking effort in Chinese lexicography and can be considered the first ''cidian'' "word dictionary".

Shu Xincheng's (1936) ''[[Cihai]]'' (辭海 "Sea of Words") was a comprehensive dictionary of characters and expressions, and provided near-encyclopedic coverage in fields like science, philosophy, history. The ''Cihai'' remains a popular dictionary and has been frequently revised.

The (1937) ''Guoyu cidian'' (國語辭典 "Dictionary of the National Language") was a four-volume dictionary of words, designed to standardize modern pronunciation. The main entries were characters listed phonologically by [[Bopomofo|Zhuyin Fuhao]] and [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]. For example, the title in these systems is ㄍㄨㄛㄩ ㄘㄉ一ㄢ and Gwoyeu tsyrdean.

Wei Jiangong's (1953) ''[[Xinhua Zidian]]'' (新华字典 "New China Character Dictionary") is a pocket-sized reference, alphabetically arranged by pinyin. It is [[List of best-selling books#List of best-selling regularly updated books|the world's most popular]] [[reference work]] (Xinhua 2004). The 11th edition was published in 2011.

Lu Shuxiang's (1973) ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]]'' (现代汉语词典 "Contemporary Chinese Dictionary") is a middle-sized dictionary of words. It is arranged by characters, alphabetized by pinyin, which list compounds and phrases, with a total 56,000 entries (expanded to 70,000 in the 2016 edition). Both the ''Xinhua zidian'' and the ''Xiandai Hanyu cidian'' followed a simplified scheme of 189 radicals.

Two outstanding achievements in contemporary Chinese lexicography are the (1986–93) ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' (漢語大詞典 "Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words") with over 370,000 word and phrase entries listed under 23,000 different characters; and the (1986–89) ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' (漢語大字典 "Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Characters") with 54,678 head entries for characters. They both use a system of 200 radicals.

In recent years, the computerization of Chinese has allowed lexicographers to create ''dianzi cidian'' (電子詞典/电子词典 "electronic dictionaries") usable on computers, PDAs, etc. There are proprietary systems, such as [[Wenlin Software for learning Chinese]], and there are also free dictionaries available online. After Paul Denisowski started the volunteer [[CEDICT]] (Chinese–English dictionary) project in 1997, it has grown into a standard reference database. The CEDICT is the basis for many Internet dictionaries of Chinese, and is included in the [[Unihan Database]].

==Specialized dictionaries==
Chinese publishing houses print diverse types of ''zhuanke cidian''  (專科詞典/专科词典 "[[specialized dictionary]]"). One Chinese dictionary bibliography (Mathis et al. 1982) lists over 130 subject categories, from "Abbreviations, Accounting" to "Veterinary, Zoology." The following examples are limited to specialized dictionaries from a few representative fields.

=== Ancient Chinese ===
Dictionaries of Ancient Chinese give definitions, in Modern Chinese, of characters and words found in the pre-Modern (before 1911) Chinese literature.  They are typically organized by ''pinyin'' or by ''Zihui'' radicals, and give definitions in order of antiquity (most ancient to most recent) when several definitions exist.  Quotes from the literature exemplifying each listed meaning are given.  Quotes are usually chosen from the pre-Han Classical literature when possible, unless the definition emerged during the post-Classical period.  Dictionaries intended for historians, linguists, and other classical scholars will sometimes also provide Middle Chinese ''fanqie'' readings and/or Old Chinese rime groups, as well as bronze script or oracle bone script forms.

While dictionaries published in Mainland China intended for study or reference by high school/college students are generally printed in Simplified Chinese, dictionaries intended for scholarly research are set in Traditional Chinese.

===Dialects===
Twenty centuries ago, the ''Fangyan'' was the first Chinese specialized dictionary. The usual English translation for ''fangyan'' (方言 lit. "regional/areal speech") is "[[dialect]]", but the language situation in China is uniquely complex. In the "dialect" sense of [[English dialects]], Chinese has [[Mandarin dialects]], yet ''fangyan'' also means "non-Mandarin languages, mutually unintelligible regional [[varieties of Chinese]]", such as [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]. Some linguists like [[John DeFrancis]] prefer the translation "topolect". Here are some general ''fangyan cidian'' (方言词典 "topolect dictionary") examples.

===Idioms===
Chinese has five words translatable as "[[idiom]]": ''[[chengyu]]'' (成語/成语 "set phrase; idiom"), ''yanyu'' (諺語/谚语 proverb; popular saying, maxim; idiom"), ''[[xiehouyu]]'' (歇後語/歇后语 "truncated witticism, [[aposiopesis]]; enigmatic folk simile"), ''xiyu'' (習語/习语 "idiom"), and ''guanyongyu'' (慣用語/惯用语 "fixed expression; idiom; locution"). Some modern dictionaries for idioms are:

===Loanwords===
The Chinese language adopted a few foreign ''wailaici'' (外來詞/外来词 "[[loanwords]]") during the [[Han Dynasty]], especially after [[Zhang Qian]]'s exploration of the [[Western Regions]]. The lexicon absorbed many [[Buddhist terms and concepts]] when [[Chinese Buddhism]] began to flourish in the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. During the late 19th century, when Western powers forced open China's doors, numerous loanwords entered Chinese, many through the [[Japanese language]]. While some foreign borrowings became obsolete, others became indispensable terms in modern vocabulary.

===Vernacular literature===
The 20th century saw the rapid progress of the studies of the lexicons found in the Chinese vernacular literature, which includes novels, dramas and poetry. Important works in the field include: 
*Zhang Xiang 張相, ''Shiciqu Yuci Huishi'' (詩詞曲語辭匯釋 "Compilation and Explanations of the Colloquial Terms Found in Classical Poetry and Dramas"). Pioneering work in the field, completed in 1945 but published posthumously in 1954 in Shanghai by Zhonghua Book Company. Many reprints.

First published in 1991 as ''Yuanming Xiqu Zhong De Mengguyu'' (元明戲曲中的蒙古語  "Mongolian Expressions in Yuan and Ming Dramas") by Shanghai: Hanyu dacidian chubanshe. Covering mainly the loanwords form Mongolian.

===Chinese learners===
Employing [[corpus linguistics]] and lists of Chinese characters arranged by frequency of usage (e.g., ''[[List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese]])'', lexicographers have compiled dictionaries for learners of [[Chinese as a foreign language]]. These specialized Chinese dictionaries are available either as add-ons to existing  publications like Yuan (2004) and [[Wenlin]] or as specific ones like

[[File:Armenian translation of Eusebius Chronicon.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Armenian translation of Eusebius Chronicon, 13th century manuscript]]
The '''''Chronicon''''' or '''''Chronicle''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Παντοδαπὴ ἱστορία ''Pantodape historia'', "[[Universal history]]") was a work in two books by [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]].  It seems to have been compiled in the early 4th century.  It contained a world chronicle from [[Abraham]] until the vicennalia of [[Constantine I]] in A.D. 325.  Book 1 contained sets of extracts from earlier writers; book 2 contained a technically innovative list of dates and events in tabular format.

The original [[Koine Greek|Greek]] text is lost, although substantial quotations exist in later chronographers.  Both books are mostly preserved in an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] translation.  Book 2 is entirely preserved in the [[Latin]] translation by [[Jerome]].  Portions also exist in quotation in later Syriac writers such as the fragments by [[James of Edessa]] and, following him, [[Michael the Syrian]].

The ''Chronicle'' as preserved extends to the year 325, and was written before the "[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]".

== Contents ==
The work was composed divided into two parts. The first part (Greek, ''Chronographia'', "Annals") gives a summary of universal history from the sources, arranged according to nations. The second part (Greek, ''Chronikoi kanones'', "Chronological Canons") furnishes a synchronism of the historical material in parallel columns, the equivalent of a parallel [[timeline]], where each line is a year. It is the longest preserved list of [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] victors, containing however mainly the [[stadion (running race)]] winners  from 776 B.C. to A.D. 217. These tables have been completely preserved in a [[Chronicon (Jerome)|Latin translation by Jerome]] and both parts are still extant in an Armenian translation.

The work may be reconstructed from later chronographists of the [[Byzantine]], especially [[George Syncellus]].

"'''Coat of Many Colors'''" is a song written and recorded by American [[country music]] singer [[Dolly Parton]], which has been described on a number of occasions as her favorite song she has written. It was released in October 1971 as the second single and title track from the album ''[[Coat of Many Colors]]''.

==Background==
She composed the song in 1969, while traveling with [[Porter Wagoner]] on a tour bus. (She explained in her 1994 memoir, ''My Life and Other Unfinished Business'', because she could find no paper, as the song came to her, she wrote it on the back of a [[dry cleaning]] receipt from one of Wagoner's suits; when the song became a hit, Wagoner had the receipt framed.) She recorded the song in April [[1971 in music|1971]], making it the title song for her'' [[Coat of Many Colors]]'' album. The song reached #4 on the U.S. country singles charts.

==Content==
The song tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. As she sewed, she told her child the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and his [[Coat of many colors|Coat of Many Colors]]. The excited child, "with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes", rushed to school, "just to find the others laughing and making fun of me" for wearing a coat made of rags. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;And oh I did not understand it, for I felt I was rich&lt;br&gt;And I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch&lt;br&gt;And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed&lt;br&gt;And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The song concludes with Parton singing the moral of her story:&lt;blockquote&gt;But they didn't understand it, and I tried to make them see&lt;br&gt;One is only poor, only if they choose to be&lt;br&gt;Now I know we had no money, but I was rich as I could be&lt;br&gt;In my coat of many colors my momma made for me&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Missing final verse==
On the original LP release of the 1975 compilation ''[[Best of Dolly Parton]]'', the printed lyrics to the song appeared in the inner gatefold of the album, including a final verse that has never been included on any of Parton's recordings of the song:

:Through life I've remained happy and good luck is on my side.
:I have everything that anyone could ever want from life.
:But nothing is as precious as my mama's memory,
:and my coat of many colors that mama made for me. 

==Original coat==
Dolly says the original coat was used for various other purposes but her mother did make a new one to use on display in her [[Chasing Rainbows Museum]] at [[Dollywood]]. (Wagoner also donated the framed dry cleaning receipt on which Parton composed the song to the museum, where it now hangs.)

==Interpretations by other artists==
[[Shania Twain]] recorded a [[cover version]] of the song on the 2003 Parton tribute album ''[[Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton]]'', with accompaniment by [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Alison Krauss and Union Station|Union Station]]. This version peaked at #57 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart based only on unsolicited airplay. Other cover versions include a 1976 recording by [[Emmylou Harris]] on her [[Reprise Records]] debut, ''[[Pieces of the Sky]]'', and a recording by [[Eva Cassidy]] released on the 2008 posthumous collection, ''[[Somewhere (Eva Cassidy album)|Somewhere]]''. Scottish comedian [[Billy Connolly]] recorded a version in 1975 on his album ''Get Right Intae Him'' (Unicorn Artists). This was a serious version unlike his comical song "[[D.I.V.O.R.C.E.]]" which parodied "[[D-I-V-O-R-C-E]]", made popular by Tammy Wynette and also covered by Parton. [[Melinda Schneider]] and [[Beccy Cole]] covered the song on their album ''[[Great Women of Country]]'' (2014).

==Legacy==
In 2005, ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' ranked ''Coat of Many Colors'' number 10 on its list of 100 Songs of the South. A 1996 [[children's]] [[picture book]] of the song, with illustrations by [[Judith Sutton]], was published by [[Harpercollins|Harpercollins Children's Books]]. In 2008, [[Kristy Lee Cook]] performed this song on [[American Idol (season 7)|''American Idol'']] during Dolly Parton Week. 

In 2011 Parton's recording was added to the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[National Recording Registry]] list of sound recordings that "are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Recording Registry 2011|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2011reg.html|work=National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors|TV movie]] was broadcast in December 2015 by [[NBC]], with [[Alyvia Alyn Lind]] as young Dolly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/news/tennesse-tale-dolly-partons-most-famous-story-coming-screen?subid=national-00001|title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">'''''Cohen, NO v Segal'''''&lt;ref&gt;1970 (3) SA 702 (W).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African law. It was heard in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Boshoff J on March 17, 1970, with judgment handed down on April 28. The case is significant for its finding that a dividend cannot be declared which has the effect of diverting a portion of the ''corpus'' of the company to the shareholders. A dividend may therefore, generally speaking, only be declared out of profits, and a resolution which declares a dividend to be paid out of the capital of the company is ''ultra vires'' the company.&lt;ref&gt;706A-B.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==
Prior to the liquidation of a company, the defendant and one "H," the sole directors and shareholders, had sold the fixed property of the company. They had then divided the proceeds of the sale between them, the company's accountant having debited their loan accounts with the amounts. Thereafter they had purported to distribute the proceeds between them as a declared dividend. The liquidator of the company sued the defendant for the pecuniary loss which the company had sustained as a result of the [[delict]].

== Judgment ==
The court held that, as the declaration of the dividend was ''ultra vires'' and of no force and effect, and as the money had been paid to the defendant as a loan, which loan still existed, the plaintiff had failed to make out a case for the payment of any money on the cause of action relied upon.

'''Dominic Nucciarone''' (born January 23, 1932), is an Italian-American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and trainer better known under his ring name of '''Dominic DeNucci'''.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.74)&lt;/ref&gt; Former wrestling students include [[Mick Foley]], [[Shane Douglas]], [[Cody Michaels]], and [[Brian Hildebrand]].&lt;ref name=mf66&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.66-68, 80)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
DeNucci started out teaming with the original Dino Bravo as Dominic Bravo, a storyline/[[kayfabe]] brother as the two worked as a [[tag team]].

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1971–1978)===
On June 18, 1971, DeNucci won his first [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) title, the [[WWWF International Tag Team Championship]], with [[Bruno Sammartino]] by defeating The Mongols ([[Nikolai Volkoff|Bepo]] and [[Newton Tattrie|Geto Mongol]]).&lt;ref name=international&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/pa/w/studio/wwwf-in-t.html|title=WWWF International Tag Team Championship History|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com|accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lost the title to The Mongols three days later.&lt;ref name=international/&gt; On May 13, 1975, DeNucci and [[Víctor Rivera (professional wrestler)|Victor Rivera]] won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]] from [[Jimmy Valiant|Jimmy]] and [[Johnny Valiant]].&lt;ref name=wwe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Truetitlehistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwf/wwf-t.html|title=WWE World Tag Team Title| publisher=Wrestling-titles.com|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, however, Rivera left the WWF, and [[Pat Barrett (wrestler)|Pat Barrett]] became DeNucci's replacement partner.&lt;ref name=wwe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Truetitlehistory/&gt; They lost the title approximately three months later to [[The Blackjacks]] on August 26.&lt;ref name=wwe/&gt; DeNucci became a two-time WWWF World Tag Team Champion when he and his partner Dino Bravo defeated [[Professor Tanaka]] and [[Harry Fujiwara|Mr. Fuji]] on March 14, 1978.&lt;ref name=wwe/&gt; They held the title until June 26 when they [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] it to [[The Yukon Lumberjacks]].&lt;ref name=wwe/&gt; DeNucci also unsuccessfully challenged inaugural [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] on a number of occasions for the IC belt. DeNucci also wrestled for Big Time Wrestling out of Detroit; he was very popular in the Michigan/Ohio territory in the early 1970s.

===Professional wrestling trainer===
After ending his career as an active professional wrestler, he trained [[Moondog Spot]], [[Mick Foley]], [[Shane Douglas]] and [[Brian Hildebrand]] among others.&lt;ref name=mf66/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=82|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeNucci is featured in ''Mick Foley: "Madman Unmasked"'', where he is seen training Mick Foley and reminiscing about Foley in the days of his training. He is also featured prominently in the opening chapters of Mick Foley's autobiography, '[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks]]'. A seven-decade man, DeNucci last wrestled April 14, 2012 in Toronto, teaming with his protege [[Shane Douglas]] to defeat [[Lord Zoltan]] and [[Shawn Blanchard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dominic DeNucci &gt; Matches|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=1418&amp;page=4&amp;s=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeNucci was profiled on the 4th episode of the popular podcast, [[Titans of Wrestling]].

==Personal life==
DeNucci can speak in at least four languages: English, French, Spanish, and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.75)&lt;/ref&gt;
He has a son named Tony DeNucci who is also a professional wrestler.

'''Dynamic DNS''' ('''DDNS''' or '''DynDNS''') is a method of automatically updating a [[name server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), often in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information.

The term is used to describe two different concepts. The first is "dynamic DNS updating" which refers to systems that are used to update traditional DNS records without manual editing. These mechanisms are explained in RFC 2136, and use the [[TSIG]] mechanism to provide security. The second kind of dynamic DNS permits lightweight and immediate updates often using an update client, which do not use the RFC2136 standard for updating DNS records. These clients provide a persistent addressing method for devices that change their location, configuration or [[IP address]] frequently.

== Background ==
In the initial stages of the Internet ([[ARPANET]]) addressing of hosts on the network was achieved by static translation tables that mapped hostnames to [[IP address]]es. The tables were maintained manually in form of the [[host file]]. The [[Domain Name System]] brought a method of distributing the same address information automatically online through recursive queries to remote databases configured for each network, or [[Domain name|domain]]. Even this DNS facility still used static lookup tables at each participating node. IP addresses, once assigned to a particular host, rarely changed and the mechanism was initially sufficient. However, the rapid growth of the Internet and the proliferation of personal computers in the workplace and in homes created the substantial burden for administrators of keeping track of assigned IP addresses and managing their [[address space]]. The [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP) allowed enterprises and [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to assign addresses to computers automatically as they powered up. In addition, this helped conserve the address space available, since not all devices might be actively used at all times and addresses could be assigned as needed. This feature required that DNS servers be kept current automatically as well. The first implementations of ''dynamic DNS'' fulfilled this purpose: Host computers gained the feature to notify their respective DNS server of the address they had received from a DHCP server or through self-configuration. This protocol-based DNS update method was documented and standardized in IETF publication RFC 2136 in 1997 and has become a standard part of the DNS protocol (see also [[nsupdate]] program).

The explosive growth and proliferation of the Internet into homes brought a growing shortage of available IP addresses. DHCP became an important tool for ISPs as well to manage their address spaces for connecting home and small-business end-users with a single IP address each by implementing [[network address translation]] (NAT) at the customer-premises router. The [[private network]] behind these routers uses address space set aside for these purposes (RFC 1918), masqueraded by the NAT device. This, however, broke the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet architecture and methods were required to allow private networks, with frequently changing external IP addresses, to discover their public address and insert it into the Domain Name System in order to participate in Internet communications properly. Today, numerous providers, called ''Dynamic DNS'' service providers, offer such technology and services on the Internet.

== Domain Name System ==
DNS is based on a [[distributed database]] that takes some time to update globally. When DNS was first introduced, the database was small and could be easily maintained by hand. As the system grew this task became difficult for any one site to handle, and a new management structure was introduced to spread out the updates among many [[domain name registrar]]s. Registrars today offer end-user updating to their account information, typically using a web-based form, and the registrar then pushes out update information to other DNS servers.

Due to the distributed nature of the DNS systems and its registrars, updates to the global DNS system may take hours to distribute. Thus DNS is only suitable for services that do not change their IP address very often, as is the case for most large services like Wikipedia. Smaller services, however, are generally much more likely to move from host to host over shorter periods of time. Servers being run on certain types of [[Internet service provider]], [[cable modem]]s in particular, are likely to change their IP address over very short periods of time, on the order of days or hours.

== DDNS ==
Dynamic DNS is a system that addresses the problem of rapid updates. The term is used in two ways, which, while technically similar, have very different purposes and user populations.  The first is "standards-based DNS updates", which uses an extension of the DNS protocol to ask for an update; this is often used for company laptops to register their address.  The second is usually a web-based protocol, normally a single HTTP fetch with username and password which then updates some DNS records (by some unspecified method); this is commonly used for a domestic computer to register itself by a publicly-known name in order to be found by a wider group, for example as a games server or webcam.

End users of Internet access receive an allocation of IP addresses, often only a single address, by their Internet service provider. The assigned addresses may either be fixed (i.e. static), or may change from time to time, a situation called ''dynamic''. Dynamic addresses are generally given only to residential customers and small businesses, as most enterprises specifically require static addresses.

Dynamic IP addresses present a problem if the customer wants to provide a service to other users on the Internet, such as a web service. As the IP address may change frequently, corresponding domain names must be quickly re-mapped in the [[Domain Name System|DNS]], to maintain accessibility using a well-known URL.

Many providers offer commercial or free Dynamic DNS service for this scenario. The automatic reconfiguration is generally implemented in the user's [[router (computing)|router]] or computer, which runs software to update the DDNS service. The communication between the user's equipment and the provider is not standardized, although a few standard web-based methods of updating have emerged over time.

== Standards-based dynamic DNS update ==
The standardized method of dynamically updating domain name server records is prescribed by RFC 2136, commonly known as dynamic DNS update. The method described by RFC 2136 is a network protocol for use with managed DNS servers, and it includes a security mechanism. RFC 2136 supports all DNS record types, but often it is used only as an extension of the [[DHCP]] system, and in which the authorized DHCP servers register the client records in the DNS. This form of support for RFC 2136 is provided by a plethora of client and server software, including those that are components of most current operating systems. Support for RFC 2136 is also an integral part of many [[directory service]]s, including [[LDAP]] and [[Active Directory|Windows' Active Directory]] domains.

=== Function ===
In [[Microsoft Windows]] networks, dynamic DNS is an integral part of [[Active Directory]], because [[domain controller]]s register their [[SRV record|network service types]] in DNS so that other computers in the domain (or forest) can access them.

Increasing efforts to secure Internet communications today involve encryption of all dynamic updates via the public Internet, as these public dynamic DNS services have been abused increasingly to design security breaches.  Standards-based methods within the [[DNSSEC]] protocol suite, such as [[TSIG]], have been developed to secure DNS updates, but are not widely in use.  Microsoft developed [[TSIG#Alternatives to TSIG|alternative]] technology ([[Generic Security Service Algorithm for Secret Key Transaction|GSS-TSIG]]) based on [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] authentication.

Some [[Free software|free]] DNS server software systems, such as [[dnsmasq]], support a dynamic update procedure that directly involves a built-in [[DHCP]] server.  This server automatically updates or adds the DNS records as it assigns addresses, relieving the administrator of the task of specifically configuring dynamic updates.

== DDNS for Internet access devices ==
Dynamic DNS providers offer a software [[Client (computing)|client]] program that automates the discovery and registration of the client system's public IP addresses. The client program is executed on a computer or device in the private network. It connects to the DDNS provider's systems with a unique login name; the provider uses the name to link the discovered public IP address of the home network with a hostname in the domain name system. Depending on the provider, the hostname is registered within a domain owned by the provider, or within the customer's own domain name. These services can function by a number of mechanisms. Often they use an [[HTTP]] service request since even restrictive environments usually allow HTTP service. The provider might use RFC 2136 to update the DNS servers.

Many home networking [[Residential gateway|modem/routers]] include client applications in their [[firmware]], compatible with a variety of DDNS providers.

== DDNS for security appliance manufacturers ==
Dynamic DNS is an expected feature or even requirement for IP-based security appliances like [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]] and [[IP camera]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  Many options are available for today's manufacturer, and these include the use of existing DDNS services or the use of custom services hosted by the manufacturer themselves.

In almost all cases, a simple [[HTTP]] based update [[Application programming interface|API]] is used as it allows for easy integration of a DDNS [[Client (computing)|client]] into a device's [[firmware]]. There are several pre-made tools that can help to ease the burden of server and client development, like MintDNS, [[cURL]] and Inadyn. Most web-based DDNS services use a standard user name and password security schema. This requires that a user first create an account at the DDNS server website and then configure their device to send updates to the DDNS server whenever an [[IP address]] change is detected.

Some device manufacturers go a step further by only allowing their DDNS Service to be used by the devices they manufacture, and also eliminate the need for user names and passwords altogether. Generally this is accomplished by [[encrypting]] the device's [[MAC address]] using an cryptographic algorithm kept secret on both the DDNS server and within the device's firmware. The resulting [[decryption]] or decryption failure is used to secure or deny updates.  Resources for the development of custom DDNS services are generally limited and involve a full [[software development cycle]] to design and field a secure and robust DDNS server.

'''eQuibbly''' is an online arbitration service (one form of [[online dispute resolution]] (ODR)), offering individuals and companies in the U.S. and Canada, and other countries that are signatories to the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]], a private and legally binding alternative to pursuing litigation in court. eQuibbly is one of only a few [[online dispute resolution|Online Dispute Resolution]] services in [[North America]] focused exclusively on online [[arbitration]]. It is the only company in North America where former trial judges arbitrate cases entirely online.

== History ==

eQuibbly was developed to mitigate the high cost of litigation which precludes many low- and middle-income families and individuals from seeking legal redress.&lt;ref name="Judge Bev"&gt;{{cite web|last=McLachlin|first=Beverley|title=The Challenges We Face|url=http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/judges-juges/spe-dis/bm-2007-03-08-eng.aspx|publisher=Supreme Court of Canada|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a Chief Justice of a Supreme Court, "Lack of access to civil justice represents the most significant challenge to our justice system...courtrooms today are filled with litigants who are not represented by counsel, trying to navigate the sometimes complex demands of law and procedure.

Eureka is a side-wheel paddle [[steamboat]], built in 1890, which is now preserved at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]. Originally named ''Ukiah'' to commemorate the railway's recent extension into the [[Ukiah, California|City of Ukiah]], the boat was built by the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad Company at their Tiburon yard. ''Eureka'' has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] and was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 24, 1973.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; 

It is the largest existing [[wood]]en [[ship]] in the world.

==Early history==
The ship originally carried people between San Francisco and [[Tiburon, California|Tiburon]] during the day and hauled railroad freight cars at night. In 1907, ''Ukiah'' was re-routed to the [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]]&amp;ndash;[[San Francisco Ferry Building]] route by its new owners, [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]].

[[Image:Eurekacabin.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of the seating area on ''Eureka's'' upper deck. The magazine shop is visible to the right behind the glass. The restaurant was on this level at the far end of the deck]]

As automobiles became more common, motorists wanted to "drive across the bay". Since there were no bridges on [[San Francisco Bay]] at the time, ''Ukiah'' was able to meet this demand via a refitted lower deck designed to handle vehicles. The deck above (also enclosed) was expanded for passengers.

==World War I and name change==
During [[World War I]], ''Ukiah'' carried munition-filled rail cars for the war effort. Overloading of the ship caused hull strains so severe that the government paid for complete rebuilding of the ship. [[Shipwright]]s at the Southern Pacific yard labored for two years—eventually replacing all of its structure above the waterline. This kind of reconstruction was called "jacking up the whistle and sliding a new boat underneath." The refurbished ferry was christened ''Eureka'' in honor of the [[Eureka, California|Northern California city]], which also happened to be the new northern termination of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad.

As a passenger ferry, she could carry 2,300 passengers and 120 automobiles. At that time, she was the biggest and the fastest double-ended passenger ferry boat in the world—{{convert|299|ft|6|in}} long, with an extreme width of {{convert|78|ft}} and gross tonnage of 2,420 tons.{{clarify |reason=What kind of tons? |date=October 2012}}

==1920s through retirement==
Between 1922 and 1941 ''Eureka'' was on the Sausalito commuter run. As the largest of the Northwestern boats, ''Eureka'' made the heaviest commuter trips - the 7:30 from Sausalito and the 5:15 from San Francisco. Each trip averaged 2,200 passengers. During this period the upper deck included seating areas, a magazine stand, and a restaurant that served full meals.

Eureka was primarily a passenger boat, carrying very few cars. After 1929, though, she sometimes made an extra run from the [[Hyde Street Pier]] in San Francisco, carrying autos on Sundays.

Completion of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] between [[San Francisco]] and [[Marin County, California|Marin]] in 1937 doomed ferry service. Northwestern Pacific first cut service, then abandoned ferries altogether in 1941.

During the war years, ''Eureka'' joined a number of bay ferries in the work of transporting troops from [[Camp Stoneman]] in [[Pittsburg, California]], up the [[Sacramento River]], to the Port of Embarkation piers in San Francisco.{{clarify |reason=Up river? |date=October 2012}}

By the 1950s ''Eureka'' served by linking [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific's]] cross-country trains, which terminated at [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], with San Francisco until 1957, when she snapped an engine crank pin. That service was discontinued the following year. In 1958, ''Eureka'' joined the fleet of historic ships now at the National Historical Park.

In the late 1990s she was used as a main filming location for the TV-show ''[[Nash Bridges]]''.

In October 1999, Eureka entered San Francisco Drydock for a $1 million restoration project focusing on the vessel's superstructure—the above-water portions of the vessel. A significant portion of that restoration was the replacement of the boat's "kingposts"--four large wooden structures that support the paddlewheels and upper decks.

==Design==
Although a number of large ferryboats survive in the US, ''Eureka'' is the only one with a wooden hull. She is one of the most impressive remaining examples of traditional American wooden shipbuilding.

[[Image:Eurekaport.jpg|thumb|200px|View of the middle of the port side of the ship]]

Beneath her upperworks, the round-bottomed hull is {{convert|42|ft}} wide and {{convert|277|ft}} long. The house rests on a platform extending {{convert|18|ft}} from the hull on either side. 

Her [[walking beam engine]] was originally powered by [[coal]]-fired [[boilers]] that were converted to oil in 1905. The engine was built in 1890 by the Fulton Iron Works in San Francisco. It is the only walking beam engine in the United States preserved in a floating vessel.

With the increased length of {{convert|5|ft}},{{clarify |reason=How and when did length increase? |date=October 2012}} ''Eureka'' became the largest wooden passenger ferry ever built. She was certified to carry 3,500 people.

'''Fantômas''' ({{IPA-fr|fɑ̃tomas|lang}}) is a fictional character created by French writers [[Marcel Allain]] (1885–1969) and [[Pierre Souvestre]] (1874–1914).

One of the most popular characters in the history of French [[crime fiction]], Fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. In the history of crime fiction, he represents a transition from [[Gothic novel]] villains of the 19th century to modern-day [[serial killer]]s.

The books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], in two respects:&lt;ref name="Slarek"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dvdoutsider.co.uk/dvd/reviews/f/fantomas.html | title=Getting away with murder, A region 2 partial DVD review of ''Fantômas'' by Slarek | work=DVD Outsider | date=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their "working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two halves of the story together in the final chapter."&lt;ref name="Slarek"/&gt; This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up. Such a system ensured that the [[film studio]] could produce sequels reliably.

The popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask, black gloves, and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas movies directed by [[André Hunebelle]] in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1963 with [[Fantômas (1964 film)|Fantômas]], departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone, and by making Fantômas (played by [[Jean Marais]]) more of a James Bond enemy. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered.

==Overview==
[[File:Fantomas-mortquitue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A poster for the third ''Fantômas'' serial by [[Louis Feuillade]]. Fantômas wears his iconic black hood and black leotard, more sinister features than the traditional gentleman thief's domino mask and tuxedo.]]
Fantômas is a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive. As described by Schütt (2003) in her analysis of French crime fiction literature, Fantômas is the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone. He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve, who is generally the only one able to see Fantômas's tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Cambridge Companion to Crime Fiction|last=Priestman|first=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn= 978-0-521-00871-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantômas was introduced a few years after [[Arsène Lupin]], another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has no such qualms and is shown as a [[Psychopathy |sociopath]] who enjoys killing in a [[sadomasochism |sadistic]] fashion.

He is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]-infested [[rat]]s, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.

Fantômas's background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fantômas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison.

C. 1895, Fantômas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, Hélène, whose father might be Fantômas or an Indian prince who was Fantômas' acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa.

In 1897, Fantômas was in the United States of America and [[Mexico]]. There, he ruined his then business partner, Etienne Rambert.

In 1899, he fought in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the [[South African Republic |Transvaal]] as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham.

Upon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him.

Fantômas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he persuaded Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, who was truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jerôme Fandor who is employed at the newspaper ''La Capitale''. Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fantômas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fantômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was [[guillotine]]d in his place.

Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910.

Fandor fell in love with Hélène and, despite Fantômas's repeated attempts to break them up, married her.

Fantômas's evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir's girlfriend was murdered by Fantômas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.

===Notes===
* The original covers by Gino Starace are often considered works of lurid genius in themselves and may be seen at the "Fantômas Lives" site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fantomas-lives.com/ | title=Fantômas Lives | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Fantômas book cover, showing a contemplative masked man dressed in evening dress and holding a dagger, boldly stepping over Paris, is so well known that it has become a visual cliché.
* The novel ''The Yellow Document, or Fantômas of Berlin'' by Marcel Allain (1919), despite its title, is not a Fantômas novel.
* The last novel written by Allain was published as a newspaper serial, but never appeared in book form.
* During the 1980s, the first two novels of the series were published in revised English translations: ''Fantômas'' appeared in 1986 with an introduction by American poet [[John Ashbery]]; and ''Juve contre Fantômas'' appeared in 1987 under the title ''The Silent Executioner'', with an introduction by American artist [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[silent film]] pioneer [[Louis Feuillade]] directed five ''Fantômas'' [[Serial (film)|serials]] starring [[René Navarre]] as Fantômas, Bréon as Juve, [[Georges Melchior]] as Fandor, and [[Renée Carl]] as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial ''[[Les Vampires]]'', which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual [[vampires]]) is also reminiscent of the ''Fantômas'' series.

There was a 1920 20-episode American ''[[Fantômas (1920 serial)|Fantômas]]'' serial directed by [[Edward Sedgwick]] starring [[Edward Roseman]] as Fantômas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fantômas's nemesis is detective Fred Dixon, played by [[John Willard (playwright)|John Willard]]. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title ''Les Exploits de Diabolos'' (''The Exploits of Diabolos''). A novelization of this serial was written by David Lee White for Black Coat Press under the title ''Fantômas in America'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackcoatpress.com/fantomasus.htm |title=Fantômas in America |work=BlackCoatPress.com |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221212201/http://www.blackcoatpress.com/fantomasus.htm |archivedate=2010-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
A ''Fantômas'' series of four 90-minute episodes was produced in 1980 starring [[Helmut Berger]] as Fantômas, [[Jacques Dufilho]] as Juve, and [[Gayle Hunnicutt]] as Lady Beltham. Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by [[Claude Chabrol]]; episodes 2 and 3 by [[Luis Buñuel]]'s son, Juan Luis Buñuel.

The [[Fantômas (1964 film)|French movie version]] of ''Fantômas'' appears in the [[Czechoslovakia]]n 1979-1981 children fantasy series ''[[Arabela (TV series)|Arabela]]'' as well as its sequel series ''Arabela se vrací'', performed respectively by actors [[František Peterka]] and [[Pavel Nový]]. In this version, he does not perform a villain's role, but becomes an ally and friend of the protagonists. Fantômas also has a cameo appearance in the Czech children's series ''[[Lucie, postrach ulice]]'' as a TV character, where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers' depiction.

==Comic books==

===French===
* "Fantômas contre les Nains". A weekly color page written by Marcel Allain and drawn by Santini was published in ''Gavroche'' #24-30 (1941). This series was interrupted because of censorship; a sequel, ''Fantômas et l'Enfer Sous-Marin'' was written but not published.
* A daily "Fantômas" strip drawn by Pierre Tabary was syndicated by Opera Mundi from November 1957 to March 1958 (192 strips in total), adapting the first two novels.
* Seventeen ''Fantômas'' fumetti magazines adapting books 1, 2, 3, and 5 were published by Del Duca in 1962 and 1963.
* A new weekly "Fantômas" color page, written by Agnès Guilloteau and drawn by Jacques Taillefer, was again syndicated by Opera Mundi in 1969 and published in ''Jours de France''.
* Finally, a series of ''Fantômas'' graphic novels written by L. Dellisse and drawn by [[Claude Laverdure]] were published by Belgian publisher Claude Lefrancq: ''L'Affaire Beltham'' (1990), ''Juve contre Fantômas'' (1991), and ''Le Mort qui Tue'' (1995).

===Mexican===
During the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a ''Fantomas, La Amenaza Elegante'' (Fantomas, the Elegant Threat) comic book series that became popular throughout [[Latin America]]. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a hero, and with no acknowledgement to the original French books or films. Perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission.

This Fantômas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in the Latin American version – which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal ''[[Diabolik]]'' — and his use of it, seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by [[Lucha libre|Mexican wrestling]].

The Latin American Fantômas mixed Italian and Mexican styles creating a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] - just as the [[flag of Mexico]] and the [[flag of Italy]] are made different by the central emblem of the Aztec pictogram for Tenochtitlan on the Mexican flag. The French character wore a black mask like his Italian inspiration, the Latin American a white mask like Mexican wrestling hero [[El Santo|Santo]] (literally 'saint' in Spanish) - Italy faces Africa home to a majority Black population, Mexico the United States mostly with a majority White population. These characters had to remain relevant and mysterious to their specific geographical regions to survive and succeed.

Apparently the series was also influenced by the ''[[James Bond]]'' movies, as Fantômas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals. The Latin American Fantômas, created in Mexico, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American [[Hugh Hefner]], who created ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo. A mixture that immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences, mostly prepubescent and adolescents males.

Latino Fantômas also was a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, had secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several secret agents, including the 12 "Zodiac Girls", beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively, known only by their codenames – the signs of the [[zodiac]]. The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their [[femininity]] and preceding [[Charlie's Angels]] by decades.

Although cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985, and a character revival by rival [[Grupo Editorial Vid]] in Mexico in the 1990s did not last long), it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both [[Central America]] and South America. Fantômas continues to be one of Latin America's favorite comic characters. For more information on this version of the character check the link to the Fantomas Lives website below.

===American===
A ''Fantômas'' short story by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Romano Felmang|Roy Mann]] appeared in ''[[Captain Action]] Comics'' No. 1, published in 2009 by [[Moonstone Books]].

"Yes Virginia, There is a Fantomas" by [[William Patrick Maynard]] was published in [[Tales of the Shadowmen]] Volume 6, published in 2009 by [[Black Coat Press]].

The first half of the novella, "Reign of Terror" by [[R. Allen Leider]] was published in [[Awesome Tales]] No. 3, published in 2016 by [[Bold Venture Press]]. The second half of the novella is planned for [[Awesome Tales]] No. 9.

==Cultural influence==
The ''Fantômas'' novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the [[surrealism|surrealists]]. [[Blaise Cendrars]] called the series "the modern [[Aeneid]]"; [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] said that "from the imaginative standpoint ''Fantômas'' is one of the richest works that exist." The painter [[René Magritte]] and the surrealist poet and novelist [[Robert Desnos]] both produced works alluding to Fantômas.

The movies were also very popular in the Soviet Union. After their success Fantômas had a short appearance in two popular Soviet comedies: "Seven Old Men and One Girl" (1968, directed by E. Karelov) and "Old Men Bandits" (1971, directed by E. Ryazanov).  In 2007, Russian author [[Andrey Shary]] published the book ''Sign F: Fantomas in Books and on the Screen'', dealing in particular with this phenomenon.

==Pastiches, homages, and related characters==
* ''Fantômas'' may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor, ''Zigomar'', the creation of Léon Sazie, which first appeared as a serial in ''Le Matin'' in 1909, then as a pulp magazine (28 issues) in 1913, and again in ''Zigomar contre Zigomar'' for eight more issues in 1924.
* In France alone, Fantômas spawned numerous imitators. Among those are [[Arnould Galopin]]'s ''Tenebras'', Gaston René's ''Masque Rouge'', [[Arthur Bernède]]'s ''[[Belphégor (novel)|Belphégor]]'', R. Collard's ''Demonax'' and Marcel Allain's own ''Tigris'', ''Fatala'', ''Miss Teria'' and ''Ferocias''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/marcelallain.htm | title=Marcel Allain - Tigris - Fatala - Miss Téria | work=CoolFrenchComics.com | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1915 adventure film ''[[Filibus]]'' was probably inspired largely by the popularity of ''Fantômas'', although the film's title character, a female [[air pirate]], strongly resembles [[Arsène Lupin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Uomini meccanici e matrimoni interplanetari: La straordinarissima avventura del cinema muto italiano di fantascienza|first=Paolo|last=Bertetti|journal=Anarres|volume=2|date=Winter 2013–14|url=http://www.fantascienza.com/anarres/articoli/32/uomini-meccanici-e-matrimoni-interplanetari/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the success of the first [[Fantômas (1913 serial)|''Fantômas'' film serial]] directed by [[Louis Feuillade]], [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] produced another serial directed by Feuillade in the same style, ''[[Les Vampires]]'', about a gang of criminals. As Feuillade had been criticized for glorifying outlaws, his next serial for Gaumont, ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'', starred this time a positive hero, a mysterious avenger conceived as an honest version of Fantômas. [[Judex]] was himself featured in various adaptations, sequels and remakes. The original ''Judex'' serial was released in the United States and appears to have been an inspiration for the American pulp character [[The Shadow]], who was himself an inspiration for [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Fournier, ''Super-héros : une histoire française'', Huginn Muninn, 2014, p. 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fantômas has appeared in an unauthorized fashion in two French stage plays: ''Nick Carter vs. Fantômas'' (1910) by [[Alexandre Bisson]] and [[Guillaume Livet]] (translated, {{ISBN|978-1-934543-05-4}}) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] vs. Fantômas'' (''La Mort d' Herlock Sholmes, ou Bandits en Habits Noirs'', 1914) by Pierre de Wattyne and Yorril Walter (translated, {{ISBN|978-1-934543-67-2}}).
* A number of Italian dark villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by Fantômas. Among the most famous are [[Diabolik]], [[Kriminal]], [[Killing (comics)|Killing]], and [[Satanik]].
* The British film critic and writer [[Kim Newman]] has argued that ''Fantômas'' inspired the ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' film series starring [[Peter Sellers]].&lt;ref name="Slarek"/&gt; In the initial 1963 ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|Pink Panther]]'' film, Fantômas was transformed into Sir Charles Lytton (the Phantom), and Inspector Juve became Inspector Clouseau.
* ''Fantômas'' also has many plot points in common with the 1969 Hong Kong movie ''Temptress of a Thousand Faces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://teleport-city.com/wordpress/?p=921 |title=Fantômas Review |date=February 26, 2008 |work=Teleport-City.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094929/http://teleport-city.com/wordpress/?p=921 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paperinik]], (Duck Avenger) alter-ego of [[Donald Duck]] created by [[Guido Martina]] and [[Giovan Battista Carpi]] in 1969, is partly based on Fantômas. His predecessor, Fantomius, (Fantomallard) was obviously also named after Fantômas. In France the character is known as Fantomiald; in Germany as Phantomias; in Greek as Phantom Duck and in Spain as Patomas.
* ''Fantômas'' inspired [[Julio Cortázar]]'s 1975 novella ''Fantomas contra los vampiros multinacionales''.
*  Fantômas' grandson, Fantoma Mark III, serves as an antagonist for [[Arsène Lupin III]] (grandson of Arsène Lupin) in two episodes of the [[Shin Lupin III|Red Jacket installment]] of the [[Lupin III]] franchise, wherein his appearance and portrayal are comparable to [[Jean Marais|Jean Marais']] version of the character.
* A character in the [[Doctor Who]] novel ''[[The Man in the Velvet Mask]]'' (1996) is named Fantômas.
* ''Fantomas'' was the inspiration for the character Mr. Ixnay, who appears in ''The Chuckling Whatsit'', a 1997 graphic novel by writer/artist [[Richard Sala]], creator of ''Invisible Hands'', an animated homage to old-fashioned mystery thrillers which aired on [[MTV]].
* In 1999, former [[Faith No More]] singer [[Mike Patton]] named his [[heavy metal music|metal]] group [[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]] after the fictional character.
* There is a [[Marvel Comics]] character named [[Fantomex]], first appearing in August 2002. He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]] for the title ''[[New X-Men]]''.
* In one of the [[The New Traveller's Almanac|back-story sections]] of the graphic novel ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II]]'', Fantômas is described as being a member of "Les Hommes Mystérieux", the French counterpart of the League, alongside [[Arsène Lupin]], the sky-pirate [[Robur the Conqueror|Robur]], and the [[Nyctalope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comp.dit.ie/dgordon/League/OtherLeagues/1910s/1910Mysterieux.html | title=Les Hommes Mysterieux 1910s | work=Comp.dit.ie | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the follow-up, ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the League's encounter with Les Hommes is halted once Fantômas detonates a bomb which destroys the [[Opera Garnier]], after saying in unaccented English, "I win".
* The character of Spectrobert in [[Gahan Wilson]]'s book ''[[Everybody's Favorite Duck]]'' is a direct parody of Fantômas.
* Fantômas is a partial inspiration for the character of [[Phantom Limb (character)|Phantom Limb]] on the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' His last name, in fact, is Fantômas. A picture similar in appearance to the masked villain can be seen hanging on the wall of his office at State University in "[[The Invisible Hand of Fate]]". It is revealed that Phantom Limb is actually the grandson of the famous criminal. Fantômas himself briefly appears in the series during a flashback in the season 3 episode "ORB" as one of the original members of the [[Guild of Calamitous Intent]].
* Fantômas has a German cousin in the person of the (supposedly British) [[Raffles (Lord Lister)|Lord Lister]].
* In the story "Fantômville" by Nick Campbell, in the book ''[[Wildthyme in Purple]]'', Fantomas meets the time traveller [[Iris Wildthyme]].
* In the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', the Fantom (a character resembling the title character from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'') owes more than a little to Fantômas, although he is ultimately revealed to be [[M (James Bond)|M]], who in turn is revealed to be [[Professor Moriarty]].
*In the Egyptian movie, “Romantic Chase”, produced in 1968, Fantômas is played by the late Egyptian actor, Hasan Mustafa. The role of Fantômas is a butler that wants to steal all the money of his employer.  The film itself is an adaptation of “What’s new pussycat” which was produced in 1965.
*In the Czech Fantasy TV series [[Arabela_(TV_series)|Arabela]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0175381|Arabela |(1979 TV series}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the sequel [[Arabela Returns (Arabela se vrací)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0182728|Arabela se vrací |(1993 TV series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  Fantomas is one of the residents in the World of fairy tales.

In [[computer programming]], a '''fully qualified name''' is an unambiguous name that specifies which [[Object (computer science)|object]], [[Function (computer science)|function]], or [[Variable (programming)|variable]] a call refers to without regard to the context of the call.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In a [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|hierarchical structure]], a name is fully qualified when it "is complete in the sense that it includes (a) all names in the hierarchic sequence above the given element and (b) the name of the given element itself."&lt;ref name="Weik"&gt;{{cite book

== Programming == 
{{example farm|date=October 2011}}
Fully qualified names explicitly refer to [[namespace]]s that would otherwise be implicit because of the [[Scope (programming)|scope]] of the call.&lt;ref name="HejlsbergTorgersen2010"&gt;{{cite book

Commonly encountered applications of the notion have been given their own names, such as the [[fully qualified domain name]] and the [[fully qualified file name]].

=== Examples ===
To distinguish a fully qualified name from a regular name, [[C++]], [[Tcl]], [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] use two colons (&lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt;), and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] uses dots (&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;), as does Visual Basic .NET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|title=Object Oriented Programming - JavaScript Programming Fundamentals - DHTML
|publisher=Lanoie.com
|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include:

{{anchor|SQL}}
* As an example of a relational database, in [[Microsoft SQL Server]] the fully qualified name of an object is the one that specifies all four parts: &lt;code&gt;server_name.[database_name].[schema_name].object_name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Using Identifiers As Object Names
|publisher=msdn.microsoft.com
|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Perl}}
* In [[Perl]], a fully qualified [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] (&lt;code&gt;$scalar&lt;/code&gt;) that is in the [[Perl module#Perl packages and namespaces|package]] &lt;code&gt;package2&lt;/code&gt; would be referred to as &lt;code&gt;$package2::scalar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html
|title=mod_perl: Perl Reference
|publisher=perl.apache.org
|accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Ruby}}
* In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], the fully qualified name of a class is the name of such class with all its parent modules, as Vehicles::Cars::Factory would be the fully qualified name of Factory class within Cars module within Vehicles module.

{{anchor|COBOL}}
* In [[COBOL]], a fully qualified data item name can be created by suffixing a potentially ambiguous identifier with an {{code|IN}} (or {{code|OF}}) phrase. For example, multiple data item records might contain a member item named {{code|ACCOUNT-ID}}, so specifying {{code|ACCOUNT-ID IN CUSTOMER}} serves to disambiguate a specific {{code|ACCOUNT-ID}} data item, specifically, the one that is a member of the parent {{code|CUSTOMER}} data item. Multiple clauses may be necessary to fully disambiguate a given identifier, for example, {{code|ACCOUNT-ID IN CUSTOMER IN LAST-TRANSACTION}}. This syntax is equivalent to the "dotted" notation employed in many object-oriented programming languages, but with the identifiers specified in reverse order.

== Filenames and paths == 
The term '''fully qualified file name''' means a file on a computer whose exact name is completely specified such that it is unambiguous and cannot be mistaken for any other file on that computer system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#fully_qualified_vs._relative_paths
|title=Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces
|publisher=msdn.microsoft.com
|accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is somewhat equivalent on the Internet to a [[URL]] specifying the full name of the computer and the entire name of a particular document as a file.  The alternative is an unqualified file name or a partially qualified file name.

{{anchor|Unix}}
*On [[Unix]]-style systems, [[DOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]], the name "sample" refers to a file in the [[current directory]] named "sample". If the current directory is changed, then the file referred to by the name "sample" is different. If you start the filename with "/" indicating the [[root directory]] as in "/Users/Name/sample", then on Unix this is a fully qualified file name. So, for example, instead of referring to &lt;code&gt;./foo/bar/baz.sh&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/home/user/quz&lt;/code&gt;, which uses a relative pathname, the fully qualified name would be &lt;code&gt;/home/user/quz/foo/bar/baz.sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="KochanWood2003"&gt;{{cite book

|year=2003
|publisher=Sams Publishing
|isbn=978-0-672-32490-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DOS, the name is still relative to the root directory of the [[drive letter assignment|current disk]], so to get a fully qualified file name, the file name must be prefixed with the drive letter and a colon, as in "C:\Users\Name\sample", where "C:" specifies the "C" drive.
*Also on the above systems, some programs such as the command-line shell will search a [[path (computing)|path]] for a file. Inserting a leading (back)slash, as in "./name", will stop the searching of the path. This is a ''partially'' qualified name, but not a fully qualified name as it still depends on the current directory. A fully qualified name, because it contains (back)slashes, will always stop a path search.
*On the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating system [[MUSIC/SP]], if one asks for the file name "X", one is making an unqualified reference either to the file X in the user's library, or to the file X in the common library if the user does not have a file named X and one does exist in the common library.  If, however, one were to refer to "*COM:X" one is using a fully qualified file name reference to the file X in the common library even if they have a different file named X in their library.  Similarly, a reference to "*USR:X" would mean the file in their own library, and "MA45:X" would be a fully qualified file name referring to the specific file X in the library of user MA45.
*On the [[RSTS/E]] operating system on the [[PDP-11]] minicomputer, specifying a file "X.X" would refer to a file in one's own directory.  Referring to "$X.X" would be referring to the file "[1,2]X.X" but to fully qualify the file name, one would have to indicate the device, so "SY:[46,145]MYFILE.TXT", "SY:$X.X", or "SY:[1,2]X.X" (the last two examples meaning the same thing) would be a fully qualified file name under RSTS/E.
*On the [[UNIVAC Series 90]] mainframe operating system [[VS/9]], specifying a file "X" could mean either the file X in the account of that user, or could mean the file X in the library of the system manager, $TSOS.  However, specifying "$S0103.X" would be a fully qualified file name.
*This term can also include the case where one prefixes a fully qualified file name with a specific computer name as a prefix to a file name (where the particular system permits referencing a file on another system), so long as the exact name is unambiguous.

=== Path names === 
'''Fully qualified path name''' ('''FQPN''') is the full path of a resource, directory or file, stored in a [[computer]].  It is composed by the full path to the resource and its syntax depends on the [[operating system]].  In [[Unix-like]] operating systems it is represented in the following form: &lt;code&gt;/root/path-to/file[OR]directory&lt;/code&gt;, while in [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] it is represented in the following form: &lt;code&gt;[Drive]:\path-to\file.ext[OR]directory&lt;/code&gt;.  FQPN is also used in [[Communications protocol|Networking]] and takes the following form: &lt;code&gt;\root\[[FQDN]]\path-to\file.ext[OR]directory&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;/root/&lt;/code&gt; is the [[root directory]], the first or top-most directory in a hierarchy, and, in this case, the rooted [[Tree (data structure)|tree]]; &lt;code&gt;FQDN&lt;/code&gt; is the fully qualified domain name or node.  It is also used in [[bootstrapping]], [[computer programming]] and in [[computer science]] [[Reference (computer science)|referencing]].

== Domain names ==
{{anchor|Domain}}
* In the sense of [[domain name]]s, used in [[Uniform Resource Locator]]s (URLs), a fully qualified domain name is explicitly suffixed with a dot, to eliminate the step of resolving, and to ensure that no additional suffix is added: &lt;code&gt;wikipedia.com.&lt;/code&gt; for instance. This is an example of a [[fully qualified domain name]].&lt;ref name="Lowe2011"&gt;{{cite book

'''Haymon''' is a mythical figure from [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] in form of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]]. It is said that Haymon was the founder of ''Stift Wilten'', a [[premonstratensian]] abbey, located in the south of [[Innsbruck]]. He is said to have lived between 600 and 900 years ago and to have died in the year 878 A.D. in [[Wilten]]. According to a 13th-century sources, Haymon's grave is at the altar of the Collegiate Church in Wilten.

It has been speculated that Haymon was a [[Bavaria]]n nobleman named Haimo.
Albeit its similar spelling and pronunciation to the ancient Greek name [[Haimon]] ({{Lang-el|Αἵμων}}), no relation could be shown.


== Tradition ==
Different traditions have been amalgamated in the legend of the giant Haymon.

In the 15th century, the local legend of the Gold-Guarding Dragon who lives on the hill [[Bergisel]] east of the river [[Sill (river)|Sill]] was created.  This dragon was killed by Haymon. Set in gold, the dragon's tongue (the horn extension of a [[sword fish]]) is still today shown in the [[Tyrolean State Museum]] Ferdinandeum in Innsbruck.

Another tradition, which comes up about the 16th century, reports of a fight between Haymon and the giant [[Thyrsus (giant)|Thyrsus]], who lived in the area of [[Zirl]] and [[Seefeld, Tirol|Seefeld]], eventually killing him. From Thyrsus's blood (the so-called ''Thyrsenblut'' the healing [[Tyrolean Shale Oil]] or Ichtltyol is extracted. The last words of the giant Thyrsus were: "Blood spray! Be good for man and beast! (Spritz Bluet! Sei für Viech und Menschen gut!)" Thus, Haymon, the immigrant from the north, defeats the local Thyrsus.

In remorse, Haymon takes the Christian faith being baptized by the Bishop of [[Chur]]. Thereafter, he founded the monastery Wilten which he hands over [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s from the [[Tegernsee Abbey]]. Then he joined the order as a lay brother and stayed there until his death. Towards the end of the 16th century, all these motives could be found in the founding legend of the monastery Wilten.

Even in the 17th century, the belief in the historical existence of the giant Haymon was still so strong that the then abbot of the monastery Wilten had an excavation for Haymon's bones carried out in the church. The excavations ended without result, eventually  throwing over parts of the church.

According to contemporary scholarly interpretation of the 17th Century, the giant
Thyrsus represents the [[Romansh people]] while the invading [[Bavaria]]ns, who populated the Inn valley as of the 6th century, are being represented through Haymon. In the fight between Haymon and Thyrsus the defeat of the Romansh people by the Bavarians is symbolized.

While Thyrsus is often depicted as a somewhat primitive layman who is fighting with a torn tree, Haymon is depicted as a gallant giant with a sword. Life-size figures of the two giants Haymon and Thyrsus can be found at [[Wilten]] where they are at the entrance to the church. An engraving from 1677 by J.J. Jezl shows Haymon as a knight with a sword and the dragon's tongue in his hands. The signature says "Haymon Fundator Monasterii Wilthinensis, obiit Anno D. 878" (Haymon  founder of the monastery in Wilten, died 878).

== Miscellaneous ==
In the region around Innsbruck, various restaurants&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riese-haymon.at/ Traditionsgasthaus ''Riese Haymon'']&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions are named after the giant Haymon.
* In Innsbruck, there is an alley named ''Haymongasse''
* The book publisher ''Haymon Verlag'' is named after the mythical figure
* The name of the wireless router ''HiMoNN''&lt;ref&gt;[http://himonn.iabg.de/ HiMoNN]&lt;/ref&gt; of the south German company [[IABG]] is a [[homophone]] of Haymon.

The '''International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID)''' was an international organization that was created to promote universal access to all recorded knowledge.

==Historical Background of FID ==

FID was established on 12 September 1895, in [[Brussels]], as the International Institute of Bibliography (originally Institut International de Bibliographie, IIB) by two [[Belgium|Belgian]] lawyers, [[Paul Otlet]] (1868–1944) and [[Henri La Fontaine]] (1854–1943). It was popularly known as the Brussels Institute. Its headquarters was changed to [[The Hague]] after 1934. It had gone through a number of changes in name that reflect changes of conceptualisation of the field in which it operates.

The changes in names and years are :
*1931 – The International Institute for Documentation (Institut International de Documentation, IID)
*1937 – The International Federation for Documentation (Fédération Internationale de Documentation, FID)
*1988 – The International Federation for Information and Documentation (Fédération Internationale d'Information et de Documentation, FID)

The Institute was one of the sponsors of the first [[World Congress of Universal Documentation]], held in [[Paris]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Barua1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barua|first=Brahmanda Pratap|title=National policy on library and information systems and services for India: perspectives and projections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBB8drHUz7YC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=11 October 2011|year=1992|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-730-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Jewish Year Book''''' is an [[almanac]] targeted at the [[Jew]]ish community in the [[United Kingdom]]. It has been published every year since 1896 and is currently published by [[Vallentine Mitchell]] in association with ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' and is edited by Stephen W. Massil.

It provides a directory and guide to Jewish institutions and religious, social, educational, cultural and welfare organisations in the [[British Isles]]. It also includes up to date lists of websites and a guide to worldwide Jewish organisations, and a list of [[Israel]]'s embassies and missions. It gives an outline of Jewish history in Britain and covers UK laws which are relevant to Jews and their place in British society. It also includes details on notable Jewish people, obituaries, major events, fasts, festivals and a calendar. It is updated annually.

An appendix lists all Jews who currently hold various positions and honours, and a complete list of every Jew who has ever won the [[Victoria Cross]] or [[George Cross]].

The [[ISSN]] of the series is {{ISSN|0075-3769}} and the 2007 edition is {{ISBN|978-0-85303-735-4}}.

This '''list of online database creator apps''' lists notable web apps where end users with minimal [[database administration]] expertise can create [[online database]]s to share with team members.

Users need not have the coding skills to manage the [[solution stack]] themselves, because the web app already provides this predefined functionality. Such online database creator apps serve the gap between IT professionals (who can manage such a stack themselves) and people who would not create databases at all anyway. In other words, they provide a low-code way of doing database administration. As the concept of [[low-code development platforms|low-code development]] in general continues to evolve, some of the brands that began as online database creator apps are evolving into [[low-code development platforms]] for both the databases and the custom [[application software|apps]] that use them.

&lt;!--NOTE: entries in this list should be "notable" with their own sourced Wikipedia article, see WP:GNG and WP:WTAF for more information. NO external links or additions without article.--&gt;

'''''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''''' is a 2003 American [[live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Joe Dante]]. It is the third feature-length live-action/animation hybrid film to feature  ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters, after ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) and ''[[Space Jam]]'' (1996). The plot follows [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] (both voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]) as they help aspiring [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] Damian "D.J." Drake, Jr. ([[Brendan Fraser]]) and [[Warner Bros.]] executive Kate Houghton ([[Jenna Elfman]]) find the "[[blue monkey]]" diamond in order to prevent the evil Mr. Chairman ([[Steve Martin]]) of the [[Acme Corporation]] from using it to turn mankind into monkeys that will manufacture his products; the group also attempts to rescue D.J.'s father ([[Timothy Dalton]]), an actor and spy who has been captured by Mr. Chairman.

The film was theatrically released on November 14, 2003 with mixed-to-positive critical reception.&lt;ref name="Looney Tunes: Back in Action"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looney_tunes_back_in_action/|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/looney-tunes-back-in-action|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film was a [[box office bomb]],&lt;ref name="AnimatedMovieGuide"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toolooney.goldenagecartoons.com/doyle.htm |title=The New Looney Tunes: An Interview with Producer Larry Doyle |publisher=Toolooney.goldenagecartoons.com |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517132247/http://toolooney.goldenagecartoons.com/doyle.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; grossing $68.5 million worldwide against an $80 million budget.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt; This was the final film to be scored by composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who died less than a year after the film's release. This was also the final film to be produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation|Warner Bros. Feature Animation]].

==Plot==
Tired of playing [[Double act|second banana]] to [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]] demands his own cartoon from [[Warner Bros.]], but is promptly fired. Aspiring [[stuntman]] DJ Drake is asked to escort Daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase leads to the [[Batmobile]] demolishing the studio [[water tower]]. DJ is also fired in the process, and returns home with Daffy hitching a ride, discovering his father,  [[action film]] star, Damian Drake, is actually a [[espionage|secret agent]]. Damian instructs his son to travel to [[Las Vegas]], find his associate Dusty Tails, and gain the mystical "blue monkey" [[diamond]], but he is shortly thereafter captured by the [[Acme Corporation]], led by the childish Mr. Chairman. DJ and Daffy head for Vegas. Meanwhile, Bugs' routines fall apart without Daffy, so "Vice-President of Comedy," Kate Houghton, is sent to rehire Daffy or face being fired herself. Bugs informs Kate of the situation, so they steal Damian's spy car, and pursue DJ and Daffy.

In Las Vegas, DJ and Daffy meet Dusty in a [[casino]] owned by Acme operative [[Yosemite Sam]]. Dusty gives them a strange playing card, but when Sam attempts to kill them, they flee in the spy car with Bugs and Kate. The spy car, which can also [[flying car (aircraft)|fly]], crashes in the Nevada desert. The group eventually stumbles upon [[Area 51|Area 52]], run by a woman called 'mother', who informs them of the situation, and plays a video recording, which reveals that Acme intends on using the blue monkey to transform mankind into monkeys to manufacture their products, before turning them back into human beings to purchase them. [[Marvin the Martian]], imprisoned in the facility, escapes and leads a group of fellow alien inmates to obtain the playing card, but the heroes escape. Seeing that the card has [[Mona Lisa]]'s face on it, the group conclude they must view the painting in the [[Louvre]], located in [[Paris]].

At the Louvre, they discover that the card contains a viewing window, and looking through it, the window reveals that the Mona Lisa has a map of [[Africa]] hidden beneath. [[Elmer Fudd]] appears, and, revealing himself as an Acme operative, chases Bugs and Daffy through the gallery for the card whilst Kate is kidnapped by Mr. Chairman's [[bodyguard]], Mr. Smith, to obtain a photo of the African map. DJ rescues Kate. Elmer is disintegrated by Bugs after jumping out of a pointillism artwork. Bugs and Daffy reunite with DJ and Kate, and they leave Paris.

DJ, Kate, Bugs, and Daffy travel to Africa, meeting Granny, Sylvester, and Tweety, who escort them to the ruins of a jungle temple where they find the blue monkey. Granny and company reveal themselves to be Mr. Chairman, Smith, and the Tasmanian Devil in disguise. Mr. Chairman uses a [[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century|disintegration gun]] to transport himself and the heroes to the Acme headquarters where he forces DJ to give him the diamond,  when Damian is revealed to be his prisoner.

Marvin is sent to place the blue monkey on an Acme satellite which will emit an energy beam around the world to turn everyone, except Mr. Chairman, into monkeys. DJ and Kate rescue Damian from a death trap, whilst Bugs and Daffy pursue Marvin into space. Bugs is incapacitated, prompting Daffy to become [[Duck Dodgers]], in order to destroy the blue monkey. The transforming energy beam only strikes Mr. Chairman, turning him into a monkey.

Bugs and Daffy return to Earth, where Daffy discovers the whole adventure was staged to make a film. However, Bugs promises Daffy they will be equal partners, but just as Daffy's luck seems to be improving, he is flattened by the Looney Tunes iris, where [[Porky Pig]] attempts to close the film with "That's all folks!" only for the studio to shut down before he can finish, and he tells the audience to go home.

==Production==
A follow-up to ''[[Space Jam]]'' was planned as early as the film's release. As development began, ''Space Jam 2'' was going to involve a new [[basketball]] competition between the Looney Tunes and a new villain named Berserk-O!. Artist [[Bob Camp]] was tasked with designing Berserk-O! and his henchmen. [[Joe Pytka]] would have returned to direct and [[Spike Brandt]] and [[Tony Cervone]] signed on as the animation supervisors. However, [[Michael Jordan]] did not agree to star in a sequel. According to Camp, a producer lied to design artists, claiming that Jordan had signed on in order to keep development going. Warner Bros. eventually canceled plans for ''Space Jam 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2012/artist-bob-camp-recalls-the-ill-fated-space-jam-2/ |title=Artist Bob Camp recalls the ill-fated "Space Jam 2" |publisher=Animated Views |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then re-entered development as ''Spy Jam'' and was to star [[Jackie Chan]]. Warner Bros. was also planning a film titled ''Race Jam'' which would have starred [[Jeff Gordon]]. Both projects were ultimately cancelled. Warner Bros. eventually asked [[Joe Dante]] to direct ''Back in Action'', having had previous success with ''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984) and ''[[Innerspace]]'' (1987). In the early 1990s, Dante wanted to produce a biographical comedy with [[HBO]], called ''Termite Terrace''. It centered around director [[Chuck Jones]]' early years at Warner Bros. in the 1930s. On the project, Dante recalled "It was a hilarious story and it was very good except that Warner Bros. said 'Look, it’s an old story. It’s got period stuff in it. We don’t want that. We want to rebrand our characters and we want to do ''Space Jam''.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zvbxrpl.blogspot.ca/2007/06/joe-dante-on-looney-tunes.html |title=Joe Dante on Looney Tunes |publisher=Something Old, Nothing New |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dante agreed to direct ''Back in Action'' as tribute to Jones. He and screenwriter [[Larry Doyle (writer)|Larry Doyle]] reportedly wanted the film to the "Anti-''Space Jam''" as Dante disliked how that film represented the ''Looney Tunes'' brand and personalities. Dante said "I was making a movie for them with those characters [''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''] and they did not want to know about those characters. They didn’t want to know why [[Bugs Bunny]] shouldn’t do hip-hop. It was a pretty grim experience all around." Warner Bros. hired [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]], most known for his fast-paced, Warner Bros.-inspired animation of the [[Genie (Disney character)|Genie]] in ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), to direct the animation.

On the film, Dante stated "It's a gagfest. Not having a particularly strong story, it just goes from gag to gag and location to location. It's not a particularly compelling narrative, but, of course, that's not where the charm of the movie is supposed to lie." On the subject of filming, Dante said "[W]e would shoot each scene three times. First we'd rehearse with a stand-in—a 'stuffy,' we called it. Then, we'd shoot the scene without anything in it; then, we'd shoot the scene again with this mirror ball in the shot which shows the computers where the light sources are. Then the animators would go to work and put characters into the frame. The problem with that movie came when the studio [executives] started to get tired of our jokes and wanted us to change them. But, of course, the animation is done to the voices and not the other way around. It was difficult trying to convince them that you don't just bring in 25 gag writers and try to write a joke that's short enough to put in somebody's mouth." Although the production had twenty-five gag writers, the film has only one credited writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sachs|first=Ben|title=The orgiast: an interview with Joe Dante (part one)|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/08/08/the-orgiast-an-interview-with-joe-dante-part-one|publisher=''[[Chicago Reader]]''|accessdate=February 13, 2016|date=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being directed by acknowledged fans of the original cartoons, Dante stated that he had no creative freedom on the project, and called it "the longest year and a half of my life." Dante felt that he and Goldberg managed to preserve the original personalities of the characters. However, the opening, middle, and end of the film are different from what Dante envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/11012/the_den_of_geek_interview_joe_dante.html |title=The Den of Geek interview: Joe Dante |publisher=Den of Geek |date=February 21, 2008 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg also provided the voices of [[Tweety]], [[Michigan J. Frog]], [[Marvin the Martian]] and [[Speedy Gonzales]]. [[Brendan Fraser]] provided the voice of the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tazmanian Devil]] and She-Devil, having impressed Dante with his Taz vocal impression.

==Soundtrack==
This was the final film scored by composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. Due to Goldsmith's failing health, the last reel of the film was actually scored by [[John Debney]], though Goldsmith was the only credited composer in marketing materials and the [[Varèse Sarabande]] soundtrack album only contains Goldsmith's music (although the first and last cues are adaptations of compositions heard in Warner Bros. cartoons). Debney receives an "Additional Music by" credit in the closing titles of the film and "Special Thanks" in the soundtrack album credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/looney_tunes.html ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''] soundtrack review at [[Filmtracks.com]]. Retrieved 2011-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith died in July 2004, eight months after the film's release.

==Reception==

===Commercial reception===
''Looney Tunes: Back in Action'' was released on November 14, 2003, originally planned to open earlier that summer. The film grossed $68.5 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimatedMovieGuide"/&gt;

Warner Bros. was hoping to start a revitalized franchise of ''Looney Tunes'' media and products with the success of ''Back in Action''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} New animated shorts and [[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|a ''Duck Dodgers'' TV series]] were commissioned to tie-in with ''Back in Action''. The film instead triggered Warner Bros. to release new TV projects in an effort to re-brand the ''Looney Tunes'' such as ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'' (2005–2007), ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' (2011–2014), and ''[[Wabbit (TV series)|Wabbit]]'' (2015–present).

===Critical response===
Critical response aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film an approval rating of 57% based on 134 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: "The plot is a nonsensical, hyperactive jumble and the gags are relatively uninspired compared to the classic ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons."&lt;ref name="Looney Tunes: Back in Action"/&gt; At [[Metacritic]], the film scored a 64/100, indicating "generally favorable reviews"&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' movie critics, [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Richard Roeper]], gave the film "Two Thumbs Up"; Roeper called it a "cheerful and self-referential romp blending animation with live action in a non-stop quest for silly laughs," while Ebert called it "goofy fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031114/REVIEWS/311140303/1023|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=October 29, 2012|date=November 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Animated Film]], [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Satellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature]].

==Home media release==
[[Warner Home Video]] released ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action'' on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on March 2, 2004.

'''Michelin Guides''' ({{Lang-fr|Guide Michelin}} {{IPA-fr|ɡid miʃ.lɛ̃|}}) are a series of guide books published by the French tire&lt;!-- European company, so British English --&gt; company {{lang|fr|[[Michelin]]}} for more than a century.

Michelin also publishes a series of general guides to cities, regions, and countries, the ''Green Guides''.

==History==
In 1900, there were fewer than 3,000 cars on the roads of France. To increase the demand for cars and, accordingly, car tires, car tire manufacturers and brothers [[Édouard Michelin (born 1859)|Édouard]] and [[André Michelin]] published a guide for French motorists in 1900, the Michelin Guide.&lt;ref name="hist1"&gt;Mayyasi, Alex [https://priceonomics.com/why-does-a-tire-company-publish-the-michelin-guide/ Why Does a Tyre Company Publish the Michelin Guide?] ''Pricenomics''. June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 35,000 copies of this first, free edition of the guide were distributed; it provided useful information to motorists, such as maps, tire repair and replacement instructions, car mechanics listings, hotels, and petrol stations throughout France.  

Four years later, in 1904, the brothers published a guide to Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505100337/http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/tpl/mag6/art200903/htm/tour-saga-michelin.htm "The Michelin Guide: 100 editions and over a century of history"] ViaMichelin, accessed 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bibendum-1911.jpg|thumb|1911 Michelin Guide to the [[British Isles]]]]

Michelin subsequently introduced guides for [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] (1907); the [[Alps]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[northern Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Bavaria]], and the [[Netherlands]]) (1908); [[Germany]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]] (1910); Ireland and the [[British Isles]] (1911); and "The Countries of the Sun" (''{{lang|fr|Les Pays du Soleil}}'') ([[Northern Africa]], [[Southern Italy]] and [[Corsica]]) (1911). In 1909, an English-language version of the guide to France was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.acgcm.com/guide_michelin.html "Le guide Michelin en quelques dates"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134653/http://www.acgcm.com/guide_michelin.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, Association des Collectionneurs de Guides et Cartes Michelin, accessed 19 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], publication of the guide was suspended. After the war, revised editions of the guide continued to be given away until 1920. It is said that André Michelin, whilst visiting a tire merchant, noticed copies of the guide being used to prop up a workbench. Based on the principle that "man only truly respects what he pays for", Michelin decided to charge a price for the guide, which was about 750 francs or $2.15 in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wertenbaker|first1=Charles|title=The Testing of M. Thuilier|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1954-06-05#folio=072|accessdate=1 July 2016|publisher=The New Yorker|date=5 June 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made several changes, notably listing restaurants by specific categories, adding hotel listings (initially only for Paris), and removing advertisements in the guide.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; Recognizing the growing popularity of the restaurant section of the guide, the brothers recruited a team of inspectors to visit and review restaurants, who were always anonymous.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;[http://www.beyond.fr/food/michelin-guide-history.html "Michelin Guide History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025504/http://www.beyond.fr/food/michelin-guide-history.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, Provence and Beyond, accessed 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the usage of the [[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers|Murray's]] and [[Baedeker Guides|Baedeker]] guides, the guide began to award [[Star (classification)|stars]] for fine dining establishments in 1926. Initially, there was only a single star awarded. Then, in 1931, the hierarchy of zero, one, two, and three stars was introduced. Finally, in 1936, the criteria for the starred rankings were published:&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

* {{Michelinstar gif|1}} : "A very good restaurant in its category" (''{{lang|fr|Une très bonne table dans sa catégorie}}'')
* {{Michelinstar gif|2}} : "Excellent cooking, worth a detour" (''{{lang|fr|Table excellente, mérite un détour}}'')
* {{Michelinstar gif|3}}: "Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey" (''{{lang|fr|Une des meilleures tables, vaut le voyage}}'').&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt;

In 1931 the cover of the guide was changed from blue to red, and has remained so in all subsequent editions.&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt; During [[World War II]], publication was again suspended, but in 1944, at the request of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], the 1939 guide to France was specially reprinted for military use; its maps were judged the best and most up-to-date available. Publication of the annual guide resumed on 16 May 1945, a week after [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]].&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

In the early post-war years the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard.&lt;ref&gt;"The Michelin Guide", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 28 March 1950, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956. It awarded no stars in the first edition. In 1974, the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published. Twenty-five stars were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Helen. "British Michelin revived", ''[[The Observer]]'' 24 March 1974, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Michelin published its first American guide, covering 500 restaurants in the five boroughs of [[New York City]] and 50 hotels in Manhattan. In 2007, a [[Tokyo]] Michelin Guide was launched. In the same year, the guide introduced a magazine, ''{{lang|fr|Étoile}}''. In 2008, a [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] volume was added.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; As of 2013, the guide is published in 14 editions covering 23 countries.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;

In 2008, the German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed editor-in-chief of the French edition of the guide. She had previously been responsible for the Michelin guides to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. She became the first woman and first non-French national to occupy the French position. The German newspaper ''{{lang|de|[[Die Welt]]}}'' commented on the appointment, "In view of the fact [[German cuisine]] is regarded as a lethal weapon in most parts of France, this decision is like Mercedes announcing that its new director of product development is a Martian."&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Tony.

==Methods and layout==
[[File:Dishes made by Michelin star restaurants.jpg|thumb|Dishes made by Michelin star restaurants]]
Red Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rival guides, relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each one in as little as two lines. Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialties. Short summaries (2–3 lines) were added in 2002/2003 to enhance descriptions of many establishments. These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published (though the [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] volume is in Spanish only) but the symbols are the same throughout all editions.&lt;ref&gt;Michelin Guide Great Britain &amp; Ireland (2000), Netherlands (2007), Benelux (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelin reviewers (commonly called "inspectors") are anonymous; they do not identify themselves, and their meals and expenses are paid for by Michelin, never by a restaurant being reviewed:
{{quote|Michelin has gone to extraordinary lengths to maintain the anonymity of its inspectors. Many of the company's top executives have never met an inspector; inspectors themselves are advised not to disclose their line of work, even to their parents (who might be tempted to boast about it); and, in all the years that it has been putting out the guide, Michelin has refused to allow its inspectors to speak to journalists. The inspectors write reports that are distilled, in annual "stars meetings" at the guide's various national offices, into the ranking of three stars, two stars, or one star—or no stars. (Establishments that Michelin deems unworthy of a visit are not included in the guide.)&lt;ref name=lunch&gt;Colapinta, John.

The French chef [[Paul Bocuse]], one of the pioneers of {{lang|fr|[[nouvelle cuisine]]}} in the 1960s, said, "Michelin is the only guide that counts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeoutkl.com/food/articles/Taste-test-Menu-by-three-star-Michelin-chef-Philippe-Marc "Taste test: Menu by three-star Michelin chef Philippe Marc"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115130231/http://www.timeoutkl.com/food/articles/Taste-test-Menu-by-three-star-Michelin-chef-Philippe-Marc |date=15 January 2013 }}, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]], Kuala Lumpur'' 20 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In France, when the guide is published each year, it sparks a media frenzy which has been compared to that for annual [[Academy Awards]] for films.&lt;ref name="lunch"/&gt; Media and others debate likely winners, speculation is rife, and TV and newspapers discuss which restaurant might lose, and who might gain a Michelin star.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/10/04/michelin-guide-in-new-york-city-three-stars-for-eleven-madison-park "Michelin Stars Align for Seven NYC Restaurants"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109181109/https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/10/04/michelin-guide-in-new-york-city-three-stars-for-eleven-madison-park |date=9 November 2016 }}, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 4 October 2011; [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/dining/kibo-opens-brooklyn-fare-gets-three-michelin-stars-off-the-menu.html "Off the Menu"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206174902/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/dining/kibo-opens-brooklyn-fare-gets-three-michelin-stars-off-the-menu.html |date=6 February 2016 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 October 2011; [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201111290082 "Tokyo retains title as Michelin's gourmet capital"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204080507/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201111290082 |date=4 December 2011 }}, ''The Asahi Shimbun'', 29 November 2011; and [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,785286,00.html "Taking the Pop-Up Restaurant to New Heights"], ''{{lang|de|Spiegel}} Online'', 19 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michelin Guide also awards Rising Stars, an indication that a restaurant has the potential to qualify for a star, or an additional star.

==={{lang|fr|Bib Gourmand}}===

Since 1955, the guide has also highlighted restaurants offering "exceptionally good food at moderate prices", a feature now called "{{lang|fr|Bib Gourmand}}". They must offer menu items priced below a maximum determined by local economic standards. {{lang|fr|Bib}} ({{lang|la|[[Bibendum]]}}) is the company's nickname for the [[Michelin Man]], its corporate logo for over a century.

===Non-restaurant food===
In 2014, Michelin introduced a separate listing for [[gastropub]]s in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Four Clare pubs listed in 2014 Michelin Guide |url=http://www.clarechampion.ie/four-clare-pubs-listed-2014-michelin-guide/ |newspaper=Clare Champion |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=4 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908085405/http://www.clarechampion.ie/four-clare-pubs-listed-2014-michelin-guide/ |archivedate=8 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Michelin Guide for Hong Kong and Macau introduced an overview of notable street food establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eater.com/2015/11/5/9674384/michelin-guide-hong-kong-street-food |title=Michelin Recognizes Street Food for the First Time in Its Hong Kong Guide |author=Adam H.

===Other ratings===
All listed restaurants, regardless of their star- or {{lang|fr|Bib Gourmand}}-status, also receive a "fork and spoon" designation, as a subjective reflection of the overall comfort and quality of the restaurant.&lt;ref name="michelinguide.com"&gt;[http://www.michelinguide.com/us/pdf/use_guide_2010.pdf How to Use This Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103233450/http://www.michelinguide.com/us/pdf/use_guide_2010.pdf |date=3 January 2011 }}, Michelin, accessed 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Rankings range from one to five: One fork and spoon represents a "comfortable restaurant" and five signifies a "luxurious restaurant". Forks and spoons colored red designate a restaurant that is considered "pleasant" as well.

Restaurants, independently of their other ratings in the guide, can also receive a number of other symbols next to their listing.

* ''Coins'' indicate restaurants that serve a menu for a certain price or less, depending on the local monetary standard.&lt;ref name="michelinguide.com"/&gt; In 2010 France, 2011 US and Japan Red Guides, the maximum permitted "coin" prices were [[€]]19, [[$]]25, and [[¥]]5000, respectively.
* ''Interesting view'' or ''Magnificent view'', designated by a black or red symbol, are given to restaurants offering those features.
* ''Grapes'', a ''[[sake set]]'', or a ''[[cocktail glass]]'' indicate restaurants that offer, at minimum, a "somewhat interesting" selection of wines, [[sake]], or [[cocktail]]s, respectively.&lt;ref name="michelinguide.com"/&gt;

==Green Guides==
The Michelin Green Guides review and rate attractions other than restaurants. There is a Green Guide for France as a whole, and a more detailed one for each of ten regions within France. Other Green Guides cover many countries, regions, and cities outside France. Many Green Guides are published in several languages. They include background information and an alphabetical section describing points of interest. Like the Red Guides, they use a three-star system for recommending sites ranging from "worth a trip" to "worth a detour", and "interesting".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Controversies==
===Allegations of lax inspection standards and bias===
[[Pascal Rémy]], a veteran France-based Michelin inspector, and also a former [[Gault Millau]] employee, wrote a tell-all book published in 2004 entitled ''[[L'Inspecteur se met à table]]'' (literally, "The Inspector Sits Down at the Table"; idiomatically, "The Inspector Spills the Beans", or "The Inspector Lays It All on the Table"). Rémy's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book.&lt;ref name="sage"&gt;Sage, Adam. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=102F005B5A132BA5&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "J'Accuse: Michelin cooks the books"], ''[[The Times]]'', 31 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He brought a court case for unfair dismissal, which was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Henley, John. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:GRDC&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10700C47EDAD28E6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "Michelin bean-spiller loses court battle"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Rémy described the French Michelin inspector's life as lonely, underpaid drudgery, driving around France for weeks on end, dining alone, under intense pressure to file detailed reports on strict deadlines. He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rémy said only about one visit every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five by the time he was fired in December 2003.&lt;ref name="sage"/&gt;

Rémy also accused the guide of favoritism. He alleged that Michelin treated famous and influential chefs, such as [[Paul Bocuse]] and [[Alain Ducasse]], as "untouchable" and not subject to the same rigorous standards as lesser-known chefs.&lt;ref name="sage"/&gt;  Michelin denied Rémy's charges, but refused to say how many inspectors it actually employed in France. In response to Rémy's statement that certain three-star chefs were sacrosanct, Michelin said, "There would be little sense in saying a restaurant was worth three stars if it weren't true, if for no other reason than that the customer would write and tell us."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/25/dining/michelin-man-jolts-french-food-world.html?pagewanted=all "Michelin Man Jolts French Food World"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of prejudice for French cuisine====
Some non-French food critics have alleged that the rating system is biased in favor of [[French cuisine]] or French dining standards. In the UK ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented in 1997 that "some people maintain the guide's principal purpose is as a tool of Gallic cultural imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;"Pass Notes", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 January 1997, p. A3&lt;/ref&gt;  When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that [[Danny Meyer]]'s [[Union Square Cafe]], a restaurant rated highly by ''The New York Times'', [[Zagat Survey]], and other prominent guides, received a no star-rating from Michelin. (He did acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambiance, and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars). Kurutz also claimed the guide appeared to favor restaurants that "emphasized formality and presentation" rather than a "casual approach to fine dining". He also claimed that over half of the restaurants that received one or two stars "could be considered French".&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;Kurutz, Steven. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/nyregion/thecity/13cafe.html "She's a Belle of the City, but the French are Blasé"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Michelin Guide New York 2007 included 526 restaurants, compared to 2,014 in Zagat New York 2007; after [[The Four Seasons Restaurant]] received no stars in that edition, co-owner [[Julian Niccolini]] said Michelin "should stay in [[France]], and they should keep their guide there".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Priscilla Parkhurst |date=2008-02-01|title=Michelin in America |url=http://gcfs.ucpress.edu/content/8/1/49|journal=Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies |volume=8|issue=1|pages=49–55|doi=10.1525/gfc.2008.8.1.49|issn=1529-3262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 guide does, however, include menus, recipes, and photographs, and description of the atmosphere of starred restaurants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Allegations of leniency with stars for Japanese cuisine====
In 2010 Michelin guides ranked Japan as the country with the most starred restaurants. This sparked questioning over whether these high ratings were merited for Japanese restaurants, or whether the Michelin guide was too generous in giving out stars to gain an acceptance with Japanese customers and to enable the parent tire-selling company to market itself in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Gwen. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:FINB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12B56B4C3A6ED4F0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "Michelin serves up stars and stirs envy in Japan"], ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 14 October 2009; and Robinson, Gwen.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303738504575568442015009552 "Michelin Stars Draw Shots"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 25 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unwanted stars===
Some restaurateurs have asked Michelin to revoke a star, because they felt that it created undesirable customer expectations or pressure to spend more on service and decor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2064554 |title=Expert Opinion and Quality Perception of Consumers: Evidence from New York City Restaurants |last1=Gergaud |first1=Olivier |last2=Storchmann |first2=Karl |last3=Verardi |first3=Vincenzo |date=22 May 2012 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2064554 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases:
* {{lang|es|Casa Julio}} ({{lang|es|Fontanars dels Alforins}}, Spain): After receiving a star for a perfumed cuisine in 2009, the restaurant chef Julio Biosca felt the award was granted to dishes that he did not like and restricted his creativity, and tried to remove his star and in December 2013, discontinued his tasting menu. The removal took place in the 2015 guide.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2014/12/11/michelin-star-restaurants-down-side/|title=The curse of the Michelin-star restaurant rating |author=Ian Mount |date=11 December 2014 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/12/02/inenglish/1417521188_192723.html |title=The chef who gave up his Michelin star |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[El País]] |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petersham Nurseries Café (London): After receiving a star in 2011, founder and chef [[Skye Gyngell]] received complaints from customers expecting formal dining, leading to her attempt to remove the star, and subsequent retirement from the restaurant. She has now said she regrets her remarks and would welcome a star.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9094386/Skye-Gyngell-curse-of-the-Michelin-star-has-driven-me-out-of-the-kitchen.html |title=Skye Gyngell: curse of the Michelin star has driven me out of the kitchen |date=21 February 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/international/art/20120222/16091504 |title=摘星變詛咒　難耐食客投訴不絕 女廚棄米芝蓮榮耀 - 蘋果日報 - 兩岸國際 - 20120222 |work=Apple Daily 蘋果日報 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [['t Huis van Lede]] (Belgium): After receiving a star in 2014, chef Frederick Dhooge said he did not want his Michelin star or his points in the Gault-Millau restaurant guide because some customers were not interested in simple food from a Michelin-starred restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eater.com/2014/3/13/6264733/chef-in-belgium-gives-back-his-michelin-star |title=Chef in Belgium Gives Back His Michelin Star |author=Hillary Dixler |date=13 March 2014 |work=Eater |accessdate=2 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable mistakes===
* In 2017, the Bouche à Oreille café in [[Bourges]] was accidentally given a star when it was confused with a restaurant of the same name in [[Boutervilliers]], near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/workmens-cafe-overwhelmed-customers-accidentally-given-michelin/ |title=Workmen's cafe overwhelmed with customers after it is accidentally awarded a Michelin star |date=18 February 2017 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clubsandwich.konbini.com/news/quand-un-bistrot-de-quartier-recoit-par-erreur-une-etoile-au-michelin/ |title=Quand un bistrot de quartier reçoit par erreur une étoile au Michelin |date=17 February 2017 |work=[[Konbini (company)|Konbini]] |accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:oldway dusk.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The southern elevation of Oldway Mansion at dusk]]
'''Oldway Mansion''' is a large house and gardens in [[Paignton]], Devon, England. It was built as a private residence for [[Isaac Merritt Singer]] (1811–1875), and rebuilt by his third son Paris Singer in the style of the [[Palace of Versailles]].

==History==
===19th century===
Around 1871 the Fernham estate in Paignton was purchased by [[Isaac Singer]], the founder of the [[Singer Sewing Machine]] Company. The old buildings on the site were demolished and he commissioned a local architect, George Soudon Bridgman, to build a new mansion as his home. As part of the designs, Singer instructed Bridgman to build a theatre within the house. Bridgman was at that time being apprenticed by a young [[Frank Matcham]] who had just returned from London where he had been studying architecture in a surveyors office.&lt;ref name="GG44-49"&gt;"Growing Up On The English Riviera" by Gorel Garlick; Wilmore, pp. 44–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In an edition of ''The Builder'', dated 1873, Matcham was named in the [[request for tender]] section as being the accepted party to work alongside Bridgman on the Oldway Mansion project.&lt;ref&gt;"Tenders", ''The Builder'', 1 March 1873, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural historian Gorel Garlick considers it entirely possible that Matcham was given sole responsibility by Bridgman for the theatre's design because of his educational experiences in London.&lt;ref name="GG44-49"/&gt; Singer spared no cost in terms of Oldway Mansion's construction; he sourced the finest materials from around the world and instructed Bridgman to design the interior in exuberant French style. Garlick notes that it was highly likely that Singer's exuberance would have influenced someone as architecturally impressionable as Matcham whose later theatres used such extravagant decoration.&lt;ref name="GG44-49" /&gt; The work was completed in 1873&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse&gt;{{NHLE|num=1195207|desc=Oldway Mansion (house)|access-date=2 October 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer died on 23 July 1875, shortly before work on the original mansion was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac-Merritt-Singer|title=Isaac Merritt Singer|work=Britannica|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris Eugene Singer, Isaac Singer's third son, supervised the alterations at Oldway Mansion between 1904 and 1907.{{sfn|Gray|1995|p=171}} The rebuilding work was modelled on the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt; and the eastern elevation of the building was inspired by the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=NHLEGarden&gt;{{NHLE|num=1001368|desc=Oldway Mansion (park and garden)|access-date=2 October 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the building is noted for its grand staircase made from [[marble]] and [[baluster]]s of [[bronze]].&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt; The ceiling of the staircase is decorated with an ornate painting based on an original design for the Palace of Versailles for [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] by the French painter and architect [[Charles Le Brun]].&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt;

Above the grand staircase there is a reproduction of the first version of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''The Crowning of Josephine by Napoleon.''.&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt; The original was purchased by Paris Singer in the late 19th century. The painting was sold to the French government in 1946 and now hangs in the [[Palace of Versailles]].{{sfn|Winn|2005|p=64}}&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt; The reproduction at the mansion, which is in the same place as the original, is a copy made by Rutters Scanachrome and was unveiled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8wETAQAAMAAJ|title=The Museums journal|volume=97|p=6|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery on the first floor is a reproduction of the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and is floored in [[parquet]].&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt; The gallery leads into the ballroom, which contains walls of [[gilding|gilt]] panelling and mirrors. Above the fireplace there is an oil painting of Louis of Bourbon dating from 1717.&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt;

Oldway Mansion is set in {{convert|17|acre|m2}} of gardens, which are laid out on an Italian theme by the French landscape gardener Achille Duchesne.&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt; Beneath the eastern elevation of the building is the maze, which consists of dwarf [[buxus|box]] hedging and flower beds. To the south of the mansion there is the [[grotto]] garden where a waterfall passes over a rocky cave into a pool below. The grounds of the mansion contain many [[sub-tropical]] plants and shrubs.&lt;ref name=NHLEGarden/&gt;

Opposite the main entrance to the mansion is a large round building known as The Rotunda. This was built in 1873, and was used originally as a horse riding pavilion and exercise area. Isaac Merritt Singer gave this building the nickname of "The Wigwam".{{sfn|Fort|2015|p=260}}

===20th century===
Following the end of an affair with the dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] in 1917, Paris Singer became an American citizen and went to live in the United States. This was done partly for tax reasons, and after 1918 Oldway Mansion was no longer the permanent home of the Singer family.{{sfn|Rea|2016|p=97}}

During the period of the [[First World War]] from 1914 to 1918, Oldway Mansion was transformed into the American Women's War Relief Hospital.{{sfn|Gray|1995|p=171}} The Rotunda was converted to house rows of beds for the wounded soldiers being brought back to England from the trenches of France and [[Belgium]].{{sfn|Rea|2016|p=96}} [[George V of England|King George V]] visited the mansion in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/coped-victims-slaughter/story-20715517-detail/story.html|title=Bygones : How we coped with victims of slaughter|work=Torquay Herald Express|date=2 March 2014|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldway Mansion became the Torbay Country Club in 1929.{{sfn|Rea|2016|p=97}} During this period tennis courts and a [[lawn bowls|bowling green]] were added to the grounds.{{sfn|Fort|2015|p=261}}

Torbay Golf &amp; Country Club opened in 1933. Oldway Mansion was used as the club house, with the course in the hills above the Mansion. The course closed in the mid 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php/england/south-west/devon/1007-dev-torbay-golf-a-country-club-shorton-road-paignton Torbay Golf &amp; Country Club], "Golf's Missing Links".

During the [[Second World War]] from 1939 to 1945, Oldway was used in the war effort by housing [[RAF]] cadets training to be aircrew.{{sfn|Gray|1995|p=171}} In 1943, Oldway was damaged in an air raid, along with many other buildings in Paignton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/1943-bomber-photo-taken-day-devastation-torquay/story-16846880-detail/story.html|title=1943 bomber photo taken on day of devastation for Torquay|work=Torquay Herald Express|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paignton Urban District Council purchased Oldway Mansion from the Singer family in 1946 for £46,000.{{sfn|Poulton-Smith|2013|p=53}} It is estimated that around £200,000 was spent on building the mansion.  Until 2013, the building was used as council offices and for civil marriage ceremonies. Oldway Mansion has been a Grade II* [[listed building]] since 1993.&lt;ref name=NHLEHouse/&gt;

In January 2007, Torbay Council announced that it was considering selling the mansion as it had become too expensive to maintain. The suggestion was controversial, since local residents argued that the mansion was sold at a reduced price on the understanding that it would be open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6309337.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anger over plans to sell mansion | date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2012, plans for Oldway Mansion to be converted into a luxury hotel and sheltered retirement flats were approved by Torbay Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =£12million Oldway plans approved|date= 30 April 2012 | work =Herald Express  | url =http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/BREAKING-NEWS-12million-Oldway-plans-approved/story-15960294-detail/story.html|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was finalised in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Delight as £12m Paignton Oldway deal is signed to herald new beginning|date= 27 September 2012 | work =Herald Express  | url =http://www.thisissouthdevon.co.uk/Delight-pound-12m-Paignton-Oldway-deal-signed/story-16989899-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, it was reported that the property developer Akkeron had filed a claim for more than £8 million in damages against Torbay Council, due to a dispute over the [[lease]]s which it said had caused a delay in starting work on the redevelopment. Torbay Council rejected the claim and said that it would defend the allegations "robustly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/Oldway-Mansion-s-going-court/story-28607490-detail/story.html| work=Herald Express |first=Tina|last=Crowson|title=Oldway Mansion: now it's going to court| date=26 January 2016|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/first-stage-in-pound-8m-court-wrangle-over-oldway/story-29452969-detail/story.html| work=Herald Express|title=First stage in £8m court wrangle over Oldway Mansion| date=2 July 2016|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2016, it was reported that the agreement between Torbay Council and Akkeron to develop the mansion had been terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/breaking-developers-pull-out-of-oldway-mansion-proejct/story-29621511-detail/story.html| work=Herald Express|title=Developers pull out of Oldway Mansion project|first=Tina|last=Crowson| date=15 August 2016|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Oldway Mansion has been used as a film location on several occasions.  During the spring of 2004, it doubled as [[Buckingham Palace]] for the filming of ''[[Churchill: The Hollywood Years]]'', starring [[Christian Slater]] and [[Neve Campbell]].  Pink gravel, guard houses and period vehicles were used to recreate the royal courtyard.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359078/|title=Churchill: The Hollywood Years|date=3 December 2004|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1968 film ''[[Isadora]]'' starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and telling the life story of the dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] also used Oldway Mansion as one of its locations.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;
On 21 December 2005, the ballroom at Oldway Mansion was the location for Devon's first civil partnership. The registration was officially witnessed by the Mayor of Torbay and his dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4549260.stm "Gay couples among first to 'wed'"], ''BBC News''. 21 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Proclamation of Independence of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]''' ({{lang-vi|Tuyên ngôn độc lập Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa}})&lt;!--, after independence from Japan and France,--&gt; was written by [[Hồ Chí Minh]], and announced in public at the Ba Đình flower garden (now the [[Ba Đình Square]]) on September 2, 1945. It led to the independence of [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnam]].

==History==
[[File:Ho Chi Minh reading the Declaration of Independence in Ba Dinh Square.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|[[Hồ Chí Minh]] reading the Proclamation of Independence in [[Ba Đình Square]].]]

Vietnam became a colony of [[France]] in the late 19th century, but during [[World War II]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] occupied Vietnam. During this period the [[Viet Minh]] fought a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the Japanese and were to a degree supported by the Americans in 1945 via the [[Office of Strategic Services]].

On August 22, 1945 the OSS agent [[Archimedes Patti]], who had previously met [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Southern China arrived in Hanoi on a mercy mission to liberate allied POWs and were accompanied by [[Jean Sainteny]] a French government official.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Carleton Swift, 1981, http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-9dc948-interview-with-carleton-swift&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese forces informally surrendered (the official surrender took place on Sept. 2, 1945 in Tokyo Bay) but being the only force capable of maintaining law and order the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] remained in power while keeping French colonial troops detained.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart-Fox, Martin. A History of Laos. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997, http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japansurrender.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese forces allowed the Việt Minh and other nationalist groups to take over public buildings and weapons without resistance, which began the [[August Revolution]]. On the morning of August 26, 1945, at No. 48 Hàng Ngang, [[Hà Nội]], chairman Hồ Chí Minh had called and presided over the meeting of the Central Standing [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]. In the decisions made at this meeting, the Standing unanimously prepared to proclaim independence and organized a large meeting in Hà Nội for the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of Vietnam (August 1945)|Provisional Government]] to present itself to the people, also the day that Vietnam officially promulgated the right of freedom and established the democratic republic system.

On August 30, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh invited several people to contribute their ideas toward his Proclamation of Independence. OSS officers met repeatedly with [[Ho Chi Minh]] and other [[Viet Minh]] officers during late August and [[Archimedes Patti]] claims to have listened to Ho read to him a draft of the Proclamation which he believed sounded very similar to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Archimedes L. A. Patti, 1981, http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-bf3262-interview-with-archimedes-l-a-patti-1981&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh read the Proclamation during a public meeting in front of thousands of people, at what is now [[Ba Đình Square]], Hà Nội, announcing the birth of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and the country's independence from France.

==Original==
{{Copy to Wikisource|date=September 2012}}
{{quote|Compatriots of the entire nation assembled:&lt;br&gt;
''All men are created equal; they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness''.&lt;br&gt;
This immortal statement was made in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.&lt;br&gt; 
The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] of the [[French Revolution]] made in 1791 also states: ''All men are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free and have equal rights''.&lt;br&gt;
Those are undeniable truths. &lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, in the name of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice.&lt;br&gt;
In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty.&lt;br&gt;
They have enforced inhuman laws; they have set up three distinct political regimes in the North, Center, and South of Vietnam in order to destroy our national unity and prevent our people from being united.&lt;br&gt;
They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slaughtered our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in bloodbaths. &lt;br&gt;
They have fettered public opinion; they have practiced obscurantism against our people. &lt;br&gt;
To weaken our race they have forced us to use [[opium]] and [[alcohol]].&lt;br&gt;
In the field of economics, they have fleeced us to the backbone, impoverished our people and devastated our land. &lt;br&gt;
They have robbed us of our [[rice field]]s, our [[Mining|mines]], our [[forest]]s, and our [[raw material]]s. They have monopolized the issuing of [[bank note]]s and the [[export trade]]. &lt;br&gt;
They have invented numerous unjustifiable [[tax]]es and reduced our people, especially our peasantry, to a state of extreme poverty.&lt;br&gt;
They have hampered the prospering of our national [[bourgeoisie]]; they have mercilessly exploited our [[Proletariat|worker]]s. &lt;br&gt;
In the autumn of 1940, when the Japanese [[fascist]]s violated [[Indochina]]'s territory to establish new bases in their fight against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and handed over our country to them. Thus, from that date, our people were subjected to the double yoke of the French and the Japanese. Their sufferings and miseries increased. The result was that, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, from [[Quảng Trị Province]] to [[Tonkin|northern Vietnam]], more than two million of our fellow citizens died from [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945|starvation]].&lt;br&gt;
On March 9 [1945], the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese. The French colonialists either fled or surrendered, showing that not only were they incapable of "protecting" us, but that, in the span of five years, they had twice sold our country to the Japanese.&lt;br&gt;
On several occasions before March 9, the [[Việt Minh|Việt Minh League]] urged the French to ally themselves with it against the Japanese. Instead of agreeing to this proposal, the French colonialists so intensified their terrorist activities against the Việt Minh members that before fleeing they massacred a great number of our political prisoners detained at [[Yên Bái]] and [[Cao Bằng]].&lt;br&gt;
Notwithstanding all this, our fellow citizens have always manifested toward the French a tolerant and humane attitude. Even after the Japanese Putsch of March 1945, the Việt Minh League helped many Frenchmen to cross the frontier, rescued some of them from Japanese jails, and protected French lives and property.&lt;br&gt;
From the autumn of 1940, our country had in fact ceased to be a French colony and had become a Japanese possession. After the Japanese had surrendered to the Allies, our whole people rose to regain our national sovereignty and to found the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.&lt;br&gt;
The truth is that we have wrested our independence from the Japanese and not from the French.&lt;br&gt;
The French have fled, the Japanese have capitulated, Emperor [[Bảo Đại]] has abdicated. Our people have broken the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for the Fatherland. Our people at the same time have overthrown the monarchic regime that has reigned supreme for dozens of centuries. In its place has been established the present [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Democratic Republic]].&lt;br&gt;
For these reasons, we, the members of the Provisional Government, representing the whole Vietnamese people, declare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with France; we repeal all the international obligation that France has so far subscribed to on behalf of Viet-Nam, and we abolish all the special rights the French have unlawfully acquired in our Fatherland.&lt;br&gt;
The whole Vietnamese people, animated by a common purpose, are determined to fight to the bitter end against any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer the country.&lt;br&gt;
We are convinced that the Allied nations, which at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Treaty of San Francisco|San Francisco]] have acknowledged the principles of self-determination and equality of nations, will not refuse to acknowledge the independence of Vietnam.&lt;br&gt;
A people who have courageously opposed French domination for more than eighty years, a people who have fought side by side with the Allies against the fascists during these last years, such a people must be free and independent!&lt;br&gt;
For these reasons, we, the members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that:&lt;br&gt;
''Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country—and in fact it is so already. And thus the entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty.''}}

'''''R v Soqokomashe'''''&lt;ref&gt;1956 (2) SA 142 (E).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]], heard in the Eastern Districts Local Division by Price JP and Jennett J on 2 March 1956, with judgment handed down on 9 March.

== Facts ==
The appellants had pleaded guilty to a charge of [[arson]], it being alleged that they had set fire to a rondavel classroom of a "native" school. The Crown evidence showed that the structure was [[immovable property|immovable]], but that there was no evidence to prove that it had been burned intentionally.

== Judgment ==
In an appeal from convictions in a magistrate's court, the court held that, as long as an accidental burning had not been excluded by the evidence as a reasonable possibility, it could not be said that it had been proved ''aliunde'' beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime had been committed. The court held further that the case should not be remitted for further evidence.

The '''Rexist Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti Rexiste}}), or simply '''Rex''', was a far-right [[political Catholicism|Catholic]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[corporatism|corporatist]] political party active in [[Belgium]] from 1935 until 1945. The party was founded by a journalist, [[Léon Degrelle]], and, unlike other fascist parties in the Belgium of the time, advocated [[Belgian nationalism|Belgian unitarism]] and [[royalism]]. Initially the party ran in both [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] but never achieved much success outside Wallonia and [[Brussels]]. Its name was derived from the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] journal and publishing company ''Christus Rex'' ([[Latin]] for [[Christ the King]]).

The highest point that the Rexist party had achieved was its success on sending 21 out of 202 deputies (with 11.4% of the vote) and twelve senators in the [[Belgian general election, 1936|1936 election]].&lt;ref name="Richard Bonney pp. 175-176"&gt;Richard Bonney ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936–1939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 {{ISBN|978-3-03911-904-2}}; pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Never a mass movement, it was on the decline by 1938. During the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in [[World War II]], Rex was the largest collaborationist group in French-speaking Belgium, paralleled by the ''[[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]]'' (VNV) in Flanders. By the end of the war Rex was widely discredited, and was banned following the liberation.

Initially modelled on [[Italian Fascism]] and [[Falange|Spanish Falangism]], it later drew closer to German [[Nazism]]. The Party espoused a "right-wing revolution" and the dominance of the [[Roman Catholicism in Belgium|Catholic Church in Belgium]],&lt;ref name=SP112&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gerard|editor1-first=Emmanuel|editor2-last=Van Nieuwenhuyse|editor2-first=Karel|title=Scripta Politica: Politieke Geschiedenis van België in Documenten (1918–2008)|year=2010|publisher=Acco|location=Leuven|isbn=9789033480393|page=112|edition=2e herwerkte dr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its ideology came to be vigorously opposed by the leader of the Belgian Church [[Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey|Cardinal van Roey]], who called Rexism a "danger to the church and to the country".&lt;ref name="Richard Bonney pp. 175-176"/&gt;

==Ideology==
The ideology of Rex, which was loosely based on the writings of [[Jean Denis (politician)|Jean Denis]], called for the "moral renewal" of Belgian society through dominance of the Catholic Church, by forming a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] society and abolishing [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="Brustein 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Brustein |title=The Case of Rexism |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denis became an enthusiastic member of Rex and later wrote for the party newspaper, ''[[Le Pays Réel]]''. The original programme of Rexism borrowed strongly from [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralism]]. It rejected [[liberalism]] which it deemed decadent and was strongly opposed to both [[Marxism]] and [[capitalism]], instead striving for a corporatist economic model, idealising rural life and traditional [[family values]].&lt;ref name="Griffin132"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Roger |last=Griffin |author-link=Roger Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Pinter |year=1991 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early period — until around 1937 — Rexism cannot accurately be categorised as a fascist movement. Rather it was a [[populism|populist]],&lt;ref name="Griffin132"/&gt; authoritarian and conservative Catholic nationalist movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jean-Michel |last=Étienne |title=Le mouvement Rexiste jusqu'en 1940 |publisher=Armand Colin |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; that initially tried to win power by democratic means, and did not want to totally abolish democratic institutions. The party increasingly made use of fascist-style rhetoric, but it was only after Degrelle's own defeat in a by-election in April 1937 that it openly embraced [[anti-Semitism]] and anti-parliamentarism, following the model of German [[Nazism]]. The historian and fascism expert [[Roger Griffin]] only considers the Rexist Party during the German occupation of Belgium as "fully fascist", until then he considers it "[[proto-fascism|proto-fascist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Roger |last=Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Pinter |year=1991 |pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rexist movement attracted support almost exclusively from Wallonia. On 6 October 1936 Degrelle made a secret agreement with ''Rex'''s [[Flanders|Flemish]] counterpart, the ''[[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]]'' (VNV; "Flemish National Union") led by [[Staf De Clercq]].&lt;ref name=SP119&gt;''Geheim akkoord tussen Rex en VNV'' quoted in {{cite book|editor1-last=Gerard|editor1-first=Emmanuel|editor2-last=Van Nieuwenhuyse|editor2-first=Karel|title=Scripta Politica: Politieke Geschiedenis van België in Documenten (1918–2008)|year=2010|publisher=Acco|location=Leuven|isbn=9789033480393|pages=119–20|edition=2nd revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements strove for a corporatist system, but unlike the Rexists, the VNV sought to separate Flanders from Belgium and to unite it with the [[Netherlands]]. The Flemish side cancelled the agreement after just one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Giovanni |last=Capoccia |title=Defending Democracy: Reactions to Extremism in Interwar Europe |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2005 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also faced competition from the ideologically similar (but explicitly anti-German) ''Légion Nationale'' ("National Legion") of [[Paul Hoornaert]].

==Pre-war politics==
The Rexist Party was founded in 1935 after its leader Léon Degrelle had left the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] which he deemed too moderate. It targeted disappointed constituencies such as traditionalist Catholics, veterans, small traders and jobless people. In the [[Great Depression|Depression]] era, it initially won considerable popularity—mostly due to its leader's charismatic appearance. Its greatest success was when it won 11.5% of the votes in the [[Belgian general election, 1936|1936 election]].&lt;ref name="WorldFasc_86"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Bruno |last=De Wever |chapter=Belgium |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Rexist Party could take 21 of the 202 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 8 out of 101 in the Senate, making it the fourth-strongest force in Parliament, behind the major established parties (Labour, Catholic, Liberal). However, the support for the party was extremely localized: Rexists succeeded in garnering over 30 per cent of the vote in the French-speaking [[Luxembourg (province)|province of Luxembourg]], compared with just 9 per cent in equally French-speaking Hainaut.&lt;ref name="Brustein 1988"/&gt; Degrelle admired [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power and progressively imitated the tone and style of fascist campaigning, while the movement's ties to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were increasingly repudiated by the Belgian clergy. Rexism received subsidies from both Hitler and Mussolini.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Degrelle ran in the April 1937 Brussels by-election against Prime Minister [[Paul van Zeeland]] of the Catholic Party, who was—to avoid victory of the Rexists—supported by all other parties, including even the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Robert O. |last=Paxton |title=The Anatomy of Fascism |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2004 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels|Archbishop of Mechelen]] and primate of the Catholic Church of Belgium, [[Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey]] intervened, rebuking Rexist voters and calling Rexism "a danger to the country and to the Church". Degrelle was decisively defeated: he lost by 20 to 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bonney ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936–1939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 {{ISBN|978-3-03911-904-2}}; pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Rexism allied itself with the interests of [[Nazi Germany]] even more strongly and incorporated [[Nazism|Nazi]]-style [[antisemitism]] into its platform. At the same time, its popularity declined sharply.&lt;ref name=diMuro151-3&gt;{{cite book|last=di Muro|first=Giovanni F.|title=Léon Degrelle et l'aventure rexiste|year=2005|publisher=Pire|location=Bruxelles|isbn=2874155195|pages=151–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Belgian general election, 1939|1939 election]], Rex's share of votes fell to 4.4% and the party lost 17 of its 21 seats, largely to the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic]] and [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal parties]].&lt;ref name=diMuro151-3/&gt;

==Second World War==
{{Fascism sidebar}}
With the [[Belgium in World War II#18 days' campaign|German invasion of Belgium]] in 1940, Rexism welcomed German occupation, even though it had initially supported the pre-war Belgian policy of neutrality.&lt;ref name=diMuro160-1&gt;{{cite book|last=di Muro|first=Giovanni F.|title=Léon Degrelle et l'aventure rexiste|year=2005|publisher=Pire|location=Bruxelles|isbn=2874155195|pages=160–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some former Rexists went into the underground resistance or (like [[José Streel]]) withdrew from politics after they had come to see the Nazis' anticlerical and extreme anti-Semitic policies enforced in occupied Belgium, most Rexists, however, proudly supported the occupiers and assisted German forces with the repression of the territory wherever they could.&lt;ref name=diMuro160-1/&gt; Nevertheless, the popularity of Rex continued to drop. In 1941, at a reunion in [[Liège (city)|Liège]], Degrelle was booed by about a hundred demonstrators.&lt;ref name=diMuro160-1/&gt;

In August 1944, Rexist militia were responsible for the [[Courcelles Massacre]].

===Collaboration===
Closely affiliated with Rex was the ''[[5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien|Légion Wallonie]]'', a [[paramilitary]] organization which later became the "Wallonien" Division of the [[Waffen SS]]. After [[Operation Barbarossa]] started, the Légion Wallonie and its Flemish counterpart, the ''[[6th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Langemarck|Legion Flandern]]'' sent respectively 25,000 and 15,000 volunteers to fight against the [[Soviet Union]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. Degrelle took command of the Wallonien division, where he fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Whilst Degrelle was absent, nominal leadership of the party passed to [[Victor Matthys]].

==End of Rexism==
From the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the party had been banned. With the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, many former Rexists were imprisoned or executed for their role during collaboration. [[Victor Matthys]] and [[José Streel]] were both executed by firing squad, [[Jean Denis (politician)|Jean Denis]] (who had played only a minor role during the war) was imprisoned.

Degrelle took refuge in [[Francoist Spain]]. He was convicted of [[treason]] ''in absentia'' in Belgium and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], but repeated requests to [[extradition|extradite]] him were turned down by the Spanish government. Stripped of his citizenship and excommunicated (later lifted in Germany), Degrelle died in [[Málaga]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Domenico|first=Roy P.

'''SPIN''' (Searchable Physics Information Notices) '''bibliographic database''' is an indexing and abstracting service produced by the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP). The content focus of SPIN is described as the most significant areas of [[physics]] [[research]]. This type of [[scientific literature|literature coverage]] spans the major [[scientific journal|physical science journals]] and magazines. Major [[conference proceedings]] that are reported by the American Institute of Physics, member societies, as well as affiliated organizations are also included as part of this database. References, or citations, provide access to more than 1.5 million articles as of 2010. ''SPIN''  has no print counterpart.&lt;ref name=DialogSpin/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIP-SPIN/&gt;

==Journals==
Delivery of timely indexing and abstracting is for, what are deemed to be, the significant or important [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] journals from the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and the [[Ukraine]]. Citations for journal articles are derived from original publications of the ''AIP'', which includes published translated works. At the same time, citations are included from member societies, and selectively chosen American journals. Citations become typically available online on the same date as the corresponding journal article.&lt;ref name=DialogSpin/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIP-SPIN&gt; {{Cite web

==Sources==
Overall, the source citations are derived from material published by the AIP and member societies,  which are English-speaking, Russian, and Ukrainian journals and conference proceedings. Certain American physics-related articles are also sources of citations. About 60 journals have cover to cover indexing, and about 100 journals, overall, are indexed.&lt;ref name=DialogSpin/&gt;&lt;ref name=pub-coverage&gt;{{Cite web

'''Scopus''' is [[Elsevier]]’s [[abstract and citation database]] launched in 2004. Scopus covers nearly 36,377 titles (22,794 active titles and 13,583 Inactive titles) from approximately 11,678 publishers, of which 34,346 are [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals in top-level subject fields: [[life sciences]], [[social sciences]], [[physical sciences]] and [[health sciences]]. It covers three types of sources: [[book series]], [[Academic journal|journals]], and [[trade journals]]. All journals covered in the Scopus database, regardless of who they are published under, are reviewed each year to ensure high quality standards are maintained. The complete list is on the [[SCImago Journal Rank]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scimagojr.com/|title=Scimago Journal &amp; Country Rank|website=www.scimagojr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searches in Scopus also incorporate searches of patent databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1307 |title=Comparisons of Citations in Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for Articles Published in General Medical Journals |year=2009 |last1=Kulkarni |first1=A.

W. |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=302 |issue=10 |pages=1092–6 |pmid=19738094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scopus gives four types of quality measure for each title; those are [[h-index|''h''-Index]], [[CiteScore]], SJR ([[SCImago Journal Rank]]) and SNIP ([[Source Normalized Impact per Paper]]).

==Overview==
Evaluating ease of use and coverage of Scopus and the [[Web of Science]] (WOS), a 2006 study concluded that "Scopus is easy to navigate, even for the novice user. ... The ability to search both forward and backward from a particular citation would be very helpful to the researcher. The multidisciplinary aspect allows the researcher to easily search outside of his discipline" and "One advantage of WOS over Scopus is the depth of coverage, with the full WOS database going back to 1945 and Scopus going back to 1966. However, Scopus and WOS complement each other as neither resource is all inclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16522216 |year=2006 |last1=Burnham |first1=JF |title=Scopus database: A review |volume=3 |pages=1 |doi=10.1186/1742-5581-3-1 |pmc=1420322 |journal=Biomedical Digital Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scopus also offers author profiles which cover affiliations, number of publications and their [[bibliographic]] data, [[references]], and details on the number of citations each published document has received. It has [[alerts|alerting]] features that allows registered users to track changes to a profile and a facility to calculate authors' [[h-index|''h''-index]]. In 2016, a free website, Scopus CiteScore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/sources|title=Sources|website=Scopus}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced. It provides citation data for all 25,000+ active titles such as journals, conference proceedings and books in Scopus and provides an alternative to the [[impact factor]].

Scopus IDs for individual authors can be integrated with the non-proprietary digital identifier [[ORCID]].&lt;ref name="Scopus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.scopusfeedback.com |title=Scopus2Orcid |publisher=Scopus |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content selection and advisory board ==
Since Elsevier is the owner of Scopus and is also one of the main international publishers of scientific journals, an independent and international Scopus Content Selection and Advisory Board was established in 2009 to prevent a potential conflict of interest in the choice of journals to be included in the database and to maintain an open and transparent content coverage policy, regardless of publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus/content-overview#content-policy-and-selection |title=Scopus Content Overview: Content Policy and Selection |work=Scopus Info |publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board consists of scientists and subject librarians.

He was born on September 1, 1898 to [[Grace Millard Knox]] (1862–1936) and [[Seymour H. Knox I]] (1861–1915), who merged his chain of [[Five and dime|five-and-dime stores]] with those of his first cousins, [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]] and Charles Woolworth, to form the [[F. W.

*Dorothy Virginia Knox (1896-1980), who in 1915 married [[Charles W. Goodyear|Frank H. Goodyear Jr.]] (1891-1930). In 1931, after Goodyear's death, she married Edmund Pendleton Rogers (1882-1966)
*Seymour Horace Knox II (1898-1990)
*Marjorie Millard Knox (1900-1971), who in 1927 married J.

==Career==
===Business career===
In 1921, upon graduation from Yale, Knox became a [[Marine Midland Bank]] director. In 1926, he became vice-president, followed by chairman in 1943 until 1970. He joined the [[F. W. Woolworth Company|F. W. Woolworth]] board in 1926 and was chairman from 1943 until reaching the mandatory retirement age forty-five years later in 1971.  He became Chairman of The [[University at Buffalo]]'s governing Council from 1950-69.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glueck|first1=Grace|title=Seymour H.

===Art===
In 1926, he joined the board of [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery|Albright Art Gallery]]. From the beginning, he was a leader in the [[modernism]] movement and in modern cultural life in Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 60 years working with the [[Buffalo Fine Arts Academy]] and by 1939, he was President of the Academy.  He bolstered the Contemporary [[Abstractionism]] collection during his tenure.  He is best known for his 1962 addition to the Albright Art Gallery, designed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]. After the completion of the addition, the Gallery was renamed the Albright-Knox Art Gallery Knox in his honor.  He donated more than 160 works for the new wing, and over 700 pieces over his lifetime.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;  He is said to be in part responsible for the popularity of [[Jackson Pollock]].  Under his direction, the Gallery became the first museum to purchase a [[Clyfford Still]], one of the first to purchase a [[Henry Moore]], and as leading champions of Abstractionism, they acquired selections from almost every major abstractionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828934,00.html|title=Shorty's Triumph|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|accessdate=February 24, 2008|date=January 12, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 he was appointed to a commission to choose modern art works for the [[Empire State Plaza#Art collection|Governor Nelson A.

*[[Seymour H. Knox III]] (1926–1996)
*[[Northrup Rand Knox]] (1928–1998)
Both sons were the original principal owners of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] [[National Hockey League|NHL team]]. Knox was the subject of the 1985 [[Andy Warhol]] painting "[[Portrait of Seymour H. Knox]]".  He also donated significant funds to the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], which both the Seymour H. Knox Jr., Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art and Seymour H. Knox Jr., Curator of European and Contemporary Art positions bear his name. He was an avid polo player and led his Aurora team to the United States Championship in 1932, later touring South America, and winning a tournament in Europe.

Knox died on September 27, 1990 and was [[eulogy|eulogized]] in Congress by [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bill Paxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E01OC0-207:|title=SEYMOUR H.

[[File:P. Bodmer XIV-XV, staurogram.jpg|thumb|A staurogram used as τρ-ligature part of the spelling of the word ''σταυρον'' (as {{overline|Ϲ⳨ΟΝ}}) in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14:27 Luke 14:27] ([[Papyrus 75|Papyrus Bodmer XIV]], 2nd century).]]

[[File:Nahsholim-Tel-Dor-3187.jpg|thumb|An [[Early Christian lamps|oil lamp]]  with staurogram from [[Caesarea Maritima]]. Glass Factory Museum, [[Nahsholim]], Israel.]]

The '''staurogram''' ('''⳨'''), also '''monogrammatic cross''' or '''''tau-rho''''',&lt;ref&gt;The term ''[[:wikt:staurogram|staurogram]]'' in this sense is of relatively late coinage (1960s); "monogrammatic cross" is in use in the later 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] composed of a superposition of the letters  [[tau (letter)|tau]] ('''Τ''')  and [[rho (letter)|rho]] ('''Ρ''').

==Overview==
The staurogram was first used to abbreviate ''[[stauros]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:σταυρός|σταυρός]]}}), the Greek word for [[Christian cross|cross]] in very early [[New Testament manuscripts]] such as [[Papyrus 66|P66]], [[Papyrus 45|P45]] and [[Papyrus 75|P75]], almost like a [[nomina sacra|nomen sacrum]], and may visually have represented [[Crucifix|Jesus on the cross]].&lt;ref name="Hurtado"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Kraus | editor-first = Thomas | title = New Testament Manuscripts | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-90-04-14945-8 | chapter=The Staurogram in Early Christian Manuscripts: the earliest visual reference to the crucified Jesus? | first=Larry| last=Hurtado| authorlink=Larry W. Hurtado | pages=207–26 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1842/1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tau-Rho as a [[Christian symbol]] outside its function as [[nomen sacrum]] in biblical manuscripts appears from c. the 4th century, used as a ''[[Christogram|monogramma Christi]]'' alongside the [[Chi-Rho]] and other variants, spreading to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redknap | first = Mark | title = The Christian Celts: treasures of late Celtic Wales | publisher = National Museum of Wales | location = Cardiff | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-7200-0354-3 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ephrem the Syrian]]  (4th century) discusses a Christian symbol, apparently combining the Tau-Rho with [[Alpha and Omega]] placed under the left and right horizontal arms of the Tau.
Ephrem says that the Tau represents the cross of Jesus (prefigured by the outstretched hands of [[Moses]] in {{bibleverse||Exodus|17:11|KJV}}), the Alpha and Omega signify that the crucified Christ is "the beginning and end", and the Rho, finally, signifies "Help" ({{lang|grc|βοήθια}} {{sic}}; classical spelling: {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:βοήθεια|βοήθεια]]}}), because of the
[[Numerology|numerological]] value of the Greek word being [[100 (number)|100]], represented by Rho as a [[Greek numeral]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado (2006), citing [[Franz Joseph Dölger|F. J. Dölger]], ''Sol Salutis'' (1920), [https://fedora.phaidra.univie.ac.at/fedora/get/o:34206/bdef:Book/view#  p. 61] (note 2).&lt;!--sic, p. 61 in the original (1920) edition, Hurtado cites p. 74 from a later (1925?) edition. Dölger's footnote cites the Greek text from the 1746 edition of Ephraem's text.--&gt;
''Ephraem in sanctam Parasceven'', ''Ephraem Syri opera omnia quae extant graece — syriace — latine'' Tom. III Romae 1746, p. 477. &lt;/ref&gt;

The two letters tau and rho can be found separately (not in ligature) as symbols already on [[early Christianity|early Christian]] [[ossuaries]].&lt;ref name="Bagatti"/&gt; [[Tertullian]] (''Contra Marcionem'' 3.22) explains the Tau  as a symbol of salvation by identification  with the sign which in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|9:4|KJV}} was marked on the forehead of the saved ones.&lt;ref name="Hurtado"/&gt;
The rho by itself can refer to Christ as [[Messiah]] because [[Abraham]], taken as symbol of the Messiah, generated [[Isaac]] according to a promise made by God when he was one hundred years old, and 100 is the value of rho.&lt;ref name="Bagatti"&gt;[[Bellarmino Bagatti|Bagatti, Bellarmino]], "The Church from the Circumcision: history and archaeology of the Judaeo-Christians", ''Studium Biblicum Franciscanum'', Collectio Minor n. 2, Jerusalem  (1984). &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}}

The staurogram is encoded by [[Unicode]] in the  [[Coptic (Unicode block)|Coptic]] block, at  {{unichar|2CE8|Coptic Symbol Tau Ro}}, and as of Unicode 7.0 (2014) also in the [[Ancient Symbols]] block, at  {{unichar| 101A0|greek symbol tau rho}}. The Coptic block has a ligature of the full word  σταυρός,  where the τρ is represented by the staurogram, and two [[lunate sigma]]s are attached to either side of the tau's horizontal bar, at  {{unichar|2CE7|Coptic symbol Stauros}}.

The goals are to improve the long term viability and quality of life for [[human]]s and the longevity of natural ecosystems. Sustainable packaging must meet the functional and economic needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging (see [[Packaging and labeling]]).  It requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design, choice of materials, processing, and life-cycle.  This is not just the vague "green movement" that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years.   Companies implementing these eco-friendly actions are reducing their [[carbon footprint]], using more recycled materials and  reusing more package components.&lt;ref&gt;Amcor (2014). Sustainability Review 2014. (http://www.amcor.com/sustainability/). Retrieved 10 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  They often encourage suppliers, contract packagers, and distributors to do likewise.

For example, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] are looking into using dairy-based films as an alternative to petroleum-based packaging. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100120.htm]  Instead of being made of [[synthetic polymers]], these dairy-based films would be composed of proteins such as [[casein]] and [[whey]], which are found in milk.  The films would be [[biodegradable]] and offer better oxygen barriers than synthetic, chemical-based films.  More research must be done to improve the water barrier quality of the dairy-based film, but advances in sustainable packaging are actively being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Environmental marketing]] claims on packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous [[greenwashing]] titles such as ''green packaging'' and  ''environmentally friendly'' can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance to packagers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm  |title=Environmental Claims |accessdate=17 November 2008 |work= |publisher= Federal Trade Commission|date=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable. Using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs. Recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social movements, consumer pressure, and regulation. All phases of packaging, distribution, and logistics are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sustainable packaging is no longer focused on just recycling. Just as packaging is not the only eco target, although it is still top of mind for many. Right or wrong, packaging is frequently scrutinized and used as the measure of a company's overall sustainability, even though it may contribute only a small percentage to the total eco impact compared to other things, such as transportation, and water and energy use.

==Criteria==

The criteria for ranking and comparing packaging based on their sustainability is an active area of development.  General guidance, metrics, checklists, and scorecards are being published by several groups.

Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/stewardship/products/packaging.htm|title=Packaging, Product Stewarship|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[standards organization]]s, consumers, retailers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://walmartstores.com/FactsNews/NewsRoom/6039.aspx |title=Wal-Mart Unveils Packaging Scorecard to Suppliers |accessdate=2008-04-29|date=  November 2, 2008 |publisher=Wal-Mart }}&lt;/ref&gt; and packagers are considering several types of criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Each organization words the goals and targets a little differently. In general, the broad goals of sustainable packaging are:
# Functional&lt;ref&gt;anon: "Packaging Matters", Institute of Packaging Professionals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; – product protection, safety, regulatory compliance, etc.
# Cost effective – if it is too expensive, it is unlikely to be used
# Support long-term human and ecological health

Specific factors for [[sustainable design]] of packaging may include:
* Use of minimal materials –  reduced packaging, reduced layers of packaging, lower mass (product to packaging ratio), lower volume, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jason DeRusha. "The Incredible Shrinking Package". 16 Jul 2007. WCCO.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Logistics]] efficiency (through complete life cycle) – cube utilization, tare weight, enablement of efficient transportation, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/smartway/transport/documents/faqs/partnership_overview.pdf|format=PDF|title=SmartWay Transport Partnerships|accessdate=2008-12-22|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Energy]] efficiency, total energy content and usage, use of [[renewable energy]], etc.
* [[Recycled]] content – as available and functional.  For [[food contact materials]], there are special safety considerations, particularly for use of recycled plastics and paper.  Regulations are published by each country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

* Avoid the use of materials toxic to humans or the environment
* Effects on atmosphere/climate – [[ozone layer]], [[greenhouse gas]]es ([[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, etc.
* [[Water]] use, reuse, treatment, waste, etc.
* Worker impact: occupational health, safety, clean technology, etc.
* Made from materials healthy throughout the life cycle
* Physically designed to optimize materials and energy
* Use integral design to reduce the use of materials

The chosen criteria are often used best as a basis of comparison for two or more similar packaging designs; not as an absolute success or failure.  Such a multi-variable comparison is often presented as a [[radar chart]] (spider chart,  star chart, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Benefits==
Some aspects of environmentally sound packaging are required by regulators while others are decisions made by each packager.  Investors, employees, management, and customers can influence corporate decisions and help set policies.  When investors seek to purchase stock, companies known for their positive environmental policy can be attractive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nef.org.uk/greencompany/benefits.htm Benefits For Being Green]&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential stockholders and investors see this as a solid decision: lower environmental risks lead to more capital at cheaper rates. Companies that highlight their environmental status to consumers, can boost sales as well as product reputation. Going green  is often a sound investment that can pay off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/aug2008/bs20080817_557068.htm?campaign_id=rss_null More Benefits For Green Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Some alternative materials that are recycled/recyclable and/or less damaging to the environment can lead to companies incurring increased costs. Though this is common when any product begins to carry the true cost of its production (producer pays, producer responsibility laws, take-back laws). There may be an expensive and lengthy process before the new forms of packaging are deemed safe to the public, and approval may take up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn6207/is_20080916/ai_n28113730 Is Going Green Worth It]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note here, that for most of the developed world, tightening legislation, and changes in major retailer demand (Walmart's Sustainable Packaging Scorecard for example) the question is no longer "if" products and packaging should become more sustainable, but how-to and how-soon to do it.&lt;ref name="Jedlicka" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Efforts toward “greener” packaging are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end.  Some picture a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's:  greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]],  fewer [[consumer packaged goods]],  [[local purchasing]]   with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''The Case of the Stuttering Pig''''' is a [[Looney Tunes]] animated cartoon, starring [[Porky Pig]] and [[Petunia Pig]], released to theaters on October 30, 1937. This short was directed by [[Frank Tashlin]], and the music was composed by [[Carl Stalling]]. The title is a parody of ''[[The Case of the Stuttering Bishop]]'', a [[Perry Mason]] mystery that [[Warner Bros.]] had filmed earlier that year.

==Plot==
On a dark and stormy night, Porky and his brothers (Patrick, Percy, Portis, Peter) and sister (Petunia) learn from lawyer Goodwill that they are set to inherit a fortune from their deceased rich uncle Solomon, with the "kindly" lawyer next in line after them. After Goodwill leaves, he walks into a secret laboratory and drinks a bottle of [[Jekyll and Hyde]] juice and turns into a hideous monster bent on killing them. The monster [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] and warns the audience not to interfere, with special emphasis by threatening the guy in the third row (whom was voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]). One by one, he kidnaps the brothers, leaving only Porky and Petunia. As Porky and Petunia walk through the house, trying to find their brothers, the monster grabs Petunia, unbeknownst to Porky, and then starts trailing Porky. When Porky sees the monster, he screams and runs up the stairs, only to meet the monster at the top. He then screams and runs down the stairs, into the laboratory where the monster is holding his siblings prisoner. No sooner has Porky freed them than the monster breaks in and corners all of the pigs. Just when it seems the monster is going to kill them, a thrown theater chair (seemingly out of nowhere) flies into the monster, trapping him in the stocks where he had them in earlier.

'''All six pigs (amazed by the incident):''' Who did that?!

'''[[Mel Blanc]] (shouting angrily):''' '''ME'''!

'''Monster (shocked at who attacked him):''' Who are '''''YOU'''''?!

'''[[Mel Blanc]] (replying angrily):''' I'm the guy in the third row, ya big sourpuss!!!

==Availability==
This short was released on the 4th ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' DVD box set on Tuesday, November 14, 2006. It was also released on the Porky Pig 101 DVD on Tuesday, September 19, 2017.

==History==
The dictionary was first considered in 2006 when Koenig was a "student at Macalester College in Minnesota" and was attempting to write poetry. The ''Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows'' was the idea he came up with that would contain all the words he needed for his poetry, including emotions that had never been linguistically described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Rebecca |date=January 5, 2016 |title=Odd Emotions |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201601/odd-emotions |newspaper=[[Psychology Today]] |access-date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the website and [[web series]] began to grow in June 2015 after a list of twenty-three words from the dictionary began to be shared on multiple [[social media]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Byrne |first=Nicola |date=June 25, 2015 |title=People are going crazy for this list of emotions people feel, but can’t explain |url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/people-going-crazy-list-emotions-people-feel-t-185920911.html |newspaper=[[TheJournal.ie]] |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable words==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''''vemödalen'''''
n. the frustration of photographing something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist—the same sunset, the same waterfall, the same curve of a hip, the same closeup of an eye—which can turn a unique subject into something hollow and pulpy and cheap, like a mass-produced piece of furniture you happen to have assembled yourself.

Several of the neologisms presented in ''The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows'', especially those that have an accompanying video, have received attention and interest. The term ''Vemödalen'' focuses on the lack of creativity within photography due to the existence of similar photographs having been taken in the past. However, the video also focuses on how it is "inevitable that the “same” image will be captured by different individuals" while it is also correct that "just because some things seem similar, their uniqueness is not annulled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arici |first=Alexandra |date=November 12, 2014 |title=Watch: Vemödalen Is the Fear of Capturing the Same Photographs as Everybody Else |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Watch-Vem-dalen-Is-the-Fear-of-Capturing-the-Same-Photographs-as-Everybody-Else-464812.shtml |newspaper=[[Softpedia]] |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dove |first=Jackie |date=December 4, 2014 |title=Is there any unique vision left in the world? |url=https://thenextweb.com/creativity/2014/12/04/unique-vision-left-world/ |newspaper=The Next Web |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a quote from [[Walt Whitman]], the video points out that something being unique will always be based on adding to what came before and that every photo ever made is being added to the story of photographs that all people are collaborating on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.commarts.wisc.edu/2014/12/02/vemodalen-and-the-dictionary-of-obscure-sorrows/ |title=Vemödalen and The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows |last1=Chia |first1=Aleena |date=December 2, 2014 |website=Antenna |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''Sonder'' has been noted as well for its relation to other people, its definition meaning "the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 2, 2014 |title=Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows: Sonder |url=http://www.pw.org/content/dictionary_of_obscure_sorrows_sonder |newspaper=[[Poets &amp; Writers]] |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichtenegger |first=Franz |date=July 3, 2015 |title=Meine Gefühle sind komisch |url=https://www.vice.com/de/read/meine-gefuehle-sind-komisch-123 |newspaper=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sonder'' has also been appropriated by various companies for use as the name of a bike brand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Orton |first=Matt |date=October 22, 2015 |title=Sonder: a new bike brand from British outdoors experts Alpkit |url=http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/news/article/sonder-a-new-bike-brand-from-british-outdoors-experts-alpkit-45527/ |newspaper=BikeRadar |access-date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title of a video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Benson |first=Julian |date=November 13, 2013 |title=Sonder has you dive from one character’s head to another’s trying to save the day |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/indie/sonder-has-you-dive-one-character-s-head-another-s-trying-save-day |newspaper=PCGamesN |access-date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third album from indie pop artist [[Kaoru Ishibashi]] was named ''Sonderlust'' after this term from the dictionary and references the separation from his wife and his attempts to understand her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rangarajan |first=Sahana |date=October 20, 2016 |title=Reflections on ‘Sonderlust,’ a talk with Kishi Bashi |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2016/10/20/kishi-bashi-feature/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Californian]] |access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shin |first=Pearl |date=October 21, 2016 |title=Kishi Bashi supports young musicians at Chicago concert |url=https://news.uic.edu/kishi-bashi-supports-young-musicians-at-chicago-concert |newspaper=[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] |access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple words from the dictionary, such as ellipism, énouement, and onism, were used as titles for various cocktails served at the Chicago restaurant Knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sula |first=Mike |date=January 11, 2017 |title=For a small steak house, Knife is big on showmanship |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/knife-timothy-cottini-fork-john-tesar-steak-house-north-center/Content?oid=25002378 |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an art gallery exhibit for the works of Michael Sagato in Los Angeles uses words from the ''Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows'' to title each of his art pieces and to reference the meaning behind each piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rivera |first=Erica |date=October 14, 2016 |title=Artist Profile: Michael Sagato: Visualizing Obscure Sorrows |url=http://www.craveonline.com/art/1130401-artist-profile-michael-sagato |newspaper=[[CraveOnline]] |access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It stars [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Katharine Graham]], the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Ben Bradlee]], the executive editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', with [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Tracy Letts]], [[Bradley Whitford]], [[David Cross]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Carrie Coon]], and [[Matthew Rhys]] in supporting roles. Set in 1971, ''The Post'' depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at ''The Washington Post'' to publish the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'', classified documents regarding the 30-year involvement of the United States government in the [[Vietnam War]].

[[Principal photography]] began in [[New York City]] in May 2017. The film premiered at the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on December 14, 2017, and went into [[limited release]] in the United States on December 22, 2017. It entered [[wide release]] on January 12, 2018, and grossed $179 million worldwide.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1966, during the [[Vietnam War]], State Department military analyst [[Daniel Ellsberg]] accompanies United States troops in combat, documenting the progress of U.S. military activities in the region for Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]. On the flight home, McNamara expresses to Ellsberg and [[William B. Macomber Jr.|William Macomber]] his view. He thinks that the war in Vietnam is hopeless, yet, upon landing, tells the press he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg overhears this and becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor working for the [[RAND Corporation]], Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the [[Vietnam War|conflict in Vietnam]], dating back to the [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]]. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to reporters at ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In 1971, newspaper heiress [[Katharine Graham]] tries to balance her social life with her responsibility as owner and publisher of ''The Washington Post'', following the deaths of her husband, [[Phil Graham]], and her father, [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]. She is troubled over preparations for the newspaper's [[Initial public offering|stock-market launch]], a move she recognizes as important for strengthening the paper's economic stability. Graham lacks experience and is frequently overruled by more assertive men who advise or work for her, such as editor-in-chief [[Ben Bradlee]] and board member Arthur Parsons.

Secretary McNamara, Graham's longtime friend, confides in her that he is to be the subject of unflattering coverage by ''The New York Times''. The story, another example of the ''Times''' ability to get [[Scoop (news)|scoops]] while ''The Post'' languishes, turns out to be an exposé of the government's long-running deception of the American public regarding Vietnam. However, the series is halted by a court [[injunction]] against further publication by the ''Times''.

''Post'' assistant editor [[Ben Bagdikian]] tracks down former colleague Ellsberg as the source for the leak, who provides him with copies of the same material given to the ''Times''. A hand-picked team of ''Post'' reporters sorts through the piles of papers, searching for further headline stories. The lawyers for the ''Post'' advise against publishing the material, lest the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] bring criminal charges against them. Graham talks to McNamara, Bradlee, and trusted ''Post'' chairman Fritz Beebe, agonizing over the decision of whether to publish. Bradlee, a close friend of former President [[John F. Kennedy]], tells Graham that their politician friends (including JFK, as shown in the documents) have abused their friendships by lying to their faces, proving that her friendship with McNamara must no longer stop her. The situation is made even more complicated when the ''Post''{{'}}s lawyers discover that Bagdikian's source is the same as the ''Times''{{'}}s, possibly putting Graham in [[contempt of court]]. If charges are brought against the company, Graham could destroy the newspaper she sees as a family legacy. Alternately, if she were to win any legal challenge, the ''Post'' could instead establish itself as an important journalistic institution. She chooses to run the story.

The White House retaliates, and in short order the ''Post'' and ''Times'' appear together before the Supreme Court to plead their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] case for the right to publish the material. Meanwhile, newspapers across the country pick up the story in solidarity with the ''Post'' and ''Times.'' On June 30, 1971, [[New York Times Co. v. United States|the court rules 6–3 in the newspapers' favor]], vindicating Graham's decision. A short while after, Nixon demands that the ''Post'' be barred from the White House. One year later,  on June 17, 1972 (two weeks before the first anniversary of the court’s ruling), security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] discovers a [[Watergate scandal|break-in in progress]] at the [[Watergate complex]].

In October 2016, [[Amy Pascal]] won a bid for the rights to the screenplay ''The Post'', written by [[Liz Hannah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/pentagon-papers-the-post-spec-script-Amy-pascal-Washington-post-1201845589/|title=Amy Pascal Buys Pentagon Papers Movie Spec Script 'The Post' By Liz Hannah|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|date=October 31, 2016|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, [[Steven Spielberg]] had halted pre-production on ''The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara'' after a casting setback, and consequently opened his schedule to other potential films to direct.&lt;ref name=recap&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/post-how-spielberg-beat-a-tight-deadline-make-a-timely-newspaper-drama-1064283|title='The Post': How Spielberg Beat a Tight Deadline to Make a Timely Newspaper Drama|last=Galloway|first=Stephen|date=December 5, 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 6, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, it was announced that Spielberg was in negotiations to direct and produce the film, with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in talks for the roles of Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/steven-spielberg-tom-hanks-meryl-streep-pentagon-papers-the-post-amy-pascal-1202034193/|title=Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks &amp; Meryl Streep Team for Pentagon Papers Drama 'The Post'|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|date=March 6, 2017|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Post'' is the first time that Spielberg, Streep, and Hanks had all worked together on a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/the-post-trailer-steven-spielberg-meryl-streep-tom-hanks-1202609871/|title=Watch First Trailer for Steven Spielberg's 'The Post,' Starring Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks|last=Khatchatourian|first=Maane|date=November 8, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-post-trailer-pentagon-papers-movie-tom-hanks-meryl-streep-spielberg-1056063|title=First 'The Post' Trailer: Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep Tackle Pentagon Papers|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg read the screenplay and decided to direct the film as soon as possible, citing that "when I read the first draft of the script, this wasn't something that could wait three years or two years — this was a story I felt we needed to tell today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/11/20/steven-spielberg-timely-new-film-the-post-history-certainly-repeating-itself/879965001/|title=Steven Spielberg on timely new film 'The Post': 'History is certainly repeating itself'|last=Ryan|first=Patrick|date=November 20, 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC|accessdate=November 21, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg worked on ''The Post'' while post-production work continued on the visual-effects-heavy ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'', a situation familiar to him from concurrently producing, in the early 1990s, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[Schindler's List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/post-steven-spielberg-tom-hanks-meryl-streep-unveil-at-first-screening-1060135|title=Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep Unveil 'The Post' at First Screening|last=Lee|first=Ashley|date=November 19, 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=November 21, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josh Singer]] was hired to re-write the screenplay ten weeks before filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/awards/oscars-steven-spielberg-the-post-meryl-streep-tom-hanks-1202618447/|title=Oscars: Steven Spielberg's 'The Post' Arrives with the Zeitgeist in Its Sights|last=Tapley|first=Kristopher|date=November 20, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=November 21, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alonso Duralde]] of ''[[TheWrap]]'' praised the acting and Spielberg's direction, though he noted the script was too on-the-nose at times, saying, "''The Post'' passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama: it makes us understand that decisions validated by the lens of history were difficult ones to make in the moment, and it generates suspense over how all the pieces fell into place to make those decisions come to fruition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/the-post-movie-review-steven-spielberg-meryl-streep-tom-hanks/|title='The Post' Movie Review: Steven Spielberg Spins a Lean and Mean Fourth Estate Yarn|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=December 6, 2017|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ehrlich of [[IndieWire]] gave the film an A– and wrote: "Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles, but ''The Post'' is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution hasn't been this much fun since ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Ehrlich |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/the-post-review-steven-spielberg-meryl-streep-tom-hanks-1201901378/|title='The Post' Review: Steven Spielberg's Spectacularly Entertaining Journalism Thriller Is a Rallying Cry for the Resistance |work=[[IndieWire]] |date=December 6, 2017 |accessdate= December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Nashawaty, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', gave the film a positive review, but also compared it with previous journalism films such as ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' stating, "Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow. But if you look at ''The Post'' next to something like ''All the President's Men'', you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it. That's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film. But it's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one."&lt;ref&gt;Nashawaty, Chris. Film Review: The Post. ''Entertainment Weekly''. First Look Issue 2018, December 1, 2017, pp 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' awarded the film an NYT Critic's Pick with a strong acknowledgment of Spielberg as director saying, "Mostly, (the ''Post'' decision to publish) went down fast, a pace that Mr. Spielberg conveys with accelerated rhythms, flying feet, racing cameras and an enjoyably loose approach to the material. With his virtuosic, veteran crew, Mr. Spielberg paints the scene vividly and with daubs of beauty; most notably, he creates distinct visual realms for the story's two main overlapping, at times colliding worlds. Katharine reigns over one; at first she's all but entombed in her darkly lighted, wood-paneled empire. Ben rules the other, overseeing the talking and typing warriors of the glaring, noisily freewheeling newsroom".&lt;ref name="Dargis"/&gt;

Matt Bobkin, writing for ''[[Exclaim!]]'', gave the film a 6 out of 10 score, saying the film "has all the makings of an awards season hit, but is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous sociopolitical climate."

===Portrayal of ''The New York Times''===
The film downplays the original role that ''The New York Times'' had in breaking the ''Pentagon Papers'' and emphasizes ''The Washington Post'''s subsequent involvement.&lt;ref name=stingpost&gt;{{cite web|first=Olivia |last=Truffaut-Wong |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/how-accurate-is-the-post-the-meryl-streep-drama-recreates-a-thrilling-chain-of-events-7694652 |title=How Accurate Is 'The Post'?

The 1972 Pulitzer jury of journalists noted in their recommendation not only the significance of Daniel Ellsberg's ''Pentagon Papers'' leak, but also that of ''Times'' reporters [[Neil Sheehan]], [[Hedrick Smith]], [[Fox Butterfield]] and E. W. Kenworthy, and stated that their effort was "a combination of investigative reporting, analysis, research, and writing — all of which added to a distinctly meritorious public service, not only for readers of The Times but also for an entire nation."&lt;ref name=opppav /&gt; Goodale noted in an article for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that the ''Times'' published the ''Papers'' after Ellsberg had leaked them to Sheehan, and further stated that the film "creates a false impression that the Post was a major player in such publication. It's as though Hollywood had made a movie about the Times' triumphant role in [[Watergate scandal#Role of the media|Watergate]]."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt; On ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', Goodale further said, "Although a producer has artistic license, I think it should be limited in a situation such as this, so that the public comes away with an understanding of what the true facts are in this case . . . And I think that if you're doing a movie now, when [President Donald] Trump is picking on the press for 'fake news', you want to be authentic. You don't want to be in any way fake."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-the-post-stood-up-to-the-power-of-the-presidency&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Army Center of Military History''' ('''CMH''') is a directorate within the [[Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army]]. The center is responsible for the appropriate use of [[military history|history]] and military records throughout the [[United States Army]]. Traditionally, this mission has meant recording the official history of the army in both peace and war, while advising the army staff on historical matters. CMH is the flagship organization leading the [[Army Historical Program]].

==Mission==
The center traces its lineage back to historians under the [[Secretary of War]] who compiled the [[Official Records of the American Civil War|''Official Records of the Rebellion'']], an extensive history of the [[American Civil War]] begun in 1874. A similar work on [[World War I]] was prepared by the Historical Section of the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]].

The modern organization of the army's historical efforts dates from the creation of the General Staff historical branch in July 1943 and the subsequent gathering of a team of historians, translators, editors, and cartographers to record the official history of [[World War II]]. They began publication of the ''United States Army in World War II'' series, which numbers 78 volumes, in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamczyk|first=Richard D.|title=United States Army in World War II: Reader's Guide|year=1992|publisher=Center of Military History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0160378171|pages=173|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/011/11-9/CMH_Pub_11-9.pdf|quote=CMH Pub 11-9|oclc= 813914147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Center has produced detailed series on the Army's role in the [[Korean war|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]]s and has begun a series on the U.S. Army in the [[Cold War]]. These works are  supplemented by monographs and other publications on a mix of topics.
[[File:Oaa-org.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Organizational Chart for the OAA, and its subordinate units, including the United States Army Center of Military History]]

Since its formation, the center has provided historical support to the [[Secretary of the Army|Army Secretariat]] and Staff, contributing background information for decision making, staff actions, command information programs, and public statements by army officials. It has expanded its role in the areas of military history education, the management of the army's museum system, and the introduction of automated data-retrieval systems. The center's work with army schools ensures that the study of history is a part of the training of officers and noncommissioned officers. Much of this educational work is performed at field historical offices and in army museums.

==Historical activities==
Under the direction of the chief of military history and his principal adviser, the army’s chief historian, CMH’s staff is involved in some 50 major writing projects. Many of these efforts involve new research that ranges from traditional studies in operational and administrative history to the examination of such areas as procurement, peacekeeping, and the global war on terror. Those works under way and projected are described in the Army Historical Program, an annual report to the Chief of Staff on the Army’s historical activities. All center publications are listed in the catalog ''Publications of the United States Army Center of Military History,'' which explains how to access them.

In addition, army historians maintain the organizational history of army units, allowing the center to provide units of the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve with [[lineage and honors certificate|certificates of their lineage and honors]] and other historical material concerning their organizations. The center also determines the official designations for army units and works with the army staff during force reorganizations to preserve units with significant histories, as well as unit properties and related historical artifacts.

CMH also serves as a clearinghouse for the oral history programs in the army at all levels of command. It also conducts and preserves its own oral history collections, including those from the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and the many recent contingency operations. In addition, the center’s end-of-tour interviews within the Army Secretariat and Staff provide a basis for its annual histories of the Department of the Army.

As tangible representations of the service’s mission, military artifacts and art enhance the soldier’s understanding of the profession of arms. CMH manages a system of more than 120 army museums and their holdings, encompassing some 450,000 artifacts and 15,000 works of military art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.army.mil/html/museums/dir-links.html Directory of Active Army and National Guard Museums]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center also provides professional museum training, staff assistance visits, teams of combat artists such as those deployed under the [[Vietnam Combat Artists Program]], and general museum support throughout the army. Current projects include the establishment of a [[National Museum of the United States Army]] at [[Fort Belvoir, Virginia]], and a complementary [[Army Heritage and Educational Center]] at [[Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania]].
[[File:Preserving and protecting Army history 120530-A-AJ780-005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Paintings by Adolf Hitler]] stored at the Center. The paintings were cited in ''[[Price v. United States]]''.]]
The Chief of Military History is responsible for ensuring the appropriate use of military history in the teaching of strategy, tactics, logistics, and administration. This mission includes a requirement that military leaders at all levels be aware of the value of history in advancing military professionalism. To that end, the center holds a biennial history conference and workshop; publishes ''Army History'', a professional bulletin devoted to informing the larger military history education community; and supplies readings for the army school system, including the ROTC community, and texts and other support for the army’s [[staff ride]] program. In this effort, the chief of military history is assisted by a historical advisory committee that includes leading academic historians and representatives of the army school system.&lt;ref name="history.army.mil"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMH Dissertation Fellowships: General Information|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/about/df-geninfo.html|website = www.history.army.mil|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff rides enable military leaders to retrace the course of a battle on the ground, deepening their understanding of the recurring fundamentals of military operations. As one of the army’s major teaching devices, staff rides are particularly dependent on a careful knowledge of military history. Center historians lead rides directed by the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff and attended by senior members of the army Staff.

It administers the army’s Command History Program, to provide historical support to army organizations worldwide. In addition, since the first Persian Gulf War, the center has coordinated the deployment of [[military history detachment]]s and the collection of historical data during peacekeeping and wartime operations, including those in northern Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

==Fellowships and publications==
To stimulate interest in military history in the army and the nation, CMH sponsors professional programs.
* Fellowships: To encourage and support dissertations in military history by graduate students, the center offers up to four dissertation fellowships each academic year. These fellowships carry a $9,000 stipend and access to the center’s facilities and expertise. Although the fellowship program broadly defines the history of war on land, it selects winners with a preference for topics on the history of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name="history.army.mil"/&gt; 
* Publications: The Center has over 600 titles in its catalog. It is responsible for writing the official [[history of the U.S. Army]]. It is able to facilitate research, provide graphics and editorial support, and carry manuscripts through to publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Army Center of Military History Publications Catalog|url = http://history.army.mil/catalog/index.html|website = www.history.army.mil|access-date = 2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Center also publishes a quarterly history journal, '''''Army History''''', known from 1983-1988 (No. 1 - No. 12) as '''''The Army Historian'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jstor.org/journal/armyhistorian | title=The Army Historian on JSTOR | publisher=[[JSTOR]] | accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This award-winning magazine currently has a print run of over 10,000 copies and has been in circulation since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Army History Complete Collection|url = http://www.history.army.mil/armyhistory/issues_complete_guide.html|website = www.history.army.mil|access-date = 2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical services to the public==
CMH’s art and documents collections, library, and reference services are available to private researchers.&lt;ref name="Inquiries"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.army.mil/inquire.html | title=Inquiries to CMH | work=CMH | date=April 1, 2016 | accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official priorities permitting, its historians, curators, and archivists advise researchers on military history and stand ready to share their expertise concerning the location of sources. The Collections Branch of the Museum Division arranges temporary loans of paintings and drawings from the [[Army Art Collection]] to private organizations that agree to display the art publicly in accordance with Army regulations. The army’s museums and historical holdings throughout the country and abroad are generally open to the public, and their curators are available to answer reference questions. As a secured facility, {{as of|2016|lc=y}} requests for an appointment at [[Fort Lesley J. McNair]] must be made at least a week in advance.&lt;ref name="Inquiries"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7205">[[File:Warkworth Chronicle f1.jpg|thumb|End of [[Caxton]]'s [[Brut Chronicle]] and the beginning of Warkworth's Chronicle: ''As for alle thynges that folowe, referre them to my copey, in whyche is wretyn a remanente lyke to this forseyd werke : that is to wytt, that, at the coronacyone of the forseyde [[Edward IV of England|Edwarde]], he create and make dukes his two brythir, the eldere [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Duke of Clarence]], and [[Richard III of England|his yongere brothir]].'' (Cambridge Peterhouse MS 190 f 214v)]]

The '''Warkworth's Chronicle''', now stylized '''"Warkworth{{'}}s" ''Chronicle''''', is an English [[chronicle]] formerly ascribed to [[John Warkworth]], a [[List of Masters of Peterhouse, Cambridge|Master]] of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]]. Known from only two manuscripts, it covers the years 1461–1474 and provides information on the recording and reception of historical events including the accession of King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and the murder of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].

==Background, authorship, publication==
For a long time the chronicle was known from only a single manuscript, Cambridge, Peterhouse, MS 190, fols. 214v – 225r.&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript is permanently on loan at [[Cambridge University Library]]; see Kaufman 50–51 n.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1972 was a second copy discovered, by [[Lister M. Matheson]], in Glasgow Library, MS Hunterian 83, fols 141r – 148v; the chronicle had been overlooked since the catalogue of Hunterian manuscripts incorrectly listed its contents. In both manuscripts, Warkworth follows the [[Brut Chronicle|''Brut'' Chronicle]], as a continuation;&lt;ref name=kaufman50/&gt; that version of the ''Brut'' ended in 1419 and is continued until 1461, with the additional text pulled from one of the ''Chronicles of England'' printed by [[William Caxton]], itself a continuation of the ''Brut''.&lt;ref name=thomson657/&gt; Matheson concluded that the continuation in Hunterian 83, covering the years 1461–1474, was added to the manuscript in 1484, and was thence copied into Peterhouse 190, likely under Warkworth's supervision.&lt;ref name=kaufman50&gt;Kaufman 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; A third manuscript, [[Harleian Library|British Library MS. Harley 3730]], is incomplete but contains material similar or identical to that of the Hunterian and Peterhouse manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Warkworth was Master of Peterhouse from 1473–1500, and he owned the ''Brut'' Chronicle of Peterhouse 190; for this reason the Warkworth Chronicle was ascribed to him as well, and thus named ''Warkworth Chronicle''. Alexander Kaufman describes how Matheson changed its appellation: "Matheson chose to remove the italics from Warkworth and place the name instead in quotation marks to signify John Warkworth's involvement with the manuscript that contained the chronicle that was, at one time, attributed to him".&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman 51 n.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The author, says Matheson, must have been a Northerner (based on orthographic and linguistic evidence), "an educated man with some sense of proportion and critical discrimination", likely a bibliophile with access to many texts and connected to the Peterhouse library. Since he was allowed to make additions to a manuscript in that library he must have had a certain standing. Matheson calculates that the author may have been in his late twenties when he wrote the chronicle and identified Roger Lancaster (d. 1502) and Thomas Metcalf (d. 1503), both Yorkshiremen, as the most likely candidates from the list of fellows of Peterhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 80–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first published in 1839 by the [[Camden Society]],&lt;ref name=thomson657&gt;Thomson 657.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[James Halliwell-Phillipps]], and reprinted in facsimile in 1988 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Lister Matheson published an edition (collated from the two manuscripts) as ''Death and Dissent: Two Fifteenth-Century Chronicles'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The chronicle covers the events of 1461 to 1474; it is "a well-known and frequently cited source" for that period. Matheson notes that the account of the first eight years are "confused", but that it improves from the account of the rebellion led by [[Robin of Redesdale]] (1469). It is especially valuable since it covers "the turbulent events in [the North of&lt;ref name=mathesonvii&gt;Matheson vii.&lt;/ref&gt;] England in 1470 and 1471", since sources for that period are difficult to come by and since it offers a "more provincial viewpoint" in contrast to chronicles produced in London.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the general propagandistic tone of contemporary chronicles that document the [[Wars of the Roses]], the chronicle is "generally moderate" in tone, even though its probable author was "a Yorkshireman whose sympathies lay with [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]".&lt;ref name=mathesonvii/&gt;

The descriptions of historical events are accompanied by a number of marvels or portents, which can be organized in two categories: natural phenomena, such as a heat wave and an incident of unstinting rain and flooding, which presage political turmoil;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman 56-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and true marvels, including two occurrences of the bleeding of the corpse of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1471, and the appearance of a headless man crying "Bowes, bowes, bowes" on [[Dunsmore Heath]] in Warwickshire. Kaufman suggests that the man might be a [[barghest]], "a fiend that is attached to a specific place", and that "bowes" is a conjugation of the verb "to bow", that is, the barghest signifies that in these difficult times it is good "to bend down in reverence, to be obedient and submit to God's will".&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman 58–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Standards Day''' (or '''International Standards Day''') is celebrated internationally each year on 14 October.&lt;!--linked as "14th" to try to stop bothead program SmackBot from unlinking the date--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/news.htm?refid=Ref1656|title= Less waste, better results - Standards increase efficiency - 43rd World Standards Day - 14 October 2012|accessdate=2014-10-21|publisher=International Organization for Standardization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day honours the efforts of the thousands of experts who develop voluntary standards within standards development organizations such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.asme.org/about-asme/standards/standards-certification-update/among-sponsors-2018-celebration-world-standards|title= ASME Among Sponsors of 2018 U.S. Celebration of World Standards Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO),  [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF). The aim of World Standards Day is to raise awareness among regulators, industry and consumers as to the importance of [[standardization]] to the global economy.

14 October was specifically chosen to mark the date, in 1946, when delegates from 25 countries first gathered in London and decided to create an international organization focused on facilitating standardization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/events/wsd|title= World Standards Day: October 14|accessdate=26 January 2010|publisher=International Organization for Standardization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though ISO was formed one year later, it wasn't until 1970 that the first World Standards Day was celebrated. 

Around the globe, various activities are chosen by national bodies to commemorate the date. The United States held a 2014 U.S. Celebration of World Standards Day on 23 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ses-standards.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=80&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standards Council of Canada]] (SCC), Canada's national accreditation body, celebrates World Standards Day together with the international community by observing the day near the dates of the international observance. In 2012 SCC celebrated World Standards Day on Friday, 12 October.

'''Yeshivas Itri''' ({{lang-he|ישיבת איתרי}}) is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[yeshiva]] in southeast [[Jerusalem]], Israel. Founded in 1968 by Rabbi [[Mordechai Elefant]], the yeshiva has several branches in Israel and the United States, and spawned several educational programs for Diaspora Jews.

==Name==
The name of the yeshiva is an acronym for '''Israel Torah Research Institute''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=38ohKjvgknIC&amp;pg=PA95|title=Biblical and Judaic Acronyms|first= Lawrence |last=Marwick|year=1979|publisher= KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn= 0870684388|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Brooklyn]]-based nonprofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/11-6043789/itri-torah-research-institute.aspx|title=Itri Torah Research Institute, Brooklyn, NY|publisher=[[Guidestar]]|year=2015|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its founding, the yeshiva was officially called ''Yeshivas Midrash HaTalmud Tiferes Avraham – Itri'' (Yeshiva for the Study of the Talmud, Glory of Abraham – Itri). After the death of its founder, Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, in 2009, the name was changed to ''Yeshivas Midrash HaTalmud Zehav Mordechai – Itri'' (Yeshiva for the Study of the Talmud, Gold of Mordechai – Itri).

==History==
Yeshivas Itri was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, an American-born educator who was a close student of Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]], Rabbi [[Aryeh Leib Malin]] and Rabbi [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik]].&lt;ref name=yated/&gt; He married the granddaughter of [[Yaakov Yosef Herman]].&lt;ref name=yated/&gt; The initial student body comprised 60 [[kollel]] students,&lt;ref name=yated/&gt; but enrollment soon expanded with unmarried yeshiva students. The yeshiva met for several years in the [[Orient House]] hotel in [[East Jerusalem]]. Elefant successfully relocated it to the premises of an old [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] hospital in the southeast of the city, near the Arab village of [[Beit Safafa]], in the 1970s. Students were housed in adjacent apartments.&lt;ref name=yated/&gt;

By 1971, enrollment was at 250 students, the majority from the United States.&lt;ref name=jdc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.archives.jdc.org/multimedia/Documents/NY_AR65-74/NY65-74_CR/NY65-74_CR_022/NY65-74_CR_022_0782.pdf|title=Visit to ITRI Yeshiva – Jerusalem|date=28 September 1971|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=[[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yeshiva received funding from the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]],&lt;ref name=jdc/&gt; government sources, and private donations.&lt;ref name=dan/&gt;

Over time, the institution grew to encompass a [[kollel]], [[yeshiva|yeshiva gedola]], [[yeshiva|yeshiva ketana]], and [[Talmud Torah]]. Branches of the yeshiva were also opened in [[Hadera]] and in the United States.&lt;ref name=yated&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chareidi.org/archives5770/chayeisoroh/CHS70arelefant.htm|title=NEWS: HaRav Mordechai Elefant zt"l|first=Yechiel|last=Sever|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=Dei'ah VeDibur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraud investigation===
In 1999 yeshiva administrator Rabbi Chaim Weiss and businessman David Appel were suspected of embezzling [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 9 million from yeshiva coffers during Elefant's medical leave.&lt;ref name=dan&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22103177.html|title= Elifant denies fleeing over Itri Yeshiva scandal|first=Dan|last=Izenberg|date=8 July 1999|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/itri-yeshiva-boss-faces-indictment-over-missing-funds-1.96309|title= Itri Yeshiva Boss Faces Indictment Over Missing Funds|first=Baruch|last=Kra|date=6 August 2003|accessdate=22 October 2015|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22013017.html|title=More Suspects to be Questioned in Itri Yeshiva Fraud Case|first=Margot|last=Dudkevitch|date=28 June 1999|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police investigation carried on for years; by 2014, police theorized that the stolen money was meant to pay for the defense of [[Aryeh Deri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-230716310.html|title=From Our Archives|first= Alexander |last=Zvielli|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=21 October 2015|work= The Jerusalem Post|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was convicted on charges of fraud and bribery in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/world/divided-israel-thousands-rally-for-ex-shas-party-leader-he-goes-jail.html|title=In a Divided Israel, Thousands Rally for the Ex-Shas Party Leader as He Goes to Jail|first=Deborah|last=Sontag|date=4 September 2000|accessdate=22 October 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offshoots==
