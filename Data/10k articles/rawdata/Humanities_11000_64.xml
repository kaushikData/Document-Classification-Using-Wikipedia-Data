The '''Aarne–Thompson classification systems''' are indices used to classify [[Folklore|folktales]]: the [[Antti Aarne|Aarne]]–[[Stith Thompson|Thompson]] Motif-Index (catalogued by alphabetical letters followed by numerals), the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (cataloged by AT or AaTh numbers), and the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system''' (developed in 2004 and cataloged by ATU numbers). 

They are named after their authors, [[Antti Aarne]], [[Stith Thompson]], and [[Hans-Jörg Uther]].

The indices are used in [[folkloristics]] to organize, classify, and analyze [[folklore]] narratives and are essential tools for folklorists, as [[Alan Dundes]] explained in 1997 about the first two indices, "the identification of folk narratives through [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] and/or tale type numbers has become an international ''[[sine qua non]]'' among bona fide folklorists".&lt;ref name="dundes"&gt;Dundes, Alan (1997) "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3814885 The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique]". ''Journal of Folklore Research'' Vol. 34, No. 3, pp. 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing folktale types==
The Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index divides tales into sections with an AT number for each entry. The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The tale type does not have to be accurate for every folktale. For example, ''The Cat as Helper'' (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance ''The Quest for a Lost Bride'' (400) or the ''Animal Bride'' (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: the ''Persecuted Heroine'' (510) has subtypes 510A, ''[[Cinderella]]'', and 510B, ''[[Catskin]]'' {{crossref|printworthy=y|1=(see other examples of tale types in the [[#Online resources and examples of tale types|online resource links]] at the end of this article)}}.

[[Antti Aarne]] was a student of [[Julius Krohn]] and his son [[Kaarle Krohn]]. Aarne developed their [[historic-geographic method]] of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for [[Morphology (folkloristics)|classifying folktales]], first published in 1910.

The American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] translated Aarne's [[motif (folkloristics)|motif-based]] classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope. With Thompson's second revisions to Aarne's catalogue in 1961, he created the "AT number system" (also referred to as "AaTh system"), which is often used today, more commonly in its updated "ATU number" form. According to [[D. L. Ashliman]], "The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales".&lt;ref name=ashliman&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D. L.]] 1987. ''A Guide to Folktales in the English Language: Based on the Aarne–Thompson Classification System.'' New York, Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography'' by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many "irregular types" are in fact old and widespread, and that "emphasis on oral tradition" often obscured "older, written versions of the tale types".&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification''' (ATU) system&lt;ref&gt;''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales'', Donald Haase, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as "smaller narrative forms" in this expanded listing.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt;

==Organising motifs==
{{main|Motif-Index of Folk-Literature}}
The Aarne–Thompson ''[[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'' organizes thousands of motifs into a similar system. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is "Unnatural Cruelty"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 "Cruel relatives-in-law", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 "Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law".

==Critical response==
In his essay "The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the "most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis".&lt;ref name=dundes/&gt;

The tale type index was criticized by [[Vladimir Propp]] of the [[Russian Formalism|Formalist]] school of the 1920s for ignoring the {{em|functions}} of the [[Motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a "macro-level" analysis means that the stories that share [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale''. Similarly, [[Alan Dundes]] points out that "Aarne’s mistake was not classifying tales on the basis of narrative plot rather than [on characters]" because "the same tale can be told with either animal or human characters" (197). "Introduction." Theory and History of Folklore. Ed. Anatoly Liberman. University of Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 1984. pg ix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify [[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]] an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale'', p. 5 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the motivation for his work,&lt;ref name="uther"&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans-Jörg |last=Uther |url=http://www.folklorefellows.fi/?page_id=915 |title=Classifying folktales: The Third Revision of the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (FFC 184) |publisher=folklorefellow.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called ''The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples''.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e.&amp;nbsp;g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p.&amp;nbsp;198),&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt; "they represent the keystones for the comparative method in [[folkloristics]], a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics" (p.&amp;nbsp;200).&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt;

==Use in folkloristics==

A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] study, published by [[folklorist]] Sara Graça da Silva and [[anthropologist]] Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the "Tales of Magic" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a [[phylogenetic]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graça da Silva |first=Sara |last2=Tehrani  |first2=Jamshid J. |date=January 2016 |title=Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/150645#F4 |journal=Royal Society Open Science |publisher=The Royal Society |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1098/rsos.150645 |access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found four of them to belong to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stratum of magic tales, namely:

* ATU 328 ''The Boy Steals Ogre's Treasure'',
* ATU 330 ''[[The Smith and the Devil]]'' (= [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|KHM]] 81a),
* ATU 402 ''The Animal Bride'' (= KHM [[:de:Die drei Federn|63]] and [[:de:Der arme Müllerbursch und das Kätzchen|106]]), and
* ATU 554 ''The Grateful Animals'' (= ''[[The White Snake]]'', KHM 17, and ''[[The Queen Bee]]'', KHM 62).

Ten more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i.&amp;nbsp;e. [[Balto-Slavic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Italo-Celtic]]):

* ATU 311 ''Rescue by Sister'' (= ''[[Fitcher's Bird]]'', KHM 46),
* ATU 332 ''[[Godfather Death]]'' (= KHM 44),
* ATU 425&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'',
* ATU 470 ''Friends in Life and Death'',
* ATU 500 ''The Name of the Supernatural Helper'' (= ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'', KHM 55),
* ATU 505 ''The Grateful Dead'',
* ATU 531 ''The Clever Horse'' (= ''[[Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful]]'', KHM 126),
* ATU 592 ''The Dance among Thorns'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der Jude im Dorn|Der Jude im Dorn]]}}'', KHM 110 is an example of this type of tale, and one of many racist and antisemitic folk tales that have been recorded),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maarten Janssen |url=http://www.mftd.org/index.php?action=atu&amp;act=select&amp;atu=592 |title=Multilingual Folk Tale Database |publisher=Mftd.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The original version of the "Dance Among the Thorns" tale-type comes from 15th century Europe, and features a monk who was forced to dance in a thorn bush, by a boy with a magic flute or fiddle. It reflected the anticlerical sentiment of many folk tales at the time, and implies that the monk deserves this punishment. An American version of this tale, told to folklorist  Marie Campbell in 1958 in Kentucky, included this apology from the informant: "Seems like all the tales about Jews gives the Jews a bad name — greedy, grabbing for cash money, cheating their work hands out of their wages — I don't know what all. I never did know a Jew, never even met up with one." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC&amp;pg=PA786&amp;lpg=PA786&amp;dq=ATU+592&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TdDjHA6OZI&amp;sig=BPMc1SNTkK7wUuyJsQCm4lAS2mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCzfe_4IXcAhVKzVMKHR5EBLMQ6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ATU%20592&amp;f=false |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales [3 Volumes&amp;#93; - Donald Haase - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ATU 650&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; ''Strong John'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der starke Hans|Der starke Hans]]}}'', KHM 166), and
* ATU 675 ''The Lazy Boy''.

[Annotated translation (English and Portuguese), including full bibliography.]&lt;/ref&gt; he was a corresponding member of the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences]], the foremost academic institution in the Russian Empire.

==Life and career==
Alexander Potebnja was born into a noble family in 1835 on his family's khutir Manev, near the village of Havrylivka in [[Romny]] county, [[Poltava oblast]] . He received his primary education in the Polish school of the city of [[Radom]]. He studied law, history, and philology at Kharkiv University (PH D, 1874). In the early 1860s he was active in the Ukrainophile Kharkiv hromada, wrote a Ukrainian primer for Sunday schools, and took part in folklore expeditions in Poltava and Okhtyrka counties. His teachers were the brothers Peter and Nikolai Lavrov and Professor [[Ambrose Metlinsky]]. He graduated from the University in 1856, served briefly a teacher of literature at a school in Kharkiv, and then in 1861 he defended his master thesis "Certain characters in the Slavic folk poetry," before beginning to lecture at the University of Kharkiv. In 1862 he published his work "Thought and Language", and in the same year he went on a trip abroad. He attended lectures at the [[University of Berlin]], he studied [[Sanskrit]] and visited several Slavic countries. In 1874 he defended his doctoral dissertation entitled "Notes on Russian Grammar". In 1875, he became a professor at Kharkiv University. He also presided over the Kharkiv Historical-Philological Society (1877–90) and was a member of the Czech Scientific Society (from 1887).

===Work===
As a linguist Potebnja specialized in four areas: the [[philosophy of language]], the historical phonetics of the [[East Slavic languages]], etymology, and Slavic historical syntax. His major works on the philosophy of language are ''Mysl’ i iazyk'' (Thought and Language, 5 edns, 1862, 1892, 1913, 1922, 1926); ''O sviazi nekotorykh predstavlenii v iazyke'' (On the Relation among Some Representations in Language, 1864); his doctoral dissertation, ''Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike'' (From Notes on Russian Grammar, vol 1, 1874; repr 1958); and the posthumously published ‘''Iazyk i narodnost''’ (Language and Nationality, in ''Vestnik Evropy'', 1895). He was particularly interested in the relations among language, thought, and reality. Language for him was primarily the means by which the mind ordered the influx of impressions and stimuli. Words carry not only a meaning, but also the past experience of the individual and the nation, through which all new experience is filtered. Thus a word usually has three aspects: an external form, a meaning, and an internal form. It is through the internal form that the objective world is subjectivized. In many cases the internal form is rooted in myth and, hence, acts as a bridge between language and folklore (with its symbols). These ideas constitute the framework of Potebnja's master's thesis, ''O nekotorykh simvolakh v slavianskoi narodnoi poezii'' (On Some Symbols in Slavic Folk Poetry, 1860; expanded edn 1914), and his monumental work ''Obiasneniia malorusskikh i srodnykh narodnykh pesen'' (Explanations of Little Russian and Related Folk Songs, 2 vols, 1883, 1887). With time the consciousness of a word's internal form fades, and one of the tasks of literature is to restore this consciousness. According to this theory, literature is a hierarchy of genres; the simplest ones (the proverb, riddle, and fable) directly recall or renew the word's internal form, and the other genres do so in a more complicated, sometimes hardly detectable, way through a complex system of subjective (in poetry) or seemingly objective (in the novel) images. Potebnia's principal works on this subject were published posthumously: ''Iz lektsii po teorii slovesnosti: Basnia, poslovitsa, pogovorka'' (From Lectures on the Theory of Literature: The Fable, the Adage, the Proverb, 1894; repr 1970; Ukrainian trans 1930), ''Iz zapisok po teorii slovesnosti: Poeziia i proza, tropy i figury, myshlenie poeticheskoe i mificheskoe, prilozheniia'' (From Notes on the Theory of Literature: Poetry and Prose, Tropes and Figures, Poetic and Mythical Thought, Addenda, 1905; repr 1970), and ‘''Chernovyia zametki ''... o L.N. Tolstom i F.M. Dostoevskom’ (Preliminary Remarks ... on L. Tolstoy and F. Dostoevsky) in Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (vol 5 [1914]).

Regarding language as an individual's or a nation's only possible means of perceiving the world and of thinking, Potebnja protested vehemently against denationalization in general and the Russification of Ukrainians in particular, and equated this process with spiritual and intellectual disintegration. Potebnja's philosophy of language is rooted in [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s romantic idealism, but he was also influenced by J. Herbart's and H. Lotze's associative psychology, and particularly by [[Heymann Steinthal]]'s psycholinguistic writings.

Potebnja viewed the history of a language as the history of its dialects and used the concept of phonetic law, although he often tried to find a psychological basis for the concept. He recognized the existence of a proto-Rus’ language, but located the beginning of its disintegration into dialects back in prehistoric times. He made many discoveries in Ukrainian historical phonetics, such as the primordial dž &lt; dj alteration, the so-called second [[pleophony]], and the conditions for the alternation e:o. He was the first to propose the theory that diphthongs were a transitional stage between Old Ukrainian o, e,  and Modern Ukrainian i.

As an etymologist, Potebnja paid much attention to semantic development and the history of words against an expansive historical, folkloric, and psychological background. His major etymological writings were collected in K istorii zvukov russkago iazyka (Toward a History of the Sounds in the Russian Language, vols 2–4, 1880–1, 1883). His annotations to Slovo o polku Ihorevi (1878; repr 1914) are a brilliant synthesis of the etymological, folkloristic, and historical approaches.

From the 1870s Potebnja concentrated on the study of the historical syntax of the Slavic languages against a comparative Indo-European background. His Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike contains his writings on predicate forms and the participle (vol 2, 1874; rev edn 1888; repr 1958), the noun and the adjective (vol 3, 1899; repr 1968), and the verb and indeclinable words (vol 4, 1941; rev edn 1978). Before his work the field of Slavic historical syntax consisted mostly of inventories of constructions collected from literary monuments of various periods. He revised it to create a broadly drawn picture of category and construction changes tied to changes in ways of thinking, by integrating historical, dialectal, and folkloric materials. His comparative analysis uncovered remnants of prehistoric syntax in later constructions and reinterpretations of archaic constructions in later syntactic systems; that is, it demonstrated the historical character of syntactic categories and parts of speech. Anton Budilovich equated Potebnia's contribution to the field of historical syntax with C. Darwin's contribution to the study of the origin of species.

Potebnja was far ahead of his contemporaries and not very popular during his lifetime{{cn|date=December 2012}}. In the field of historical syntax his only immediate followers were A. Popov and, to a certain extent, Dmitrii Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky (in his outline of Russian syntax). His ideas on literature were adopted as a theoretical framework by the ‘Kharkiv school’ (B. Lezin, Vasyl Khartsiiev, A. Gornfeld, T. Rainov, Oleksa Vetukhiv, and others) grouped around the serial Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (8 vols, 1907–23). They also had a significant impact on the aesthetics of the Russian Symbolists (particularly A. Bely) and an indirect influence on the Ukrainian Symbolists. In 1945 the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (now NANU) was named after Potebnia. Collections of his works on accentology (1973) and esthetics and poetics (1976, 1985) have been published.

Chan Chan is located in the mouth of the [[Moche Valley]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1739056|title = Chan Chan: Andean Alternative of the Preindustrial City|last = Moseley|first = Michael|date = 24 January 1975|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.187.4173.219|pmid =|volume=187|pages=219–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the capital of the historical empire of the [[Chimor]] from 900 to 1470,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 23072515|title = Building Chan Chan: A Project Management Perspective|last = Smailes|first = Richard|date = March 2011|journal = Latin American Antiquity|doi = 10.7183/1045-6635.22.1.37|pmid =|volume=22|pages=37–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they were defeated and incorporated into the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Kingdom of Chimor|last = Rowe|first = John|date = 1948|journal = Acta Americana|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimor, a conquest state,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; developed from the [[Chimú culture]] which established itself along the Peruvian coast around 1400 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Incas|last = D'Altroy|first = Terence|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0-631-17677-0|location = Malden, MA|pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chimú tongue, [[Quingnam language|Quingnam]], Chan Chan means "Sun Sun;" it was named for its sunny climate which is cooled year round by a southerly breeze.&lt;ref name="Holstein" /&gt;

Chan Chan is in a particularly arid section of the coastal desert of northern Peru.&lt;ref name="Holstein"&gt;Otto Holstein (1927). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/208132 Chan-Chan: Capital of the Great Chimu]. ''Geographical Review'' {{nobreak|'''17''' (1, January 1927): 36–61.}}  {{doi|10.2307/208132}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of rain in this area, the major source of water for Chan Chan is in the form of rivers carrying [[surface runoff]] from the [[Andes]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This runoff allows for control of land and water through [[Irrigation in Peru|irrigation systems]].

The city of Chan Chan spanned 20&amp;nbsp;km² and had a dense urban center of 6&amp;nbsp;km² which contained extravagant ''ciudadelas''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Ciudadelas'' were large architectural masterpieces which housed plazas, storerooms, and burial platforms for the royals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Prehistory|last = Moore|first = Jerry|publisher = Human Relations Area Files, Inc.|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The splendor of these ''ciudadelas'' suggests their association with the royal class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Housing for the lower classes of Chan Chan's hierarchical society are known as small, irregular agglutinated rooms (SIARs).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because the lower classes were often artisans whose role in the empire was to produce crafts, many of these SIARs were used as workshops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The coordinates chosen at right for the location of Chan Chan were determined using "Figure 1: Archaeological Zone of Chan Chan" from Michael West's article, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/278179 Community Settlement Patterns at Chan Chan, Peru]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 278179|title = Community Settlement Patterns at Chan Chan, Peru|last = West|first = Michael|date = January 1970|journal = [[American Antiquity]]|doi = |pmid =|volume=35|pages=74–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this figure, it can be seen that Verlarde, Laberinto, and Bandelier form the northern border of Chan Chan while Uhle, Chaiguac, Tschudi, and Rivero form its southern flanks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The location chosen for the coordinates is in the center of these cities and so represents a central location for the ruins of Chan Chan amidst this archaeological zone.

== Etymology ==
The name is probabilly derived from the Quingnam "Jiang" or "Chang" which means Sun, from which Chan-Chan would be literally: Sun-Sun. It is hypothesized that its true meaning would be: Great sun, resplendent Sun, splendid sun or refulgent sun (since a typical feature of the [[Quingnam language]] is that the reduplication of a word acquires a new meaning). Another theory says that the name would derive from the term: Shian or Sian. The "Shi" voice translates as Moon and "An" as house, meaning House of the Moon, making known that the Moon was the main deity.

==Brief history==
Chan Chan is believed to have been constructed around 850 AD by the [[Chimú]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abcarch/chan_chan/0|title = Chan Chan|last = Murray|first = T|date = 2001|journal = Encyclopedia of Archaeology: History and discoveries|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Chimor empire capital city with an estimated population of 40,000-60,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the Inca conquered the Chimú around 1470 AD, Chan Chan fell into decline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1535 AD, [[Francisco Pizarro]] founded the Spanish city of Trujillo which pushed Chan Chan further into the shadows.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While no longer a teeming capital city, Chan Chan was still well known for its great riches and was consequently looted by the Spaniards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An indication of the great Chimú wealth is seen in a sixteenth century list of items looted from a burial tomb in Chan Chan; a treasure equivalent to 80,000 pesos of gold was recovered (nearly [http://www.treasurenet.com/forums/inca-treasures/398422-legend-little-gold-fish-idol-treasure-chan-chan-peru.html $5,000,000 US dollars in gold]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1969, Michael Moseley and Carol J. Mackey began excavations of Chan Chan; today these excavations continue under the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Conservation plan===
In 1998, The "Master Plan for Conservation and Management of the Chan Chan Archeological Complex" was drawn up by the Freedom National Culture Institute of [[Peru]] with contributions from the World Heritage Foundation - WHR, ICCROM, and GCI. The plan was approved by the Peruvian Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://whc.unesco.org/document/135239|title = Legal Documentation of the Peruvian Government taking care of Chan Chan|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = |format = .PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of conservation include reinforcement and stabilization of structures of main buildings and around the Tschudi Palace, using a blend of traditional and modern engineering techniques. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Correia|first=M|title=Which course of action for earthen architectural heritage preservation?|date=2012-05-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/b15164-4|work=Rammed Earth Conservation|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780415621250|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan Chan currently has 46 points of critical damage, though the site's total damage far exceeds these points. The regional government of La Libertad is funding conservation efforts at these points. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chan Chan|date=2018-09-16|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chan_Chan&amp;oldid=110650270|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World Heritage Site ====

On 28 November 1986, [[UNESCO]] designated Chan Chan as a [[World Heritage Site]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-11-23-chan-chan-la-ciudadela-de-barro-que-resiste-al-paso-del-tiempo-noticia_543097.html|title =Chan Chan la ciudadela de barro que resiste al paso del tiempo|editor = |accessdate =2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as placed it on the List of World Heritage in Danger. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sakai.claremont.edu/access/content/group/CX_mtg_110866/Week%203%20-%20Readings%20on%20UNESCO,%20Tourism,%20and%20Ruins%20for%20Discussion%20on%20Sept%2024,%202018/Reading%204%20for%20Week%204%20-%20Sept%2025%20-%20World%20Heritage%20and%20Climate%20Change%20UNESCO%20Case%20Studies%20-%20Chapter%204%20_12%20pages_.pdf|title=Login - CAS – Central Authentication Service|last=|first=|date=|website=sakai.claremont.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Heritage Committee's initial recommendations included taking the appropriate measures for conservation, restoration, and management; halting any excavation that did not have accompanying conservation measures; and mitigation of plundering. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sakai.claremont.edu/access/content/group/CX_mtg_110866/Week%203%20-%20Readings%20on%20UNESCO,%20Tourism,%20and%20Ruins%20for%20Discussion%20on%20Sept%2024,%202018/Reading%204%20for%20Week%204%20-%20Sept%2025%20-%20World%20Heritage%20and%20Climate%20Change%20UNESCO%20Case%20Studies%20-%20Chapter%204%20_12%20pages_.pdf|title=Login - CAS – Central Authentication Service|website=sakai.claremont.edu|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pan-American Course on the Conservation and Management of Earthen Architectural and Archaeological Heritage was funded by many institutes coming together, including ICCROM, the Getty Conservation Institute, and the Government of Peru. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Correia|first=M|title=Which course of action for earthen architectural heritage preservation?|date=2012-05-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/b15164-4|work=Rammed Earth Conservation|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780415621250|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Archeological site ==
[[File:Chan Chan Archaeological Zone-110903.jpg|thumb|Walled compounds]]
The archaeological site covers an area of approximately 20 square kilometers, being considered the largest [[adobe]] city on the [[Americas]] and the second on the world.

The walled compounds (palaces) that make up the metropolis are the following:

=== Walled compound Nik An (Ex Tschudi) ===
The walled complex "Nik An" is the greatest in illustration of the importance of water, particularly of the sea, and of the cult that surrounded it in the [[Chimú culture|Chimu culture]]. The high reliefs of the walls represent fish, directed towards the north and the south (what can be interpreted as representation of the two currents that mark the Peruvian coast: that of [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]], cold, that comes from the south and the one of El Niño, hot, that comes from the north), waves, rombito (fishing nets), as well as pelicans and anzumitos (mixture of sea lion and otter).

This coastal society was governed by the powerful Chimucapac and was united by the force of a social control originated in the necessity of a strict management of the water, as well as by the external threats. The "Nik An" complex had a single entrance and high walls up to twelve meters for a better defense, and was wider at its bases (five meters) than at its summits (one meter), in anticipation of possible earthquakes on the seismic coast.

== Architecture ==
{{See also|Incan agriculture|label 1 = Incan Agriculture}}
[[File:MuseoChanChan.jpg|thumb|200px|Museum of Chan Chan.]]
The city has ten walled ''ciudadelas'' which housed ceremonial rooms, burial chambers, temples, reservoirs and residences for the Chimú kings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition to the ''ciudadelas'', other compounds present in Chan Chan include courts, or ''audencias'',&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3629879|title = Socio-Economic Organization of the Moche Valley, Peru, during the Chimu Occupation of Chan Chan|last = Keatinge|first = Richard|date = Winter 1973|journal = Journal of Anthropological Research|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Day|first2 = Kent|volume=29|pages=275–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; small, irregular agglutinated rooms (SIARs) and mounds called ''huacas''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Evidence for the significance of these structures is seen in many funerary ceramics recovered from Chan Chan.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many images seemingly depict structures very similar to ''audencias''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; which indicates the cultural importance of architecture to the Chimú people of Chan Chan. Additionally, it should be noted that the construction of these massive architectural feats indicates that there was a large labor force available at Chan Chan.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This further supports evidence for a hierarchical structure of society in Chan Chan as it was likely that the construction of this architecture was done by the working class.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;


Chan Chan is triangular, surrounded by {{convert|50|–|60|ft|sing=on}} walls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are no enclosures opening north because the north-facing walls have the greatest sun exposure, serving to block wind and absorb sunlight where fog is frequent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The tallest walls shelter against south-westerly winds from the coast. The walls are adobe brick&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; covered with a smooth surface into which intricate designs are carved. The two styles of carving design include a realistic representation of subjects such as birds, fish, and small mammals, as well as a more graphic, stylized representation of the same subjects. The carvings at Chan Chan depict crabs, turtles, and nets for catching sea creatures (such as [[Spondylus]]. Chan Chan, unlike most coastal ruins in [[Peru]], is very close to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Minelli" /&gt;

===Irrigation===
[[File:WaterReserveChanChan.jpg|thumb|Water reserve in Chan Chan.]]
Originally the city relied on wells that were around 15 meters deep.&lt;ref name="Minelli"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-sUwZpIxB6UC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=chan+chan+irrigation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gUGi8D9TI9&amp;sig=tdhvZogjQP3O9H1Kd3I67eFhfG4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-WCPTczIH6TH0QGgzqGxCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chan%20chan%20irrigation&amp;f=false The Inca World: The development of pre-Columbian Peru, A.D. 1000-1534] by Laura Laurencich Minelli, Cecilia Bákula, Mireille Vautier – Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; To increase the farmland surrounding the city, a vast network of canals diverting water from the Moche river were created.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greentracks.com/Chan_Chan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Once these canals were in place, the city had the potential to grow exponentially. Many canals to the north were destroyed by a catastrophic flood around 1100 CE, which was the key motivation for the [[Chimú Culture|Chimú]] to refocus their economy to one rooted in foreign resources rather than in subsistence farming.&lt;ref name=Minelli /&gt;

===Threats===

The ancient structures of Chan Chan are threatened by [[erosion]] due to changes in weather patterns — heavy rains, flooding, and strong winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Endangered-Cultural-Treasures-Chan-Chan-Peru.html# |title=Endangered Site: Chan Chan, Peru |access-date=2009-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206021829/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Endangered-Cultural-Treasures-Chan-Chan-Peru.html# |archive-date=2010-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0903/etc/climate_change.html Climate Change: Sites in Peril]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the city is severely threatened by storms from [[El Niño]], which causes increased precipitation  and flooding on the Peruvian coast.&lt;ref name="Holstein" /&gt; Chan Chan is the largest mud city in the world, and its fragile material is cause for concern. The heavy rains of El [[El Niño|Niño]] damages the base of Chan Chan's structures. Increased rain also leads to increased humidity, and as humidity gathers in the bases of these structures, salt contamination and vegetation growth can occur, which further damage the integrity of Chan Chan's foundations. Global warming will only further these negative impacts, as climate change facilitates increased precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1016759279|title=Nitrogen fixation (Acetylene reduction) in the sediments of the pluss-see : with special attention to the role of sedimentation|last=S.|first=Blauw, T.|oclc=1016759279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
===First adaptation: ''Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory'' (1971)===
{{main|Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory}}
''Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory'' is a 1971 [[Musical film|musical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tim Dirks | title=Musicals–Dance Films | url=http://www.filmsite.org/musicalfilms5.html | work=AMC Filmsite| accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[film adaptation]] of the 1964 novel ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' by Roald Dahl. It was directed by [[Mel Stuart]], and starred [[Gene Wilder]] as Wonka. The film tells the story of Charlie Bucket as he receives a golden ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in [[Munich]] in 1970, and the film was released on June 30, 1971. It received positive reviews, but it was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]] despite the fact that it recouped its budget. However, it developed into a [[cult film]] due to its repeated television airings and home video sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54174|title=Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|website=AFI Catalog of Feature Films|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|author1=Kara K.

===Second adaptation: ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (2005)===
{{main|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)}}
''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' is a 2005 [[film adaptation]] of the 1964 [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. The film was directed by [[Tim Burton]]. The film stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket and [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]]. The storyline concerns Charlie, who takes a tour he has won, led by Wonka, through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world. Development for another adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', filmed previously as ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'', began in 1991, 20 years after the first film version, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl Estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while Warner Bros. either considered or discussed the role of Willy Wonka with [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]] and [[Adam Sandler]]. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Johnny Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' that Elfman contributed to the film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where Burton avoided using digital effects as much as possible. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to critical praise and was a box office success, grossing approximately $475 million worldwide, but received mixed to negative reviews when compared with the original 1971 film.

===Cartoon partial adaptation: ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (2017)===
{{main|Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory}}
A direct-to-video animated crossover film adaptation starring  [[Tom and Jerry]], entitled ''Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'', was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs-tu4fi4zA|publisher=Movieclips Extra|accessdate= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to [[Gene Wilder]], who died less than a year before the release.

===''Willy Wonka's Adventures in Loompaland'' (2020)===
In October 2016 it was confirmed that Warner Bros are planning a prequel film depicting Willy Wonka's "early adventures" prior to the events depicted in the books and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/willy-wonka-new-film-david-heyman-warner-bros-1201894143/|title='Willy Wonka' New Film in the Works from David Heyman and Warner Bros.

==Video games==
{{main|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory video games}}
There are two ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' video games, one made in 1985 and another in 2005. The games are based on the book of the same name.

==Ride==
{{main|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride}}
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride is a [[dark ride]] located in the Cloud Cuckoo Land area of [[Alton Towers]] theme park, [[Staffordshire]], [[England]]. It is based upon the famous [[Roald Dahl]] [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]], and takes its thematic inspiration from the illustrations of [[Quentin Blake]]. The ride is split into two segments, the first being a [[Water ride|boat ride]] along the chocolate river inside [[Willy Wonka]]'s Chocolate Factory. Passengers encounter all the characters from the book (going from Augustus Gloop to Veruca Salt) either as simple animatronics or CGI projections. After disembarking the boats the second segment begins with a short pre-show video (involving Mike Teevee). The video is presented as if the viewers are actually trapped within the TV set. The ride continues inside one of two 'Great Glass Elevators' which simulate passengers taking an airborne trip through the rest of the factory. Each elevator is a static room with semi-translucent walls and ceiling on which CGI animations are projected from the outside, and only the floor trembles slightly to give the impression of movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jul/08/familyholidays.family|title=Alton Towers Theme Park, Staffordshire|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cleo Rickman Fitch''' (June 16, 1910 – January 5, 1995) was an American archaeological researcher who specialized in Roman lamps.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=NYT|title=Obituaries: Cleo Rickman Fitch; Archaeological Researcher, 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/obituaries/cleo-rickman-fitch-archeological-researcher-84.html|website=New York Times|date=January 19, 1995|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Cleo Rickman Fitch was born on June 16, 1910, in Carlsbad, Texas. Her father was a doctor for Southern Pacific Railroad. While living in Carlsbad, he diagnoed himself with incurable diabetes and moved the family moved back to his hometown of [[Chapel Hill, Tennessee]]. Soon after arriving in Tennessee, Fitch's father died and her mother supported the family by teaching school.&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldman|first1=Norma|title=Cleo Rickman Fitch|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Fitch_Cleo%20Rickman.pdf|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitch obtained her bachelor's degree at Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee, studying art and art history.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; She continued her art education at Watkins Institute of Art in Nashville. She married the architect [[James Marston Fitch]] in 1936. In 1945, the couple moved to New York City, where James Fitch took a teaching job at [[Columbia University]]. During World War II, Fitch worked for the Army as an industrial draftsman.&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt;

From 1953 to 1954, Cleo and James Fitch spent a year in Italy. While James Fitch studied architecture, Cleo studied art and sculpture.&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt;

== Archaeological career ==
During their year abroad, Frank Brown, Director of the [[American Academy in Rome]], invited Fitch to join his expedition at the ancient town of [[Cosa]], north of Rome.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt; Fitch was assigned the task of cataloging the excavation materials, which included many terracotta lamps. With her drafting skills, she was also given the responsibility of putting together the building plans for the new museum that Brown, representing the American Academy at Rome, was having built in Cosa&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt;

Each summer for the following 21 years, Fitch made Rome her home and continued her work at the American Academy, reconstructing, drawing and cataloguing the lamp fragments from the Costa excavation site. "From the over-view of all of the lamps from the c. 700 years of the history of the site, it is possible to see the entire history of the Roman lamp industry."&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt;

In 1979, Dr.[Norma Goldman of [[Wayne State University]] joined Fitch in her work. Their collaborative effort resulted in the publication of ''Costa: The Lamps'' in 1994, part of the American Academy Series published by the University of Michigan Press.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Fitch died January 5, 1995, in Manhattan, New York.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5793">{{short description|Political theory of beneficial opposing forces}}
'''Countervailing Power''', or '''countervailence''', is the idea in political theory of institutionalized mechanisms that the wielding of power within a [[polity]] having two or more centers can, and often does, provide counter-forces that usefully oppose each other.  This political organization stands in contrast to polities such as principalities where "various princes were absolute rulers in their domain"&lt;ref name=gordon1999ch4/&gt; or in modern examples of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments.

==History==

Countervailance in formal political theory dates back at least to Medieval times, especially in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant Reformation|early Protestant]] movements, not all of which were successful in achieving their own ends.
The [[Conciliar movement|Conciliar Movement]], although ultimately ending in failure to reform the Catholic church, "raised issues that are fundamental in all domains of social organization, and it contributed to the understanding of the general principle of countervailance, which eventually became the foundation of modern [[constitutionalism]]."&lt;ref name=gordon1999ch4&gt;
{{cite book |last=Gordon|first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |chapter=Countervailance Theory in Medieval Law, Catholic Ecclesiology, and Huguenot Political Theory |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-16987-5 |pages=116–128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OTyH71czwsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=countervailance&amp;f=false |quote=''the Republic of Venice ... city-state constructed a political system based firmly on the principle of countervailance''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, "Countervailing Power" is a theory of political modification of markets, formulated by American [[economist]] [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in his 1952 book ''[[American Capitalism]]''.  In the classic liberal economy, goods and services are provided and prices set by free bargaining.  According to Galbraith, modern economies give massive powers to large business corporations to bias this process, and there arise 'countervailing' powers in the form of trade unions, citizens' organizations and so on, to offset business's excessive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/countervailing-power.php EconomyProfessor.com], Retrieved 2008-08-25  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829132038/http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/countervailing-power.php |date=August 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 126 of this book, Galbraith elaborates on countervailing power in the sphere of economics when he states:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The development of countervailing power requires a certain minimum opportunity and capacity for organization, corporate or otherwise. If the large retail buying organizations had not developed the countervailing power which they have used, by proxy, on behalf of the individual consumer, consumers would have been faced with the need to organize the equivalent of the retailer's power. This would have been a formidable task but it has been accomplished in Scandinavia where the consumer's co-operative, instead of the chain store, is the dominant instrument of countervailing power in consumers' goods markets."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seventeenth century England was an active time for the development of countervailance theory.  Although much political discourse during the period was focused on the matter of ''sovereignty'', or [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism for the sovereign]] as, for example, we observe in the writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]], the principle "significance of seventeenth-century England for [[Constitutionalism|constitutional theory]] was that during this period the concept of sovereignty was ''replaced'' by the concept of [[checks and balances]]."&lt;ref name=gordon1999ch7/&gt;
The evolution of political practice in England paralleled the evolution in theory, for it was during this period that "the operational dynamics of the system developed in accordance with the countervailance model of government."&lt;ref name=gordon1999ch7/&gt;
While the trend reversed somewhat under the power of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the era of the [[Stuart period|later Stuarts]], and was therefore rather uneven over the flow of the 17th century, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 "firmly established the principles of dispersed power and checks and balances as the central pillars of [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|English constitutionalism]]."&lt;ref name=gordon1999ch7&gt;
{{cite book |last=Gordon|first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |chapter=The Development of Constitutional Government and Countervailance Theory in Seventeenth-Century England |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-16987-5 |pages=223–283 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OTyH71czwsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=countervailance&amp;f=false |quote=''The toleration of an aberrant religion means that its adherents are left free to preach, publish and organize.  Where such freedoms exist for religious groups, the cannot be effectively denied to citizens who have other agendas. ... During the eighteenth century, the countervailance model of British government was embraced by all the major writers on the subject.  It appears to have been generally accepted until Walter Bagehot and A.V. Dicey initiated in the nineteenth century a reinterpretation of the English constitution in terms of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[idolatry]] and [[iconodule|iconodulism]], '''epeolatry''' literally means the worship of words. It derives from {{lang|grc|ἔπος}} ({{lang|grc|épos}}), which unlike {{lang|grc|λόγος}} ({{lang|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) more specifically means ''word'' in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], and was apparently coined in 1860 by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Oliver Wendell, Sr. |author-link=Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. |year=1860 |title=The Professor at the Breakfast Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European Americans''' (also referred to as '''Euro-Americans''') are [[Americans]] of [[Europe]]an ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Merriam Webster Dictionary |title=Euro-American |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euro-american |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OJilCCGFCTYC&amp;pg=PR9 Ethnic Groups of the Americas: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia:] By James B. Minahan – Americans of European descent (Page: 17-18)&lt;/ref&gt; This term includes people who are descended from the first European settlers in America and as well as people who are descended from more recent European arrivals. Euro-Americans are the largest [[panethnicity|panethnic group]] in the United States, both historically and at present.

The [[Spanish Americans|Spaniards]] are thought to be the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the [[contiguous United States]], with [[Martín de Argüelles]] ({{abbr|b.|born}}&amp;nbsp;1566) in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], then a part of [[Spanish Florida]].&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/colonial/jb_colonial_augustin_1.html |title=A Spanish Expedition Established St. Augustine in Florida |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWX5d27NkFgC&amp;pg=PT35 |title=Latino Chronology |work=''google.co.uk'' |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Dare]] ({{abbr|b.|born}}&amp;nbsp;August 18, 1587) on [[Roanoke Colony]], present-day [[North Carolina]] was the first [[English people|English]] child and girl, in a late 16th-century attempt by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] to establish a permanent [[English overseas possessions|English settlement]] in North America.

In the 2016 [[American Community Survey]], [[German Americans]] (13.9%), [[Irish Americans]] (10.0%), [[English Americans]] (7.4%), [[Italian Americans]] (5.2%), and [[Polish Americans]] (3%) were the five largest self-reported European ancestry groups in the United States forming over a third of the total population.&lt;ref name="factfinder.census.gov"&gt;[https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE UNITED STATES] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129212537/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk |date=January 29, 2017 }} - 2016 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the English Americans and [[British Americans]] demography is considered by some to be under-counted, as the people in that demographic tend to identify themselves simply as [[American ethnicity|Americans]] (20,151,829 or 7.2%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57 Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

=== Use ===
In 1995, as part of a review of the [[Office of Management and Budget]]'s Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting), a survey was conducted of census recipients to determine their preferred terminology for the racial/ethnic groups defined in the Directive. For the ''White'' group, ''European American'' came third, preferred by 2.35% of panel interviewees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.bls.census.gov/cps/pub/ethnic_0595.htm |title=A Test of Methods For Collecting Racial and Ethnic Information: May 1995 |publisher=CPS Publications |date=October 26, 1995 |accessdate=March 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212044012/http://www.bls.census.gov/cps/pub/ethnic_0595.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes used interchangeably with Caucasian American, White American, and [[Anglo-America|Anglo American]] in many places around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |author1=Sandra Soo-Jin Lee |author2=Joanna Mountain |author3=Barbara A.

''European American'', when used properly, has a more specific definition and scope.

The term is used by some to emphasize the European cultural and geographical ancestral origins of Americans, in the same way as is done for [[African Americans]] and [[Asian Americans]]. A European American awareness is still notable because 90% of the respondents classified as white in the U.S. Census knew{{clarify|date=October 2015}} their European ancestry.&lt;ref name=Randolph&gt;{{cite web |last=Randolph |first=Gayle |publisher=Iowa State University |title=Why Study European Immigrants |year=2007 |accessdate=June 14, 2007 |url=http://frontpage.uwsuper.edu/Soc330b/Chap11_files/frame.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050506011524/http://frontpage.uwsuper.edu/Soc330b/Chap11_files/frame.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 6, 2005 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the concept of an American originated in the United States as a person of European ancestry, thus excluding African Americans, Jews, and Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Crevecoeur, Hector St. John. Letters from an American Farmer. "What is an American." 1782.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[linguistics|linguistic]] concern, the term is sometimes meant to discourage a [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] view of the [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] landscape between the white category and everyone else.&lt;ref name=Bhopal&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhopal, Raj. |title=White, European, Western, Caucasian or What?

Since 1607, some 57 million immigrants have come to the United States from other lands. Approximately 10&amp;nbsp;million passed through on their way to some other place or returned to their original homelands, leaving a net gain of some 47&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-y_q4J_eCEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=52+million+europeans+immigrated+to+united+states&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The New Americans |work=''google.co.uk'' |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial settlers ===
Between 1607 and 1776 most European settlements were British. Colonial stock of [[English Americans|English]], [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], [[Cornish Americans|Cornish]] or [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]] descent, may be found throughout the country but is especially dominant in [[New England]] and [[Southern United States|the South]]. Some people of colonial stock, especially in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], are also of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Germans|German]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] descent. The vast majority of these are [[Protestant]]s. The [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] ([[German American]]) population gave the state of [[Pennsylvania]] a high German cultural character. [[French people|French]] descent, which can also be found throughout the country, is most concentrated in [[Louisiana]], while [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent is dominant in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and [[Florida]]. These are primarily [[Roman Catholic]] and were assimilated with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the aftermath of the [[Mexican–American War]] and [[Adams–Onís Treaty]], respectively.

===1820-1890===
The first large wave of European migration after the Revolutionary War came from Northern and Central-Western Europe between about 1820 and 1890. Most of these immigrants were from [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and Britain, and with large numbers of Irish and German Catholics immigrating, Roman Catholicism became an important minority religion. [[Polish Americans]] usually used to come as German or Austrian citizens, since Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]] in the period between 1772 and 1795. Descendants of the first wave are dominant in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]], although German descent is extremely common in Pennsylvania, and Irish descent is also common in urban centers in the Northeast. The [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans]] held onto their ethnic identity throughout the 19th and early half of the 20th centuries, as well as other European ethnic groups. Most people of Polish origin live in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the Midwest (see also [[White ethnic]]).

===Second wave 1890-1920===

The second wave of European Americans arrived from the mid-1890s to the 1920s, mainly from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Ireland.&lt;ref name=Randolph /&gt; This wave included [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italians]], [[Greeks]], [[Hungarians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Romanians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and other [[Slavs]]. With large numbers of immigrants from [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Spanish Caribbean]], and [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanics]] have increased to 8% of the US population, and [[Texas]], [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Florida]] are important centers for them. 

===Shifts in European migration===
Before 1881, the vast majority of immigrants, almost 86% of the total, arrived from [[northwest Europe]], principally [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], and [[Scandinavia]]. The years between 1881 and 1893 the pattern shifted, in the sources of U.S. "New immigration".
Between 1894 and 1914, immigrants from [[Southern Europe|southern]], [[Central Europe|central]], and [[eastern Europe]] accounted for 69% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Raymond L.

[[File:Top of Rock Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[New York City Metropolitan Area]] is home to the largest European population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/table2_2.xls |title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2011 Supplemental Table 2 |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The numbers below give numbers of European Americans as measured by the U.S. Census in 1980, 1990, and 2000. The numbers are measured according to declarations in census responses. This leads to uncertainty over the real meaning of the figures: For instance, as can be seen, according to these figures, the European American population dropped 40 million in ten years, but in fact, this is a reflection of changing census responses. In particular, it reflects the increased popularity of the "American" option following its inclusion as an example in the 2000 census forms.

Breakdowns of the European American population into sub-components is a difficult and rather arbitrary exercise. Farley (1991) argues that "because of ethnic intermarriage, the numerous generations that separate respondents from their forebears and the apparent unimportance to many whites of European origin, responses appear quite inconsistent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farley, Reynolds |year=1991 |title=The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us? |journal=Demography |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=411–429 |doi=10.2307/2061465 |jstor=2061465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, a large majority of European Americans have ancestry from a number of different countries and the response to a single "ancestry" gives little indication of the backgrounds of Americans today. When only prompted for a single response, the examples given on the census forms and a pride in identifying the more distinctive parts of one's heritage are important factors; these will likely adversely affect the numbers reporting ancestries from the British Isles. Multiple response ancestry data often greatly increase the numbers reporting for the main ancestry groups, although Farley goes as far to conclude that "no simple question will distinguish those who identify strongly with a specific European group from those who report symbolic or imagined ethnicity." He highlights responses in the Current Population Survey (1973) where for the main "old" ancestry groups (e.g., German, Irish, English, and French), over 40% change their reported ancestry over the six-month period between survey waves (page 422).

An example is that in 1980 23.75&amp;nbsp;million Americans claimed English ancestry and 25.85 claimed English ancestry together with one or more other. This represents 49.6&amp;nbsp;million people. The table below shows that in 1990 when only single and primary responses were allowed this fell to 32 million and in 2000 to 24&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;World Culture Encyclopedia [http://www.everyculture.com/North-America/European-Americans-Bibliography.html EveryCulture.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155437/http://www.everyculture.com/North-America/European-Americans-Bibliography.html |date=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest self-reported ancestries in 2000, reporting over 5 million members, were in order: German, Irish, English, American, Italian, French, and Polish. They have different distributions within the United States; in general, the northern half of the United States from [[Pennsylvania]] westward is dominated by German ancestry, and the [[Southern United States|southern-half]] by English and American. Irish may be found throughout the entire country.

Italian ancestry is most common in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], Polish in the [[Great Lakes Region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] and the Northeast, and French in [[New England]] and [[Louisiana]].  U.S. Census Bureau statisticians estimate that approximately 62 percent of European Americans today are either wholly or partly of English, Welsh, Irish, or Scottish ancestry.  Approximately 86% of European Americans today are of northwestern and central European ancestry, and 14% are of southeastern European and [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanic and Latino American]] descent.

== Cultural icons and symbols ==
[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|right|American cultural icons, [[apple pie]], [[baseball]], and the [[American flag]]. All have European influence primarily from the British.]]

The culture of the Americans of European descent, European-American culture, is the [[culture of the United States]]. As the largest component of the American population, the overall American culture deeply reflects the European-influenced culture that predates the United States of America as an independent state. Much of American culture shows influences from the diverse nations of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], such as the [[English Americans|English]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Cornish Americans|Cornish]], [[Manx Americans|Manx]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] and [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]]. Colonial ties to [[Great Britain]] spread the [[English language]], legal system and other cultural attributes.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk" /&gt; Scholar [[David Hackett Fischer]] asserts in ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'' that the folkways of four groups of people who moved from distinct regions of the [[United Kingdom]] to the [[United States]] persisted and provide a substantial cultural basis for much of the modern [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer explains "the origins and stability of a social system which for two centuries has remained stubbornly [[democracy|democratic]] in its politics, [[capitalism|capitalist]] in its economy, [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in its laws and [[individualism|individualist]] in its society and [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] in its culture."&lt;ref&gt;Hackett Fischer, David. ''Albion's Seed'' Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the European-American cultural lineage can be traced back to [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Northern Europe]], which is institutionalized in the government, traditions, and civic education in the United States.&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;Kirk, Russell. The Heritage Lecture Series. "America Should Strengthen its European Cultural Roots." Washington D.C:1949&lt;/ref&gt;
Since most later European Americans have assimilated into American culture, most European Americans now generally express their individual ethnic ties sporadically and symbolically and do not consider their specific ethnic origins to be essential to their identity; however, European American ethnic expression has been revived since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Randolph /&gt; Some European Americans such as [[Italian American|Italians]], [[Greek Americans]], [[Polish Americans]], [[German Americans|Germans]], [[Ukranian Americans|Ukranians]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and others have maintained high levels of ethnic identity. Same applied to [[Polish Americans]]. In the 1960s, Mexican Americans, Jewish Americans, and African Americans started exploring their cultural traditions as the ideal of cultural pluralism took hold.&lt;ref name=Randolph /&gt; European Americans followed suit by exploring their individual cultural origins and having less shame of expressing their unique cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=Randolph /&gt;

The [[Solutrean hypothesis]] suggested that Europeans may have been among the first in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=February 19, 2006 |url=http://www.livescience.com/7043-americans-european.html |title=First Americans may have been European |publisher=Life Science |accessdate=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Conner |first=Steve, Science Editor |date=December 3, 2002 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/stross/ant322m_files/1stpersons.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040302011546/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/stross/ant322m_files/1stpersons.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2004 |title=Does skull prove that the first Americans came from Europe? |publisher=utexas.edu |accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earliest humans in the Americas: new evidence from Mexico, Journal of Human Evolution 44, 379-387.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has argued this not to be the case and that the founding Native American population came from Siberia through Beringia.

=== American flag ===
* '''[[Flag of the United States]]''' – Based on the first flag of the [[United States of America]] the [[Grand Union Flag]] was first flown on December 2, 1775.

=== Law ===
The [[Law of the United States|American legal system]] also has its roots in [[France|French]] philosophy with the separation of powers and the federal system&lt;ref&gt;[[Separation of powers#Checks and balances]]&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[English law]] in common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llrx.com/features/otherthanenglish.htm |title=Features – Sources of United States of America Legal Information in Languages Other than English – LLRX.com |accessdate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140249/http://www.llrx.com/features/otherthanenglish.htm |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, elements of the [[Magna Carta]] in it contain provisions on criminal law that were incorporated into the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of the United States}}
* '''[[Apple pie]]''' – [[New England]] was the first region to experience large-scale [[English colonial empire|English colonization]] in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by [[East Anglia]]n Calvinists, better known as the [[Puritan]]s. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially "American", such as [[apple pie]] and the oven-roasted [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, pp. 74, 114, 134–39.&lt;/ref&gt; "As American as apple pie" is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American.
* '''[[Hamburger]]''' – Invented in the [[United States]] and known as "Hamburger" after [[Germans|German]] immigrants from [[Hamburg]] who named the unnamed food,&lt;ref&gt;according to a theory; see [[Hamburger]]&lt;/ref&gt; this cultural and widely known icon has trans international reach and has been internationally known for decades as a symbol of American [[fast food]].
* '''[[Maxwell Street Polish]]''' – Consists of a grilled or fried length of [[kielbasa|Polish sausage]] topped with grilled [[onion]]s and [[Mustard (condiment)|yellow mustard]] and optional pickled whole, green [[sport pepper]]s, served on a bun. The sandwich traces its origins to [[Chicago]]'s [[Maxwell Street]] market, and has been called one of "the classic foods synonymous with Chicago".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Sandy Thorne. (June 26, 2006), "Getting a taste of Chicago: City's signature flavors have tourists and locals lining up for more, more, more", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', S1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Buffalo wings]]''' – Invented in 1964 at [[Anchor Bar]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] by Italian-American Teressa Bellissimo. Now popular all over the country it has become a symbol of American cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mz5tt-4yHIQC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=teressa+bellissimo+italian+buffalo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij-ZWD3-neAhVHJsAKHZq3CJQQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=teressa%20bellissimo%20italian%20buffalo&amp;f=false The Italian American Cookbook: A Feast of Food from a Great American Cooking] - By John Mariani, Galina Mariani&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thanksgiving ===
* '''[[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]''' – In the United States, it has become a national secular holiday (official since [[Thanksgiving (United States)|1863]]) with religious origins. The first Thanksgiving was celebrated by [[English people|English]] settlers to give thanks to God and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for helping the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] of [[Plymouth Colony]] survive the brutal winter.&lt;ref&gt;William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620–1647, 85&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Thanksgiving holiday traces its origins from a 1621 celebration at the Plymouth Plantation, where the Plymouth settlers held a harvest feast with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] after a successful growing season. [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] is credited as the first to proclaim the American cultural event which is generally referred to as the "[[Thanksgiving#The "First" Thanksgiving?|First Thanksgiving]]".

=== Sports ===
{{Main|Origins of baseball}}
* '''[[Baseball]]''' – The earliest recorded game of base-ball involved none other than the family of the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince of Wales]], played indoors in London in November 1748. The Prince is reported as playing "Bass-Ball" again in September 1749 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, against Lord Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why isn't baseball more popular in the UK?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23425907|accessdate=March 1, 2018|first=Nate|last=Sulat|work=[[BBC News Online]]|location=New York|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on [[Easter Monday]] 1755 in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]]; Bray's diary was verified as authentic in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7622026.stm |title=UK – England – Baseball 'origin' uncovered |publisher=BBC |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |date=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southtoday/content/articles/2008/09/09/baseball_feature.shtml |title=BBC – South Today – Features – Baseball history |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by English immigrants. The first appearance of the term that exists in print was in "[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]" in 1744, where it is called Base-Ball. Today, [[Rounders]] which has been played in England since [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times holds a similarity to Baseball. Although, literary references to early forms of "base-ball" in England pre-date use of the term "rounders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/baseball/2799671/Major-League-Baseball-told-Your-sport-is-British-not-American.html |title=Major League Baseball told: Your sport is British, not American |author=Telegraph staff and agencies |date=September 11, 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[American football]]''' – can be traced to modified early versions of [[rugby football]] played in [[England]] and [[Canadian football]] mixed with and ultimately changed by [[United States|American]] innovations which led over time to the finished version of the game from 1876 to now. The basic set of rules were first developed in American universities in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhBw1RpvhLwC&amp;pg=PA89 |title=The New American Sport History |work=''google.co.uk'' |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
Another area of cultural influence are [[American patriotic music|American Patriotic songs]]:
* '''[[The Star-Spangled Banner|American National Anthem]]''' – takes its melody from the 18th-century English song "[[To Anacreon in Heaven]]" written by [[John Stafford Smith]] from England for the [[Anacreontic Society]], a men's social club in London and lyrics written by [[Francis Scott Key]]. This became a well-known and recognized patriotic song throughout the United States, which was officially designated as the American national anthem in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Stafford Smith: Composer of the Star Spangled Banner |url=http://www.visit-gloucestershire.co.uk/gloucester/smith.htm |publisher=visit-gloucestershire.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711181457/http://www.visit-gloucestershire.co.uk/gloucester/smith.htm |archivedate=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcpl.net/~etowner/anthem.html |title=Fort McHenry: Birthplace of Our National Anthem |work=''bcpl.net'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721004503/http://www.bcpl.net/~etowner/anthem.html |archivedate=July 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemplator.com/america/ssbanner.html |title=Star Spangled Banner |author=Lesley Nelson |work=''contemplator.com'' |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom.

* '''[[Amazing Grace]]''' – written by English poet and [[clergyman]] [[John Newton]]. Popular among [[African Americans]], it became an icon in American culture and has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=894060 |title=Amazing Grace |date=December 29, 2002 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Hail, Columbia]]''' – initial presidential inauguration song up until early 20th century. Now used for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].
* '''[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]''' – Patriotic song sung during the civil war time between 1861 and 1865.

=== Automotive industry ===
* '''[[Buick]]''' – [[David Dunbar Buick]] was a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born American, a [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]-based inventor, best known for founding the Buick Motor Company.
* '''[[Chevrolet]]''' – [[Louis Chevrolet]] was a [[Swiss Americans|Swiss]]-born American race car driver who co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Car Company in 1911.
* '''[[Harley-Davidson]]''' – The Davidson brothers were of Scottish descent (William. A., Walter and [[Arthur Davidson (motorcycling)|Arthur Davidson]]) and [[William S. Harley]] of English descent. Along with [[Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company]] was the largest and most recognizable American [[motorcycle]] manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clutchandchrome.com/Articles/Littleport.htm |title=Harley: The Littleport Connection "Without Littleport, there'd be no Harley-Davidson" |publisher=clutchandchrome.com |accessdate=March 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421100954/http://clutchandchrome.com/Articles/Littleport.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notes ===
* [[Jewish Americans]], particularly those of [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] descent, are a diaspora population with origins in [[Middle East|South Western Asia]], but are often classified as White rather than Asian. In addition, all of the original peoples of the Middle East are classified as White by the US Census Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=humbiol_preprints |title=No Evidence from Genome-Wide Data of a Khazar Origin for the Ashkenazi Jews |format=PDF |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1312/1312.6639.pdf |title=Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans |format=PDF |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roma in the United States|Gypsy Americans]] are a diaspora group with origins in the Indian Subcontinent, but are sometimes classified as European.

== Notable people ==
=== Presidents heritage ===
Most of the heritage that all 44 [[President of the United States|US Presidents]] come from (or in some combination thereof): is [[British people|British]] ([[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] or [[Welsh people|Welsh]]) ancestry. Others include [[John F. Kennedy]] of Irish descent, [[Martin Van Buren]] of Dutch descent and three presidents whose fathers were of German descent: [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (whose original family name was ''Eisenhauer''),[[Herbert Hoover]] (''Huber''), and [[Donald Trump]]. Later US Presidents' ancestry can often be traced to ancestors from multiple nations in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/presidents/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210002715/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/presidents/ |archivedate=February 10, 2006 |publisher=americanheritage.com |title=The Presidents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admixture in Non-Hispanic Whites ==
Some White Americans have varying amounts of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry. In a recent study, Gonçalves et al. 2007 reported [[Haplogroup L (mtDNA)|Sub-Saharan]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDna]] lineages at a frequency of 3.1% (respectively 0.9% and 2.2%) in American Caucasians (Please note that in the USA, "Caucasian" includes people from North Africa and Western Asia as well as Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Sample of 1387 American Caucasian individuals catalogued in the FBI mtDNA population database, Gonçalves et al. 2007, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17573655 Sex-biased gene flow in African Americans but not in American Caucasians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108005424/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17573655 |date=November 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on Y-chromosomes and mtDNA detected no African admixture in European-Americans.

Shriver]] showed an average of 0.7% Sub-Saharan African admixture and 3.2% Native American admixture.&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, et al., "[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38568440/admixture/shriver01.pdf Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230031612/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38568440/admixture/shriver01.pdf |date=December 30, 2014 }}, ''[[Human Genetics (journal)|Hum Genet]]'' (2003) 112 : 387–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The same author, in another study, claimed that about 30% of all White Americans, approximately 66 million people, have a median of 2.3% of [[Black Africa]]n admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Steve Sailer |author=Sailer, Steve |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/05/08/Analysis-White-prof-finds-hes-not-2/UPI-53561020909970 |title=Analysis: White prof finds he's not. |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=May 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Shriver retracted his statement, saying that actually around 5% of White Americans exhibit some detectable level of African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wootan |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Wooten |url=http://abcnews.go.com/sections/Nightline/SciTech/racial_identity_031228.html |title=Race Reversal Man Lives as 'Black' for 50 Years – Then Finds Out He's Probably Not |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=December 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803055203/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/Nightline/SciTech/racial_identity_031228.html |archivedate=August 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[23andMe]] database, about 5 to at least 13 percent of self-identified White American Southerners have greater than 1 percent African ancestry.&lt;ref name=23andme /&gt; [[Southern United States|Southern states]] with the highest African American populations, tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry.&lt;ref name="Hadly"&gt;Scott Hadly, "Hidden African Ancestry Redux", ''[http://blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/dna-usa-2/ DNA USA*] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322002312/http://blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/dna-usa-2/ |date=March 22, 2015 }}'', [[23andMe]], March 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; White Americans (European Americans) on average are: "98.6 percent European, 0.19 percent African and 0.18 percent Native American." Inferred British/Irish ancestry is found in European Americans from all states at mean proportions of
above 20%, and represents a majority of ancestry, above 50% mean proportion, in states such
as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Scandinavian
ancestry in European Americans is highly localized; most states show only trace mean
proportions of Scandinavian ancestry, while it comprises a significant proportion, upwards of
10%, of ancestry in European Americans from Minnesota and the Dakotas.&lt;ref name=23andme&gt;{{cite biorxiv |biorxiv=009340 |title=The genetic ancestry of African, Latino, and European Americans across the United States |year=2014 |last1=Bryc |first1=Katarzyna |last2=Durand |first2=Eric Y |last3=MacPherson |first3=J Michael |last4=Reich |first4=David |last5=Mountain |first5=Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadly" /&gt;

A '''feature''' in archaeology and especially [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] is a collection of one or more [[archaeological context|contexts]] representing some human non-portable activity that generally has a [[vertical direction|vertical]] characteristic to it in relation to site [[stratification (archaeology)|stratigraphy]]. Examples of features are [[Cut (archaeology)|pits]], walls, and ditches. General [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] elements in the stratigraphic [[sequence (archaeological)|sequence]], such as layers, dumps, or surfaces are ''not'' referred to as features. Examples of surfaces include yards, roads, and floors. Features are distinguished from [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in that they cannot be separated from their location without changing their form. 

Features ''tend'' to have an intrusive characteristic or associated [[cut (archaeology)|cuts]]. This is not definitive as surfaces can be referred to as features of a building and free standing structures with no [[Cut (earthmoving)|construction cut]] can still be features. [[Midden]]s (dump deposits) are also referred to as features due to their discrete boundaries.  This is seen in comparison to leveling dumps, which stretch out over a substantial portion of a site. The concept of a feature is, to a certain degree, fuzzy, as it will change depending on the scale of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].

== Generic feature types ==
Features specific to certain architecture types or eras such as [[megalithic architectural elements|trilithon]] for the purposes of this article are not considered generic. Generic features are feature types that can come from a broad section in time of the [[archaeological record]] if not all of it. Generic types can include:
#[[Cut (archaeology)|Cut]]s
#[[Cut (archaeology)#Re-cuts|Re-cuts]]
#Pits
#[[Posthole|Post holes]]
#Stake holes
#Construction cuts
#Robber trenches
#[[Wall]]s
#[[Foundation (architecture)|Foundations]]
#[[Ditch]]es
#[[Drainage|Drains]]
#[[Water well|Wells]]
#[[Cistern]]s
#[[Hearth]]s
#Stairs and steps
#[[Enclosure (archaeology)|Enclosures]]
#[[Lynchet]]s
#[[Grave (burial)|Graves]]
#[[Burial]]s
#[[Midden]]s

The '''Guild of Romanists''' or '''Confrérie van romanisten''' was a society which was active in [[Antwerp]] from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and [[artist]]s of Antwerp who had visited [[Rome]] and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.&lt;ref name=lux&gt;Rengenier C. Rittersma, ''Luxury in the Low Countries: Miscellaneous Reflections on Netherlandish Material Culture, 1500 to the Present'', Asp / Vubpress / Upa, 2010, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] under the patronage of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul).  It was a condition of membership to have visited [[Rome]].  The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.

The membership included [[Canon (priest)|canons]], prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists.  Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. 
[[File:Rubens apostel paulus grt.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul by Rubens]]

After 1680 the Confrérie went into decline.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;  The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades.  It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal.  The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]].

A Magistrate Book (1576), the "LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen, Sint-Joriskerk – De broederschappen actief in de kerk
Centrum - Mechels Plein, 2000 Antwerpen, at the site of topa.be {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons.&lt;ref name=Tim&gt;Bert Timmermans. ''Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld'', Amsterdam University Press, Antwerp, 2008, pp. 243-245&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar social mediation role was played by the [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] and in particular the [[Violieren]], which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]].   Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.

The non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food.  The dinner was hosted at different locations.&lt;ref name=Tim/&gt;

The Confrérie further allowed "'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;David Jaffé (ed), ''Rubens, A Master in the Making'', The National Gallery Company/Yale, p. 11 London 2005, {{ISBN|1-85709-326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of European Studies''' is a unit of the [[Jagiellonian University]], having its roots in the Inter-Faculty Department for European Studies which was founded in 1993. It was the first [[Institute|university Institute]] in Poland committed to the study of European integration.

The primary seat of the Institute is the Przegorzały Castle located on the top of a hill on the outskirts of the Wolski Woods, about 20 minutes from the centre of [[Kraków]], with a smaller Centre for European Studies on ul Garbarska in the city centre. 

The JU Institute of European Studies is a partner institution of the [[Europaeum]].

== Structure ==

* Centre for European Culture and Society
* Centre for European Heritage
* Centre for European Philosophy
* Centre for the EU Political System
* Department of Central European History and Culture
* Department of European History
* Department of the EU Financial System
* Central and Eastern European Studies
* European Consultation Centre

The Institute is closely connected with the '''JU Centre for Holocaust Studies''' and shares one seat with the Centre. The Centre for Holocaust Studies is the only university institution in [[Kraków]] committed to the study of the [[Holocaust]]. Before the Centre was established, Holocaust Studies Department was a part of the Institute of European Studies. 

The Centre cooperates with main Holocaust Studies institutions in the world, including [[Yad Vashem]] and the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp]]. International Summer School "Teaching the Holocaust" is organised in cooperation with the [[American Jewish University]].

== Study programmes ==

The Institute conducts a wide range of study programmes in Polish and in English, including MA programmes in European Studies, European Governance, [[Erasmus_Mundus#Euroculture|Euroculture]] or [[Erasmus_Mundus#IMESS: International Masters in Economy, State and Society|Economy, State and Society]], many of them organised in cooperation with foreign partner institutions.

The '''Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew:]] תחרות קריקטורות אנטישמיות ישראלית) was initiated by two [[Israel]]i artists in response to the [[Muhammad cartoons controversy]] and the subsequent [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition|"Holocaust Cartoon Competition"]] by the [[Iran]]ian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]''. Illustrator Amitai Sandy announced the contest on the website of his [[Tel Aviv]]-based graphic arts company on February 14, 2006, stating, "We'll show the world we can do the best, sharpest, most offensive Jew hating cartoons ever published! No Iranian will beat us on our home turf!" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/TA-artist-takes-on-Iranian-cartoons  TA artist takes on Iranian cartoons]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' reported Sandy as saying that his intention was to challenge bigotry by using humour.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} According to ''[[Haaretz]]'', within three days of the announcement of the contest Sandy was interviewed by more than thirty daily newspapers, as well as two television channels and a radio program broadcast on 450 local stations in the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

On April 6, the winner was announced on the contest homepage: "'''Fiddler on the Roof.'''" It depicted a fiddler on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnd.com/2006/04/35834/#XOYrgLCeVGiFt7dm.99  'Fiddler' 9-11 spoof wins anti-Semitic cartoon contest]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common themes through the cartoons included [[Hegemony|world domination]], the myth of Jews having horns, the [[Holocaust]] (and its [[Holocaust denial|denial]]), and the [[blood libel]], all of which were familiar staples or topics of antisemitism. Many of those staples were [[antisemitic canard|canards]] as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Komafest''' (Norwegian: Coma party) was an [[urban art]] and [[graffiti]] event organized in [[Vardø]], Norway. Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5–21 July 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6159982.ece] Finnmarken: Fiskerens gudinne ble til kunst&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist "[[Pøbel]]". Participating artists were [[Steve Powers (artist)|Stephen Powers]] (United States), "[[Vhils]]" ([[Portugal]]), "[[ROA (artist)|Roa]]" (Belgium), Atle Østrem (Norway), "Ethos" ([[Brazil]]), "E. B. Itso", "Husk mit navn" (both Denmark), "Horfe", Ken Sortais, "Remed" (all France) and Conor Harrington (Ireland).

==Background==

Vardø is Norway's north-easternmost town. Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vardø had 2,122 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssb.no/emner/02/02/folkendrhist/tabeller/tab/2002.html] Statistics Norway (''Statistisk sentralbyrå'')&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the population decline, Vardø was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. "Pøbel" wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the "Getto spedalsk" ("Ghetto leperous") project, where he and collaborator "[[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]]" painted abandoned buildings in at the [[Lofoten islands]].

After securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name "Komafest" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6124905.ece] Finnmarken: Tar street art til verdens ende&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moving bus Vardø komafest.jpg|thumb|right|Vardø mayor Lasse Haughom ([[Progress Party (Norway)|FRP)]] beside the moving-bus installation]] --&gt;

==The festival==

Although substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. "Pøbel" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renovation and increased enthusiasm for local history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/troms_og_finnmark/1.8241059] NRK: I denne byen har Pøbel frie tøyler&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, the 100-year-old municipal cinema, closed for over 20 years and used as a warehouse, was cleared and used to host a lecture by author Tristan Manco and screen street art films.

After the opening weekend, the festival secured financing, equipment and political permission to realise the long-planned idea of planting an old bus next to the underwater tunnel that leads to Vardø. The bus was previously used to transport families and their belongings out of Vardø during the era of mass de-population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/kulturliv/article6164378.ece] Finnmarken: Setter punktum for Vardøs fraflytting&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria]] ratified the convention on December 18, 1992, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.&lt;ref name=austria&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/at/ |title=Austria – Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites in Austria were first inscribed on the list at the 20th Session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], held in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], [[Mexico]] in 1996. At that session, two sites were added: the "[[Historic Centre of Salzburg]]", and the "[[Palace and Gardens of Schönbrunn]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom96.htm#784 |title= Report of the Rapporteur|publisher=UNESCO |date=March 10, 1997 |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites were added each year until 2001 and again in 2011 and 2017. As of September 2017, Austria has 10 total sites inscribed on the list. Of these, three sites are shared with other countries: "[[Fertö / Neusiedlersee Cultural Landscape]]" with [[Hungary]]; "[[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps]]" with [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]]; and "[[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]]" with [[Albania]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], and [[Ukraine]]. All but one of the World Heritage sites in Austria are of the cultural type.&lt;ref name=austria/&gt;

'''Margaret Bennett''' (27 October 1946) is a Scottish writer, [[folklorist]], [[ethnologist]], broadcaster and singer. Her main interests lies in the field of traditional Scottish [[folk culture]] and [[cultural identity]] of the Scots, home and abroad. The late [[Hamish Henderson]], internationally distinguished poet and folklorist, said about her: ''Margaret embodies the spirit of Scotland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orkneyfolkfestival.com/act_detail.asp?actID=92|title=Margaret Bennett|year=2009|publisher=Orkney Folk Festival|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Margaret Bennett grew up in a family of tradition bearers: [[Gaels|Gaelic]], from her mother's side, and [[Irish culture|Irish]] and [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland Scots]] from her father's. She and her three sisters lived their childhood in the [[Isle of Skye]], "in a household where singing, playing music, dancing and storytelling were a way of life as were traditional crafts."&lt;ref name="Chat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/familytree/magazine/junjul2005/story29.htm|title=A Chat with Margaret Bennett|author=Frank R. Shaw|year=2005|accessdate=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to the [[Isle of Lewis]] in the late 1950s, and then to the [[Shetland Islands]] between 1963–1964, when her father (a civil engineer) emigrated to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada. When visiting him in 1965, she came across the newly founded Folklore Department at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]. There, under the direction of Prof. [[Herbert Halpert]], she realised that her cultural heritage "was a subject you could actually study and get a degree in."&lt;ref name="Gaelcast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelcast.com/?page_id=57|title=An Interview with Margaret Bennett|author=Liam Caiside|year=2006|accessdate=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing her teacher training in [[Scotland]] with distinction, Margaret went back to Newfoundland, where she worked as an elementary school teacher in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] between 1967–68. From 1968 she attended the University, intermittently lecturing part-time at St. John's Vocational College, then, in 1975, earned a post-graduate M.A. from M.U.N. She spent a year in [[Quebec]] as folklorist for the Museum of Man (now [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]], across the [[Ottawa River]]) before returning to Scotland. Between 1977–1984, she worked as a [[special education]] teacher in the [[Scottish Education Department]]. From 1984 to 1995, she was lecturer in Scottish Ethnology at the [[School of Scottish Studies]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Since October 1995 she has been Glasgow Honorary [[Research Fellow]] of the [[University of Glasgow]] (attached to Glasgow-Strathclyde School of Scottish Studies) and lecturer in folklore at the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]] in Glasgow.

She is the mother of the late [[Martyn Bennett]].

'''Mihai Dumitru Ralea''' (also known as '''Mihail Ralea''', '''Michel Raléa''', or '''Mihai Rale''';&lt;ref name="mstr586"&gt;Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a [[Romania]]n social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of [[Poporanism]], the left-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] movement, which he infused with influences from [[corporatism]] and [[Marxism]]. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic "peasant state". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to [[political sociology]], the [[sociology of culture]], and [[Social psychology|social]] and [[national psychology]]. He was a professor at the [[University of Iași]] and, from 1938, the [[University of Bucharest]].

By 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the [[National Peasants' Party]], managing ''[[Viața Românească]]'' review and ''[[Dreptatea]]'' daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a [[Socialist Peasants' Party]], then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Labor Minister]] of the dictatorial [[National Renaissance Front]], representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a "[[fellow traveler]]" of the underground [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]].

Ralea willingly cooperated with the communists and the [[Ploughmen's Front]] before and after their arrival to power, serving as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]], [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]], and vice president of the [[Great National Assembly]]. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and, as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Heavily controlled by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], his work gave scientific credentials to the regime's [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] propaganda, though Ralea also used his position to protect some of those persecuted by the authorities.

Ralea's final contributions assisted in the re-professionalization of Romanian psychology and education, with the retention of a more liberal communist doctrine. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, he died abroad, while on mission to the [[UNESCO]]. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises. His only, and last, direct descendant was a daughter, Catinca Ralea, who achieved literary fame as a translator of Western literature.

==Biography==

===Early life and Poporanist beginnings===
A native of [[Huși]], [[Fălciu County]] (currently in [[Vaslui County]]), Ralea was the son of a Dumitru Ralea, a local magistrate, and Ecaterina Botezatu-Ralea.&lt;ref name="gc912"&gt;Călinescu, p. 912&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Camelia Zavarache, Ralea's ethnic background was non-Romanian: on his father's side, he was a [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarian]], while his mother was [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196–197. See also Moldovan, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The family was relatively wealthy, and Dumitru had served as Fălciu representative in the [[Senate of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; His son was always spiritually attached to his native region and, later in life, bought himself a vineyard on Dobrina Hill, just outside Huși, building himself a vacation home.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 125; (2010), p. 385; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Huși was where he completed his primary education, before he moved on to the urban center of [[Iași]], where he enlisted at [[boarding school]] (''Liceul Internat'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 912; Vianu, p. 143; Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199&lt;/ref&gt; He was colleagues with another future sociologist, [[D. I. Suchianu]]. The two remained personal and political friends for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Another enduring friendship was formed on school grounds between Ralea and historian [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], who became Ralea's main connection to the revolutionary left.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea went on to attend the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, under [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] (who shortlisted and prepared Ralea for academic tenure).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in publishing during 1916, with an essay in Rădulescu-Motru's ''Revista de Filozofie'',&lt;ref name="tv144"&gt;Vianu, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and with ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' articles that he usually signed with the initials ''M. R.'' (an alternative signature he would use for the rest of his career).&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 406, 586&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was university colleagues with philosophers [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Nicolae Bagdasar]], with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 283. See also Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies were interrupted by the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign of World War I]], during which time Ralea relocated to Iași. He took his final examination in Law and Letters at the [[University of Iași]], in 1918.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; His professors included the culture critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who became Ralea's mentor.&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea recalled that his first encounter with Ibrăileanu was "my life's greatest intellectual event".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by Vianu as a "young luminary" with "new and original ideas", "always surrounded by a sizable pack of students",&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to cultural journalism in postwar [[Greater Romania]]. From February 1919, he was a contributor to the Iași-based review ''Însemnări Literare'', which stood in for the temporarily disestablished ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 114; Nicolescu, p. 131. See also Desa ''et al.'' (1987), pp. 508–509&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was managed by the novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] and heavily influenced by Ibrăileanu. Their friendship sealed Ralea's affiliation to prewar [[Poporanism]], a leftist current which promoted [[agrarianism]], "national specificity", and art with a social mission. The ''Însemnări Literare'' group also recognized that Poporanism was made inadequate by the social promises of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[universal male suffrage]]. These policies, Ibrăileanu acknowledged, "settled a debt" with the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Poporanism was generally pro-[[Westernization]], with a noted reserve; taken separately, Ralea was the most pro-Western, socialist, and least culturally conservative thinker of this category.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 353–354; Verdery, pp. 50–51, 53, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1919, Ralea and his new friend, [[Andrei Oțetea]], earned state scholarships to complete his doctorate in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 190–192, 250, 284&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] as a disciple of [[Lucien Herr]],&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; simultaneously registering for doctoral programs in letters and politics, with interests in sociology and psychology. He studied under the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] [[Célestin Bouglé]], then under [[Paul Fauconnet]] and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], and later, at the [[Collège de France]], under [[Pierre Janet]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293&lt;/ref&gt; As he himself recounted, he became a passionate follower of the [[French Left]], a reader of [[Jean Jaurès]], and a guest of [[Léon Blum]]'s.&lt;ref name="istnm28"&gt;Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He defined himself as a [[Rationalism|rationalist]], heir to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; and was ostensibly an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's secular agenda was underscored when he joined the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], which, historian Lucian Nastasă writes, implied a commitment to [[freethought]] and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, Ralea managed a Romanian restaurant owned by the banker [[Aristide Blank]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a tight cell of Romanian students in letters or history, which also included Oțetea, [[Gheorghe Brătianu]], and [[Alexandru Rosetti]], who remained close friends over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 284, 293, 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; Suchianu and his sister Ioana, who were also studying in Paris, lived in the same boarding house as Ralea.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"/&gt;

===Debut as theoretician===
With funds raised by a Support Committee that included Ralea,&lt;ref&gt;Ilie Th. Riga, Gheorghe Călin, ''Dr. Fr. I. Rainer'', [[Editura Științifică]], Bucharest, 1966, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viața Românească'' was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]],&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the first Romanian notices about the work of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/COROIUoct12.htm "Proust și romanul românesc modern"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt;

In 1922, Ralea took his ''[[Habilitation|Docteur d'État]]'' degree (the sixth Romanian to ever qualify for it)&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; with ''L'idée de la révolution dans les doctrines socialistes'' ("The Idea of Revolution in Socialist Doctrines"). Under the [[Francization|Francized]] name ''Michel Raléa'', he published it at Rivière company in 1923. ''L'idée de la révolution...'' theorized that, in order to be classified as a revolution, a social movement needed at once a "social body", an "ideal", and a "transfer of power"—depending on which trait was prevailing, revolutions were, respectively, "organic", "programmatic", or "means-based".&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of his attention was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], whom he rediscovered (and criticized) as a proponent of "class solidarity" and [[nonviolent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; The work earned Ralea the [[Institut de France]]'s [[Prix Osiris]]&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; and a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree in 1923.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; He spent another several months frequenting [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] lectures.&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; It was there that he first met a future enemy, the poet-mathematician [[Ion Barbu]]. The latter left a corrosive record of their first encounter, dismissing Ralea as a "clown" with "aristocratic manias".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Ralea began publishing his political and sociological essays in reviews such as ''Fapta'', ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', and ''[[Gândirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 76; Desa ''et al.'' (1987), p. 469; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with [[Dimitrie Gusti]] and [[Virgil Madgearu]]'s Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its ''Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială''. In 1923, it hosted his essay on "The Issue of Societal Classification" and his critical review of German sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, pp. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Paris, Ralea was confident that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, [[Garabet Aslan]], ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to [[Ion Petrovici]], while also employed as lecturer in [[social pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 344–345, 347, 483&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea's own words, this was a "ridiculous" situation: most of his students were girls, some of whom were infatuated with him.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the ''Viața Românească'' offices.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 150, 200–201, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, Ralea diversified his qualifications with the goal of obtaining employment in his main field. He published the tract ''Formația ideii de personalitate'' ("How the Notion of Personality Is Formed"), noted as a pioneering introduction to [[behavioural genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1926, following good referrals from Petrovici (and despite the preference of psychology students, who favored C. Fedeleș), Ralea was appointed Professor of Psychology and Aesthetics at Iași University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 345–346, 347, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea soon became one of ''Viața Românească''{{'}}s ideologues and polemicists, as well as architect of its satire column, ''Miscellanea'' (alongside Suchianu and, initially, [[George Topîrceanu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925, he was also regularly featured in the left-wing daily ''[[Adevărul]]'', and its cultural supplement, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt; His essays were taken up by other cultural magazines throughout Romania, including ''[[Kalende]]'' of [[Pitești]] and ''Minerva'' of Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 557, 619–620&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, when Ralea published his ''Contribuțiuni la știința societății'' ("Contributions to Social Science") and ''Introducere în sociologie'' ("Companion to Sociology"),&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Herseni, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; Gusti's Social Institute had Ralea as a guest speaker, with a lecture on "Social Education".&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, with Gusti as president of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Broadcasting Company]], Ralea became a frequent presence on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

In his columns and essays, Ralea defended Ibrăileanu's "national specificity" against criticism from the new-wave [[Literary modernism|modernists]] at ''[[Sburătorul]]''. [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the modernist ideologue, had reconnected with 19th-century [[classical liberalism]], rejecting Poporanism as a nationalist, culturally isolationist, and [[Socialization (economics)|socializing]] phenomenon. Lovinescu and Ralea denounced each other's politics as [[reactionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 39, 128, 133; E. Lovinescu, pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea opined that Poporanist ideas were still culturally relevant, and not in fact isolationist, since they provided a recipe for "originality"; as he put it, "national specificity" had become inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was not just political: Ralea also objected to modernist aesthetics, from the pure poetry cultivated by ''Sburătorul'' to the more radical [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] of ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 123–124, 128, 133–135, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was not an anti-modernist, but rather a particular modernist. According to his friend and colleague [[Octav Botez]], he was an "integrally modern man" in tastes and behavior, "one of the few philosophers who conceived of, and lived, their lives as regular people, with a naturalness and facility that were charming and stimulating."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; The same was also noted by ''Contimporanul'' writer [[Sergiu Dan]], who proposed that Ralea denied himself "all sort of transaction with the confuse world of sentiment".&lt;ref name="sdan184"&gt;Dan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's literary columns very often promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as when he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by [[Thomas Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 911; Vianu, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; More famous was his reading of Proust through [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Matter and Memory|classification of memory]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc911"&gt;Călinescu, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], and hailed [[Tudor Arghezi]], the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 227; Crohmălniceanu, p. 140. See also M. Lovinescu, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for [[social realism]] in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, but he was also enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by ''Sburătorul''{{'}}s [[Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 180, 253, 397, 406, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ralea vs. ''Gândirea''===
With the Lovinescu–Ralea debate occupying the center stage at ''Viața Românească'' and ''Sburătorul'', a new intellectual movement, critical of both modernism and Poporanism, was emerging in the cultural life of Greater Romania. Led by poet-theologian [[Nichifor Crainic]], this group took over at ''Gândirea'', turning the magazine against its former ''Viața Românească'' allies.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 76–77, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by Lovinescu, Ralea was initially welcoming of Crainic's "remarkable" program.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; He did not object to Crainic's [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] devotion (seeing it as compatible with secularism and "national specificity"), but mainly to his [[national conservatism]], which worshiped the historical past.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–128&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Poporanists, Ralea adopted [[left-wing nationalism]], arguing that the very concept of nation was a product of French radicalism: "[It] emerged from the great French Revolution, the modest ideology of the bourgeoisie. [...] What's more, we may claim that only a democracy can truly be nationalistic."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bochmann, "Conceptul de patriotism în cultura română", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 124; Ornea (1995), pp. 65, 351&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the core ideas of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]], according to which [[National awakening of Romania|Romanian national awareness]] was an afterthought of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]]: "We have had to visit France to find out we're Romanians."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by scholar Balázs Trencsényi: "Ralea sought to separate the study of national specificity, which he considered to be legitimate, from the exhortation of national particulars, which he rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, ''Gândirea'' hosted the inflammatory "White Lily" Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a "new generation" of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry with one of the White Lily intellectuals, [[Petre Pandrea]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for [[aestheticism]] and [[mysticism]], a critique of "that famed social justice" idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the ''Sburătorul'' group as "dry", "barren", all too critical.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, could do without "prophets" with "fun and interesting biases", but not without "liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day [[Rasputin]]s, prone to fanatical vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

From that moment on, Crainic's Orthodox spirituality and traditionalism made a slow transition into far-right politics. Their rejection of democracy became another issue of dispute, with Ralea noting, in 1930, that "all civilized countries are democratic; all semi-civilized or primitive countries are dictatorial."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, ''Gândirists'' produced more and more systematic attacks on Ralea's ideology, condemning its atheism, "[[historical materialism]]", and [[Francophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 97, 102&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Ralea noted that, beyond their facade, national and religious conservatism meant a reinstatement of primitive customs, [[obscurantism]], [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Byzantinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 124, 127, 130–132&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed the envelope by demanding a program of forced Westernization and secularization, to mirror [[Kemalism]].&lt;ref name="gc973"&gt;Călinescu, p. 973&lt;/ref&gt;

His comments also challenged the grounding of ''Gândirist'' theory: Romanian Orthodoxy, he noted, was part of an international Orthodox phenomenon that mainly included [[Slavs]], whereas many Romanians were [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]]. He concluded, therefore, that Orthodoxy could never claim synonymy with the Romanian ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 127–128; Ornea (1995), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also insisted that, despite its nativist [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] claims, Orthodox religiousness was a modern "trifle", that owed inspiration to [[Hermann Graf Keyserling|Keyserling]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]]'s Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132; Ornea (1995), pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that Romanian peasants, whose religiousness was exhorted by Crainic, were "superstitious, but atheistic", not respectful "of any spiritual value when it should compete with their logical instincts." No other people, he contented, was as blasphemous as Romanians when it came to [[Romanian profanity|profanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea collected his critical essays as a set of volumes: ''Comentarii și sugestii'' ("Comments and Suggestions"), ''Interpretări'' ("Interpretations"), ''Perspective'' ("Perspectives").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188, 586, 598, 616&lt;/ref&gt; He was still involved in psychological research, with tracts such as ''Problema inconștientului'' ("The Problem of the Unconscious Mind") and ''Ipoteze și precizări privind știința sufletului'' ("Hypotheses and Précis Regarding Spiritual Science").&lt;ref name="gc1025"&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also resumed his European travels, touring the [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]], and was unenthusiastic about its conservatism. Ralea's travelogue, ''Memorial din Spania'', depicts the country as a reactionary bulwark of "somber priests" and "festooned soldiers".&lt;ref name="sdan184"/&gt; Another ''Memorial'', serialized by ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', detailed his trips through [[Germanic-speaking Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 912, 1025&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNȚ deputy and ''Viața Românească'' editor===
Shortly before the [[Romanian general election, 1928|election of December 1928]], Ralea was attracted into the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ), speaking out against the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] political class as "an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Octavian Tăslăuanu]], "Ce scriu tinerii despre România", in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 28/1928, pp. 898–899&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully contested a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], and was [[Romanian general election, 1931|reelected in 1933]]; during that interval, he also presided upon Fălciu's party chapter.&lt;ref name="zavr189"&gt;Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, [[Constantin Balmuș]], [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Petre Andrei]], [[Traian Bratu]], and [[Traian Ionașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 100, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, [[Constantin Stere]], but did not follow Stere's "[[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere|Democratic Peasantist]]" dissidence of 1930.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/glose_la_petre_pandrea_ii "Glose la Petre Pandrea (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party press organ ''Acțiunea Țărănistă'' and to [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște|Teodorescu-Braniște]]'s ''Revista Politică''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 16, 822&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic [[George Călinescu]] as editors of ''Viața Românească''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 146; Piru, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea eventually affiliated with the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126. See also Ornea (1995), pp. 119, 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted the vision of a "peasant state", accepting socialist [[reformism]], but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejected outright the idea of [[Dictatorship of the proletarian|proletarian primacy]]. Criticized by the communist left as "outstanding shortsightedness",&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] meetings, including the 1933 conference in the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic of Spain]], but insisted on the benefits of [[statism]] and a [[planned economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5448104j/ ''Compte rendu de la XXIXe conférence tenue à Madrid du 4 au 10 octobre 1933''], Éditions Payot, Lausanne, 1934, pp. 582–588&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Ralea was leaving behind his sociological research. As noted by his friend Botez, he showed himself to be "absent-minded and preoccupied most of all with politics."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Botez noted that Ralea was showing signs of [[hyperactivity]], seemingly incapable of concentrating during formal functions.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"/&gt; He became infamous as one of the "traveling professors",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in Bucharest and only taught the minimum of classes allowed in Iași—one of his return trips to Iași, in 1936, was for the funeral ceremony of his mentor Ibrăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 475–476; Piru, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He now owned an Iași townhouse and a villa in Bucharest's Filipescu Park.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 201, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Although lovingly married to Ioana, he had begun an affair with another woman, Marcela Simionescu.&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's energies were also drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent seat at the University of Iași, at the expense of PNȚ colleague [[Ioan Hudiță]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 403, 406&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to do the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist [[Giorge Pascu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their [[Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate examination]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"/&gt; Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1934 to March 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Diego Ciobotaru, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-au-vazut-taranistii-restauratia-lui-carol-al-ii-lea "Cum au văzut țărăniștii restaurația lui Carol al II-lea"], in ''Historia'', February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also editor of the main PNȚ newspaper, ''[[Dreptatea]]''. He contributed its political editorials, answering to criticism from the right. In February 1935, he co-authored and published the new PNȚ Party Program, which rendered explicit the goal of transforming Romania into a "peasant state".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dreptatea'', addressing ''[[Universul]]'' editor [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], Ralea dismissed suspicions that the "peasant state" signified a "simplistic domination" or a dictatorship of the peasantry. He maintained that the notion simply implied "a juster distribution of the national income", and the "collective" but peaceful "redemption of an entire class."&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 204–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the Iron Guard===
Ralea's time at ''Dreptatea'' overlapped with the emergence of [[fascism]], whose leading Romanian representatives were members of the [[Iron Guard]]. This violent movement had been temporarily banned in 1931, by order of a PNȚ [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]], [[Ion Mihalache]]. Mihalache's ban followed repeated requests by the party's left-wingers, Ralea included.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea had his own brush with the Guard in late 1932, when he was presiding upon symposiums on French literature at ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion Society]]''. One of the sessions, focusing on [[André Gide]], was interrupted, on Crainic's instigation, by Guardsmen under [[Mihai Stelescu]], who assaulted ''Criterion'' activists and created a bustle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Irina Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/criterion-o-istorie "Criterion – o istorie"], in ''Historia'', May 2014; Ornea (1995), pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, Ralea had quarreled with the ''Criterion'' cell, which had since adopted "new generation" idealism and sympathy for the Iron Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; In private, he also dismissed the Guard's new convert and ideologue, [[Nae Ionescu]], as a "trickster" and a "barber".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of Romanian fascism became stringent after the Guard assassinated [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] [[Ion G. Duca]]. In his articles, Ralea described the National Liberal administration as "insane and degenerate" for continuing to tolerate the Guard's existence, instead of jailing its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Dreptatea'', protesting against the Guard's assault of the leftist intellectual [[Alexandru Graur]], Ralea decried fascism in Romania as an "[[The Island of Doctor Moreau|island of Doctor Moreau]]", an experiment in the growth of "blind and absurd mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, 161 of Ralea's essays were collected and published at [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]] as ''Valori'' ("Values"). They predicted the emergence of a stable civilization, conformist and [[Collectivism|collectivist]], whose great merit was the elimination of careerism.&lt;ref&gt;Dan, pp. 184–186&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea synthesized his critique of fascism in the 1935 essays on "The Right's Doctrine", taken up by ''Dreptatea'' and ''Viața Românească''. These texts described the far-right and fascism as parasitical phenomena, feeding on democracy's errors, with an ignorant mindset, incapable of subtlety.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 119; Ornea (1995), pp. 64–65, 350–352&lt;/ref&gt; His assessments were countercriticized by Guardist intellectual [[Toma Vlădescu]], in the newspaper ''[[Porunca Vremii]]''. According to Vlădescu, the "right-wing ideology" existed as an expression of the "human equilibrium", and, at its very core, was antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the invigoration of European fascism, Ralea was again moving to the left, cooperating with the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR). In 1936, at ''Dreptatea'', he condemned the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|German march into Rhineland]] as a bad omen and an attack on world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Prisăcaru, "Rhineland Crisis: The First 'Milestone' to the Second World War. Romanian Authorities and Media Reactions", in ''Romanian Military Thinking'', Nr. 4/2013, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the PNȚ men affiliated with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Cecil]]'s International Peace Campaign, which, in Romania, was dominated by PSDR militants.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, with an obituary piece to the "martyr" Stere, he defended Poporanism from accusations of "[[Bolshevik]]" subservience. Bolshevism, he argued, was impossible in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 74, 396&lt;/ref&gt; However, he himself had established a working relationship with the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR), who was also interested in other PNȚ antifascists (one of them was the White Lily's Pandrea, who had since joined the National Peasantist left current).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126, 133, 137, 143–144; Tismăneanu, pp. 99, 299, 312&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also allowed PCdR intellectuals such as [[Ștefan Voicu]] and [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]] to publish essays in ''Viața Românească'', and hosted news about social life and culture in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 118–119. See also Zavarache, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the PCdR acknowledged him as one of the intellectuals who could be trusted with "fulfilling the bourgeois revolution in Romania."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1937, at the PNȚ Youth Conference in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Ralea spoke of the "peasant state" as a "[[neo-nationalist]]" application of [[democratic socialism]], opposed to fascism, and in natural solidarity with the trade unions. He felt confident that this alliance would be powerful enough to outweigh fashionable [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conferințele tineretului național-țărănist la Cluj", in ''Țara de Mâine'', Nr. 1–2/1937, pp. 58, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; During April of that year, Ralea and his Iași colleagues expressed public solidarity with his old Poporanist friend Sadoveanu, whose books were being burned by far-right militants.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 78–80; Ornea (1995), p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own sociological work was falling under Guardist scrutiny: in December, ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' hosted a piece by [[Horia Stamatu]], which referred to Ralea's contribution as "unhinged", and to Ralea personally as "kike-turned", "at odds with the new man".&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Săndulescu, "Convertiri și reconvertiri: elite academice și culturale și schimbare politică în România anilor 1930–1960", in Cristian Vasile (ed.), ''"Ne trebuie oameni!".

===Becoming Carol's minister===
[[File:Călinescu, Gafencu, Ralea, Constantinescu. Prima ședință a fondatorilor F.R.N..jpg|thumb|370px|Founding session of the [[National Renaissance Front]]. Wearing the Front's gala uniforms, from left: [[Armand Călinescu]], [[Grigore Gafencu]], Ralea, [[Mitiță Constantinescu]]]]
The [[Romanian general election, 1937|December 1937 election]] toned down Ralea's anti-Guard militancy: the PNȚ had a non-aggression pact with the Guardsmen. Consequently, Ralea campaigned in his native [[Fălciu County]] alongside the movement's candidates, in terms he would later describe as "cordial".&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; His apparent compromise with the Guard is one of the most serious charges in Pandrea's later criticism of Ralea.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; The tied elections, and the successes of the Guard, prompted the authoritarian [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to increase his participation in politics, beyond his [[royal prerogative]]. Identified as one of the PNȚ "turncoats",&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea sealed a surprising deal with Carol II and Premier [[Miron Cristea]] (the [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarch of Romania]]), becoming the country's [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Minister of Labor]]. He was promptly stripped of his PNȚ membership, and inaugurated his own party, the exceedingly minor [[Socialist Peasants' Party]] (PSȚ).&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162339/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 "Întâlniri secrete între Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D. Cocea și Mihail Ralea (1942–1944)"], in ''Caiete Silvane'', Nr. 2/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians tend to describe Ralea's attitude toward Carol as "servile",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; and Ralea himself as Carol's "pocket Socialist"&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; or "intellectual trophy".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself claimed that the king cultivated his friendship as a likable "communist", though, as Camelia Zavarache argues, there is no secondary proof to attest that Ralea was ever part of Carol's ''[[camarilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iuliu Maniu]], the PNȚ chief and leader of the semi-clandestine democratic opposition, suggested that Ralea had "not a trace of character" to compliment his intellectual gifts.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; At the time, PNȚ activists began collecting evidence that Ralea was not an ethnic Romanian, which meant that he could no longer hold public office under the [[Romanianization]] laws.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"&gt;Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself was involved in the Romanianization campaign: in late 1938, he accepted [[Wilhelm Filderman]]'s proposal for [[Fifth Aliyah|the mass emigration of Romanian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel Vainer]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160416040538/https://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE442-443.pdf "Contribuția evreimii române la Așezământul Muncii în Ereț Israel"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 442–443, January 2015, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, Ralea became a founding member of Carol's [[One-party state|single party]], the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment offered him several honors, including a reprint of his works by the ministry press.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his ministerial appointment, Ralea became Royal Resident, or governor, of [[Ținutul Prut]], a new administrative region incorporating parts of Western Moldavia and [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He was created a Knight 2nd Class of the ''[[Meritul Cultural]]'' Order,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; publishing, at Editura Fundațiilor Regale, the volume ''Psihologie și vieață'' ("Psychology and Life").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Toward the end of 1938, Ralea moved from his old chair at the University of Iași and took up a similar position at his Bucharest alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 343, 447; Zavarache, pp. 190, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu was the assistant professor, lecturing in specialized aesthetics and literary criticism, and in practice taking over all of Ralea's classes.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 283–284, 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Lucian Boia]] argues: "Of all the king's dictatorship dignitaries, one may count Mihai Ralea as the most left-wing."&lt;ref name="lb141"&gt;Boia, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: "I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class."&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1945 by political scientist [[Hugh Seton-Watson]], there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: "however much [the average Romanian intellectual] cursed the regime, he was grateful to it for one thing. It stood between him and the great, dirty, primitive, disinherited masses, whose 'Bolshevik' desire for Social Justice threatened his comforts."&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; His time in office brought the creation of a workers' leisure service, ''[[Muncă și Voe Bună]]'', together with a Workers' University,&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"&gt;"Necesitatea universităților muncitorești", in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 4/1939, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; a workers' theater, and a hostel for vacationing writers (''Casa Scriitorilor'').&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 140–143, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nepotistic in his selection of a ministerial staff,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 182, 225&lt;/ref&gt; by November 1939 his ministry was able to co-opt PSDR politicians such as [[George Grigorovici]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Petrescu, p. 458, 459&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stavri Cunescu]].&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilarion Țiu, Lavinia Betea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-l-furat-ceausescu-regele-playboy "Cum l-a furat Ceaușescu pe Regele playboy"], in ''Historia'', online edition; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He appropriated socialist propaganda, and attracted more or less sizable contributions from various centrists and left-wingers: Sadoveanu, Vianu, Suchianu, Philippide, as well as [[Demostene Botez]], [[Octav Livezeanu]], [[Victor Ion Popa]], [[Gala Galaction]], [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], and [[Ion Pas]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 141–143, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's mandate was also a crossover of left-wing corporatism and fascism. In June 1938, he even visited Nazi Germany and had a formal meeting with his counterpart, [[Robert Ley]].&lt;ref name="lb141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Manolescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/85_via-a-romaneasca-5-6-2013/80_istorie-i-literatura/1492_scriitori-romani-in-exil-vintila-horia-fata-cu-premiul-goncourt.html "Scriitori români în exil. Vintilă Horia față cu Premiul Goncourt"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 5-6/2013&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Muncă și Voe Bună'' was directly inspired by [[Strength Through Joy]] and the ''[[Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro]]''.&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Ralea celebrated [[May Day]] with a large parade of support for Carol II. This was meant to undermine the leftist [[International Workers' Day|Workers' Day]] while showing the success of the FRN's worker [[guild]]s, and was partly inspired by Nazi festivities.&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; Nevertheless, the parade was voluntarily joined by militants of the underground PCdR, who found that it gave them am opportunity for chanting "democratic slogans".&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; In underground PSDR circles, as well as in inside the ministerial structures, rumors spread that Ralea was using secret funds at his discretion to sponsor various PCdR militants, including his schoolmate [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]]; these stories were partly confirmed by Ralea himself.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–200, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 1939, the premiership had passed to [[Armand Călinescu]], a former PNȚ politician. Ralea was his friend and confidant, and, as he later claimed, tried to keep Călinescu grounded in the face of "mythomaniacal" rumors.&lt;ref name="zoambasador"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nsemnrile_unui_ambasador "Însemnările unui ambasador"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2001&lt;/ref&gt; The FRN regime soon organized a massive clampdown of the Iron Guard. Ralea claimed to have protected Guardsmen employed by the Labor Ministry, and to have negotiated pardons for militants interned at [[Miercurea Ciuc]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 313, 314&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained one such reprieve for Guardist historian [[P. P. Panaitescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a Guard sympathizer, [[Ion Barbu]] later claimed that Ralea was behind his marginalization in academia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 189; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 332, 342&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also accused by Pandrea of having done nothing to prevent the arrest of his former ''Dreptatea'' colleague, the anti-Carol PNȚ-ist Madgearu.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt;

On September 21, 1939, following a spree of extrajudicial killings ordered by government, an [[Iron Guard death squads|Iron Guard death squad]] took its revenge, assassinating Premier Călinescu. Ralea, Andrei, and other former PNȚ-ists preserved their governmental posts as the premiership passed to [[Constantin Argetoianu]], then to [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Guvern nou", in ''Unirea. Foaie Bisericească'', December 2, 1939, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also given new responsibilities within the FRN structure, becoming president of its regional chapter in [[Ținutul Mării]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 359, 369–372&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall and harassment===
[[File:Sala de Consiliu -- Primim &amp; mobilizare.jpg|thumb|250px|Ralea's vote on the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet ultimatum]] and mobilization, registered on Romanian government stationary, alongside those of his cabinet colleagues]] 
Meanwhile, the outbreak of World War II caught Romania isolated from either the [[Axis Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. During the [[Battle of France]], the FRN regime itself was divided between partisans of a détente with Germany and Francophiles such as Ralea. As witnessed by the Swiss diplomat [[René de Weck]], Ralea was restating his ''Valori'' ethos at cabinet meetings, in front of Axis representatives, declaring that the Allies stood for "humanistic civilization".&lt;ref name="zoambasador"/&gt; Former PCdR activists still enjoyed access to Ralea, through Constantinescu-Iași. In May 1940, the latter tried to create a bridge of communications between the Labor Minister and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 118; Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; Various reports on both sides confirm that Ralea was in permanent contact with Soviet diplomats, arranged for him by Constantinescu-Iași and [[Belu Zilber]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a month later, the Soviets issued an ultimatum, demanding that Romania cede Bessarabia. During the deliberations, Ralea voted in favor of Argetoianu's proposal: withdrawing from the region and mobilizing the army on the [[Prut River|Prut]], in preparation of a future defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Argetoianu]], [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/constantin-argetoianu-ultimatum-mi-s-au-taiat-picioarele "Ultimatum... Mi s-au tăiat picioarele..."], in ''Historia'', June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] sent Romania into a deep political crisis. The events, and revelations about the existence of a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet agreement]], led Carol to order a final clampdown of the PCdR's remaining Romanian cells. In July, Ralea intervened to rescue a communist friend, the journalist [[George Ivașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Țugui]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_ivacu_cronicar_de_rzboi_la_ziarul_vremea_1941-1944 "George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul ''Vremea'' (1941–1944). I"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian crisis was aggravated in August, when the Nazi-inspired [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna arbitration]] stripped her of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The political standstill propelled the Iron Guard, which was Nazi-aligned, into government, and forced Carol into permanent exile. The emerging "[[National Legionary State]]" banned reviews such as ''Viața Românească'',&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to prosecute all former FRN dignitaries. With Panaitescu as the new Rector, the University instituted a Commission for Review, which included Iron Guard sociologist [[Traian Herseni]] and eugenicist [[Iordache Făcăoaru]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 172; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 314, 315&lt;/ref&gt; Of those professors brought before the commission, Ralea was the only one to have his contract terminated without the possibility of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 540–541. See also Boia, pp. 176, 199; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Panaitescu, Herseni and Făcăoaru found that his appointment to Bucharest had been illegal, and dismissed his scientific contributions as having "zero value".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 176; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315. See also Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and his colleagues were able to defend Vianu, who was openly Jewish, and who was threatened with demotion under the [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial purity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 447. See also Boia, pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing to Huși, Ralea became the target of surveillance by agents of the [[Siguranța]], who monitored his subversive conversations, including his wager that Guard rule would be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"/&gt;

In November 1940, the Guard's [[Romanian Police|Police]] chief, [[Ștefan Zăvoianu]], ordered the arrests of several FRN dignitaries, Ralea included. This angered the military ''[[Conducător]]'', [[Ion Antonescu]], who freed Ralea and the others, ordering Zăvoianu to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe I. Florescu, "N. Iorga și America", in ''Zargidava. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, 2013, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clashes of January 1941]], the Iron Guard was ousted, and Antonescu remained unchallenged. Although fascist, the new regime reinstated Ralea to his professorship. Antonescu castigated the Commission for Review as a "shame", and declared Ralea to be "indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt; In a companion to [[Romanian philosophy]], published that year, Herseni revised his stance, calling Ralea "a thinker of unquestionable talent", whose sociological work had been "a true revelation."&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to teach at the University where, in addition to Vianu, he had received as his assistant a refugee from Soviet-occupied territory, [[Traian Chelariu]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Traian Chelariu]], [[Mircea A. Diaconu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/zilele_i_umbra_mea "Zilele și umbra mea"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Panaitescu was stripped of his position and briefly imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Still present in public life after the Romania's entry into the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]], Ralea returned to publishing with articles in ''Revista Românǎ''&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 243; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1942 book ''Înțelesuri'' ("Meanings").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Despite being partly recovered by the new regime, and allegedly proposing to Antonescu that they revive together the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|National Socialist Party]],&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; Ralea was still under ''Siguranța'' watch, and also spied on by the Police and the German Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 200, 237; Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; His file contains a denunciation of his entire career and loyalties: he stood accused of having been a "socialist-communist" camouflaged within the PNȚ, of having revived the guilds so as to give the PCdR room for maneuver, and of having sponsored Soviet agents to protect himself in the event of a Soviet invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/154/art16-arhiva.php "''Arhivele Sfera Politicii'' – Mihail Ralea"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 154, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''Siguranța'' record suggests that, in secret, Ralea was hoping to consolidate a left-wing opposition movement against Antonescu during the early months of 1941. More alarmingly for the regime, Ralea had also begun cultivating a revolutionary and pro-Allied youth, through a new magazine called ''Graiul Nostru'' and with British funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Ralea was subjected to formal interrogations over his contacts with the PCdR under Carol. He defended these, arguing that he had aimed at securing a protective deal between Romania and the Soviets, and that Carol had approved of his effort. The explanation was viewed as plausible by police, and Ralea was allowed to go free.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the file was reopened by August, after revelations that Ralea had cultivated communists since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, Antonescu ordered Ralea's interment at the concentration camp in [[Târgu Jiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He was held there for about three months, to March 1943, and apparently enjoyed a mild detention regime, with visitations.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antihitlerite Front===

Ralea's return from camp coincided roughly with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the turn of fortunes on the eastern front. He soon established contacts with the antifascist opposition, repeatedly seeking to set up a Peasantist left and rejoin the PNȚ. Maniu received him and listened to his pleas, but denied him readmission and invited him to create his own coalition from shards of the Renaissance Front, promising him some measure of leniency "for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection."&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; Their separation remained "unbridgeable";&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, Ralea reestablished the PSȚ, and attracted into its ranks a Social Democratic dissident faction, led by former PSDR theoretician [[Lothar Rădăceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 116–117, 120; Tismăneanu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The two reestablished contacts with the PCdR and other fringe parties: moving between Bucharest and [[Sinaia]], Ralea was involved in trilateral talks between the communists, the [[Ploughmen's Front]] of [[Petru Groza]], and the National Liberal inner faction of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], helping to coordinate actions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, pp. 550, 555&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brașov]], he met with the economist [[Victor Jinga]], whose antifascist and socialist program was reused in later PSȚ propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Together with party colleague [[Stanciu Stoian]], he signed the PSȚ's adherence to the PCdR's clandestine "Patriotic Antihitlerite Front".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 132; Frunză, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He was one of several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 243, 244; {{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/g.clinescu_i_detractorii_si "G. Călinescu și detractorii săi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2013&lt;/ref&gt; alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism.&lt;ref name="gc973"/&gt; With the 1943 collection of essays, ''Între două lumi'' ("Between Two Worlds", published at [[Cartea Românească]]),&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of collectivism.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Ralea's participation in subversion was disregarded by government: in June 1943, when the [[German Foreign Ministry]] nominated Ralea as a high-risk target, Antonescu personally replied that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"/&gt; In November, Ralea applied for a new Chair of Psychology at Bucharest, reserving his old department for Vianu. The review committee, overseen by leftist allies such as Gusti and [[Mircea Florian]], gave him immediate approval for transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 346. See also Zavarache, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; In February of the next year, Ralea and N. Bagdasar rejected the application of [[Constantin Noica]], the traditionalist philosopher, to join the university teaching staff. In his report, Ralea noted that Noica had "an absolute and metaphysical mindset", with no "practical reason", and that he was therefore unsuited for research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a defense witness for [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]], an activist of the underground [[National Popular Party (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Hudiță and other rival PNȚ-ists, and his friends in Iași academia, Ralea signed to [[Grigore T. Popa]]'s manifesto of the intellectuals, demanding that Antonescu negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets. Reputedly, the document had been stripped of references to the prosecution of FRN and Antonescian officials, leading Maniu to conclude that the signers were "cowardly".&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Solomon Marcus]], [http://www.romlit.ro/halucinantul_an_1944 "Halucinantul an 1944"], ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hudiță, Ralea objected to the Soviets' offer of an armistice as "too soft" on Romania.&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"/&gt; Blocked out of the National Democratic Bloc coalition,&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p. 120; Zavarache, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; which included the PNȚ, the PSDR, and ultimately the PCdR, Ralea watched from the side as the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] deposed Antonescu and pushed Romania into the anti-Nazi camp. His friend and PSȚ colleague, Grigore Geamănu, was more directly involved, helping PCdR leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] to escape from Târgu Jiu camp and join the other conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the PSȚ newspaper, ''Dezrobirea'', Ralea saluted "the full triumph of the ideas and principles for which our foremost activists have been militating uninterruptedly these past six years" (a pedigree which seemingly included Ralea's own activities under King Carol).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He reissued ''Viața Românească'' with a similar statement about "the present triumph of our credo".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, keeping up with his earlier threats, Maniu repeatedly asked for Ralea to be [[Romanian People's Tribunals|indicted for war crimes]].&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt;

Ralea played an instrumental part in the gradual installation of communism, and is described by various authors as the prototype "[[fellow traveler]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154, 290; Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1944, he was announced as the Literary Section Vice President of the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]] (ARLUS).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126, 143&lt;/ref&gt; His PSȚ was drawn into the National Democratic Front (FND) coalition, which comprised the PCdR, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. According to the PCdR, this transformation of the Antihitlerite Front was "a progressive step, befitting the tasks of the people's revolution";&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; according to historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], it was more of opportunistic move on Ralea's part.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; In private, Ralea claimed that his alignment with the communists helped him provide for his large family, including former landowners, but his account is viewed as doubtful by Zavarache.&lt;ref name="zavr256"&gt;Zavarache, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's Socialist Peasantists were eventually absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. As noted by Zavarache, Ralea now understood that his influence on political life was "exceedingly minor", aware that Groza himself was merely a communist "puppet"; "consequently, he sought to preserve those offices which could ensure him a comfortable lifestyle".&lt;ref name="zavr225"&gt;Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of the FND, Ralea participated in the movement to depose the monarchist premier, General [[Nicolae Rădescu]]. Faced with the PCdR's obstructionism, Rădescu approached Ralea with an alternative offer: the Ploughmen's Front was to form a new government with no communist ministers. Ralea divulged this offer to the Soviet envoy, [[Andrey Vyshinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1945, together with 10 other academics (among them Balmuș, Parhon, Rosetti and Oțetea), he signed a letter of protest, accusing Rădescu of stalling land reform and of undermining the work of the [[Allied Commission]].&lt;ref name="citeroarea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cicerone Ionițoiu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/aldine/history/asa-a-inceput-teroarea-92991 "Așa a început teroarea"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts Minister and ambassador===

Front row, from the right: General [[Grigore Vasiliu Rășcanu]], [[Teohari Georgescu]], [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], Groza, Gheorghiu-Dej, [[Chivu Stoica]], [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]]. Ralea is visible second row, between Georgescu and Tătărescu]]
Bloody clashes ensued in Bucharest, most of them between anticommunists and communist agents.&lt;ref name="citeroarea"/&gt; They signaled a new political crisis, and forced the FND into power. Ralea was made [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]] on March 6, 1945, when Groza took the premiership from the deposed General Rădescu.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 127, 154; Vasile (2010), pp. 71–72; Zavarache, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945 Ralea was one of the rapporteurs at the Ploughmen's Front largest-ever General Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1946, he also took over the Ministry of Religious Affairs, replacing the disgraced [[Constantin Burducea]] until August (when Groza himself replaced him in this function).&lt;ref&gt;George Enache, "Strategii de infiltrare și atragere la colaborare a cultelor religioase elaborate de autoritățile procomuniste din România în perioada 1945-1947, cu o privire specială asupra cazului Bisericii Ortodoxe Române", in ''Caietele CNSAS'', Nr. 1/2008, pp. 74, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea became one of several intellectuals who were mobilized to run on the Ploughmen's Front (and FND) list in the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 273; Cioroianu, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as minister, Ralea set in motion the purge of PNȚ-ist functionaries and of artists perceived by the PCdR as pro-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 187–188, 190; Vasile (2010), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his personal protection to [[Șerban Cioculescu]], who became Iași University professor in 1946 upon Ralea's intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also pursued his projects for workers' education, authorizing the establishment of a workers' theatrical troupe, ''[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Teatrul Muncitoresc CFR Giulești]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; He also republished his 1930s travel accounts, completed with notes from his trip to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], as ''Nord-Sud'' ("North-South").&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 285–291; Vianu, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, Ralea stepped down from the Ministry of Arts, only to be appointed [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]]. Reputedly, he was a last minute replacement for the Union of Patriots' [[Dumitru Bagdasar]]. The latter had fallen severely ill,&lt;ref name="abasclepios"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandra Bellow]], [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-1115.html "Asclepios versus Hades în România (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 755, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but was also seen as a political liability by the American side—Ralea, as a former monarchist, was preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own arrival in Washington was delayed by his inclusion on the Romanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]], and he finally landed on American soil in October.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a détente in [[Romania–United States relations|Romanian–American relations]], after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] had refused to recognize the Groza cabinet. In front of American criticism, he played down the electoral fraud of 1946, claiming that it was within the "normal" boundaries, at some 5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127. See also Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was also tasked with undermining the reputation of the anticommunist opposition and with popularizing communism among [[Romanian American]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The anticommunist press responded by calling Ralea "a liaison man" of the [[Politburo]], tasked with planting [[Stalinism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dushnyck, "Stalin's Pan-Slavism in the United States", in ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', Nr. 30/1948, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among expatriate Romanians, Ralea and his legation staff had difficulties convincing [[Maruca Cantacuzino|Maruca]] and [[George Enescu]], but persuaded [[Dimitrie Gusti]] to return to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also approached the former backers of Carol's regime. He build a connection with the industrialist [[Nicolae Malaxa]], but found vocal adversaries in [[Max Auschnitt]] and [[Richard Franasovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Going against Soviet policies and his own government, Ralea also sought to obtain American foreign aid, and even political interventions. His persistence in this regard contributed to the relief effort organized by [[Cortlandt V.R. Schuyler|General Schuyler]] in famine-stricken [[Western Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; However, the assistance fell below Ralea's expectations, owing to various factors, one of which was American suspicion that Groza was diverting food to relieve the [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|Soviet famine]]; meanwhile, diaspora voices repeatedly argued that Ralea was playing down the scale of famine, and also insinuated that he was embezzling funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; In his reports to Bucharest, Ralea complained that: "America's attitude toward us was oscillating between hostility and ignorance. All doors were closed. [...] We were seen as a Soviet branch office, and people were discouraged from giving us any sort of assistance."&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he was shocked by Truman's ignorance of Romanian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_raport_american_despre_romnia_din_1949 "Un raport american despre România din 1949"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's diplomatic mission was also tainted by his difficult lifestyle, including his noticeable [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 207, 267&lt;/ref&gt; but also his philandering. Ralea had appointed his mistress as [[cultural attaché]], but she deserted her post and left to Mexico while Ioana Ralea took up residence in the Romanian embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, p. 27; Nastasă (2010), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

With the looming threat of Soviet-style [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization]], Ralea informed the Americans that Romanian peasants valued individual property.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during his January 1947 interview with [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], he pleaded emotionally for Romanians not to be left "behind the [[Iron Curtain]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127; Deaconescu, p. 29; Zavarache, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; He was still the country's ambassador when King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate by the PCdR officials and a [[Communist Romania|communized people's republic]] was proclaimed. Nevertheless, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ana Pauker]] greatly reduced his influence in Washington, transferring many of his attributes to a communist diplomat, [[Grigore Preoteasa]].&lt;ref name="zavr225"/&gt; In June, Ralea also became chairman of a Romanian Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, which was dedicated to the spread of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Florin C. Stan, "Relațiile bilaterale România—Israel (1948–1959). O cronologie", in ''Caiete Diplomatice'', Vol. 2, Issue 2, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist marginalization and recovery===
A scandal erupted in July 1948, when the Raleas were denied access to the diplomats' beach in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], having been blacklisted as "communists". Ioana Ralea endangered her husband's position by protesting against this qualifier; at home, rumor spread that the couple was planning to defect.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was able to persuade Pauker not to recall him, and even organized a reception in her honor during October 1948;&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; he also organized a communist counter-manifestation upon Michael's arrival to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Ghilezan, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/De-ce-toti-presedintii-Romaniei-s-au-temut-de-Regele-Mihai-I*articleID_26028-articles_details.html "De ce toți președinții României s-au temut de Regele Mihai I?"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 597, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While still abroad, Ralea had run in the formal [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|election of March 1948]], taking a Fălciu seat in the [[Great National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 310–311; Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to return to a secure position after [[Mihai Magheru]] took over as Ambassador, in late 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 226, 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his scholarly work, Ralea had to refrain from calling himself a "sociologist", as that field of research had been declared "reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was again given the position of psychology chair at the University of Bucharest, and was also made a member of the new [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History|Institute of History and Philosophy]], whose president was Constantinescu-Iași. Ralea was seconded there by [[Constantin Ionescu Gulian]], with whom he did research into the history of Romanian materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 237–246&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tract, ''Explicarea omului'' ("Explaining Man"). Translated into the French by [[Eugène Ionesco]],&lt;ref name="apmorală3"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Antonio Patraș]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PATRASfeb7.html "Pentru o morală a grației (III)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it was published at [[Presses Universitaires de France]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"&gt;François Evain, "Revue des livres. Mihai Ralea, ''Explication de l'Homme''", in ''Études'', Nr. 6/1950, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, he had been accepted into the [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|recently purged]] [[Romanian Academy]], at the same time as Balmuș, [[Raluca Ripan]], [[Grigore Moisil]], [[Ștefan Milcu]], [[Camil Petrescu]], and PCdR historian [[Mihail Roller]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; A contributor to the PCdR daily, ''[[Scînteia]]'', as well as to its youth supplement and its cultural reviews (''Studii'', ''[[Contemporanul]]'', etc.),&lt;ref name="mstr586"/&gt; Ralea also sat on the editorial staff of the Academy Historical Section's trimonthly, ''Buletin Științific'', alongside Roller, [[David Prodan]], and [[Constantin Moisil]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Berindei]], "''Buletin Științific''", in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești'', [[Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1978, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Workers' Party (as the PCdR was known after absorbing the PSDR) was collecting evidence incriminating Ralea. In October 1949, taking its cue from Roller and [[Leonte Răutu]], the party press carried notes critical of Ralea and Gulian's research.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 242–247&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Roller suggested that Ralea's introduction to the works of [[Vasile Conta]] was not up to Marxist standards, and also hinted that Ralea held too many offices.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securitate]] secret police opened a file on him, which recorded his criticism of Roller and other "ignoramuses" promoted by the regime; in exchange, the Securitate labeled Ralea "opportunistic" and "a danger to our regime."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1950, his office at the Institute was infiltrated by informants, and probably also [[Covert listening device|bugged]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea responded to the pressures by presenting his services as an anti-American propagandist, making his first-hand experience in America into an irreplaceable asset; this assignment was inaugurated in January 1951, when Ralea and Gulian published in ''Studii'' a piece addressing the immorality of "[[American imperialism|American imperialists]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; Working under direct Soviet supervision, Ralea took charge of a research project endorsed by the entire Institute: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman al psihologiei americane'' ("The Anti-Science and Anti-Humanity Nature of American Psychology", published 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 248–249, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; He was again able to rescue Vianu, this time from communist persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 308–309; Vasile (2010), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and intervened to save the career of writer [[Costache Olăreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cronicar, [http://www.romlit.ro/act4099 "Actualitatea: Costache Olăreanu par lui-même"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 40/1999&lt;/ref&gt; More discreetly, he paid the bills of his former teacher, Rădulescu-Motru, who had been expelled from academia,&lt;ref name="zavr256"/&gt; and rescued from eviction the conductor [[George Georgescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not protect either his brother-in-law Suchianu, who was arrested and held in communist prisons,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; nor Chelariu, who was sacked and had to work as a rat-catcher.&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt; His disciple, [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]] [[Tatiana Slama-Cazacu]], was forced to abandon her doctorate studies because of her political nonconformism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Al. Niculescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/requiem_pentru_o_savant "Requiem pentru o savantă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea still had friendly contacts with his former supervisors in Foreign Affairs, though he complained to his peers that Pauker was snubbing him.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea, who had fallen out with the Workers' Party regime and spent time in prison, later alleged that Ralea, "the impenitent servant", cultivated the friendship of communist women, from Pauker to [[Liuba Chișinevschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/extraordinarul_petre_pandrea_i "Extraordinarul Petre Pandrea (I)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea witnessed Pauker's 1952 downfall and banishment, and reputedly kept himself informed about her activities through mutual acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p. 268.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own survival in the post-Pauker era was an unusual feat. According to Pandrea, it was possible only because Ralea was "without scruples", always ready for a "cowardly submission", and a "valet" of Workers' Party potentates such as [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]].&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; As a sign that he was still protected by the regime, in February 1953 Ralea was awarded the [[Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic|Star of the People's Republic]], Second Class.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; A close bond existed between Ralea and the Workers' Party chief, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who began cultivating his very own intellectual circle after engineering Pauker's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 161; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in early 1953 signaled a path toward less dogmatism. This initially hurt Ralea: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'', now seen as embarrassing, was not given mass circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ralea supported Gheorghiu-Dej's adoption of a [[National communism in Romania|national communist]] platform, which was presented as an alternative to Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Over the early 1950s, he had grown disgusted and alarmed by the impact of communist policies in education, but still fearful of approaching the topic in his dealings with communist potentates.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, with the relaxation of political pressures, he went public with his criticism, issued as a report to the Workers' Party leadership. It spoke about the poor scientific standards at Romania's universities, and criticized the appointment of political workers as school principals.&lt;ref&gt;Cristian Vasile, "Propaganda and Culture in Romania at the Beginning of the Communist Regime", in [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] (ed.), ''Stalinism Revisited: The Establishment of Communist Regimes in East-Central Europe''. [[Central European University|CEU Press]], Budapest, 2009, pp. 378–379.  {{ISBN|978-963-9776-63-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also condemned the Art Ministry for promoting "mediocrities" as cultural inspectors,&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; but avoided any proposal for actual liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, the Romanian school of psychology had been relaunched, and its official publications recommended Ralea as a main reference, but without mentioning ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 236, 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, some Romanian anticommunist circles also began taking an interest in Ralea, vainly hoping that he would be appointed premier of a [[De-Stalinization in Romania|post-Stalinist Romania]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt;

===Final years===

In 1956, the psychology section became an independent Institute, and Ralea became its chairman.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"&gt;Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Ralea published his historical essay on French politics and culture, ''Cele două Franțe'' ("The Two Frances"). It came out in a 1959 French edition, as ''Les Visages de France'', with a preface by [[Roger Garaudy]].&lt;ref name="adf253"&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Traditions of Invention: Romanian Ethnic and Social Stereotypes in Historical Context'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 2013, p. 253.  {{ISBN|978-90-04-21617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also one of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company [[Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă]]. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 ''Scrieri din trecut'' ("Writings from the Past).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/istoria_unei_ediii "Istoria unei ediții"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 8/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 ''În extremul occident'' ("Into the Far West").&lt;ref name="adf253"/&gt; It had comments on the "iron fisted rule" of the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]], and gibes at "the putrefied lazy specimens" of "exploiters" in [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|pre-communist Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 ''Istoria psihologiei'' ("History of Psychology").&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 149; (2010), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; According to memoirist C. D. Zeletin, Ralea and Vianu had a "courageous and noble" stand after the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956|student protest of 1956]]: acting together, they obtained the release from Securitate custody of Dumitru D. Panaitescu, son of the critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Zeletin, "Perpessicius, sau Pentru ca fresca să nu se șteargă (1)", in ''Acolada'', Nr. 12/2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea and his family lived at a luxurious villa on Washington Street, [[Dorobanți]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 36, 118, 197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he had been re-inducted into the literary canon, mentioned in official manuals as one of sixteen critics whose work supported "socialist construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/canonul_literar_proletcultist_iii "Canonul literar proletcultist (III)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Ralea and Vianu mounted campaign for Marxist humanism, and were elected to the National Board of [[UNESCO]] (Ralea was its vice president). Their actions were condemned at the time by the exile writer [[Virgil Ierunca]], who described their "solemn agitation" as a new ruse on the part of Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], [http://193.226.7.140/~laszlo/eleonardo/n18/Laszlo7.htm "Domnul T."], in ''E-Leonardo'', Nr. 18/2012; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also sent abroad with a dossier on exile writer [[Vintilă Horia]], who had received the [[Prix Goncourt]]. It showed evidence of Horia's support for interwar fascism. Ralea's mission was hampered by revelations about his own compromises with fascism, published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[Paris-Presse]]'' and the Romanian diaspora press, under such titles as: "Ralea used to [[Roman salute|lift his arm really high]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; According to later assessments, the Horia affair and Ralea's participation therein were instrumented by the Securitate.&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 312; {{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ultimul_mesaj_al_lui_vintil_horia "Ultimul mesaj al lui Vintilă Horia"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 50/2008; Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/vintil_horia_exorcist_al_exilului "Vintilă Horia, exorcist al exilului"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 30/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Adhering to the official cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Mihai, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cerberul-ceausescu-contra-lui-zaharia-stancu-agentul-sigurantei "Cerberul Ceaușescu contra lui Zaharia Stancu, 'agentul Siguranței'"], in ''Historia'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; and a seat on the republican [[State Council of Romania|Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a [[Geneva]] conference on the [[generation gap]], alongside [[Louis Armand]], [[Claude Autant-Lara]], and [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;C. V., "Bibliographie critique. ''La vie et le temps. Les générations dans le monde actuel. Texte des conférences et entretiens des Rencontres internationales de Genève 1962''", in ''Population'', Nr. 3/1964, p. 604&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, [[Traian Herseni]]. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they published ''Sociologia succesului'' ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym ''Traian Hariton''.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 703; Straje, p. 323; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7; Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such interventions, Ralea was publicly shamed by the dissident poet [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], who nicknamed him the communist "Viceroy", or "Immo-Ralea".&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his younger colleague George C. Basiliade, Ralea was an "unfulfilled sybarite", whose luxurious lifestyle did not fit his physical frame and his background.&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy smoker, and prone to culinary excesses, Ralea checked himself in [[Otopeni]] hospital showing symptoms of [[facial nerve paralysis]], with [[hypertension]] and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; Against the advice of his doctors, he decided to attend a UNESCO meeting in [[Copenhagen]]. He died aboard the train, outside [[East Berlin]], on the morning of August 17, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 438. See also S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; His body was transported back to Bucharest, and buried at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], Bucharest, 1972, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Herseni had been working on a textbook, ''Introducere în psihologia socială'' ("Companion to Social Psychology"), which only saw print in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 702, 703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of culture==

===Generic traits===
As seen by Zavarache, Ralea was a man of "outstanding intelligence" with an "encyclopedic knowledge, tightly aligned with the rhythms of Western culture."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's contemporaries left remarks on not just his hyperactivity, but also his neglect of details, and his eclecticism. [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] remarked of "petulant" Ralea: "Here is a soul who will not stand for the label of specialization!"&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Eugen Lovinescu]] dismissed Ralea as "a fecund ideologue, paradoxical in his association and dissociation of varied and superficial ideals that have happened to have points of contact with Romanian literature."&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He reads both Ralea and Suchianu as displays of "useless erudition" and "failure of logic".&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 117, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Completing this verdict, [[Monica Lovinescu]] saw Ralea as "not truly a literary critic", but "a sociologist, a psychologist, a moralist—a moralist with no morals, and yet a moralist".&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; More leniently, [[George Călinescu]] noted that Ralea was an "[[Epicureanism|epicurean]]" of "vivid intelligence", who only chronicled "books that he has enjoyed reading". His free associations of concepts were "very often surprising, quite often admirable".&lt;ref name="gc911"/&gt; Ralea, Călinescu proposes, was Romania's own "little [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt;

After his French sojourn, Ralea infused Poporanism and collectivism with both [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s corporatism&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118. See also Vianu, p. 146; Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theory of "[[class consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In his earliest work, he also referenced [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]'s ideas about the [[Conflict theories|fundamental inequality]] of class-based societies. These references helped him build a critique of innate "class solidarity" as presumed by early corporatism, and also of Proudhon's [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 27, 101–102, 144, 147, 149, 152, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this collectivist-functionalist outlook, and although he spoke out against [[art for art's sake]], Ralea was adamant that strictly sociological explanations of creativity were doomed to fail. As he put it, all attributes of a writer were "subsidiary to [his] creative originality".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea reduced [[aestheticism]] and [[social determinism]] to the basic units of "aesthetics" and "ethnicity". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality.&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129, 130; E. Lovinescu, pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was "obliged" to address the national society he lived in, "at the present stage in civilization": "If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, that is to say the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd stand to lose his means of expression, the point of contact with his public".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic [[Petru Comarnescu]]) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

With this analysis of aesthetic principles, borrowing from [[Henri Bergson]], Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in [[relativism]] and [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; With his respect for critical intuition, his critique of determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the "aesthetic autonomism" of [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 151–152; Ornea (1998), pp. 146–147, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or "unforeseen significances"),&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the [[semiotics]] of [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="agutopia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex Goldiș, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/10/adrian-marino-si-utopia-teoriei-literaturii/ "Adrian Marino și utopia teoriei literaturii"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 343, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Între două lumi'', he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"/&gt;

===National psychology===
In his essay ''Fenomenul Românesc'' ("The Romanian Phenomenon"), Ralea elaborated on the issue of Romanian [[national psychology]]. He understood this as a natural development of [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s sociological "science of the nation", but better suited to the topic and more resourceful.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, Romanians were structurally opposed to mysticism, which could not compliment their true character: "good-natured, even-minded, sharp-witted like all meridional men, [and] extremely lucid."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The "Romanian soul" was therefore an adaptable and pragmatic entity, mixing a Western propensity for action with a [[Levant]]ine [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Combating antisemitism, Ralea applied this theory to the issue of [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|European Jewish intelligence]]: quoting [[Werner Sombart]], he deduced that the "rationalist", "progressive" and "utilitarian" essence of Jewishness was socially determined by the Jews' participation in capitalist competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Oișteanu]], ''Inventing the Jew. Antisemitic Stereotypes in Romanian and Other Central East-European Cultures'', [[University of Nebraska Press]], Lincoln, 2009, pp. 56, 149.  {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ralea was personally responsible for establishing a laboratory of [[experimental psychology]] at Iași, he in fact abhorred experimental methods, and preferred to rely on intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; As a theorist, he gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, in the face of philosophical sobriety. He commended [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the creator of modern [[Romanian humor]], as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Călinescu, Ralea "either intentionally or unconsciously [suggests] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: "maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done us a great harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iari_despre_caragiale "Iarăși despre Caragiale"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2006&lt;/ref&gt; During his polemic with ''[[Sburătorul]]'' modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: "Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [the modernists]. They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of "lassitude" and "cowardice" in urban life is "a severe diagnostic of his own disease."&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

On such grounds, Ralea concluded that Romanian writers "have had no deep spiritual experience", lacking "a comprehension of humanity, of life and death."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in ''Perspective'', Ralea asked: "Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a "great moral significance".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188; Vianu, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral [[Romanian folklore]] and modern literary choices: in the absence of any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and ''[[Doina|doine]]'' had naturally mutated into novellas.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 153, 154&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an "inflation of novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/granta-romania#"Granta de România"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 502, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conformist Marxism===
In a 1945 interview with writer [[Ion Biberi]], Ralea explained himself as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], influenced by [[André Malraux]] and by unspecified "recent Russian doctrinaires".&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; Expanding on his earlier stances, he understood the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] as both desirable and inevitable, to be received with "enthusiasm" by the masses: "[it] provides practically infinite production opportunities, because it excludes personal gain and is no longer dominated by the game of markets, of supply and demand."&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived of a socialism wherein "man, integrated with communal life, shall have full liberty in his actions".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]], Ralea's discourse is to be read as a "celebration of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation was accelerated during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying [[Marxist aesthetics]] and [[Marxist literary criticism]], advising young literati, and his colleague Vianu, to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} G. Pienescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/70_via-a-romaneasca-1-2-2011/49_note-din-launtru/793_sub-vremi.html "...sub vremi"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 1&amp;ndash;2/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it as an obstacle to the proper understanding of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Christian Maner, "Noțiunea de Europa din perspectiva științei istorice românești", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching aid for social psychology was similarly adjusted, introducing chapters on "class psychology", though, as Zavarache argues, these modifications were "surprisingly kept to a minimum".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in his reedited ''Scrieri din trecut'', Ralea sought to reconcile Ibrăileanu's [[social Darwinism]] with the official readings of Marxism, as well as with [[Lysenkoism|Michurinism]] and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodora Dumitru, "«Selecție» și «mutație»: două concepte pentru explicarea fenomenului literar", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. VII, Issue 2, 2011, pp. 44, 48, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaped by political command, ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'' excoriated American psychologists as tools of the capitalist regime, claiming that capitalism cultivated "force", "triviality", and "sexual debauchery"; Ralea also stated his outrage at the absence of socialized health care in the United States, even though he privately explained that American workers led "satisfactory" lives.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; To his peers, Ralea complained that "the adoption of a Marxist canon was stifling his ability to interpret", and therefore prevented him from "elaborating valuable papers."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; He "doubtlessly never imagined that there would be such excess and distortion", and tried to persuade [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]] not to exaggerate his works' anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Explicarea omului'', Vianu notes, Ralea brought up "a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself ''obstacles'' and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [Vianu's emphasis]."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as "a mechanism for social self-regulation", which helped to distill the "[[Élan vital|vital impulse]]", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt; Overall, Ralea contended that "[[dialectical materialism]] has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring". That answer was in "[[Base and superstructure|superstructures]]", and the references were Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], alongside [[Ludwig Klages]] and [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of [[psychological anthropology]], and merely showed "what superstructures become under Marxist materialism."&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; Contrarily, critic [[Antonio Patraș]] noted the links between ''Explicarea omului'' (a "brilliant study") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt;

''Sociologia succesului'' was to some extent dependent on Ralea's study of Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society|Division of Labor]]'', with its distinction between laws of punishment and laws of restitution (or reward). Ralea maintained that remedial sanctions were a characteristic of modern civilized society, and that the [[social fact]] of "success" was created within that setting.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 547–548&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was heavily reliant on [[Marxist sociology]], hypothesizing that socialist societies had perfected new incentives for workers to set collective objectives and succeed at them.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huhnwald, "Bibliographie. Ralea M., Hariton T., ''Sociologia succesului''", in ''Revue Française de Sociologie'', Nr. 2/1964, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Edgar Krau, Ralea and Herseni gave credibility to "the tenet that the individualistic ethics of capitalism disunites and hurts people"; however, they ignored the reality of communism, which was "not [its] collectivism, but the all-pervading party tuition".&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Krau, ''Social and Economic Management in the Competitive Society'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 36–37.  {{ISBN|0-7923-8028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, ''Sociologia succesului'' was mainly noted for reintegrating professional (albeit antiquated) references to American psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"/&gt; It marked a fundamental step in the restoration of Romanian sociology, and also allowed Ralea to publish again on a subject which had preoccupied him since 1944.&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ralea was survived by his only child, daughter Catinca Ralea (1929–1981). In her twenties, she cultivated a literary circle which included poet [[Geo Dumitrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a career in letters, before becoming a [[Radio Romania International]] reporter and [[Romanian Television]] producer.&lt;ref name="acfresh"&gt;Alice Caster, "A Short, Fresh Look At Canadian Life", in ''[[The Ottawa Journal]]'', March 18, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 157; (2010), pp. 307, 517&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Catinca provided live coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, including the first [[Moon landing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Un mare comentator sportiv – Ion Ghiţulescu", in ''Buletin de Istoria Presei'', Issues 8–9/2015, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she is remembered for her translations from [[J. D. Salinger]] (which fed Romania's [[counterculture of the 1960s]])&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Brumaru]], "Crepusculul civil de dimineață. După lungi și dulci discuții...", in ''Suplimentul de Cultură'', Issue 133, June 2007, p. 11; Adina Popescu, "Literatura imaginarului", in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 115, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With Eugenia Cîncea, she completed a best-selling translation of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which had five editions between 1962 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Andreea-Mihaela Tamba, "Translating vs. Rewriting during the Romanian Communist Period — Prefaces to Translations of ''Vanity Fair'' and ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. IX, Issue 2, 2013, pp. 267, 268, 269&lt;/ref&gt; Against her father's wish,&lt;ref name="acfresh"/&gt; she married in 1958 the actor [[Emanoil Petruț]], who survived her by two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Loreta Popa, [http://jurnalul.ro/cultura/film/amintiri-din-copilarie-534042.html "Amintiri din copilărie"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', January 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihai Ralea's death, coinciding with a spell of liberalization, created unexpected room for maneuver for a younger generation of literary critics and historians, who were anti-sociological, subjectivist, and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism'', Editura Pontica, Constanța, 2002, pp. 117–118.  {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some members of this intellectual school, such as [[Adrian Marino]]&lt;ref name="agutopia"/&gt; and [[Matei Călinescu]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Axinte]], "Modele ale criticii literare postbelice. E. Lovinescu, G. Ibrăileanu, G. Călinescu", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 2/2011, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; continued to draw inspiration from Ralea, having rediscovered his early Bergsonian essays. They were joined in this by [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], the novelist and Marxist literary theorist.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 395–398&lt;/ref&gt; From within the anti-communist movement, Ralea was defended by author [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]. Although a devout Orthodox, Steinhardt treasured the non-believers Ralea and [[Paul Zarifopol]] for their "quick wit".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], "Nicolae Steinhardt", in ''Caiete Critice'', Issues 1–2/2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] and the fall of communism, Ralea's Dobrina estate was transferred by government order to the [[Diocese of Huși|Orthodox Diocese of Huși]], and came to host a convent.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; His Dorobanți villa, which Catinca Ralea had sold, bears a memorial plaque honoring the sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 197, 325&lt;/ref&gt; By Government Act 503/1998, the Romanian Academy Institute of Psychology was renamed ''Mihai Ralea Institute''.&lt;ref&gt;"Guvernul României. Hotărârea nr. 503/1998 privind modificarea denumirii unor unități de cercetare din subordinea Academiei Române", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Part I, Nr. 307/1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Huși library, also named after Ralea, has been hosting the entire corpus of his works since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.vrn.ro/biblioteca-husi-are-acum-intreaga-colectie-a-scrierilor-lui-mihai-ralea "Biblioteca Huși are acum întreaga colecție a scrierilor lui Mihai Ralea!"], in ''Vremea Nouă'', November 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's early sociological writings were republished, as ''Fenomenul Românesc'', in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 355, 376&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his sociological contribution was being reassessed in various ways, leading to a reissue of his essays as a 1997 volume, put out by [[Constantin Schifirneț]] at [[Editura Albatros]].&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"/&gt; Around 1995, a heated public debate erupted, focusing on the careers of leftist intellectuals such as Ralea, and their supposed acts of self-betrayal. The central question, brought up by researcher [[Marin Nițescu]], was: would they have done better not to publish at all under communism?&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 21, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a group of sociologists defended Ralea's prestige, noting that "we [Romanians] are inexcusably delaying in recognizing Mihai Ralea's sociological contribution".&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"/&gt;

==About==

Napoleonic studies is a speciality at various universities as well as private Napoleonic societies, including the International Napoleonic Society and the Napoleonic Historical Society. Though the history of the [[Napoleonic era]] has been extensively studied, the field of Napoleonic studies as a defined area of academia has emerged only in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broers|first1=Michael|title=Europe Under Napoleon|date=2014|publisher=I.B.

French historian [[Jean Tulard]], who founded the  l'Institut Napoleon at the [[École pratique des hautes études|École Pratique de Hautes Études]] of [[Paris-Sorbonne University]], has been credited with establishing the field of Napoleonic studies as a serious academic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Englund|first1=Steven|title=Napoleon: A Political Life|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-674-01803-6|page=540|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_q6b24_hXAC&amp;pg=PA540&amp;lpg=PA540|ref=Englund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salt lake-street.jpg|thumb|View from Rio Grande Street in Salt Lake City, Utah]]

'''Operation Rio Grande''' is the codename given to a massive multi-agency collaboration to promote public safety in the Rio Grande neighborhood of [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. It consists of three phases. Phase one was rolled out on August 14, 2017.&lt;ref name="Utah Gov"&gt;{{cite web |title = Operation Rio Grande |url = http://operationriogrande.utah.gov/ |website = operationriogrande.utah.gov |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase one was targeted enforcement of laws. Phase two is rehabilitation of offenders who were arrested in phase one. Phase three will be to find jobs for all rehabilitated offenders. Its biggest impact is on Salt Lake's [[homelessness|homeless]] population, as the neighborhood has a very high density of homeless people and homeless services. The two year cost to fund the operation is estimated at {{US$|67{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}.

== Details ==
Operation Rio Grande started its three phase rollout on August 14, 2017 in the Rio Grande neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah. The first phase was enforcement of laws. Part of the operation included an order from Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski, shutting down Rio Grande Street permanently to vehicles and pedestrians to create a drug free zone.&lt;ref name="SLCgov"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Rojas |first1 = Matthew |title = Operation Rio Grande |url = http://www.slcgov.com/tags/operation-rio-grande |website = www.slcgov.com |publisher = SLCgov.com |accessdate = September 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Biskupski stalled the closure for three weeks while she took public comment and went through city processes.&lt;ref name="Closure Delay"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Woodruff |first1 = Daniel |title = Tension erupts between House speaker, SLC mayor over Operation Rio Grande |url = http://kmyu.tv/news/local/tension-erupts-between-house-speaker-slc-mayor-over-operation-rio-grande |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = KMYU/KUTV |date = August 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Utah state Governor Gary Herbert has called the state legislature into a special session to discuss the various aspects of the massive crackdown and intervention.&lt;ref name="Special Session 2"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = McKellar |first1 = Katie |title = Herbert To Call Special Session To Deal With Operation Rio Grande Issues Next Week |url = https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865688709/Herbert-to-call-special-session-to-deal-with-Operation-Rio-Grande-issues-next-week.html |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = DeseretNews.com |date = September 13, 2017 |ref = Gov Herbert |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskupski"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Winslow |first1 = Ben |title = Governor to call special session on 'Operation Rio Grande' issues next week |url = http://fox13now.com/2017/09/13/governor-to-call-special-session-on-operation-rio-grande-issues-next-week/ |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = fox13now.com |date = September 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Special Session"&gt;{{cite news |title = Herbert to call special session to deal with Operation Rio Grande issues next week – Utah Standard News |url = https://www.utahstandardnews.com/herbert-call-special-session-deal-operation-rio-grande-issues-next-week/ |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = Utah Standard News |date = September 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies participating are the Utah Department of Public Safety, state probation and parole officers, Utah Highway Patrol, social workers, and lawyers. The operation has also led to arrests in [[Ogden, Utah]]. Out of the over 1000 people arrested, 676 non-violent offenders were released because of jail overcrowding, ability to obtain bail or to attend court dates. Most of the charges were for misdemeanors.&lt;ref name="Ogden Raids"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Mims |first1 = Bob |title = SLC's 'Operation Rio Grande' leads to Ogden drug raid, arrests |url = http://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/09/13/slcs-operation-rio-grande-leads-to-ogden-drug-raid-arrests/ |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = The Salt Lake Tribune |date = September 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the arrestees, 35 have been identified as being eligible for Salt Lake's drug court.

Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes and Department of Public Safety Commissioner Keith Squires also emphasized that the law enforcement prong of Operation Rio Grande—its name aside—won't be confined to the Rio Grande area. If wrongdoers "run and try to hide at the Jordan River, we're going to the Jordan River. If they're going to South Salt Lake, we're going to South Salt Lake. West Valley—were going there," Hughes said. "This is not about a geographic area, per se, as it is what has hurt this community, the state and the people that live in it. And we're going to eradicate that."&lt;ref name="Operation a Go"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Piper |first1 = Matthew |title = ‘Operation Rio Grande’ launched near homeless shelter with arrests, big jump in police presence |url = http://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/08/14/operation-rio-grande-crackdown-near-homeless-shelter-now-underway/ |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = The Salt Lake Tribune |date = August 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin Jolley"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Jolley |first1 = Calvin |title = Commentary: Operation Rio Grande is driven by fearmongering |url = http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2017/09/09/commentary-operation-rio-grande-is-driven-by-fearmongering/ |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = The Salt Lake Tribune |date = September 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house speaker, and also Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox estimate the two year cost of the operation to be $67{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref name="67 Million"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Winslow |first1 = Ben |title = The price tag for Operation Rio Grande? $67 million |url = http://fox13now.com/2017/08/28/the-price-tag-for-operation-rio-grande-67-million/ |accessdate = September 16, 2017 |work = fox13now.com |date = August 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of psychedelic literature''', works related to [[psychedelic drug]]s and the [[psychedelic experience]]. '''Psychedelic literature''' has also been defined as textual works that arose from the proliferation of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic research with [[hallucinogen]]s during the 1950s and early 1960s in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/4207/DickinsR.pdf The Birth of Psychedelic Literature: Drug Writing and the rise of LSD Therapy 1954 – 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4757">[[File:Lilith Periodo de Isin Larsa y Babilonia.JPG|thumb|220px|right|The goddess of the [[Burney relief]] presenting a '''rod-and-ring''' symbol in each hand.]]

The '''Rod and ring symbol''' is a symbol that is depicted on Mesopotamian [[stela]]s, [[cylinder seal]]s and [[relief]]s. It is held by a god or goddess and in most cases is being offered to a king who is standing, often making a sacrifice, or otherwise showing respect. The symbol dates from the [[Sumerian Renaissance]] to the [[Neo-Assyrian Period]], and is commonly explained as a [[wiktionary:coil|coil]] of [[measuring string]] and a [[yardstick]].&lt;ref name="TJ"&gt;Jacobsen, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories are that they are a [[shepherd's crook]] and a [[nose rope]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallo, W.W. 2005. Sumerian history in pictures: a new look at the ‘Stele of the Flying Angels’, in: Y. Sefati et al (eds), ‘An Experienced Scribe who Neglects Nothing’: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Honor of Jacob Klein. Bethesda, MD: CDL Press, 142-62.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the ring is no rope at all.&lt;ref&gt;Van Buren, E.D. 1949. The rod and ring. ArO 17 (2), 434-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the symbol is seen on the [[Code of Hammurabi]] stela. The most elaborate depiction is found on the  [[Ur-Nammu]]-stela, where the winding of the cords has been detailed by the sculptor. This has also been described as a "staff and a chaplet of beads".&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, Anthony Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia'', Rod and Ring, p 156.&lt;/ref&gt; There is discussion whether the Ur-Nammu-stela is showing the same thing.

==Scepter, throne, and ring: Enuma Elish==
The myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent to the nether world describes how the goddess dresses and prepares herself: "She held the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand."&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.4.1 Inana's descent to the nether world] line 25. The Sumerian has: gi-diš-'''nindan''' '''eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' za-gin&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; šu ba-ni-in-du&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; i.e. taken literally the rod would have the length of one ''nindan'' (6 cubit = 5.94m) and the eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  the surveyor's line - would be ten ''nindan'' in length.&lt;/ref&gt;

In tablet IV of the [[Enuma Elish]], the rod and ring symbol is referenced as:
:"They rejoiced, and they did homage unto him, saying, "[[Marduk]] is King!"&lt;br&gt;They bestowed upon him the scepter, and the throne, and the ring.&lt;br&gt;They gave him an invincible weaponry which overwhelmeth the foe."&lt;ref&gt;Enuma Elish, tablet IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols that appear similar==
*The Egyptian [[Shen ring]] has an identical resemblance.
*The Greek goddess [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]] uses a different type of [[investiture]] symbol for the victor in the sporting races, a ''wreath of laurel'', or a wreath of olive branches, but she is depicted with a ring, a rigid circle.
*The [[Faravahar]], the symbol of [[Zoroastrianism]], also holds a ring.
*The Egyptian [[Ankh]] has a vaguely similar form but is used in very different contexts.
*At the 6th century B.C.E. archaeological site of [[Cancho Roano]], located near [[Zalamea de la Serena]], Badajoz, Spain, a large feature in the shape of the rod and ring symbol was modeled into the floor of the innermost chamber of a [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] temple.
*This symbol also bears a resemblance to an ancient rune called a [[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]] or thorn, which means "frost giant" or "giant".

[[image:Rosenbom replika1956.jpg|thumb|The original inside the church]]
In front of the [[Karlskrona Admiralty Church]], in Sweden, the popular wooden figure of '''Gubben Rosenbom''' (''Old Man Rosenbom'') has been standing since the mid 18th century. In 1956 the original was replaced by a copy and put in a safer place inside the church. The life-size figure is actually a poor box, which means, if you lift its hat, you can insert a coin for the poor.

The figure holds a placard in one hand which states in a slightly old-fashioned Swedish:

:I humbly beg of you,
:even though my voice may be weak,
:come and put a penny in
:but first lift my hat.
:Blessed are those that care for the poor.

The last sentence is from the [[Bible]].

The figure of Rosenbom is particularly well-known because it is featured in [[Selma Lagerlöf]]'s book ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''. There, the title hero meets Rosenbom and speaks with him.

'''Sawiri''' or '''SAWAIRY''' or '''es-SAWAIRI'''  (الصويري)  is a town (village) in the eastern part of [[Lebanon]].
Its is located in the West Bekaa District near the [[Syria]]n borders, in [[Governorates of Lebanon|governorate]]  of [[Beqaa Governorate|Beqaa]] in the foothills of the eastern mountains.

Al-Masna (المصنع) is the main check point between the Lebanese &amp; Syrian Borders and it is located in the territory of Sawiri.

&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age Sites in Lebanon: North, South and East-Central Lebanon, p. 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhPRQwAACAAJ|accessdate=29 August 2011|year=1966|publisher=Impr. Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Sawiri's population is over 20,000 people with many of its inhabitants having immigrated to the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Canada and France in the 1900s. The major surnames or families in Sawiri are Janbein ,Amer, Berro, Balhis, El Smaily(Smaily or Smaili), Youssef, Abdel Razzak, Zeitoun, Shouman, Abou Nemry, Taleb, Shalaby, Abou Arab, Chebli, Tahan, Salha or Salim, Abdallah , Zrara, Almoghabbat and Saleh

== Schools in Sawiri ==
Until the early 1990s, Sawiri had only two schools (Makased School and Sawiri Official School) educating up to Grade 9. At that time, the Sawiris used to continue their high school education in the neighbour towns of their village and then their university studies in Beirut. Sawiri nowadays has three big schools which allow the students to pass the Lebanese Brevet Examinations (Grade 9). Sawiri has one high school (Grade 12) which is funded by the Lebanese Ministry of Education. This high school is called: Sawiri Official High School. It started in 2003

== Agriculture in Sawiri ==
Sawiri is an agriculture and service-oriented town. Most people own their land and come from a farming background. Sawiri produces lentils, figs, and Armenian cucumbers (mikthi). However, olive, [[Almond]], [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] and cherry trees have been grown rapidly as well as grape vines of all sorts in the last 3 decades. In the last 15 years, many "Sawiris" started growing up peanuts ([[Sterculia quadrifida]]) trees too.

== Sawiri's Neighborhood ==
Sawiri is very close to [[Anjar, Lebanon]] and [[Baalbek]] where ancient history can be seen in the Roman and Umayyad ruins. It is also opposite the [[Tell Ain el Meten]], a [[Heavy Neolithic]] archaeological site that was once used by the [[Qaraoun culture]] during the deforestation of Lebanon in [[prehistory]]. Some of the flints found at the site possibly date back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] with other evidence of pottery from the [[Early Bronze Age]] and [[Middle Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

'''The Scout Association of the British Virgin Islands''' operates as a branch of the United Kingdom [[The Scout Association|Scout Association]], due to the [[British Virgin Islands]]' affiliation as a [[British overseas territories|British Overseas Territory]]. The BVI Scout Oath and Law, as well as other Scouting requirements, closely follow that of the United Kingdom.

Although the program activities are taken from the British system, BVI Scouting is geared to the [[Caribbean]] way of life. Training for [[Wood Badge]] and leader training are conducted with the help of British and nearby Caribbean Scout associations. BVI Scouts participate in numerous Caribbean camps and events.

The '''British Virgin Islands Girl Guide Association''' is a [[Girl Guides|Guiding]] organisation in the [[British Virgin Islands]]. It is one of the nine branch associations of [[Girlguiding UK]]. It is represented by Girlguiding UK at [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) level and Girlguiding UK's Chief Guide is also Chief Guide for British Virgin Islands Girlguiding. British Virgin Islands Girlguiding is part of the [[Caribbean Link for Guiding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Face to face with globalization | publisher = [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts|WAGGGS]] | date = 2006-06-15 | url = http://western.wagggsworld.org/en/news/389 | accessdate = 2006-10-30 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070629140158/http://western.wagggsworld.org/en/news/389 | archivedate = 2007-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''solar term''' is any of 24 points in traditional [[East Asia]]n [[lunisolar calendar]]s that matches a particular astronomical event or signifies some natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asia-home.com/china/solterms.php|title=24 Chinese Feasts (Jiéqì, 节气), equivalent to the 24 Chinese Solar Terms|work=Chinese calendar|publisher=asia-home.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The points are spaced 15° apart along the [[ecliptic]]&lt;ref&gt;Until 1644(Chinese Empire and its tributary states) or 1844(Japan) a period of time of the solar year itself had been equally divided instead of the spatial zodiac.&lt;/ref&gt; and are used by lunisolar calendars to stay synchronized with the seasons, which is crucial for agrarian societies. The solar terms are also used to calculate [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary months]] in East Asian calendars;&lt;ref&gt;When a lunar month's end does not reach a midpoint of the solar terms, it is regarded as the last month's intercalary one instead of the true "next" month. It is called 歳中閏月法 lit."midpoint intercalating system".&lt;/ref&gt; which month is repeated depends on the position of the sun at the time.

Because the [[Sun]]'s speed along the ecliptic varies depending on the Earth-Sun distance, the number of days that it takes the Sun to travel between each pair of solar terms varies slightly throughout the year. Each solar term is divided into three {{ill|Pentad (calendar)|lt=pentads|ja|七十二候}} (候 ''hòu'') ([[:ja:七十二候|ja]]), so there are 72 pentads in a year. Each pentad consists of five, rarely six, days, and are mostly named after [[phenology|phenological]] (biological or botanical) phenomena corresponding to the pentad.

Solar terms originated in [[China]], then spread to [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Japan]], countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. Although each term was named based on the seasonal changes of climate in [[North China Plain]], peoples living in the different climates still use it with no changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koyomi8.com/reki_doc/doc_0702.htm なぜずれる？　二十四節気と季節感 (Why off-point? -solar terms and our real feeling of the seasons)]  An example in Japan. It compares the climate of [[Taiyuan]] with that of [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]]. In maritime Japanese islands difference of the seasonal gap length is the main problem. In [[subtropical]] or [[tropical]] regions including [[southern china]] climate difference is more serious.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exhibited by the fact that [[traditional Chinese]], [[Hanja]], and [[Kanji]] characters for most of the solar terms are identical.

On December 1, 2016, 24 Solar Terms were listed as [[UNESCO]]'s [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= An intro to China’s 24 Solar Terms|url= http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1021416.shtml |publisher= Global Times |accessdate= 2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional note==
In Japan, the term [[Setsubun]] (節分) originally referred to the eves of [[Risshun]] (立春, 315°, the beginning of Spring) [[Lixia|Rikka]] (立夏, 45°, the beginning of Summer), [[Risshū]] (立秋, 135°, the beginning of Autumn), and [[Lidong|Rittō]] (立冬, 225°, the beginning of Winter), but currently mostly refers to the day before Risshun. The name of each solar term also refers to the period of time between that day and the next solar term, or 1/24th of a year.

A '''supporting character''' is a [[fictional character|character]] in a [[narrative]] that is not the focus of the primary [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]], but appears or is mentioned in the story enough to be more than just a minor character or a [[cameo appearance]]. Sometimes, supporting characters may develop a complex [[back-story]] of their own, but this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than entirely independently. In television, supporting characters may appear in more than half of the episodes per season.

In some cases, especially in ongoing material such as comic books and television series, supporting characters themselves may become main characters in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] if they are sufficiently popular with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=THR|title=6 Characters Who Became the Stars of Their Own Spinoff Films|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/minions-5-character-spinoff-films-808201|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qazi Syed Hayatullah''' (died c. 1135 AH / 1722 AD) was a Muslim scholar of [[Fiqh]] from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]], India). He belonged to the family of [[Gardēzī Sadaat]].

==Biography==
Qazi Syed Hayatullah was a scholar of [[Fiqh]], an expert in [[sharia]] laws, from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]]). He was also a good orator and stayed at [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] for a long time, where he gained both name and fame in teaching Fiqh. At Sakras, he built a rich library after collecting large number of books. He also built his own beautiful [[Haveli]] at [[Mohallah]] Sayidwadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|publication-place = ʻAlīgaṛh |author = Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman| pages = 43–47 (Qazi Syed Hayatullah) | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3006896M/Ḥayāt-i_Karam_Ḥusain |title = Ḥayāt-i Karam Ḥusain |publication-date = 1983, revised second edition 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His ancestors Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut ibn Mir Imaduddin ibn Syed Shamsuddin) came to India during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]] (1211–1235).

Like his father [[Qazi Syed Inayatullah]], his wife also belonged to [[Pinangwan]]. He had one daughter, who was married to Mohammad Ammad of [[Pinangwan]], and two sons: Syed Mohammad Zaman and Syed Mohammad Mureed.

Syed Mohammad Zaman was affirmed [[Qazi]] after his father.
{{main|Qazi Syed Mohammad Zaman}}

Syed Mohammad Mureed had a horse business. He was not only a good horse rider but also an expert in [[Archery]]. He, most of the times, stayed in [[Ujjain]] and hence after death also buried near Ujjain at Dargah Shah Mahmood, Ghalla Mandi along with his father-in-law Mohammad Ikram and brother-in-law Abu Ishaq. Syed Mohammad Mureed with his wife Noorun Nisan had one son Mohammad Muneer and three daughters, Bibi Sahiba, Jamiatun Nisan and Sahibun Nisan. Bibi Sahiba was married to Mohammad Aziz ibn Mohammad Azim (husband of Bibi Khadija daughter of Mohammad Asadullah), while Jamiatun Nisan and Sahibun Nisan were married to Abu Turab (son of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza) and Mohammad Munawwar (son of Mohammad Adil) respectively. Jamiatun Nisan had one daughter Jamal Daulat and two sons Mian Mohammad Yar and Mohammad Hasan. Mohammad Hasan along with Ghulam Qutubuddin, was killed in a battle with [[Ahirs]] on 26 August 1797 at [[Rewari]]. In the same battle, another relative to Mohammad Hasan, Syed Hisamuddin with his colleague Ahmad Beg Khan was also killed by [[Ahirs]] and their graves are located besides the wall of Masjid located inside the fort. The son of Mohammad Hasan, Ghulam Saroor was a prominent physician who died in [[Mecca]], after performing [[Hajj]] on 11 [[Moharram]] 1294 AH. Mian Mohammad Yar (born 1176 AH / 1762 AD) was quite a religious person and was married to Wajihun Nisan (daughter of Shah Abul Ghais). The son of Mohammad Yar Mohammad Ali was married to Sahibun Nisan (daughter of Shah Mohammad Shoeb).

Mohammad Muneer was married to the daughter of Syed Aminuddin ibn Syed Nasiruddin and had one daughter Fahamun Nisan, who was married to Mohammad Rasheed (died 10 [[Rabi' al-awwal]] 1203 AH/1788 AD). Fahamun Nisan had two sons – Aulad Ali and Murad Ali. Both had good business of horses. The daughter of Murad Ali, Fahimun Nisan was married on 12 [[Shawwal]] 1246 AH / 1830 AD with Aminuddin ibn Fasihuddin. While returning from [[Hajj]] in 1852, Aminuddin died as a result of a [[storm surge]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

A '''tamga''' or '''tamgha''' "stamp, seal" ({{lang-mn|тамга}}, {{lang-otk|𐱃𐰢𐰍}} ''tamga''; {{lang-tr|damga}}; [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish:]] طمغا ) is an abstract [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] or [[Seal (emblem)|stamp]] used by [[Eurasian nomad]]ic peoples and by cultures influenced by them. The tamga was normally the emblem of a particular tribe, clan or family.
They were common among the Eurasian nomads throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages (including [[Alans]], [[Mongols]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Turkic peoples]]).

Similar "tamga-like" symbols were sometimes adopted by sedentary peoples adjacent to the Pontic-Caspian steppe both in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker. ''Heraldik''. Orbis, 2002; Brook 154; Franklin and Shepard 120-121; Pritsak 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists prize tamgas as a first-rate source for the study of present and extinct cultures.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Medieval tamgas==
===Mongol empire===
[[File:Member of Mongolian Association of Numismatics.png|thumb|Logo with the [[Xiongnu]] tamga; these five symbols were later used as the tamgas of [[Genghis Khan]] and his sons.]]
[[File:Kaidu's tamga.png|thumb|Tamgha of [[Kaidu]], [[House of Ögedei]].]]

Since the time when the ancients, including the [[Mongol]] nations have developed into relative groups, origins, and ethnic groups, the symbol and belief of a clan have emerged, and a custom to distinguish their origins and relatives have been established. Consequently, when labor distributions within clans began to develop and people started to manage an economy, various tamgas, drawings, notes and earmarks have been used as an identification sign for labor instruments and utilities as well as in domestication of animals. Every time the clan branched off due to internal clashes, the number of derivative tamghas gradually developed into personal, family, lineage, khans, and state tamghas. Those new tamghas were created through adding new markings on the original tamgha, in order to conserve the tradition. In the Mongol Empire a Tamgha was a seal placed on taxed items, and by extension, a tax on commerce.(and see Eastern Europe below) &lt;ref&gt;Christian, History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, page 415&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tamga" or "tamag" literally means a stamp or seal in the [[Mongolian language]]. Tamgas are also [[Livestock branding|stamped using hot irons]] on domesticated animals such as horses in present-day [[Mongolia]] and others to identify that the livestock belongs to a certain family while they graze during the day on their own. In this regard, each family has their own tamga markings for easier identification. Tamga marking in that case is not very elaborate and is just a curved iron differentiating from other families' tamgas. The [[President of Mongolia]] also passes the ''tamag'' "state seal" when he or she transitions the position to the new president. In the presidential case, the tamag or seal is a little more elaborate and is contained in a wooden box.

===Turkic peoples===
[[Image:Flag of the Crimean Tatar people.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Crimean Tatars]], sporting the traditional tamğa.]]

The Turks who remained pastoral nomad kings in eastern Anatolia and Iran however, continued to use their clan tamgas, and in fact they became high-strung nationalistic imagery.  The [[Ak Koyunlu]] and [[Kara Koyunlu]], like many other royal dynasties in Eurasia, put their tamga on their flags and stamped their coinage with it.

For those Turks who never left their homeland of [[Turkestan]] in the first place it remained and still is what it was originally,  a cattle brand and clan identifier.

Among modern [[Turkic peoples]], the tamga is a design identifying [[property]] or [[cattle]] belonging to a specific Turkic clan, usually as a [[livestock branding|cattle brand]] or [[seal (emblem)|stamp]].

When Turkish clans took over more [[Urban area|urban]] or [[rural area]]s, tamgas dropped out of use as [[pastoral]] ways of life became forgotten.  This is most evident in the Turkish clans who took over western and eastern [[Anatolia]] following the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The Turks who took over western Anatolia founded the [[Sultanate of Rûm]] and became Roman-style aristocrats. Most of them adopted the (at the time) Muslim symbol of the [[Seal of Solomon]] after the Sultanate disintegrated into a mass of feuding [[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]] states (see [[Isfendiyarids]], [[Karamanids]]). Only the Ottoman ghazi state (later to become the [[Ottoman Empire]]) kept its [[Ottoman flag|tamga]], and this was highly stylized, so much so that the bow was stylized down eventually to a crescent moon.

In Russia, the term ''tamga'' (''тамга'') survived in state institution of border customs, with associated cluster of terms: ''tamozhnya'' (''таможня'', customs), ''tamozhennik'' (''таможенник'', customs officer), ''rastamozhit''' (''растаможить'', pay customs duties), derived from the use of tamga as a certificate of state.

[[Columns of Gediminas]], an early coat of arms of Lithuania, may be a tamga.

==Islamic empires==
[[File:Taj Mahal top of finial.jpg|thumb|Tamga of the [[Mughal Empire]] on top of the [[Taj Mahal]].]]

In the late medieval  [[Turco-Mongol]] states, the term ''tamga'' was used for any kind of official stamp or seal. This usage persisted in the early modern Islamic Empires ([[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mughal Empire]]), and in some of their modern successor states.

In the [[Urdu]] language (which absorbed Turkic vocabulary), ''Tamgha'' is used as [[medal]]. [[Tamgha-i-Jurat]] is the fourth highest Military medal of [[Pakistan]]. It is admissible to all ranks for gallantry and distinguished services in combat. [[Tamgha-i-Imtiaz]] or Tamgha-e-Imtiaz ({{lang-ur|تمغہ امتیاز}}), which translates as "medal of excellence", is fourth highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. [[Tamgha-i-Khidmat]] or Tamgha-e-Khidmat ({{lang-ur|تمغۂ خدمت}}), which translates as "medal of services", is seventh highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. It is admissible to non-commissioned officers and other ranks for long meritorious or distinguished services of a non-operational nature.
 
In [[Egypt]], the term ''damgha'' ({{lang-ar|دمغة}}) or ''tamgha'' ({{lang|ar|تمغة}}) is still used in two contexts. One is a tax or fee when dealing with the government. It is normally in the form of stamps that have to be purchased and affixed to government forms, such as a driver license or a registration deed for a contract. The term is derived from the Ottoman [[damga resmi]]. Another is a stamp put on every piece of jewelry made from gold or silver to indicate it is genuine, and not made of baser metals.

[[File:Colossus and Other Poems.jpg|thumb|First edition, 1960]]
'''''The Colossus and Other Poems''''' is a poetry collection by American poet [[Sylvia Plath]], first published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], in 1960. It is the only volume of poetry by Plath that was published before her death in 1963.

==Contents==
The 44 poems presented here are in the published order.&lt;ref&gt;Plath, Sylvia (1987) ''The Colossus'' Faber and Faber {{ISBN|0-571-09864-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!---Please do not add to or change the poems on this list. This is the full, referenced contents of the book.---&gt;The list below contains the poems published in the US version of the collection, which omits several poems from the original UK edition, including most of the seven sections of "Poem for a Birthday", only two of which ("Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond" and "The Stones") are included in the US edition. The title ''The Colossus'' comes from "Kolossus" a character who appeared in the [[ouija board]] games of Plath and Ted Hughes directing her to write poems on certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Plath 1438148445   2013   (Journals, 409) In early July, they brought out their ouija board and spoke with their spirit, Pan, whose god is "Kolossus"; Pan told her to write about the Lorelei. 6 As a result, Plath wrote apoem, "Lorelei," which explored her Germanic roots. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erica Wagner - Ariel's Gift: Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, and the Story of Birthday ... 2002   0393292673
... she would be told that Prince Otto could not speak to her directly, because he was under orders from the Colossus. And when she pressed for an audience with the Colossus, they would say he was inaccessible. It is easy to see how her effort to come to terms with the meaning this Colossus held for her, in her poetry, became more and more central as the years passed.” Plath wrote to her mother in 1958 that “Pan claims his family god, 'Kolossus,' tells him much of this information.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Prominent journalist, poet and literary critic for ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, [[Al Alvarez]], called the posthumous re-release of the book, after the success of ''[[Ariel (book)|Ariel]]'', a "major literary event" and wrote of Plath's work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"She steers clear of feminine charm, deliciousness, gentility, supersensitivity and the act of being a poetess. She simply writes good poetry. And she does so with a seriousness that demands only that she be judged equally seriously... There is an admirable no-nonsense air about this; the language is bare but vivid and precise, with a concentration that implies a good deal of disturbance with proportionately little fuss."&lt;ref&gt;Plath, Sylvia. ''The Colossus and Other Poems'', [[Faber and Faber]], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Seamus Heaney]] said of ''The Colossus'': "On every page, a poet is serving notice that she has earned her credentials and knows her trade." &lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Seamus. "The Indefatigable Hoof-taps: Sylvia Plath." ''The Government of the Tongue.'' NY: Faber, 1988, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bnei Hazir tomb PA180072.JPG|right|thumb|208px|Detail of the surviving half of the loggia]]
[[File:Tombe Du St. Jacquesch De ... -309 LACMA M.2008.40.265.jpg|thumb|1870 photo by [[Felix Bonfils]] showing the Tomb of Benei Hezir to the left of the [[Tomb of Zechariah]].]]
The '''Tomb of Benei Hezir''' ({{lang-he|קבר בני חזיר}}) is the oldest of four [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|monumental rock-cut tombs]] that stand in the [[Kidron Valley]], [[Jerusalem]] and dates to the period of the [[Second Temple]]. It is a complex of burial caves. The tomb was originally accessed from a single rock-cut stairwell which descends to the tomb from the north. At a later period an additional entrance was created by quarrying a tunnel from the courtyard of the monument known as "the [[Tomb of Zechariah]]". This is also the contemporary entrance to the burial complex.

==Architecture==
The facade of the tomb is a classical [[distyle in antis]] with two pillars between two pilasters above which there is undecorated architrave containing an engraved a Hebrew inscription.  Above the [[architrave]] is a Doric frieze and a cornice. The tomb's architectural style is influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Greece|ancient Greek architecture]] only (two pillars with [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]), without [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|ancient Egyptian architectural]] influences.

==History==
The tomb dates to the second century BCE, the Hellenistic period and the time of the [[Hasmonean]] monarchy in [[Jewish history]]. Architecturally the so-called Tomb of Zechariah postdates the complex, and the Tomb of Absalom is considered to have been erected even later. The tomb is effectively a burial cave dug into the cliff. It contains a Hebrew inscription, which makes it clear that this was the burial site of a [[Kohen|priestly]] family called Benei Hezir, lit. "sons [descendants] of Hezir". The inscription reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;זה הקבר והנפש שלאלעזר חניה יועזר יהודה שמעון יוחנן בני יוסף בן עובד יוסף ואלעזר בני חניה כהנים מבני חזיר &amp;mdash; This is the grave and the ''Nefesh'' (burial monument) of Eliezer Hania Yoazar Yehuda Shimon Yochanan Benei (sons of) Yosef Ben (son of) Oved Yosef and Elazar Benei (sons of) Hania, Kohanim of the Hezir family.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Name==
The name Hezir appears twice in the Bible (see below). The inscription on the monument mentions the "sons of Hezir", meaning: the descendants of Hezir. The Hebrew term is ''bnei Hezir'', usually written in English as Benei Hazir. The common misspelling ''Hazir'' is clearly wrong, since that means ''pig'' in Hebrew.

In the 19th century Westerners still identified the monument with the tomb of [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]] the Apostle.

==Benei Hezir family==
The tomb's inscription reveals that the cave was used by several generations of the Benei Hezir family.  As well, it indicates that this was a wealthy family, able to afford a burial cave in the Kidron Valley.  In the [[Hebrew Bible]] there are two mentions of men with the name of Hezir. One was the founder of the 17th [[Priestly divisions|priestly division]] ({{Bibleref2|1 Chron. 24:15}}); the other one was among the leaders who set their seal to the covenant with [[Nehemiah]] ({{Bibleref2|Neh. 10:20}}). It is not known if there is a relation between the family buried here and the biblical Hezirs.

==Nefesh==
The inscription mentions a ''nefesh'' (נפש : literally meaning ''soul''), which is also a designation for a magnificent structure built on or alongside the tomb. It has been proposed that the Tomb of Zechariah, a solid rock-hewn object which stands by the entrance, and is thought to date from a similar period to the inscription,&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hachlili, ''Jewish funerary customs, practices and rites in the Second Temple period'' (2005), page 30&lt;/ref&gt; is actually this ''nefesh''.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Rocca, ''Herod's Judaea'', (2008), page 365&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is that the additional facade to the north of the Doric ''dystilos-in-antis'' was the original ''nefesh''. Although it did not survive it is possible to reconstruct the upper part of the above-mentioned facade as a Nabatean tower with a decorative door and window, similar monuments can be seen in [[Petra]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27345">The Pontifical and Royal [[University of Santo Tomas]] celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2011. The agenda before the  quadricentennial in 2011 included the introduction of new academic programs, improvements in the university's infrastructure, and other projects to raise UST’s national and international prominence and promote its role as a social catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/supplement/rectors_supplement/memos_to_the_quadricentennial_rector|title=Memos to the Quadricentennial Rector |website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans to open satellite campuses in [[Santa Rosa, Laguna]] and [[General Santos City]] are being put in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/europe_firm_may_finance_general_santos_campus|title=Europe firm may finance General Santos campus - The Varsitarian|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical developments for the Sampaloc campus are ongoing. The Plaza Mayor in front the [[Main Building (University of Santo Tomas)|Main Building]], the Quadricentennial Square which will feature the Tetraglobal sculpture, the Quadricentennial Fountain, and the Quadricentennial Alumni Walkway were constructed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/special_reports/synchronized_constructions_in_ust|title=Synchronized constructions in UST - The Varsitarian|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the needs of extra space for the growing number of student activities, the UST Tan Yan Kee Student Center was built in front of the [[University of Santo Tomas Miguel de Benavides Library|Miguel de Benavides Library]]. The more than 80-year-old Main Building, and the artifacts and art works in the [[UST Museum of Arts and Sciences]], were placed under the preservation of the UST Heritage Conservation program in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/circle/preserving_heritage_on_a_high_note|title=Preserving heritage on a high note - The Varsitarian|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UST Benavides Cancer Institute, part of the five-year redevelopment plan and expansion of the [[University of Santo Tomas Hospital|UST Hospital]] for its 60-year celebration and the quadricentennial celebration, was established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usthospital.com.ph/bci/bci.php|title=USTH - Benavides Cancer Institute|website=Usthospital.com.ph|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the university's infrastructure modernization is the construction of an P800-million, four-storey gymnasium capable of seating 5,792, designed by Thomasian architects José Pedro Recio and Carmelo T. Casas. University officials, led by Rector Rolando V. de la Rosa, O.P., led its groundbreaking ceremonies in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?Itemid=104&amp;id=639&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|title=University of Santo Tomas|website=www.ust.edu.ph|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Santo Tomas Publishing House|UST Publishing House]] in 2001 launched its quadricentennial project, “400 Books at 400!”, publishing books in a range of disciplines, from theology to literature to medicine, written in both Filipino and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/news/university/409-ust-publishing-house-launches-book-titles-for-2007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927182341/http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/news/university/409-ust-publishing-house-launches-book-titles-for-2007.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Quadricentennial Commission ==
A Quadricentennial Commission was created to formulate preparations for the celebration of the UST Quadricentennial Jubilee. The commission is chaired by the UST rector, Rev. Fr.

== Symbolization ==
[[File:UST Quadricentennial Logo ALT.png|thumbnail|200px|right|The Tongues of Fire, the official Quadricentennial logo]]

=== Logo ===
The Tongues of Fire is the official logo for the quadricentennial celebration. It features the outline of the UST Main Building Tower as a concrete symbol of the stability, integrity and 400 years of existence of the university. From the cross of the Main Building emanate four tongues of fire that spell out U, S, and T. The tongues of fire reference the future of the university and some ideals, and are reminiscent of the stripes of the Tiger, the school's mascot. The quadricentennial logo was designed by Dopy Doplon, a Thomasian.&lt;ref name="QLogo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=439&amp;Itemid=104|title=University of Santo Tomas|website=Ust.edu.ph|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song ===
"Ako'y Isang Tomasino", composed by UST [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]] alumnus Gerry de Leon, is the official theme song of the celebration. It bested four other finalists in the Q Songwriting Contest Grand Finals held the previous December at the Albertus Magnus Auditorium. It was performed by Sam Velarde, a friend of de Leon, from other university. The song was launched during the “400 days to 400 years Countdown” on December 18 at the UST football field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.net.ph/metro/20091215met5.html] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prayer ===
The quadricentennial prayer was unveiled to the public during the “400 days to 400 years Countdown” on Dec. 18. It was recited by Fr. Pompeyo de Mesa, O.P. with a candle-lighting ceremony.&lt;ref name="Paskuhan2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20091219/paskuhan_draws_crowd_of_50000|title=Paskuhan draws crowd of 50,000 |website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flag ===
The quadricentennial flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper one gold and the lower one white. These are defined as [[school colors]] of the university because of its [[Pontifical university|Pontifical]] status. Embroidered with "2011", the flag features the sun and the colors yellow and blue, taken from the logo of the University.&lt;ref name="Paskuhan2009"/&gt;

=== Countdown Clock ===
The countdown clock, which is a Swatch Beatman, is produced by Swiss watch company [[Swatch]]. It is designed by former [[The Varsitarian|Varsitarian]] art director Jonathan Gamalinda.&lt;ref name="Paskuhan2009"/&gt;

=== Mascot ===
The mascot is named "QUSTER", which stands for '''Q'''uadricentennial '''U'''niversity of '''S'''anto '''T'''omas Tig'''er'''.

== Infrastructure ==
[[Image:UST Fountain.jpg|right|thumb|250px|UST Quadricentennial Fountain]]

=== University Marker ===
A one-foot-by-three-feet marble marker in Plaza Intramuros near the main vehicular entrance of the campus was unveiled on February 4, 2010. It was designed by architect John Joseph T. Fernandez, Dean of the [[University of Santo Tomas College of Architecture|College of Architecture]], and architect Froilan M. Fontecha, faculty member of the same college. It bears the name of the university, its seal on the left, and the year 1611 on the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20100218/alumni_center_ust_marker_simbahayan_launched|title=Alumni Center, UST marker, ‘Simbahayan’ launched - The Varsitarian|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quadricentennial Square===
Replacing the old Colayco Park and its adjacent UST Cooperative Center, the Quadricentennial Square was built as a memorial of the University's four centuries of existence. It has two main features: the Quadricentennial Fountain and the Quattromondial. It is located between the Main Building and the Miguel de Benavides Library.

The Colayco Shrine, an iron statue commemorating the World War 2 victim Capt. Manuel Colayco, was nowhere to be found since its removal from the site in 2006.

==== Fountain ====
This recreational and interactive fountain was unveiled in 2007. It was designed and built by Industron Inc., the same designer of [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] and Liwasang Bonifacio fountains in Manila.&lt;ref name="Unraveling UST fountain spectacle"&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2017}} [http://www.varsitarian.net/sci_tech/unraveling_ust_fountain_spectacle]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain has sun-like floor patterns to pay tribute to the University’s patron saint, Thomas Aquinas. Its four cornerstones highlight UST milestones during its first four centuries.&lt;ref name="Unraveling UST fountain spectacle"/&gt;

According to UST Facilities Management Office administrator Antonio Espejo, the fountain uses recycled water treated with chlorine. It runs three times a day (6AM to 8AM, 11AM to 1PM, and 5PM to 8PM).&lt;ref name="Unraveling UST fountain spectacle"/&gt;

There is a superstition that to counter the effect of passing through the Arch of the Centuries while studying in the University, a student must take a shower in the fountain, as this will cleanse him and prevent the happening of an event that will bar the student from graduating.

==== Quattromondial ====
This artwork was unveiled for the Quadricentennial celebrations on January 27, 2011.&lt;ref name="Archt Orlina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/2011/744-archt-orlina-signs-accord-to-build-tetraglobal-sculpture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002120517/http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/2011/744-archt-orlina-signs-accord-to-build-tetraglobal-sculpture.html |archivedate=2010-10-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; This is a ten-meter-high structure of bronze and glass, made by artist Ramon Orlina, a UST alumnus.&lt;ref name="Countdown to 2011 begins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20091216/countdown_to_2011_begins|title=Countdown to 2011 begins|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The monument features four figures, which, according to Orlina, represent the school's four centuries:

*The young Filipino student represents excellence, and was modeled by actor Piolo Pascual.
*The young Filipina student represents tradition, and was modeled by Orlina's daughter Monina.
*The Thomasian teacher represents erudition, and was modeled by beauty queen Charlene Gonzales.
*The Dominican monk-scholar represents spirituality, and was modeled by Fr. Rolando V. dela Rosa, O.P.&lt;ref name="Quattromondial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110123-316039/Quattromondial-UST-embraces-birthright-destiny |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022219/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110123-316039/Quattromondial-UST-embraces-birthright-destiny |archivedate=2011-01-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the four near-naked figures, whose genitals are covered by a long strip of ribbon, rests a globe; and like the earth, it tilts 23.5 degrees. The globe represents globalization, with all its benefits and hindrances, such as environmental degradation and cultural divisions. The ribbon streams out of the globe, printed with an inscription in Latin signifying accomplishment, scholarliness and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Quattromondial" /&gt; It reads: 
{{cquote|''Pontificia et Regalis Universitas Sancti Thomae Aquantis Manilana MDCXI. Contemplari et Contemplata aliis Tradere. In Veritate fideles. In Labore proficientes. In Caritate divites.''}}

===UST Gymnasium and Sports Complex===
{{main|Quadricentennial Pavilion}}

Replacing the original UST Gymnasium and the old Engineering Sports Complex, the construction of the 800-million-peso UST Sports Complex began after the Vatican gave its "blessing" to the project.&lt;ref name="Vatican OKs sports complex"/&gt; It was to be inaugurated on August 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20110121/ust_set_to_open_quadricentennial_week|title=UST set to open Quadricentennial Week|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially named the Quadricentennial Pavilion, the sports complex was designed by Thomasian architects Jose Pedro Recio and Carmelo Rosas. It stands on what used to be the Engineering Sports Complex, basketball courts, and the adjacent football field. It houses training areas for gymnastics, aerobics, taekwondo, judo, table tennis, fencing, and badminton at its ground floor. It features a ticket counter, a museum, a dance hall for the [[Salinggawi Dance Troupe]], and a fitness room. Its main attraction is a basketball court surrounded by bleachers rising up to the fourth level.&lt;ref name="Vatican OKs sports complex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20090715/vatican_oks_sports_complex|title=Vatican OKs sports complex|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomasian Alumni Center ===
{{main|Thomasian Alumni Center}}
To be built on the site of the original UST Gymnasium, the alumni center will be used as a venue for alumni gatherings, various university events, and lodging services for visitors. It is according to the pursuit of the university's Office for Alumni Relations to build a center to cater to the growing number of UST Alumni. The existing Olympic-sized swimming pool located nearby would be kept and refurbished.&lt;ref name="Four-story alumni center soon to rise"/&gt; It was projected to be completed and opened in 2012.&lt;ref name="UST set to open Quadricentennial Week"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20110121/ust_set_to_open_quadricentennial_week|title=UST set to open Quadricentennial Week |website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its design was chosen from seven winners in a competition among students organized by the College of Architecture. Abelardo Tolentino Jr., an outstanding Thomasian alumni for Architecture, worked on the design to produce the final blueprint.&lt;ref name="Four-story alumni center soon to rise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20090715/four_story_alumni_center_soon_to_rise|title=Four-story alumni center soon to rise|first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US-based Thomasian medical practitioners raised and donated USD 1 million to assist the construction of the alumni center.&lt;ref name="UST set to open Quadricentennial Week" /&gt;

=== UST Hospital extension building ===
The blessing of the construction site of the UST Hospital's extension building was held on 23 January 2012, the first day of the closing week of the quadricentennial celebrations. Once constructed, the services in the USTH Medical Arts building will be transferred there. The medical arts building will then be demolished to give way to another construction of a new medical arts facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20120123/neo_centennial_celebration_opens |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126134344/http://www.varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20120123/neo_centennial_celebration_opens |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== University sites as National Cultural Treasures ===
Four structures within the university's campus were declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum. The declaration was made on 25 January 2010. These sites were: 
*The Main Building (the first earthquake-resistant building in the Philippines)
*Arch of the Centuries (the remnant of UST's original building from Intramuros)
*Central Seminary (the home of the oldest college of Ecclesiastical studies in the Philippines)
*The Grandstand and Parade Grounds (the venue where a mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II was held)

The Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act describes "National Cultural Treasures" as unique objects found in the Philippines that possess outstanding historical, cultural, artistic, and/or scientific value. These are considered as significant and important to the Philippines.&lt;ref name="NationalTreasures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20100127/ust_sites_declared_national_treasure|title=UST sites declared ‘National Treasures’ |first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another National Cultural Treasure was recently awarded to the University these are the [[UST Baybayin Documents]] which created in the years 1613 (Ducment a) and in 1625 (Document B).

The Quadricentennial countdown to 2011 coincided with UST's Christmas tradition, Paskuhan, held on December 18, 2009. The theme was called as such because the party lasted for 4 hours on December 18, which was 4 days before December 22, which was 400 days before January 28, 2011, which was the grand opening of UST's Quadricentennial celebrations.&lt;ref name="UST to launch 400-day countdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/print/179634|title=UST to launch 400-day countdown for Quadricentennial on Friday|website=Gmanews.tv|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official launch of the countdown was intended to be held on December 22, but the university was expected to be already on its Christmas vacation during that day.

January 28 is the feast day of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the patron saint of the university, after which it was named. UST was founded on April 28, 1611.

The Paskuhan festivities and the Quadricentennial countdown were hosted by UST alumni - beauty queen [[Miriam Quiambao]] and TV personality [[Kim Atienza]].

=== Simbahayan 400 ===
"Tomasino para sa Simbahan at Bayan" (Thomasians for the Church and the Country) is a socio-civic activity that began on January 2010.&lt;ref name="Countdown to 2011 begins"/&gt; The Quadricentennial's "centerpiece project", according to the Rector Rev. Fr. Rolando De La Rosa, O.P., aims for UST to adopt some 400 villages with the help of non-governmental organization [[Gawad Kalinga]].&lt;ref name="Countdown to 2011 begins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="400 days to 400 years"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20091217-242596/400-days-to-400-years |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222051800/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20091217-242596/400-days-to-400-years |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomasian Global Trade Expo ===
This three-day event was led by Thomasian tycoons such as Jollibee Foods Corp. president Tony Caktiong, and Mercury Drug president Vivian Que-Ascona in July 2010.

It was a three-day exposition of businesses owned and managed by Thomasian students or alumni. It was held at SMX Convention Center in the [[Mall of Asia]] Complex in Pasay City. Begun on October 15, 2010, the expo featured a job fair; shopping bazaars; wellness festival; arts, design, and construction booths; celebrity shows; food and beverage stalls; entrepreneur workshops; and advocacy seminars.&lt;ref name="Thomasian Expo set at SMX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/cebu-news/621098/fsupt-comar-back-bfp-7|title=F/Supt.

The expo was a joint project of UST Alumni Association, UST Office for Alumni Affairs, and the UST Thomasian Alumni Leaders Association.

Some of the proceeds of this event funded the building of the Thomasian Alumni Center.&lt;ref name="Thomasian Expo set at SMX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomasian Global Expo set" /&gt;

=== Lumina Pandit ===
UST's rare book collections and historic documents were shown to the public through an exhibition in Miguel de Benavides Library.&lt;ref name="Countdown to 2011 begins"/&gt; ''Lumina Pandit'' is Latin for "spreading the light." The exhibit showcased ''Doctrina Christiana'', the first book published in the Philippines,&lt;ref name="400 days to 400 years"/&gt; a rare copy of Copernicus' book, and academic records of UST alumni, such as those of national heroes [[José Rizal]] and [[Apolinario Mabini]],&lt;ref name="Countdown to 2011 begins"/&gt; four Philippine presidents, and six Supreme Court chief justices.&lt;ref name="400 days to 400 years"/&gt;

== Quadricentennial Week ==
The Quadricentennial celebrations began with the Opening of the Jubilee Door and a Mass held on January 24, 2011.

=== Q Parade ===
The Q Parade, held simultaneously with the Icusta opening, was joined by 7,200 students and 150 registered alumni.

The parade passed from UST to Morayta and then Recto and Mendiola. There were five floats, one each representing the four centuries of the University, and the "Q" float.

The first float represented the first century of the university with a replica of the statue of the founder, Msgr. Miguel de Benavides, O.P. The second float showed a model of the Arch of the Centuries. The third float was designed after the Main Building which was built on the España campus in the 1920s. The fourth float was patterned after the UST Central Seminary with the Fountains of Wisdom and Knowledge. The Q float showcased models of the yet to be unveiled Quattromondial, the future Martyrs' Monument, and the Tria Haec, or the statues representing faith, hope, and love atop the Main Building.

The first four floats carried candidates for the Ideal Thomasian Personalities (TSITP) while the Q float carried reigning Thomasian personalities, Ms. Earth - Eco Tourism 2009 Angela Fernando, businessman Joel Cruz, and alumni who have won beauty pageant titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20110126/officials_of_foreign_universities_attend_three_day_meet_ust_mounts_q_parade|title=Officials of foreign universities attend three-day meet; UST mounts ‘Q’ parade - The Varsitarian|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This annual competition was held on January 26, 2011. The university also invited other schools' dance companies to compete with each other featuring different Philippine festivals.

Cheermania was won by College of Commerce Cheering Squad. The Philippine Festival's Invitational Competition was won by FEU Dance Company, organized by the UST Student Organizations Coordinating Council (UST SOCC).

== International recognition ==
=== Holy See's recognition ===
UST being a pontifical university, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was invited, and sent a special envoy, though he did not attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/190941/pope-not-coming-to-rp-for-ust-quadricentennial-anniversary|title=Pope not coming to RP for UST quadricentennial anniversary|website=Gmanews.tv|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope declared a Jubilee year from January 2011 until January 2012, coinciding with the university's quadricentennial. The pope arranged to deliver a recorded video on January 28, feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, and a thanksgiving mass was to be held.&lt;ref name="Vatican declares Jubilee Year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20110126/vatican_declares_jubilee_year|title=Vatican declares Jubilee Year |first=Tomas U.|last=Santos|website=Varsitarian.net|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[Apostolic Penitentiary]] allowed in a decree Archbishop Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales to bestow a [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|papal blessing]] carrying a [[plenary indulgence]] in the Jubilee Mass held on January 24, 2011.&lt;ref name="Vatican declares Jubilee Year" /&gt;

Upon the request of Rector Magnificus Fr. Rolando dela Rosa, O.P., a separate decree also granted plenary indulgences to participants.

'''Visual focus depth art''' ('''VFDA''') is a form of [[mixed media]] [[collage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mixed-media|title=mixed-media|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that places an emphasis on the use of three-dimensional application to individual creations of single one-of-a-kind art pieces to emphasize individual meaning in the work. It is a derivative of ''[[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) "Assemblage Art". ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed. Retrieved February 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''collage''&lt;ref&gt;Collage, essay by Clement Greenberg, July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[decollage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See D-De, ArtLex Art Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is similar to the basic mixed-media collage idea of building up various levels of the piece for emphasis. Known in this medium as '''''projections''''', the artist tries in a variety of ways to create a visual image that causes the viewer to focus on certain areas of the art framework that would ordinarily be overlooked or relegated to the background rather than to randomly layer structure creating a whole image of the work.

==Origins==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}While the exact origins of VFDA are unknown, the first artwork of its nature began to appear around 2010 in the street art of various cities in Europe, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]]. This appears to have been a response to the expanding use of computer generation in art to both design and create mixed-media collage works that could be essentially pre-designed and mass-produced. Since that time, various artists have produced series of works-known as '''''ensembles'''''—that are individually unique and limited in scope. Common themes of these ensembles range widely from ideological ideas like bohemianism, libertine and socially relevant matters to historical perspective, such as the interpretation of various time periods and eras.

==Structure of the design==
The floor/design base of the piece is used to create a theme or story about the subject.  Sections of the work are then raised to provide emphasis and act as an accent to substantiate the message. VFDA is usually created in single pieces or via limited series depending upon the artist involved and is also generally confined to canvass or wooden framework. Larger scale pieces, such as architectural interpretations, are generally not considered part of this medium. Each VFDA piece is unique is not duplicated in any way with the exception of limited prints. While some artists offer limited prints of the original artwork, the number offered is very limited in scope.

[[File:Femme Fatales VFDA.JPG|thumb|Femme Fatales VFDA]]

==Background variations==
The backgrounds used in VFDA range widely from the use of true vintage pieces such as original period sheet music, fractional currency, foreign money or other items that set the time frame for the piece.  Each of the items used relate the overall, theme of the art. The background can also be structured in segmented form-through the use of '''linear script'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linear|title=Linear - Definition of linear by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—composed of simply drawn lines with little attempt at pictorial representation, '''mathematic symbolism'''—such as the use of angles and formulas and via '''free-form application'''—concepts chosen by the artist to represent the underlying theme in the work.

[[File:Athena VFDA.JPG|thumb|Athena VFDA]]

VFDA is based on the unique aspect of every piece being created by the artist. Materials used to emphasize the projections include wooden palates measured to the frame, various forms of corkboard, balsa wood and other materials that are hand-cut or machined by the artist to help raise the projections to the level desired. The use of preformed shapes, three-dimensional printing and advanced computer generation of any kind&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick Bloom, Susan (2006). ''Digital Collage and Painting: Using Photoshop and Painter to Create Fine Art''. Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-80705-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used to map the work or create the projections is not considered to be part of this art form because the work can be saved, duplicated and even mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Manovich (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Boat to Gaza''' ('''WBG''') was an initiative by the [[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] in 2016 to challenge the [[Israel]]i [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)|naval blockade]] of the [[Gaza Strip]]. The WBG consisted of an entirely female crew and one ship, ''Zaytouna-Oliva''. It started from [[Barcelona]] on 14 September 2016 and visited [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]] and [[Messina]], [[Sicily]] along the way.&lt;ref name="WBG FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://wbg.freedomflotilla.org/faq |website=Women's Boat to Gaza |publisher=[[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2016, the [[Israeli Navy]] intercepted the Women's Boat to Gaza and detained its crew members, who were taken to the Israeli port of [[Ashdod]]. The activists were subsequently deported to their home countries.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 5 Oct 16"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanchez |first1=Raf |title=Israeli navy intercepts all-female flotilla protesting against Gaza blockade |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/05/israeli-navy-intercepts-all-female-flotilla-protesting-against-g/ |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No violence as Israel intercepts women’s boat to Gaza |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-navy-intercepts-gaza-bound-womens-boat/?fb_comment_id=1228552607218144_1228603150546423 |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Times of Israel]]'' |date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Booth |first1=William |last2=Eglash |first2=Ruth |title=Israel sends female naval cadets to stop women's boat headed to Gaza |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-sends-female-naval-cadets-to-stop-womens-boat-headed-to-gaza/2016/10/05/740aecfe-8b13-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506_story.html |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Legal Cases"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaza Freedom Flotillas-Ships, Passengers &amp; Lawsuits Against the Israeli government |url=https://legalcasesagainstisraelattacksoncivilianboatstogaza.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/31-boats-challenge-israeli-naval-blockade-of-gaza/ |website=Legal Cases Against Israeli Attacks on Civilian Boats to Break the Illegal Israeli Blockade of Gaza |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and objectives==
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition launched the Women's Boat to Gaza to raise awareness of the role of women in advancing the Palestinian struggle in the Palestinian Territories and diaspora. The Women's Boat to Gaza also supported the goals of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign: 

# Ending its [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation]] and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|Wall]];
# Recognizing the fundamental rights of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel]] to full equality; and
# Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of [[Palestinian refugees]] to [[Palestinian right of return|return to their homes and properties]] as stipulated in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN Resolution 194]].&lt;ref name="WBG FAQ" /&gt;

==Participants==
The Women's Boat to Gaza had a total of 26 participants. The voyage was divided into three legs: Barcelona to Ajaccio, Ajaccio to Messina, and Messina to Gaza. Each leg was crewed by thirteen volunteers with several members alternating at different legs of the voyage.&lt;ref name="Barcelona to Ajaccio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Participants on Board: Barcelona to Ajaccio |url=https://wbg.freedomflotilla.org/passengers-barcelona-to-ajaccio |website=Women's Boat to Gaza |publisher=[[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ajaccio to Messina"&gt;{{cite web |title=Participants on Board: Ajaccio to Messina |url=https://wbg.freedomflotilla.org/participants |website=Women's Boat to Gaza |publisher=[[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messina to Gaza"&gt;{{cite web |title=Participants on Board: Messina to Gaza |url=https://wbg.freedomflotilla.org/participants-on-board-messina-to-gaza |website=Women's Boat to Gaza |publisher=[[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]]|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Legal Cases" /&gt;

'''Yaxha''' (or '''Yaxhá''' in Spanish orthography) is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]] in the northeast of the [[Petén Basin]] region, and a former ceremonial centre and city of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. Yaxha was the third largest city in the region and experienced its maximum power during the Early Classic period (c. AD 250–600).

The city was located on a ridge overlooking Lake Yaxha. The name of the city derives from the Mayan for "blue-green water"; it is a notable survival of a Classic period place-name into the modern day. The Yaxha kingdom is estimated to have covered an area of {{convert|237|km2|sqmi}} and to have had a peak population of 42,000 in the Late Classic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaxha had a long history of occupation with the first settlement being founded sometime in the Middle Preclassic period (c. 1000–350 BC). It developed into the largest city in the eastern Petén lakes region during the Late Preclassic (c. 350 BC – AD 250) and expanded into an enormous city during the Early Classic (c. AD 250–600). At this time, in common with other sites in Petén, it shows strong influence from the distant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. It was eclipsed during the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) by neighbouring [[Naranjo]] but was never completely dominated. The city survived well into the Terminal Classic (c. 800–900) but was abandoned by the Postclassic period (c. 900–1525).

The ruins of the city were first reported by [[Teoberto Maler]] who visited them in 1904. The site was mapped in the 1930s and again in the 1970s and stabilisation work began in the late 1980s. The ruins include the remains of more than 500 structures with a number of major archaeological groups linked by [[sacbe|causeways]]. Approximately 40 [[Maya stelae]] have been discovered at the site, about half of which feature sculpture.

==Etymology==
The name Yaxha derives from the [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] ''yaxa''', which means "blue-green water".&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p146"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Yaxha is notable for the survival of its [[toponym]] from the  Classic period, when it was a thriving city.&lt;ref name="Rice04p145"&gt;Rice 2004, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]] first proposed that the [[emblem glyph]] of the site should be read ''Yax-ha'' and that the name of the city (and the lake) is of ancient origin.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p146"/&gt;

==Location==
Located in the modern-day department of [[Petén (department)|Petén]], northern [[Guatemala]], it is approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} southeast of [[Tikal]];&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p375"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Yaxha is situated on the north shore of [[Laguna Yaxhá|Lake Yaxha]];&lt;ref name="Rice04p145"/&gt; the ruins extend roughly {{convert|3|km|mi}} along a hilltop parallel to the lake shore.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p110"&gt;Hermes et al 1999, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins fall within the borders of the [[Cultural Triangle Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park|Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park]],&lt;ref name="Hermes2010p510"&gt;Hermes 2010, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; which encompasses an area of {{convert|37160|ha|sqmi}} and incorporates the remains of four ancient Maya cities: Yaxha, [[Topoxte]], [[Nakum]] and [[Naranjo]], as well as 10 intermediate sites and more than 280 smaller settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Aquino and Cardona Caravantes 2009, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yaxhatemplo216.jpg|thumb|right|Temple 216 in the East Acropolis at Yaxha]]

===Preclassic===
Yaxha was already significant in the Late Preclassic (c. 350 BC – AD 250), and was a large site as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 1000–350 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, pp. 3, 52, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological investigations indicate that the earliest, Middle Preclassic, settlement was in what developed into the southern and western sectors of the city. In the Late Preclassic the city became the largest settlement in the Yaxha-Sacnab basin, with a marked increase in population and in construction activity.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p111"&gt;Hermes et al 1999, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Classic===
The city reached the height of its power during the Early Classic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]] (c. AD 250–600), during which period the city expanded enormously.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p72"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's Early Classic monuments are poorly preserved, meaning that the history of its period of maximum power is poorly understood.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p375"/&gt; The influence of the distant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]] is evident in Early Classic imagery following Teotihuacan's decisive intervention at Tikal in AD 378.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, pp. 123-125. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Early Classic, seismic activity caused movement of the Yaxha Fault, resulting in damage to buildings in the East Acropolis. The same earthquake appears to have caused damage across the city and at neighbouring [[Nakum]].&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1012-1013"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, pp. 1012-1013.&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake may have resulted in the temporary abandonment of the East Acropolis.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period the city established itself as an important centre on the [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] that crossed the Petén lakes region.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt;

===Late Classic===
In the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) the city developed with major construction projects taking place across the city centre,&lt;ref name="Hermes99p115"&gt;Hermes et al 1999, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; especially during the 8th century; the twin pyramid complex is an example of one of the major construction projects undertaken at this time.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; At this time the city became an important trading centre to the southeast of the great city of Tikal.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p136"&gt;Hermes et al 1999, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Classic the city fought several wars against the neighbouring city of [[Naranjo]], which had eclipsed Yaxha in power but was never able to complete dominate it.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p72"/&gt; In 710, king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak]] of Naranjo sacked Yaxha, captured its king and [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]] him.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter 8th century, king K'ak' Ukalaw Chan Chaak of Naranjo took a Yaxha princess as his wife; Lady Shell Star provided the king with his heir.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This heir was unable to maintain peace between the cities and Itzamnaaj K'awiil of Naranjo went to war against Yaxha and its allies in AD 799, launching assaults against his mother's city in July and September of that year, some months after defeating a number of Yaxha's satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to capture K'inich Lakamtuun, Yaxha's king.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p383"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminal Classic===
[[Image:Guatemala-Peten-around-Flores.png|left|400px|thumb|Map of the eastern Petén lakes region]]
There is no evidence of the rapid collapse of the Yaxha polity in the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) as took place at other cities in the vicinity. Instead there is evidence of renewed and widespread construction activity. It is apparent that the local elite made every effort to prolong the city's Late Classic political system. Some entry controls to the city were removed in order to encourage the flow of visitors to Yaxha from surrounding areas that were more immediately affected by the [[Classic Maya collapse]].&lt;ref name="Hermes99p136"/&gt;

===Postclassic===
During the Postclassic (c. 900–1525) there is some evidence of activity at the site associated with the inhabited islands of Lake Yaxha but these were not in any way associated with occupation of the city itself, rather consisting of pieces of ceramic and food refuse left at the city by the islanders.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p124"/&gt;

===Modern history===
[[Teoberto Maler]] first reported Yaxha's existence after visiting the ruins in 1904. The [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]] mapped the ruins in the 1930s and the site was again mapped in the early 1970s, at which time test excavations were undertaken.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p375"/&gt; The Proyecto Nacional Tikal ("National Tikal Project") carried out a survey of architectural damage at Yaxha in 1987 and in 1988 the first work was undertaken in order to stabilise some of the structures.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p110"/&gt; Archaeological excavations have continued into the 21st century;&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1010"/&gt; The South Acropolis was excavated from 2005 through to 2007.&lt;ref name="Hermes2010p510"&gt;Hermes 2010, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 21st century excavations of Yaxha formed a part of the Peten Sustainable Development Programme (''Programa de Desarrollo Sostenible de Petén'') funded by the Banco Interamericano de Desarollo ([[Inter-American Development Bank]]).&lt;ref name="Hermes10p513"&gt;Hermes 2010, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
Yaxha is the third largest ruin in Guatemala, with only Tikal and [[El Mirador]] being larger.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p72"/&gt; The centre of the city consisted of a number of plazas and architectural groups, with outlying groups and the lake shore linked by [[Sacbe|causeways]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p375"/&gt; The main architectural groups are the Maler Group to the north, linked to the central area by the Blom Causeway; the South (or Main) Acropolis, the West Group, the Northeast Acropolis, the East Acropolis and a number of plazas and lesser groups make up the site core. The city was linked to the shore of Lake Yaxha by the Lake Causeway. Plaza A is a [[twin pyramid complex]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermes et al 1999, pp. 110, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Ten main communication routes have been identified in the city, with the four principal routes having been classified as causeways by archaeologists, with the remainder classed as "vias".&lt;ref name="Hermes99p110"/&gt; Yaxha was more densely occupied than most other Maya cities.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has more than 500 structures,&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt; including about 40 [[stela]]e,&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt; 13 Altars, 9 temple pyramids, 2 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]]s, and a network of ''[[sacbe]]ob'' (causeways) that connect the central, northern (Maler), and eastern 'acropoleis', and the Lake causeway that was the main entrance in the past. The top of Temple 216 (restored) provides a view of the two lakes on one side and the jungle and the [[Mesoamerican pyramid|stepped-pyramids]] on the other.

Yaxha possesses one of very few [[twin pyramid complex]]es outside of Tikal; the fact that the site holds a twin-pyramid complex provides a visible insight into the political alliances that eventually influenced the architectural style of the city at its peak,&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p72"/&gt; although it appears that the complex at Yaxha was unfinished.&lt;ref name="Rice04p145"/&gt;

===Architectural groups===
{{Maya civilization}}
'''Plaza A''' is a twin pyramid complex to the north of the East Acropolis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, pp. 1010-1011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built during the 8th century AD.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt;

'''Plaza B''' is on the west side of the East Acropolis.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p115"/&gt;

'''Plaza C''' is an E-Group astronomical complex to the southeast of the site core,&lt;ref&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1010. Kelly 1996, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; linked to the city centre by the Lincloln Causeway. Three Early Classic stelae were erected on the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt;

'''Plaza D''' is in the site core, at the northwest end of the Lincoln Causeway and immediately north of the South Acropolis. It is bordered to the north by the Northeast Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plaza E''' is situated in the site core, on the north side of the South Acropolis and linked to it via a stairway rising from the plaza.&lt;ref name="Hermes10p512"&gt;Hermes 2010, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calzada de los Peregrinos.jpg|thumb|right|Calzada de los Peregrinos]]
[[File:Ruins on the Plaza B (Plaza de las Columnas).jpg|thumb|right|Ruins on the Plaza B (Plaza de las Columnas)]]
[[File:Acropolis Norte.jpg|thumb|right|Acropolis Norte (Plaza E)]]

The '''East Acropolis''' is on the east side of the city centre, to the south of the Twin Pyramid Complex.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p115"/&gt; It occupies the highest area of the city and is surrounded by Plazas A, B and C. The area that was to become occupied by the East Acropolis was first levelled from the limestone bedrock in the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the Preclassic the East Acropolis was laid out as a [[triadic pyramid]] complex but was radically modified during the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1016"/&gt; In its final form the East Acropolis formed a closed complex with twelve structures covering a total area of {{convert|8100|m2|sqft}}. The main buildings of the East Acropolis were Structure 216, a pyramid-temple, and Structure 218, a palace.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1010"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1010.&lt;/ref&gt; The East Acropolis plaza featured a west-facing monumental stairway built in the Late Preclassic and remodelled in the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1012-1013"/&gt; The first version of the temple was built in the Late Preclassic, while the earliest version of the palace dates to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, pp. 1011-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The East Acropolis appears to have been temporarily abandoned at the end of the Early Classic due to destruction caused by an earthquake,&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; but was reoccupied and developed during the course of the Late Classic. During the Terminal Classic (9th century AD) great quanitites of ash and domestic ceramics were deposited in the East Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, pp. 1013-1015.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time a small platform was built against Structure 219, which blocked access to the southwestern terrace of the complex.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1015"/&gt;

The '''Northeast Acropolis''' dates back to the Late Preclassic and incorporates an arrangement that includes a [[triadic pyramid]] forming a part of an [[E-Group]] astronomical complex.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South Acropolis''', sometimes referred to as the '''Main Acropolis''', was built upon a high [[karst]]ic hill. It had a long history, with construction starting at the end of the Middle Preclassic period and continuing through to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes 2010, pp. 510-511.&lt;/ref&gt; The acropolis is a complex consisting of six patio groups upon an artificial platform and includes a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]] (Ballcourt 1).&lt;ref name="Hermes2010p510"/&gt; The patios are separated by corbel-vaulted structures that were probably elite residences; the exception is Structure 363, which is a temple between Patio 5 and Patio 6.&lt;ref name="Hermes10p511"/&gt; The South Acropolis is located in the southern portion of the site core near the junction of various causeways and vias. The acropolis is bordered on the north side by the ballcourt and plazas D and E. It is bordered on the western side by Via 5 and on the southern side by Via 6. In its final form during the Terminal Classic the basal platform formed an irregular rectangle measuring {{convert|200|m|ft}} east-west by {{convert|100|to|120|m|ft}} north-south. The platform had stepped levels and rounded corners;&lt;ref name="Hermes2010p510"/&gt; the principal access appears to have been a stairway on the west half of the north side, which linked Plaza E with Patios 5 and 6 of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Hermes10p511"&gt;Hermes 2010, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations of the acropolis took place in 1996 and 2006; excavators found evidence of earlier archaeological investigation that had not been recorded and suggested professional investigation in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes 2010, pp. 512-513.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maler Group''' is located to the north of the site core, linked to it by the Blom Causeway.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p115"/&gt;

===Structures===
'''Structure 216''' is a large pyramid on the east side of Plaza A upon the East Acropolis. The remains of the temple shrine still stand upon the pyramidal base and the total height of the structure is over {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=flip}}, making it the tallest structure at Yaxha.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"/&gt; The earliest structure on the site was the plaza platform raised in the Late Preclassic, which consisted of a five-stepped platform with ''talud'' walls and an inset {{convert|17.5|m|ft|adj=on}} wide west-facing monumental stairway, consisting of 32 steps, each with a {{convert|0.45|m|ft}} tread and a {{convert|0.35|m|ft}} riser. This Late Preclassic phase stood about {{convert|11|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In the Early Classic a new version of the structure was built (Structure 216 sub 1). It was a stepped platform, like its predecessor, although the stairway of the new version projected westwards, possibly flanked by ballustrades. The maximum height of this construction phase was {{Convert|22.75|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1012"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century AD a new version of Structure 216 was built, rising to a height of {{convert|23.25|m|ft}}. The pyramid base had eight stepped levels with rounded corners and featured a projecting stairway. The summit shrine had three doorways and two inner chambers. Stela 41 was raised at the base of the stairway.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; An offering was found in the fill under the first chamber of the temple that consisted of seven [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|eccentrics]], five of them crafted from [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and two from flint, and a piece of [[nacre|mother of pearl]].&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1015"/&gt;

'''Structure 217''' is a palace-type structure at the north end of Structure 218 in the East Acropolis. The first phase of construction dates to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1012"/&gt; In the 8th century the structure was redesigned. It stood upon a basal platform with slightly inclined walls. The structure had two vaulted chambers and was accessed via an east-facing stairway.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; In the 9th century the base of the structure was dressed with masonry.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1015"/&gt;

'''Structure 218''' is a palace-type structure in the East Acropolis.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1010"/&gt; The earliest version of the building dates to the Early Classic period (Structure 218 sub 1A) and had a long room with a [[Corbel arch#Maya civilization|corbel-vaulted]] roof. The structure had multiple east-facing doorways, possibly five, and two narrow doorways in the centre of the western facade. Traces of red pigment survive on the cornice. The location and characteristic of this Early Classic phase lead archaeologists to believe that it was built slightly after the Early Classic phase of Structure 216 (sub 1). The building was remodelled a number of times in the Early Classic. Stage 1B consisted in the division of the room into three chambers, the addition of a bench inside the north chamber and the addition of small zoomorphic masks to the sunken panels of the cornice. Phase 1C consisted of the addition of a small platform to the western facade. The Early Classic substructure has suffered subsidence at the southern end due to movement of a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]].&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1012"/&gt; Stage 2A dates to the Late Classic, during the 8th century AD. The western facade became the main facade, the height of the corbel vaulting was reduced and the previous structure was filled. Structure 218 Sub 2A measured {{Convert|36.5|m|ft}} long and was raised upon a {{convert|1.85|m|ft}} high platform. Like the earlier version, it had a long room with a vaulted ceiling; the walls were {{convert|1|m|ft}} thick and the interior vaulting was {{convert|2.6|m|ft}} high. The building featured decorated cornices. The total heigh of the building as measured from the plaza floor may have been over {{convert|6.5|m|ft}}. The rear, east, side of Stage 2A consisted of three plain, stepped levels. Two benches were built against the corners, possibly to disguise the subsidence that occurred as a result of the earlier earthquake.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; An offering was deposited underneath the central chamber; it consisted of 9 grey obsidian eccentrics, 14 flint eccentrics, a ''[[spondylus]]'' shell, a small fragment of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|greenstone]] and carbon remains mixed with unidentified vegetable fibres.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1014"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1014.&lt;/ref&gt; The following stage, denominated 2B by archaeologists, also dates to the 8th century and consisted of the unification of Structure 218 with the neighbouring structures 217 and 219, creating a new facade with nine doorways.&lt;ref&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, pp. 1013-1014.&lt;/ref&gt; Three vaulted chambers were added to the east facade, with spacing between them; the north and south chambers (A and B) were built over the earlier benches. The central chamber (Chamber C) had flanking stairways. The ''talud'' wall between chambers A and C had the remains of a giant mask but the upper sectiuon of the wall was demolished by the Terminal Classic occupants of the city. The remains of painted murals were discovered in the interior of the central chamber of the palace, using red, blue, black and yellow pigments. The murals were badly damaged but apparently depicted human figures performing actions near a palace and a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]]. A high status Late Classic burial (Burial YX-08) was also found in Structure 218, buried in a [[cist]] in front of the main entrance.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1014"/&gt; Four individuals were interred to the south of this principal burial during the Terminal Classic. They were not buried in cists and were unaccompanied by offerings. The bones belonged to individuals of varying ages and gender. At this time, during the 9th century AD, a three-chambered building with a perishable roof was built upon the upper platform of the structure; the chambers were linked by doorways. The only access to the building was via a narrow, sunken stairway built directly over the earthquake fissure. In its final form Structure 218 stood {{convert|38|m|ft}} high, with four stepped platforms supporting the superstructure. The final remodelling of the building resulted in the blocking of the top of the stairway with a wall.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1015"/&gt;

'''Structure 219''' is another palace-type structure at the south end of Structure 218 in the East Acropolis. The first phase of construction dates to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1012"/&gt; In the 8th century Structure 219 was rebuilt in a very similar manner to Structure 217, with two vaulted chambers upon a basal platform and an east-facing stairway.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; During the 9th century, in the Terminal Classic, the base of the structure was dressed with masonry and two small platforms were added to the southeastern portion of the building, one against the north side and the other against the southeastern corner.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1015"/&gt;

'''Structure 363''' is a temple located between Patio 5 and Patio 6 of the South Acropolis.&lt;ref name="Hermes10p511"/&gt; A stone monument was placed in front of the west facade of the temple; the placement of such a monument within an acropolis complex is unusual.&lt;ref name="Hermes10p512"/&gt;

===Causeways===
[[File:Laguna Yaxha.jpg|thumb|right|Lake Yaxha viewed from the summit of one of the temples]]
The '''Lake Causeway''' (''Calzada del Lago'' in Spanish) runs north from the lake shore to the city centre, where it continues as '''Via 5'''. The total length of the causeway and the via is around {{convert|400|m|ft}}. The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about {{convert|10|m|ft}} wide and was raised {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes et al 1999, pp. 111, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p115"/&gt; It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p136"/&gt; At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately {{convert|1|m|ft}} high and varied from {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft}} wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than {{convert|50|m|ft}}. There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p115"/&gt; During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure {{convert|32|m|ft}} east-west by {{convert|19|m|ft}} north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished ''[[talud-tablero|talud]]'' walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p124"&gt;Hermes et al 1999, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Blom Causeway''' (''Calzada Blom'' in Spanish) runs north from the city centre to the Maler Group.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p113"&gt;Hermes et al 1999, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galindo Causeway''' (''Calzada Galindo'' in Spanish) runs north-south between the East Acropolis (at the north end) and Plaza C (at the south end).&lt;ref name="Kelly96p115"/&gt;

The '''Lincoln Causeway''' (''Calzada Lincoln'' in Spanish) runs southeast from the city centre to Plaza C.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p115"&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
[[File:Yaxha stela.jpg|thumb|right|Stela 11 at Yaxha,&lt;ref&gt;Groff 2007, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; bearing the Teotihuacan-style image of a warrior with the attributes of Tlaloc, the central Mexican rain god.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, pp. 117-118"&gt;Kelly 1996, pp. 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Approximately 40 [[Maya stelae]] have been recovered at Yaxha, half of which were plain monuments without sculpted faces.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt;

'''Stela A''' is a plain stela that was raised upon the platform at the southern (lake-side) end of the Lake Causeway during the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Hermes99p124"/&gt;

'''Stela 3''' is the northernmost of the three stelae erected on the east side of Plaza C. It dates to the Early Classic period and is stylistically related to the [[Izapa]]n culture of the Pacific coast. It is poorly preserved and only the lower panel survives; it bears a similarity to the equivalent panel on Stela 4.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt;

'''Stela 4''' is the central stela on the east side of Plaza C and is the best preserved of the three Early Classic monuments. It bears the sculpted image of a standing figure with left-facing feet standing upon a grotesque head. Two [[Maya script|hieroglyphs]] are carved to the left of the figure's knees.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt; One of the glyphs preserved on Stela 4 is the Emblem Glyph of Yaxha.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1016"/&gt;

'''Stela 5''' is the southern stela of the three on the east side of Plaza C. It is badly eroded but has been dated to AD 357, making it the earliest dated monument at the city.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p114"/&gt;

'''Stela 8''' is found in the Maler Group. It dates to the Early Classic and is poorly preserved with only the lower portion surviving.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"/&gt;

'''Stela 10''' is situated in the Maler Group. It is badly damaged with only the lower portion surviving. It has been dated to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"/&gt;

'''Stela 11''' is a well preserved Early Classic monument on the east side of Plaza B,&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"/&gt; at the base of Structure 218 in the East Acropolis.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1016"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1016.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the stela is that of Teotihuacan, with the sculpted figure of a warrior with the attributes of Tlaloc, the central Mexican rain deity.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, pp. 117-118"/&gt; The figure bears characteristic eye rings, and a butterfly ornament over the mouth, and wears a feathered headdress. The warrior carries a spear and a shield. The monument is very similar to Stela 32 from Tikal and is associated with the intervention of Teotihuacan in the Petén region during the Early Classic period.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1016"/&gt;

'''Stela 13''' was a sculpted monument but it has been broken into fragments, although much of the sculpture is preserved. The text on the stela includes a date in 793, the latest recorded date at the city. The stela was erected at the base of the West Pyramid of the Twin Pyramid Complex.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"/&gt; Stela 13 bears the image of a king of Yaxha together with a text describing the celebration of an [[equinox]].&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1016"/&gt;

'''Stela 30''' is the northernmost of two stelae found in Plaza E. It is broken in two pieces. It dates to the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"/&gt;

'''Stela 31''' is located in Plaza E. It dates to the Late Classic and depicts an ornate figure with a large headdress. The monument is badly damaged and broken into several pieces.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p117"&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 36''' is a badly eroded monument on the west side of Plaza B.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp. 115, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stela 41''' was raised at the base of the access stairway of Temple 216 in the 8th century AD.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1013"/&gt; The monument is missing its butt, and may not be in its original location; all four sides are sculpted in an Early Classic iconographic style. The front face of the stela has two masks facing to the left and an anthropomorphic figure wearing a bracelet of a type used from the end of the Late Preclassic through to the Early Classic. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the north and south faces of the stela are eroded but include a glyph that could be the Emblem Glyph of Yaxha.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1016"/&gt;

==Burials==
'''Burial YX-08''' was excavated from in front of the main entrance to Structure 218, a palace-type building in the East Acropolis. The remains were deposited in a [[cist]] and possibly belonged to a member of the city's elite. The remains were those of a young adult male in his early twenties, interred lying upon his back with his skull towards the north.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1014"/&gt; The skull was deformed and the upper incisors were artificially modified with jade incrustations.&lt;ref&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, pp. 1014-1015.&lt;/ref&gt; Two pieces of sculpted jade were found near the neck, one of them a square plaque inscribed with an anthropomorphic figure. Both of the jade pieces had traces of red pigment.&lt;ref name="MoralesValiente06p1015"&gt;Morales and Valiente 2006, p. 1015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Yūki-tsumugi'''''|結城紬}} is the [[Japanese handicrafts|Japanese craft]] of [[silk]] cloth practised chiefly in the vicinity of [[Yuki, Ibaraki|Yūki]] in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]. It is designated one of the [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan]] and has also been inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].

==History==
Developing from earlier silk techniques, the name Yūki-tsumugi was adopted in 1602. Weavers were invited from [[Ueda Castle|Ueda]] and the cloth, at first plain, was used as gifts for the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shōgun]].&lt;ref name="Kimono"/&gt;
Currently approximately one hundred and thirty craftsmen transmit the technique in [[Yuki, Ibaraki|Yūki]] and [[Oyama, Tochigi|Oyama]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/download.php?versionID=07350 |title=Yuki-tsumugi Nomination Form |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[Silk]] floss is extracted from [[silkworm]] [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]] and [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] by hand into [[yarn]]. [[Kasuri|Patterns]] are added by [[tie-dyeing]], before [[weaving]] with a [[Loom#Back strap loom|loom]] known as a {{nihongo|jibata|地機}}.&lt;ref name="Kimono"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00406 |title=Yuki-tsumugi, silk fabric production technique |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strap around the weaver's waist enables the tension of the vertical thread to be adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsumugi.co.jp/top.php?date=2009-09-03 |title=About Tsumugi-no-Sato |publisher=Tsumugi-no-Sato |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take up to fifteen days to weave enough plain fabric for an adult garment, and up to forty-five days for patterned fabric.&lt;ref name="Kimono"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimono.or.jp/dic/eng/04Dye-Kanto-1.html |title=Kanto District 1 |publisher=Cultural Foundation for Promoting the National Costume of Japan |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safeguarding==
In 1956 Yūki-tsumugi was designated one of the [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=303&amp;item_id=114 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{nihongo|Association for the Preservation of the Honba Yūki-tsumugi Weaving Technique|本場結城紬技術保持会}} was established in 1976 and helps promote and transmit the craft.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Yūki Daiichi [[Secondary education in Japan|High School]] in [[Yuki, Ibaraki|Yūki]] has a Yūki-tsumugi club.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; In 2010 Yūki-tsumugi was inscribed on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;
