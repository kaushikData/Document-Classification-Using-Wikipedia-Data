      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">The '''AMC Model 20''' is an automotive [[axle]] manufactured by [[American Motors]] and [[AM General]].

== General specifications ==
AMC 20s have an 8 7/8" ring gear and use a 29 spline axle shaft.

The AMC 20 was most often used with [[V8 engine]]s in cars and [[Jeeps]]. It was also used in the AM General [[Humvee]].

== Ratios ==
There were many ratios offered over the lifetime of the AMC 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AMC 1977 Technical Service Manual|year=1977|publisher=American Motors Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Letter codes were stamped on the axle to indicate installed gears. AMC changed or reused letter codes during the axle's long life.
There are other gear ratios available in the aftermarket.

The '''Alliance of Asian Liberal Arts Universities''' (AALAU) is as a [[consortium]] of leading [[liberal arts]] [[universities]] located in countries and regions in Asia. Formed in November 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ln.edu.hk/asian-liberal-arts-conference/welcome.php|title=Asian Liberal Arts Conference Lingnan University|website=www.ln.edu.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; AALAU enable member universities to renew and reinvigorate the liberal arts education traditions and development. Its Alliance Secretariat located in [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]] in [[Hong Kong]].

== Overview ==
Due to the fact that [[university ranking]]s have not been able to present teaching quality for a long time, 15 of universities with similar visions and characteristics have formed the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epaper.edu.tw/windows.aspx?windows_sn=20776|title=教育部電子報_國際排名未能反應教學質量　15校組亞洲博雅大學聯盟|website=epaper.edu.tw|language=zh|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding member universities of AALAU are all well-known universities in their respective countries, their common feature is highly internationalized, high social reputation, and high education quality (high graduate achievement). Some of these members were selected as the "Top 10 Liberal Arts Colleges In Asia" by ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/gkle45i/top-10-liberal-arts-coll/#50a12a2b6742|title=Top 10 Liberal Arts Colleges In Asia|website=www.forbes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The Alliance features 15 founding member universities (marking †).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lingnan-university-organises-conference-to-mark-the-launch-of-the-alliance-of-asian-liberal-arts-universities-300559231.html|title=Lingnan University organises Conference to mark the launch of the Alliance of Asian Liberal Arts|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, AALAU has 19 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.rikkyo.ac.jp/news/2017/dn4ddm0000000stt.html|title=Rikkyo University becomes founding member of alliance of liberal arts universities in Asia|website=english.rikkyo.ac.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BioTapestry was created at the [http://www.systemsbiology.org/ Institute of Systems Biology] in Seattle, in collaboration with the [http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mirsky/index.htm Davidson Lab] at the [http://www.caltech.edu/ California Institute of Technology].  The project was initiated to support the ongoing development of the model of the GRN regulating the development of the endomesoderm in the sea urchin [[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus]]. BioTapestry was initially made public in late 2003 as a web-based, read-only [http://sugp.caltech.edu/endomes/index.html interactive viewer for the sea urchin network], with the first fully functional editor released in August 2004 (v0.94.1).  The current version, 7.0.0, was released in September 2014.

== Development ==
Development work on BioTapestry is ongoing.  For more information about version 7.0, see the [http://www.Biotapestry.org/docs/V7ReleaseNotes.html release notes page].

== Usage ==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Biotapestry network visualization1.png|thumb|450px|GRN visualized by BioTapestry. ]] --&gt;

BioTapestry is an interactive tool for modeling and visualizing gene regulatory networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1312">'''Bulliform cells''' are large, bubble-shaped [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] that occur in groups on the upper surface of the leaves of many monocots.These cells are present on the adaxial or the upper surface of the leaf. They are generally present near the mid vein. These cells are large, empty and colourless.

The mechanism of working of bulliform cells can be explained as:

During [[drought]], the loss of water through [[vacuoles]] induces the reduced bulliform cells to allow the leaves of many grass species to close as the two edges of the grass blade fold up toward each other. Once adequate water is available, these cells enlarge and the leaves are forced open again.

Folded leaves offer less exposure to sunlight, so they are heated less thus reducing evaporation and conserving the remaining water in the plant. Bulliform cells occur on the leaves of a wide variety of monocotyledon families but are probably best known in grasses. They are thought to play a role in the unfolding of developing leaves and in the rolling and unrolling of mature leaves in response to alternating wet and dry periods.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, R. et al.

'''Celeste Suzanne Baranski''' is an American electronic engineer, entrepreneur, and executive who helped create several pioneering electronic devices including early versions of the tablet computer. Baranski, with her colleague [[Alain Rossmann]], won the ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' Award from Discover Magazine in 1993.&lt;ref name="disc_1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VarePtacek2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedrich2011"/&gt;

== Education ==
Baranski attended Stanford University from 1975 to 1980 and obtained Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in electrical engineering.&lt;ref name="BaranskiBio"/&gt;

== Career ==
[[Image:Eo-kindle.jpg|right|thumb|Comparison of the EO 440 Personal Communicator (1993) and the Amazon Kindle 2 e-book reader (2009). Both have reflective displays (no backlight). The EO has liquid crystal display, the Kindle an electrophoretic one.]]
After engineering jobs at [[ROLM]], [[GRiD Systems]], and Tsunami Technologies, Baranski joined [[GO Corp.|GO Corporation]] in 1987 as one of the founders, and served as Vice President of Engineering. In 1990, the hardware division of GO was divested as EO Inc. and she continued there from 1990 to 1994, producing the [[EO Personal Communicator]], an early tablet computer.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2014"/&gt; The device did not enjoy commercial success so after the collapse of Go/EO, she worked from 1994 to 2006 on mobile devices at Norand Corporation, [[Hewlett Packard]],  Set Engineering, [[Handspring (company)|Handspring]], and [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]].&lt;ref name="BaranskiBio"/&gt;

After taking a sabbatical she founded Vitamin D Video, a machine vision company, in 2007 and served as its Chief Executive Officer until 2010. The company licensed artificial intelligence algorithms from [[Numenta]], a company founded by [[Jeff Hawkins]] whom she met at Handspring/Palm.&lt;ref name="Gulker2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fried2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rivlin2007"/&gt; It was acquired by Sighthound in 2013.&lt;ref name="Sighthound2013"/&gt;

From 2010 to 2014 she was Senior Vice President, Engineering, at [[Panasas]], a data storage company.

In 2014 she joined Hawkins' machine intelligence company, Numenta, as Vice President of Engineering.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt;

Retrieved December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As a specialty for medical doctors, Clinical Physiology is a diagnostic specialty to which patients are referred to undergo specialized tests of functions of the [[heart]], [[blood vessels]], [[lungs]], [[kidneys]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]], and other organs. Testing methods include evaluation of electrical activity (e.g. [[electrocardiogram]] of the heart), [[blood pressure]] (e.g. [[ankle brachial pressure index]]), and air flow (e.g. [[pulmonary function testing]] using [[spirometry]]). In addition, Clinical Physiologists measure movements, [[velocities]], and [[metabolism|metabolic processes]] through imaging techniques such as [[ultrasound]], [[echocardiography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[x-ray computed tomography]] (CT), and [[nuclear medicine]] scanners (e.g. [[single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) with and without CT).

== Role ==
[[Human physiology]] is the study of bodily functions. Clinical physiology examinations typically involve assessment of such functions as opposed to assessment of structures and [[anatomy]]. The specialty encompasses the development of new physiological tests for medical diagnostics, while some Clinical Physiology departments perform tests from related medical specialties including [[nuclear medicine]], [[clinical neurophysiology]], and [[radiology]]. In the health care systems of countries that lack this specialty, the tests performed in clinical physiology are often performed by the various organ-specific specialties in [[internal medicine]], such as [[cardiology]], [[pulmonology]], [[nephrology]], and others.

In Australia and the United Kingdom, clinical physiology is not a medical specialty for physicians. Rather, clinical physiologist is a term used in these systems to refer to an allied health professional, scientist, or technologist who may work as a cardiac scientist, vascular scientist, respiratory scientist, sleep scientist or in Ophthalmic and Vision Science as an Ophthalmic Science Practitioner (UK).&lt;ref name=clinicalphysiology /&gt; These professionals also aid in the diagnosis of disease and manage patients, with an emphasis on understanding physiological and pathophysiological pathways.&lt;ref name=clinicalphysiology /&gt; Disciplines within clinical physiology field include [[Audiology|audiologists]], cardiac physiologists, gastro-intestinal physiologists, [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologists]], [[respiratory physiologist]]s, and sleep physiologists.

== History ==
Clinical physiology was first established in 1954 by the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] with the intention of ensuring "contact between routine clinical work and the scientific progression."  Clinical physiology was originally its own [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]], however, between 2008-2015, clinical physiology was categorized as a sub-discipline to [[radiology]]. For this reason, those pursuing a career in clinical physiology had to first become registered and certified [[radiologists]] before becoming clinical physiologists. Since 2015, it is once again possible to train to be a clinical physiologist, with clinical physiology being its own [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] independent of [[radiology]].

The cougar is an [[ambush predator]] that pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources are [[ungulate]]s, particularly [[deer]]. It also hunts species as small as insects and [[rodents]]. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and survives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the [[apex predator]] in its range, yielding to the jaguar, [[gray wolf]], [[American black bear]], and [[grizzly bear]]. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. [[List of fatal cougar attacks in North America by decade|Fatal attacks on humans]] are rare, but have recently been increasing in North America as more people enter cougar territories.&lt;ref name="Med"/&gt;

Intensive hunting following [[European colonization of the Americas]] and the ongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the [[North American cougar]] was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for the isolated [[Florida panther]] subpopulation. Transient males have been verified in Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/134835873.html Shot fells elusive cougar chased out of a culvert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203022643/http://www.startribune.com/local/134835873.html |date=December 3, 2011 }}.

==Naming and etymology==
With its vast range across the length of the Americas, ''P. concolor'' has dozens of names and various references in the [[mythology]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]] and in contemporary culture. Currently, it is referred to as "puma" by most scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mountain Lion (Puma, Cougar) |publisher=San Diego Zoo |url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/mountain-lion-puma-cougar |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214221407/http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/mountain-lion-puma-cougar |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the populations in 21 of the 23 countries in the Americas.&lt;ref name=EOL&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Life |chapter-url=http://eol.org/pages/311910/names/common_names |chapter=''Puma concolor'' |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228043650/http://eol.org/pages/311910/names/common_names |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Puma" is the common name in Spanish or Portuguese-speaking countries but the cat has many local or regional names in the United States and Canada, of which cougar, puma, and mountain lion are popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Martinez Guerrero | first1 = J.

"Cougar" is borrowed from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''çuçuarana'', via [[French language|French]]; the term was originally derived from the [[Tupi language]]. A current form in Brazil is ''suçuarana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jaguar | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | date=2001 | publisher = [[Douglas Harper]] | accessdate = August 12, 2006}}&lt;br /&gt;* [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=c&amp;p=27 Cougar]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, German naturalist [[Georg Marcgrave]] named the cat the ''cuguacu ara''.

The first English record of "puma" was in 1777, where it had come from the Spanish, who in turn borrowed it from the Peruvian [[Quechua language]] in the 16th century, where it means "powerful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Puma |publisher=Projeto Puma |url=http://uniplac.net/~puma/puma.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706131806/http://uniplac.net/~puma/puma.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[File:Puma face.jpg|thumb|Although large, the cougar is more closely related to smaller [[felidae|felines]] than to other [[big cat]]s]]
Cougars are the largest of the small cats. They are placed in the subfamily Felinae, although their physical characteristics are similar to those of the big cats in the subfamily Pantherinae.&lt;ref name=MSW3/&gt; The [[family (biology)|family]] [[Felidae]] is believed to have originated in Asia about 11 million years ago. Taxonomic research on felids remains partial, and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=DNA Offers New Insight Concerning Cat Evolution |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/science/06cats.html |work=The New York Times |date=January 6, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112044647/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/06/science/06cats.html |archivedate=November 12, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as cats are poorly represented in the [[fossil record]],&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"/&gt; and significant [[confidence intervals]] exist with suggested dates. In the latest [[genomic]] study of the Felidae, the common ancestor of today's ''[[Leopardus]]'', ''[[Lynx]]'', ''[[Puma (genus)|Puma]]'', ''[[Prionailurus]]'', and ''[[Felis]]'' lineages migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] into the Americas 8.0 to 8.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago (Mya). The lineages subsequently diverged in that order.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson, W.E.|author2= Eizirik, E.|author3= Pecon-Slattery, J.|author4= Murphy, W.J.|author5= Antunes, A.|author6= Teeling, E. |author7= O'Brien, S.J. |date=January 6, 2006 |title=The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=73–77 |doi=10.1126/science.1122277 |pmid=16400146|bibcode= 2006Sci...311...73J}}&lt;/ref&gt; North American felids then invaded South America 2–4{{nbsp}}Mya as part of the [[Great American Interchange]], following formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]].&lt;ref name="Culver"/&gt;

[[Linnaeus]] placed the cougar in ''Felis'' (''Felis concolor''), the genus which includes the [[cat|domestic cat]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; The cougar is now placed in ''Puma'', and is most closely related to the [[jaguarundi]], as well as the modern [[cheetah]] of Africa and western Asia,&lt;ref name="Johnson2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culver"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Culver, M. |author2=Johnson, W.E. |author3=Pecon-Slattery, J. |author4=O'Brien, S.J.  |year=2000 |title=Genomic Ancestry of the American Puma |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=186–97 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/91.3.186 |pmid=10833043}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the relationship is unresolved. The cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the ''Puma'' lineage in the Americas (see [[American cheetah]]) and migrated back to Asia and Africa,&lt;ref name="Johnson2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culver" /&gt; while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the [[Old World]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ross |last=Barnett |author2=Barnes, Ian |author3=Phillips, Matthew J. |author4=Martin, Larry D. |author5=Harington, C.

A high level of genetic similarity has been found among North American cougar populations, suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver ''et al.'' propose the original North American population of ''P.{{nbsp}}concolor'' was [[local extinction|extirpated]] during the [[Pleistocene extinctions]] some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals, such as ''[[Smilodon]]'', also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by a group of [[South American cougar]]s.&lt;ref name="Culver" /&gt;

The jaguarundi, which is known as the cougar's closest relative, was formerly placed within the same genus, [[Puma (genus)|Puma]]. It is now most often placed in the genus [[Herpailurus]].&lt;ref name="Catsg2017"/&gt;

===Subspecies===
Until the late 1980s, as many as 32 [[subspecies]] were recorded; [[Genetics|genetic]] study of mitochondrial DNA&lt;ref name="Culver" /&gt; found many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level. Following the research, the canonical ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' (3rd{{nbsp}}ed.) recognized six subspecies, five of which were solely found in Latin America:&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id = 14000204|pages=544–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the locality, cougars can be smaller or bigger than jaguars, but are less muscular and not as powerfully built. Whereas cougars tend to be larger as distance increases from the equator,&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt; which crosses South America, jaguars north of the Amazon River in South America tend to be smaller.

The cougar is on average larger than all felid species apart from the [[lion]], tiger, and jaguar.

Cougar coloring is plain (hence the [[Latin]] ''concolor'') but can vary greatly across individuals and even siblings. The coat is typically tawny like that of the lion, which is why it was initially called the "mountain lion",&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt; but it otherwise ranges from silvery-grey or reddish with lighter patches on the underbody, including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails;&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt; juveniles are pale and dark spots remain on their flanks.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt; Despite anecdotes to the contrary, all-black coloring ([[melanism]]) has never been documented in cougars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn, Eddie|url=http://www.tahlequahdailypress.com/black-mountain-lion-more-rumor-than-fact/article_db970b99-4383-5306-a277-10beadd92364.html |title=Black cougar more talk than fact |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 15, 2016 |publisher=Tahlequah Daily Press |quote=[[Game Warden]]: Never in the history of the United States has there ever been, in captivity or in the wild, a documented black mountain lion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[black panther]]" is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species, particularly jaguars and leopards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/mutant-pumas.html|title=Mutant Pumas|work=messybeast.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185155/http://messybeast.com/genetics/mutant-pumas.html|archivedate=October 11, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology and behavior==

===Hunting and diet===
A successful [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] [[predator]], the cougar will eat any animal it can catch, from insects to large [[ungulate]]s (over {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}). Like other cats, it is an [[obligate carnivore]], meaning it must feed on meat to survive. The mean weight of vertebrate prey (MWVP) that pumas attack increases with the puma's body weight; in general, MWVP is lower in areas closer to the [[equator]].&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt; Its most important prey species are various deer species, particularly in North America; [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[elk]], and even bull [[moose]] are taken. Other species such as the [[bighorn sheep|bighorn]] and [[Dall's sheep]], [[horse]], [[fallow deer]], [[caribou]], [[mountain goat]], [[coyote]] and [[pronghorn]].&lt;ref name="SW"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3672527 |title=Influence of predation by mountain lions on numbers and survivorship of a feral horse population |jstor=3672527 |first=John W. |last=Turner |first2=Michael L. |last2=Morrison |year=2008 |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=183–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer.

In [[Pacific Rim National Park Reserve]], [[Feces#Animal feces|scat]] samples showed [[raccoon]]s to make up 28% of the cougar's diet, [[harbor seal]]s and [[blacktail deer]] 24% each, [[North American river otter]]s 10%, [[California sea lion]] 7%, and [[American mink]] 4%; the remaining 3% were unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.petethomasoutdoors.com/2012/02/british-columbia-cougars-found-to-prey-on-seals-sea-lions.html|title= British Columbia cougars found to prey on seals, sea lions|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= February 23, 2012|website= |publisher= |access-date= August 5, 2016|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160803202215/http://www.petethomasoutdoors.com/2012/02/british-columbia-cougars-found-to-prey-on-seals-sea-lions.html|archivedate= August 3, 2016|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-sized mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the [[capybara]]. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, about half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar in South America has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items.&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt; However, a study by Gutiérrez-González and López-González showed that the cougar and jaguar in Central or North America may share the same prey, depending on its abundance.&lt;ref name="GGLG2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gutiérrez-González |first1=Carmina E. |last2=López-González |first2=Carlos A. |title=Jaguar interactions with pumas and prey at the northern edge of jaguars' range |journal=PeerJ |volume=5 |pages=e2886 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/2886/ |date=2017-01-18 |access-date=2018-05-31|doi=10.7717/peerj.2886 |pmid=28133569 |pmc=5248577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other listed prey species of the cougar include mice, [[porcupine]]s, [[American beaver|beaver]]s, raccoons, [[hare]]s, [[guanaco]], [[peccary]], [[vicuna]], [[rhea (bird)|rhea]], and [[wild turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, John O.

Chanticleer Press, New York, 1980, pg. 598. {{ISBN|0-394-50762-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America.&lt;ref name="diet"/&gt;

Although capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an [[ambush predator]]. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground.&lt;ref name="WhosWho"/&gt;

Kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around 15 months.&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt; The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. The cougar is generally reported to not be a [[scavenger]], but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bauer |first=Jim W. |author2=Logan, Kenneth A. |author3=Sweanor, Linda L. |author4=Boyce, Walter M. |date=December 2005 |editor1-last=Jones |editor1-first=Cheri A. |title=Scavenging behavior in Puma |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=466–471 |doi= 10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050[0466:SBIP]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only females are involved in parenting. Litter size is between one and six cubs; typically two. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first, and begin to be weaned at around three months of age.

Young adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territories at around two years of age and sometimes earlier; males tend to leave sooner. One study has shown high [[mortality rate|mortality]] amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars ([[intraspecific competition]]).&lt;ref name="Utah"/&gt; Research in [[New Mexico]] has shown that "males dispersed significantly farther than females, were more likely to traverse large expanses of non-cougar habitat, and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches."&lt;ref name="Dispersal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sweanor |first=Linda |author2=Logan, Kenneth A. |author3=Hornocker, Maurice G. |year=2000 |title=Cougar Dispersal Patterns, Metapopulation Dynamics, and Conservation |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=798–808 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social structure and home range===
Like almost all cats, the cougar is a mostly solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting rarely. While generally loners, cougars will reciprocally share kills with one another and seem to organize themselves into small communities defined by the territories of dominant males.

Ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other. Scrape marks, [[urine]], and [[feces]] are used to mark territory and attract mates. Males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then [[territorial marking|urinate on it as a way of marking territory]].&lt;ref name="Sierra"/&gt;

Home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance.&lt;ref name="Utah"/&gt; One female adjacent to the [[San Andres Mountains]] was found with a large range of 215&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (83&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), necessitated by poor prey abundance.&lt;ref name="Dispersal"/&gt; Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as much as 7 (in one study in South America) per 100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (38&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt;

Because males disperse farther than females and compete more directly for mates and territory, they are more likely to be involved in conflict. Where a juvenile fails to leave his maternal range, for example, he may be killed by his father.&lt;ref name="Dordt"/&gt; When males encounter each other, they hiss, spit, and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down.&lt;ref name="UWSP"/&gt; Hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounters by disrupting territories and bringing young, transient animals into conflict with established individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinapu.org/PDF/Front%20Range%20lion%20study.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616200443/http://www.sinapu.org/PDF/Front%20Range%20lion%20study.pdf |archivedate=June 16, 2007 |format=PDF |title=Mountain Lion (''Puma concolor'') study on Boulder Open Space |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |date=March 22, 2007 |work=Letter to the Parks and Open Space Advisory Committee, Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Sinapu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

===Distribution and habitat===
[[File:Puma concolor camera trap Arizona 2.jpg|thumb|A [[camera trap]] image of a cougar in [[Saguaro National Park]], [[Arizona]]]]
The cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the Americas. Its range spans 110 degrees of [[latitude]], from northern [[Yukon]] in Canada to the southern [[Andes]]. Its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type; it is found in all forest types, as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts. The cougar prefers habitats that include precipitous canyons, escarpments, rim rocks, and dense brush,&lt;ref name="Sierra" /&gt; but can also live in open areas with little vegetation.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

The cougar was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] across nearly all of its eastern North American range (with the exception of Florida) in the two centuries after [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], and faced grave threats elsewhere. It currently ranges across most western American states, the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[British Columbia]], and the Canadian territory of [[Yukon]]. There have been widely debated reports of possible recolonization of eastern North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0305/0305_selections.html |title=Bookshelf |last=Marschall |first=Laurence A. |date=March 2005 |work=Natural Selections |publisher=[[Natural History Magazine]] |accessdate=May 6, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174138/http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/master.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalhistorymag.com%2F0305%2F0305_selections.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA]] evidence has suggested its presence in eastern North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbdba.lfpress.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=183996&amp;s=pets_nature |first=Joe |last=Belanger |title=DNA tests reveal cougars roam region |date=May 25, 2007 |publisher=[[London Free Press]] |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061306/http://pbdba.lfpress.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=183996&amp;s=pets_nature |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a consolidated map of cougar sightings shows numerous reports from the mid-western [[Great Plains]] through to eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cougarnet.org/bigpicture.html |title=The "Big" Picture |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |author=Board of Directors |year=2004 |publisher=The Cougar Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120173547/http://www.cougarnet.org/bigpicture.html |archivedate=November 20, 2014 }} ''The Cougar Network methodology is recognized by the [http://www.fws.gov/northeast/ECougar/ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507210014/http://www.fws.gov/northeast/ECougar/ |date=May 7, 2007 }}.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quebec]] wildlife services also considers cougar to be present in the province as a threatened species after multiple DNA tests confirmed cougar hair in lynx mating sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/faune/especes/menacees/faire.jsp |title=Your part in helping endangered species |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=Ministry of Wildlife and Natural Resources, Quebec, Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203082852/http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/faune/especes/menacees/faire.jsp |archivedate=February 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only unequivocally known eastern population is the critically endangered [[Florida panther]].

===Ecological role===
[[File:Feeling Unwelcome.jpg|thumb|Juvenile cougars in conflict with [[coyote]]s at [[National Elk Refuge]]]]
Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur. Of the three large predators in [[Yellowstone National Park]] – the [[grizzly bear]], [[gray wolf]], and cougar – the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often (but not always) able to drive both the gray wolf pack and the cougar off their kills. One study found that grizzlies and [[American black bear]]s visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Parks]], usurping 10% of carcasses. Bears gained up to 113% and cougars lost up to 26% of their respective daily energy requirements from these encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=COSEWIC. Canadian Wildlife Service |title=Assessment and Update Status Report on the Grizzly Bear (''Ursus arctos'') |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |year=2002 |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CW69-14-166-2002E.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colorado and California, black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills, respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to black bears when it comes to kills and when bears are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal refuges to avoid their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elbroch, L.

The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, mostly in winter. Packs of wolves can steal cougars' kills and occasionally kill the cat.

Both species are capable of killing mid-sized predators, such as [[bobcat]]s and [[coyote]]s, and tend to suppress their numbers.&lt;ref name="Yellowstone"/&gt; Although cougars can kill coyotes, the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubs.&lt;ref name="Cougars vs. coyotes photos draw Internet crowd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cougars vs. coyotes photos draw Internet crowd|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/cougars-vs-coyotes-photos-draw-internet-crowd/article_f6ecdb1a-a051-11e2-85a3-001a4bcf887a.html|publisher=missoulian.com|accessdate=April 8, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411040326/http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/cougars-vs-coyotes-photos-draw-internet-crowd/article_f6ecdb1a-a051-11e2-85a3-001a4bcf887a.html|archivedate=April 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any predator at or near the top of its [[food chain]], the cougar impacts the population of prey species. Predation by cougars has been linked to changes in the species mix of deer in a region. For example, a study in [[British Columbia]] observed that the population of mule deer, a favored cougar prey, was declining while the population of the less frequently preyed-upon [[white-tailed deer]] was increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Hugh S. |author2=Wielgus, Robert B. |author3=Gwilliam, John C. |year=2002 |title=Cougar predation and population growth of sympatric mule deer and white-tailed deer |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=556–68 |doi=10.1139/z02-025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vancouver Island marmot]], an endangered species [[endemic]] to one region of dense cougar population, has seen decreased numbers due to cougar and gray wolf predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bryant |first=Andrew A. |author2=Page, Rick E. |date=May 2005 |title=Timing and causes of mortality in the endangered Vancouver Island marmot (Marmota vancouverensis) |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology  |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=674–82 |doi=10.1139/z05-055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is a measurable effect on the quality of deer populations by puma predation.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Henry (November 16, 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/science/17obprey.html "Observatory: When Mountain Lions Hunt, They Prey on the Weak"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625085938/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/science/17obprey.html |date=June 25, 2017 }}.

==Hybrids==
[[File:Pumapard-1904.jpg|thumb|upright|Pumapard, photographed in 1904]]
{{Main|Pumapard}}
A pumapard is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal resulting from a union between a puma and a [[leopard]]. Whether born to a female puma mated to a male leopard or to a male puma mated to a female leopard, pumapards inherit a form of [[dwarfism]]. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent), but short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or greyish with brown, chestnut or "faded" rosettes.&lt;ref name="Geo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|title=Geocites – Liger &amp; Tigon Info|accessdate=June 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015110856/http://www.geocities.com/pride_lands/Liger_Tigon.html|archivedate=October 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
[[File:Puma concolor puma 4.JPG|thumb|At a [[zoological park]]]]
The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) currently lists the cougar as a "[[least concern]]" species. The cougar is regulated under [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices I, II and III|accessdate=May 24, 2007|publisher=[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B6FXtv06?url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|archivedate=October 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts.

In the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]], the only unequivocally known cougar population is the [[Florida panther]].

This uncertainty has been recognized by Canadian authorities. The Canadian federal agency called [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] rates its current data as "insufficient" to draw conclusions regarding the eastern cougar's survival and its website says that "despite many sightings in the past two decades from eastern Canada, there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar." Notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in [[Ontario]], Quebec, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive as "there may not be a distinct 'eastern' subspecies, and some sightings may be of escaped pets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct1/searchdetail_e.cfm?id=132 Committee on Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930014057/http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct1/searchdetail_e.cfm?id=132 |date=September 30, 2011 }}.

The cougar is also protected across much of the rest of its range. As of 1996, cougar hunting was prohibited in [[Argentina]], Brazil, [[Bolivia]], Chile, [[Colombia]], Costa Rica, [[French Guiana]], Guatemala, [[Honduras]], Nicaragua, [[Panama]], Paraguay, [[Suriname]], Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]. The cat had no reported legal protection in [[Ecuador]], El Salvador, and [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt; Regulated cougar hunting is still common in the United States and Canada. Although cougars are protected from all hunting in the [[Yukon]]; hunting is permitted in every U.S. state except California from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the Pacific Ocean.

Texas is the only U.S. state with a viable population of cougars that does not protect that population in some way. In Texas, cougars are listed as nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season, number killed, sex or age of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/nuisance/mountain_lion/ TPWD: Mountain Lions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126060556/http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/nuisance/mountain_lion/ |date=January 26, 2010 }}.

Conservation threats to the species include persecution as a pest animal, [[environmental degradation]] and [[habitat fragmentation]], and depletion of their prey base. [[Wildlife corridor]]s and sufficient range areas are critical to the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations have shown that the animal faces a low extinction risk in areas of 2200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (850&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) or more.

According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves (0.0006% of Texas's 13.4&amp;nbsp;million cattle and calves), 253 mohair goats, 302 mohair kids, 445 sheep (0.02% of Texas's 2&amp;nbsp;million sheep and lambs) and 562 lambs (0.04% of Texas's 1.2&amp;nbsp;million lambs) were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year.&lt;ref name="NASS-cattle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/Catt//1990s/1990/Catt-07-27-1990.pdf | title=Cattle report 1990 | publisher=National Agricultural Statistics Service | accessdate=September 11, 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608154849/http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/Catt//1990s/1990/Catt-07-27-1990.pdf | archivedate=June 8, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASS-sheep-goats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/SheeGoat//1990s/1990/SheeGoat-02-02-1990.pdf | title=Sheep and Goats report 1990 | publisher=National Agricultural Statistics Service | accessdate=September 11, 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608154900/http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/SheeGoat//1990s/1990/SheeGoat-02-02-1990.pdf | archivedate=June 8, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed nine calves, one horse, four foals, five goats, 318 sheep, and 400 lambs. In both reports, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of [[surplus killing]] have resulted in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack.&lt;ref name="Livestock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aws.vcn.com/mountain_lion_fact_sheet.html |title=Mountain Lion Fact Sheet |publisher=Abundant Wildlife Society of North America |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120720162250/http://www.aws.vcn.com/mountain_lion_fact_sheet.html |archivedate=July 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cougar's killing bite is applied to the back of the neck, head, or throat and the cat inflicts puncture marks with its claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey, sometimes also shredding the prey as it holds on. Coyotes also typically bite the throat but the work of a cougar is generally clean, while bites inflicted by coyotes and dogs leave ragged edges. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.&lt;ref name="Predation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agrilife.org/texnatwildlife/predators-and-predation/predator-species/cougars/ |title=Cougar Predation – Description |publisher=Procedures for Evaluating Predation on Livestock and Wildlife |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111165333/http://agrilife.org/texnatwildlife/predators-and-predation/predator-species/cougars/ |archivedate=January 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of human-puma conflicts. In a 2013 study the most important predictor of puma problems were remedial hunting of puma the previous year. Each additional puma on the landscape increased predation and human-puma complaints by 5%, but each additional animal killed on the landscape during the previous year increased complaints by 50%. The effect had a dose-response relationship with very heavy (100% removal of adult puma) remedial hunting leading to a 150% – 340% increase in livestock and human conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of Remedial Sport Hunting on Cougar Complaints and Livestock Depredations |author1=Peebles, Kaylie A.|author2= Wielgus, Robert B.|author3= Maletzke, Benjamin T.|author4= Swanson, Mark E. |journal=PLoS ONE |date=November 2013 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=e79713|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079713|pmid=24260291 |pmc=3834330|bibcode=2013PLoSO...879713P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is attributed to the removal of older pumas that have learned to avoid people and their replacement by younger males that react differently to humans.

===Attacks on humans===

====North American subspecies====
{{See also|List of fatal cougar attacks in North America}}
[[File:MountainLionAttackProtocol.jpg|thumb|right|Mountain Lion warning sign in [[California]], US.]]

The pertinent North American subspecies is ''P. concolor couguar''.

Due to the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]], cougar [[range (biology)|range]]s increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by [[humans]]. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey.&lt;ref name="Med"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKee |first=Denise |year=2003 |title=Cougar Attacks on Humans: A Case Report |journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 |pmid=14518628 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2003)14[169:CAOHAC]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 10-year study in New Mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans, the animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely (median distance=18.5 m; 61 feet) except in 6% of cases; 14/16 of those were females with cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Puma responses to close approaches by researchers|first1=Linda L.|last1=Sweanor|first2=Kenneth A.|last2=Logan|first3=Maurice G.|last3=Hornocker|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|volume=33|issue=3|pages=905–913|year=2005|doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[905:PRTCAB]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma [[Habituation|habituates]] to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.&lt;ref name="GovBC"/&gt;

Between 1890 and 1990, in North America there were 53 reported, confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim).&lt;ref name="Beier"&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul |last=Beier |url=http://users.frii.com/mytymyk/lions/beier.htm |title=Cougar attacks on humans in United States and Canada |work=Wildlife Society Bulletin |year=1991 |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Northern Arizon University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622033418/http://users.frii.com/mytymyk/lions/beier.htm |archivedate=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/mtn_lion_attacks.shtml |title=Confirmed mountain lion attacks in the United States and Canada 1890 – present |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Arizona Game and Fish Department |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518181449/http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/mtn_lion_attacks.shtml# |archivedate=May 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform. The heavily populated state of California has seen a dozen attacks since 1986 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; Washington state was the site of a fatal attack in 2018, its first since 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Michelle|title=Victim In Deadly Washington State Cougar Attack Had Boston Ties|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/05/21/cougar-attack-victim-sj-brooks-washington-seattle-boston/|accessdate=23 May 2018|publisher=CBS BOston|date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightly populated [[New Mexico]] reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Mexico Department of Game and Fish]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120620114802/http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/062308pinosaltoslion.html Search continues for mountain lion that killed Pinos Altos man], June 23, 2008; [https://web.archive.org/web/20120620114802/http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/062508pinosaltoslion.html Wounded mountain lion captured, killed near Pinos Altos], June 25, 2008; [https://web.archive.org/web/20120620114802/http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/publications/press_releases/documents/2008/070108pinosaltoslion2.html Second mountain lion captured near Pinos Altos], July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person "[[wikt:play dead|plays dead]]". Standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Subramanian|first=Sushma|title=Should You Run or Freeze When You See a Mountain Lion?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=should-you-run-or-freeze-when-you-see-a-mountain-lion|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=March 10, 2012|date=April 14, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319160359/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=should-you-run-or-freeze-when-you-see-a-mountain-lion|archivedate=March 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.&lt;ref name="Med" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GovBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm |title=Safety Guide to Cougars |work=Environmental Stewardship Division |year=1991 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 |publisher=[[Government of British Columbia]], Ministry of Environment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823061650/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm# |archivedate=August 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the [[vertebrae]] and into the [[spinal cord]]. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal.&lt;ref name="Med" /&gt; Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims – and almost all fatalities – were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in [[British Columbia]], particularly on [[Vancouver Island]] where cougar populations are especially dense.&lt;ref name="Beier" /&gt; Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27756765/ns/us_news-life/t/neighbor-saves-miami-teen-cougar/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=November 16, 2008|title=Neighbor saves Miami teen from cougar|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=2-Year-Old Boy Hurt In Pet Cougar Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/04/nyregion/2-year-old-boy-hurt-in-pet-cougar-attack.html|date=June 4, 1995|journal=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625060218/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/04/nyregion/2-year-old-boy-hurt-in-pet-cougar-attack.html|archivedate=June 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on new wildlife collars may be able to reduce human-animal conflicts by predicting when and where predatory animals hunt. This may save the lives of humans, pets, and livestock as well as the lives of these large predatory mammals that are important to the balance of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Terrie M.

Pumas in the [[Southern cone]] of America – often called Argentine cougars by North Americans – are reputed to be extremely reluctant to attack man; in legend, they defended people against jaguars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chébez|first1=Juan Carlos |last2=Nigro |first2=Roberto Ángel |title=APORTES PRELIMINARES PARA UN PLAN DE CONSERVACIÓN Y MANEJO DEL PUMA (''Puma concolor'') EN LA REPÚBLICA ARGENTINA|language=Spanish|url=http://maaz.ihmc.us/rid=1PP8CK25F-1FYP3P-2VPC/chebez-y-nigro-aportes-para-un-plan-de-conservacion-y-m.pdf|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nineteenth century naturalists [[Félix de Azara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azara|first=Félix de|title=The Natural History of the Quadrupeds of Paraguay and the River la Plata|pp=207–8|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|location=Edinburgh|year=1838|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QNc0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA207|quote=I have not heard that they have assaulted or attempted to assault man, nor dogs and boys, even when it encounters them asleep}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Henry Hudson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=W.

Despite prohibitory signs, coatis are hand-fed by tourists in the park, causing unnatural approximation between cougars and humans.

'''Desakota''' is a term used in [[urban geography]] used to describe areas in the extended surroundings of large cities, in which urban and agricultural forms of land use and settlement coexist and are intensively intermingled.

The term was coined by the urban researcher Terry McGee of the [[University of British Columbia]] around 1990. It comes from [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''desa'' "[[village]]" and kota "[[city]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Stephen |last=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate: Reflecting on Urban Form in Southeast Asia |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desakota areas typically occur in Asia, especially [[South East Asia]]. Examples can be found in the urbanised regions of [[Java]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Terry G. |last=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ in an Era of Volatile Globalization |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; the densely populated, delta-shaped areas on the peripheries of the [[Jakarta]] agglomeration ("[[Jabodetabek]]"), but also the extended metropolitan regions of [[Bangkok]] or [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ |year=2002 |pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desakota areas are situated outside the periurban zones, from which daily commuting is easily possible, i.e. more than 30 or 50&amp;nbsp;km off the city centre. They often sprawl alongside arterial and communication roads, sometimes from one agglomeration to the next. They are characterised by high population density and intensive agricultural use (especially [[Paddy field|wet-rice cultivation]]), but differ from densely populated rural areas by more urban-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=The Emergence of ''Desakota'' Regions in Asia. |year=1991 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are: developed transport networks, high population mobility, increasing activity outside the agricultural sector, the coexistence of many different forms of land use, more female participation in paid labour, and unregulated land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chia |first1=Lin Sien |first2=Martin |last2=Perry |title=Introduction |work=Southeast Asia Transformed: A Geography of Change |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |place=Singapur |year=2003 |isbn=981-230-119-4 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their rambling extent and indistinct boundaries, the emergence of Desakota regions brings difficulties for the administration, as uniform plans, regulations or designs are hardly viable. Desakota regions are characterised by high mobility of goods and services and rapid change in patterns of settlement. They usually elude the division in functually specialised zones that is conventionally applied in urban geography. Completely different forms of use, as e.g. traditional agriculture, large scale and cottage industry, amusement parks and golf courses, shopping centres and retail parks, and forms of settlement from [[shanty town]]s to [[gated community]] coexist in them close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate |year=2002 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment''' ('''LTEE''') is an ongoing study in [[experimental evolution]] led by [[Richard Lenski]] that has been tracking genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of asexual ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacteria since 24 February 1988.&lt;ref name="Source"&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard E. |last=Lenski |url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/strainsource.html |title=Source of founding strain |publisher=Michigan State University |work=Richard E.

Lenski (@RELenski) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski performed the 10,000th transfer of the experiment on March 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/some-wrinkles-in-time/|title=Some Wrinkles in Time|date=2017-03-13|website=Telliamed Revisited|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the experiment, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the evolving populations. These have included changes that have occurred in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in ''E. coli'', in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blount2012 /&gt;

==Experimental approach==
The long-term evolution experiment was designed as an open-ended means of empirical examination of central features of [[evolution]].  The experiment was begun with three principal goals:
# To examine the dynamics of evolution, including the rate of evolutionary change.
# To examine the repeatability of evolution.
# To better understand the relationship between change on the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] and [[Genotype|genotypic]] levels.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Richard E. |last1=Lenski |year=2003 |title=Phenotypic and Genomic Evolution during a 20,000-Generation Experiment with the Bacterium ''Escherichia coli'' |pages=225–65 |doi=10.1002/9780470650288.ch8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BIK4_B_180C&amp;pg=PA225 |editor1-first=Jules |editor1-last=Janick |journal=Plant Breeding Reviews |volume=24 |issue=2 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-46892-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the experiment has continued, its scope has grown as new questions in evolutionary biology have arisen that it can be used to address, as the populations' evolution has presented new phenomena to study, and as technology and methodological techniques have advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Jeremy W.|last2=Lenski|first2=Richard E.|date=2015-06-23|title=From Here to Eternity—The Theory and Practice of a Really Long Experiment|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=13|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002185|issn=1544-9173|pmc=4477892|pmid=26102073|pages=e1002185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''E. coli'' as the experimental organism has allowed many generations and large populations to be studied in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, due to the long use of ''E .coli'' as a principle model organism in [[molecular biology]], a wide array of tools, protocols, and procedures were available for studying changes at the genetic, phenotypic, and physiological levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=Zachary D|title=The unexhausted potential of E. coli|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.05826|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4373459|pmid=25807083}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria can also be frozen and preserved while remaining viable. This has permitted the creation of what Lenski describes as a "frozen fossil record" of samples of evolving populations that can be revived at any time. This frozen fossil record allows populations to be restarted in cases of contamination or other disruption in the experiment, and permits the isolation and comparison of living exemplars of ancestral and evolved clones. Lenski chose an ''E. coli'' strain that reproduces only [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], lacks any [[plasmid]]s that could permit [[bacterial conjugation]], and has no viable [[prophage]]. As a consequence, evolution in the experiment occurs only by the core evolutionary processes of [[mutation]], [[genetic drift]], and [[natural selection]]. This strict asexuality also means that [[genetic marker]]s persist in lineages and clades by [[common descent]], but cannot otherwise spread in the populations.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004"/&gt;

Lenski chose to carry out the experiment with the bacteria grown in a glucose-limited minimal medium called DM25,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dm25liquid.html|title=DM25 Liquid Medium|website=myxo.css.msu.edu|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was initially developed by [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]] for use in isolating [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophic]] mutants of ''E. coli'' using [[penicillin]] as a selective agent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=George|last2=Williams|first2=Luther S.|date=1975-04-01|title=Modified Penicillin Enrichment Procedure for the Selection of Bacterial Mutants|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=122|issue=1|pages=345–346|issn=0021-9193|pmc=235679|pmid=1091629}}&lt;/ref&gt; DM25 is supplemented with a low concentration of glucose.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lenski chose this concentration to simplify analysis of the populations' evolution by reducing [[clonal interference]], in which multiple versions of [[allele]]s are competing in an evolving population, while also reducing the possibility of the evolution of ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004" /&gt;  This concentration of glucose used supports a maximum population of 500 million cells of the ancestor in a 10 mL culture, though the maximum now varies among the evolved populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  DM25 also contains a large amount of citrate (about 11 times the concentration of glucose), which was originally included by Davis because it improved the killing efficiency of [[penicillin]] during his experiments, though it is now known to aid in ''E. coli'''s acquisition of iron from the medium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagegg|first=W.|last2=Braun|first2=V.|date=1981-01-01|title=Ferric citrate transport in Escherichia coli requires outer membrane receptor protein fecA|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=145|issue=1|pages=156–163|issn=0021-9193|pmc=217256|pmid=7007312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
The 12 populations are maintained in a {{Convert|37|C}} incubator in Lenski's laboratory at [[Michigan State University]]. Each day, 1% of each population is transferred to a flask of fresh DM25 growth medium. The dilution means that each population experiences 6.64 generations, or doublings, each day.  Large, representative samples of each population are frozen with glycerol as a [[cryoprotectant]] at 500-generation (75-day) intervals. The bacteria in these samples remain viable, and can be revived at any time.  This collection of samples is referred to as the "frozen fossil record", and provides a history of the evolution of each population through the entire experiment.  The populations are also regularly screened for changes in [[mean fitness]], and supplemental experiments are regularly performed to study interesting developments in the populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard E. |last=Lenski |url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/overview.html |title=Overview of the ''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment |publisher=Michigan State University |work=Richard E. Lenski Homepage |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|4}}, the ''E. coli'' populations have been under study for over 64,500 generations, and are thought to have undergone enough [[spontaneous mutation]]s that every possible single [[point mutation]] in the ''E. coli'' genome has occurred multiple times.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Borland|first2=Christina Z.|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|year=2008|title=Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of ''Escherichia coli''|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=105|issue=23|pages=7899–906|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.7899B|doi=10.1073/pnas.0803151105|jstor=25462703|pmc=2430337|pmid=18524956|last1=Blount|first1=Zachary D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding strain===
The strain of ''E. coli'' Lenski chose to use in the long-term evolution experiment was derived from "strain Bc251", as described in a 1966 paper by Seymour Lederberg, via Bruce Levin, who had used it in a bacterial ecology experiment in 1972. The defining genetics traits of this strain were: T6&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, Str&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, r&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (unable to grow on [[arabinose]]).&lt;ref name="Source" /&gt; Lenski designated the original founding strain as REL606. Before the beginning of the experiment, Lenski isolated an Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variant  of the strain in which a [[point mutation]] in the ''ara'' [[operon]] had restored growth on arabinose, which he designated as strain REL607. When beginning the long-term evolution experiment, Lenski founded six populations with six individual Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; colonies of REL606. These populations are referred to as Ara-1 through Ara-6. Lenski also founded six more populations from six individual Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colonies of REL607. These are referred to as populations Ara+1 through Ara+6. The marker differences permit strains to be differentiated on Tetrazolium Arabinose plates, on which Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; colonies appear red, while Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colonies appear white to pink. Over the course of the experiment, each population has accumulated a large number of distinct mutations, which permit further means of identifying strains by their population of origin.

Much analysis of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004" /&gt; This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a [[power law]] model much better than the hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ribeck|first2=Noah|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|date=13 December 2013|title=Long-Term Dynamics of Adaptation in Asexual Populations|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1364|journal=Science|volume=342|issue=6164|pages=1364–1367|bibcode=2013Sci...342.1364W|doi=10.1126/science.1243357|first1=Michael J.|last1=Wiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data.

===Evolution of increased cell size in all twelve populations===
[[Image:Lenski10.png|left|thumb|right|Growth in cell size of bacteria in the Lenski experiment]]

However, although this mutation increased [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to [[osmotic stress]] and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures.&lt;ref name="Philippe" /&gt;

===Ecological specialization===
Over the course of the experiment, the populations have evolved to specialize on the glucose resource on which they grow. This was first described in 2000, when Cooper and Lenski demonstrated that all populations had experienced decay of unused metabolic functions after 20,000 generations, restricting the range of substances on which the bacteria could grow. Their analysis suggested that this decay was due to [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|antagonistic pleiotropy]], in which mutations that improved ability to grow on glucose had reduced or eliminated the ability to grow on others substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=V.

Moreover, they concluded that the metabolic losses were not due to antagonistic pleiotropy, but the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused portions of the genome, suggesting that adaptation to a simple environment might not necessarily lead to specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leiby|first=Nicholas|last2=Marx|first2=Christopher J.|date=2014-02-01|title=Metabolic erosion primarily through mutation accumulation, and not tradeoffs, drives limited evolution of substrate specificity in Escherichia coli|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=e1001789|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001789|issn=1545-7885|pmc=3928024|pmid=24558347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of aerobic citrate usage in one population===
====Background====
[[Image:Lenski's long-term lines of E. coli on 25 June 2008, close-up of citrate mutant.jpg|thumb|The population designated Ara-3 (center) is more [[turbid]] because that population evolved to use the [[citrate]] present in the growth medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/on-the-evolution-of-citrate-use/|title=On the Evolution of Citrate Use|date=2016-02-20|website=Telliamed Revisited|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''E. coli'' is normally unable to grow [[Aerobic respiration|aerobically]] on [[Citric acid|citrate]] due to the inability to express a citrate transporter when oxygen is present.&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lbc.msu.edu/evo-ed/pages/Ecoli/cellbio.html|title=Cell Biology: The Use of Citrate|website=EVO-ED|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''E. coli'' has a complete [[citric acid cycle]], and therefore metabolizes citrate as an intermediate during aerobic growth on other substances, including glucose. Most ''E. coli'' can grow anaerobically on citrate via [[fermentation]], if a co-substrate such as glucose is available to provide reducing power.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Stokes|first2=J.L.|date=1952|title=Oxidation of citrate by Escherichia coli|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=63|issue=3|pages=415–420|pmc=169284|pmid=14927574|last1=Lara|first1=F.J.S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lütgens|first=M.|last2=Gottschalk|first2=G.|date=1980-07-01|title=Why a co-substrate is required for anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli on citrate|journal=Journal of General Microbiology|volume=119|issue=1|pages=63–70|doi=10.1099/00221287-119-1-63|issn=0022-1287|pmid=6997437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] growth is possible due to the expression of a transmembrane citrate-succinate antiporter gene, ''citT'', which was first identified in 1998.

The inability to grow aerobically on citrate, referred to as a Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype, is considered a defining characteristic of ''E. coli'' as a species, and one that has been a valuable means of differentiating ''E. coli'' from pathogenic ''Salmonella''. While Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; strains of ''E. coli'' have been isolated from environmental and agricultural samples, in every such case, the trait was found to be due to the presence of a plasmid containing a foreign citrate transporter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=C.

====Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolves in the LTEE====
In 2008, Lenski's team, led by [[Zachary Blount|Zachary D. Blount]], reported that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate had evolved in one population. Around generation 33,127, a dramatic increase in turbidity was observed in the population designated Ara-3. They found that the population contained clones that were able to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). This metabolic capacity permitted the population to grow several-fold larger than it had previously, due to the large amount of citrate present in the medium. Examination of frozen fossil samples of the populations showed that Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones could be isolated as early as 31,500 generations. The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants in the population were found to possess a number of genetic markers unique to the Ara-3 population, which excluded the possibility that they were contaminants, rather than spontaneous mutants. In a series of experiments that "replayed" the tape of Ara-3 evolution from Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clones isolated from samples frozen at various time points in the population's history, they demonstrated that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate was more likely to re-evolve in a subset of genetically pure, evolved clones. In these experiments, they observed 19 new, independent instances of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; re-evolution, but only when starting from clones isolated from after generation 20,000. Fluctuation tests showed that clones from this generation and later displayed a rate of mutation to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait was significantly higher than the ancestral rate. Even in these later clones, the rate of mutation to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was on the order of one occurrence per trillion cell divisions.&lt;ref name=pmid18524956 /&gt;

Lenski and his colleagues concluded that the evolution of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; function in this one population arose due to one or more earlier, possibly nonadaptive, "potentiating" mutations that increased the rate of mutation to an accessible level. The data suggested that citrate usage involved at least two mutations subsequent to these "potentiating" mutations. More generally, the authors suggest these results indicate, following the argument of [[Stephen Jay Gould]], "that historical contingency can have a profound and lasting impact" on the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=pmid18524956/&gt; These findings have come to be considered a significant instance of the impact of historical contingency on evolution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=Zachary D.|date=2016-01-16|title=A case study in evolutionary contingency|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.12.007|issn=1879-2499|pmid=26787098|volume=58|pages=82–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desjardins|first=Eric|date=2011-01-01|title=Historicity and Experimental Evolution|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/DESHAE|journal=Biology and Philosophy|volume=26|issue=3|pages=339–364|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9256-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beatty|first=John|last2=Carrera|first2=Isabel|date=2011-01-01|title=When What Had to Happen Was Not Bound to Happen: History, Chance, Narrative, Evolution|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/BEAWWH|journal=Journal of the Philosophy of History|volume=5|issue=3|pages=471–495|doi=10.1163/187226311x599916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genomic analysis of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait and implications for evolutionary innovation====
[[File:Novel rnk-citT module and citT expression - actualization of Cit+ trait in LTEE population Ara-3.svg|thumb|418x418px|The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait was actualized by a duplication mutation that created a new regulatory module by placing a copy of the ''citT'' gene that encodes a citrate-succinate antiporter under the control of a promoter that supports expression under aerobic conditions. This mutation results in the CitT transporter being expressed when oxygen is present, permitting growth on citrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blount-lab.org/photos.html|title=Photos|website=Blount Lab|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2012, Lenski and his team reported the results of a genomic analysis of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait that shed light on the genetic basis and evolutionary history of the trait. The researchers had sequenced the entire genomes of twenty-nine clones isolated from various time points in the Ara-3 population's history. They used these sequences to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the population, which showed that the population had diversified into three [[clades]] by 20,000 generations.  The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants had evolved in one of these, which they called Clade 3. Clones that had been found to be potentiated in earlier research were distributed among all three clades, but were over-represented in Clade 3. This led the researchers to conclude that there had been at least two potentiating mutations involved in Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolution.&lt;ref name="Blount2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blount ZD, Barrick JE, Davidson CJ, Lenski RE |title=Genomic analysis of a key innovation in an experimental ''Escherichia coli'' population |journal=Nature |date=2012-09-27 |volume=489 |issue=7417 |pages=513–518 |doi=10.1038/nature11514 |pmid=22992527 |pmc=3461117|bibcode = 2012Natur.489..513B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that all Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones had mutations in which 2933 base pair segment of DNA was duplicated or amplified. The duplicated segment contained the gene for the citrate transporter protein used in anaerobic growth on citrate, ''citT''. The duplication is tandem, and resulted in copies that were head-to-tail with respect to each other. This new configuration placed a copy of the previously silent, unexpressed ''citT'' under the control of the adjacent ''rnk'' gene's promoter, which directs expression when oxygen is present. This new ''rnk-citT'' module produced a novel regulatory pattern for ''citT'', activating expression of the citrate transporter when oxygen was present, and thereby enabled aerobic growth on citrate.&lt;ref name=Blount2012 /&gt;

Movement of this ''rnk-citT'' module into the genome of a potentiated Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clone was shown to be sufficient to produce a Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. However, the initial Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype conferred by the duplication was very weak, and only granted a ~1% fitness benefit. The researchers found that the number of copies of the ''rnk-citT'' module had to be increased to strengthen the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait sufficiently to permit the bacteria to grow well on the citrate. Further mutations after the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria became dominant in the population continued to accumulate improved growth on citrate.

The researchers concluded that the evolution of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait occurred in three distinct phases in which mutations accumulated that increased the rate of mutation to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the trait itself appeared in a weak form, and, finally, the trait was improved by later mutations. Blount et al. suggested that this pattern might be typical of how novel traits in general evolve, and proposed a three-step model of evolutionary innovation:
# '''Potentiation''': a genetic background evolves in which a trait is mutationally accessible, making the trait's evolution possible.
# '''Actualization''': a mutation occurs that produces the trait, making it manifest, albeit likely in a weak form.
# '''Refinement''': Once the trait exists, if it provides selective benefit, mutations will accumulate that improve the trait, making it effective. This phase is open-ended, and will continue so long as refining mutations arise and the trait remains beneficial.&lt;ref name="Blount2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
This model has seen acceptance in evolutionary biology. In 2015 paleontologist [[Douglas Erwin]] suggested a modification to a four-step model to better reflect a possible distinction between evolutionary novelty and evolutionary innovation, and to highlight the importance of environmental conditions: potentiation, generation of novel phenotypes (actualization), adaptive refinement, and exploitation (conversion of a novelty to an innovation as it becomes important for the ecological establishment of possessing organisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erwin|first=Douglas H.|date=2015-10-05|title=Novelty and Innovation in the History of Life|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=19|pages=R930–940|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.019|issn=1879-0445|pmid=26439356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation of potentiation====
In 2014, a research team led by Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] described the application of a new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify potentiating mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quandt|first=Erik M.|last2=Deatherage|first2=Daniel E.|last3=Ellington|first3=Andrew D.|last4=Georgiou|first4=George|last5=Barrick|first5=Jeffrey E.|date=2014-02-11|title=Recursive genomewide recombination and sequencing reveals a key refinement step in the evolution of a metabolic innovation in Escherichia coli|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=6|pages=2217–2222|doi=10.1073/pnas.1314561111|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3926077|pmid=24379390|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.2217Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method used multiple rounds of a process in which [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|F plasmid]] based [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] between a 33,000 generation Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clone, CZB154, and the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait, which they refer to as Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;. They found that the ''rnk-citT'' module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was sufficient to produce a weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that conferred a strong, Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the ''rnk-citT'' module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called ''dctA'', caused a massive increase in the expression of the [[Dcu family|DctA transporter]], which functions to import C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells to re-uptake [[Succinic acid|succinate]], [[Malic acid|malate]], and [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]] released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, ''dcuS'', that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the ''dctA'' mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a genetic background and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit.

Quandt and colleagues later published findings definitively identifying a mutation that did potentiate Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quandt|first=Erik M.|last2=Gollihar|first2=Jimmy|last3=Blount|first3=Zachary D.|last4=Ellington|first4=Andrew D.|last5=Georgiou|first5=George|last6=Barrick|first6=Jeffrey E.|date=2015-01-01|title=Fine-tuning citrate synthase flux potentiates and refines metabolic innovation in the Lenski evolution experiment|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.09696|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4718724|pmid=26465114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mutation was in the ''gltA'' gene, which encodes [[Citrate synthase family|citrate synthase]], an enzyme involved in the flow of carbon into the [[citric acid cycle]]. It had the effect of increasing citrate synthase activity, and they showed that it permitted improved growth on [[acetate]]. Moreover, with the ''gltA'' mutation, the ''rnk-citT'' module that causes the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait has a neutral-to-slightly beneficial fitness effect, while, without it, the module was strongly detrimental. The ''gltA'' mutation therefore seems to have permitted early, weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants to persist in the population until later refining mutations could occur, consistent with their earlier conclusions. After a strong Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype evolved, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. The researchers found that later mutations in ''gltA'' countered the first mutation, reducing citrate synthase activity, and further improving growth on citrate. They concluded that the series of mutation in ''gltA'' first potentiated, and then refined growth on citrate. They also suggested that the lineage in which Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; arose might have occupied a niche in Ara-3 based on growth on acetate, and that the potentiating mutations that led to evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in Ara-3 were originally adaptive for acetate use.

====Investigation of post-Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ecology and persistent diversity====
A small subpopulation of Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells unable to grow on citrate, and belonging to a separate clade persisted in the population after the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells became dominant. Early findings showed that this diversity was partly due to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells being better at growing on the glucose in the medium.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt; Turner et al. later found that another factor behind the coexistence was that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells evolved the ability to cross feed on the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; majority. They showed that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells release [[Succinic acid|succinate]], [[Malic acid|malate]], and [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]] during growth on citrate, as the CitT transporter pumps these substances out of the cell while pumping citrate into the cell. The Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells had rapidly evolved the ability to grow on these substances due to a mutation that restored expression of an appropriate transporter protein that was silent in the ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Turner|first=Caroline B.|last2=Blount|first2=Zachary D.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Daniel H.|last4=Lenski|first4=Richard E.|date=2015-06-17|title=Evolution and coexistence in response to a key innovation in a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli|biorxiv=020958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulation eventually went [[Extinction|extinct]] in the population between 43,500 and 44,000 generations. This extinction was shown to not be due to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; majority evolving to be able to [[Invasive species|invade]] the niche occupied by the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; minority. Indeed, Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clones could invade Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations from after the extinction event. Moreover, in an experiment in which they restarted twenty replicates of the Ara-3 population from the sample frozen 500 generations before the extinction, Turner et al. found that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulation had not gone extinct in any of the replicates after 500 generations of evolution. One of these replicates was continued for 2,500 generations, over which Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; continued to coexist. The researchers concluded that the extinction of Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; had been due to some unknown "rare environmental perturbation", similar to that which can impact natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extinction-lab-bottle-was-fluke-experiment-finds|title=Extinction in lab bottle was a fluke, experiment finds|last=Saey|first=Tina Hesman|website=Science News|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final replicate was integrated into the main LTEE experiment, becoming the thirteenth population, Ara-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Caroline B.|last2=Blount|first2=Zachary D.|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|date=2015-11-18|title=Replaying Evolution to Test the Cause of Extinction of One Ecotype in an Experimentally Evolved Population|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142050|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0142050|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0142050|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651540|pmid=26581098|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1042050T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of citrate-usage findings====
Other researchers have experimented on evolving aerobic citrate-utilizing ''E. coli''. Dustin Van Hofwegen et al., working in the lab of [[Scott Minnich]], were able to isolate 46 independent citrate-utilizing mutants of ''E. coli'' in just 12 to 100 generations using highly prolonged selection under starvation, during which the bacteria would sample more mutations more rapidly.&lt;ref name="Rapid Evolution Van Hofwegen"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hovde|first2=Carolyn J.|last3=Minnich|first3=Scott A.|last4=Silhavy|first4=T. J.|date=1 April 2016|title=Rapid Evolution of Citrate Utilization by Escherichia coli by Direct Selection Requires citT and dctA|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=198|issue=7|pages=1022–1034|doi=10.1128/JB.00831-15|last1=Van Hofwegen|first1=Dustin J.|pmid=26833416|pmc=4800869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, the genomic DNA sequencing revealed an amplification of the ''citT'' and ''dctA'' loci, and rearrangement of DNA were the same class of mutations identified in the experiment by Richard Lenski and his team. They concluded that the rarity of the citrate-utilizing mutant in Lenski's research was likely a result of the selective experimental conditions used by his team rather than being a unique evolutionary speciation event.&lt;ref name="Rapid Evolution Van Hofwegen" /&gt;

John Roth and Sophie Maisnier-Patin reviewed the approaches in both the Lenski team's delayed mutations and the Van Hofweges team's rapid mutations on ''E. coli''. They argue that both teams experienced the same sequence of potentiation, actualization, and refinement leading up to similar Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Maisnier-Patin|first2=Sophie|last3=Silhavy|first3=T. J.|date=1 April 2016|title=Reinterpreting Long-Term Evolution Experiments: Is Delayed Adaptation an Example of Historical Contingency or a Consequence of Intermittent Selection?|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=198|issue=7|pages=1009–1012|doi=10.1128/JB.00110-16|last1=Roth|first1=John R.|pmc=4800865}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, the period of less than a day during which citrate usage would be under selection, followed by 100-fold dilution, and a period of growth on glucose that would not select for citrate use, ultimately lowered the probability of ''E. coli'' being able accumulate early adaptive mutations from one period of selection to the next.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting" /&gt; On the other hand, Van Hofwegen's team allowed for a continuous selection period of 7 days, which yielded a more rapid development of citrate-using ''E. coli''. Roth and Maisnier-Patin suggest that the serial dilution of ''E. coli'' and short period of selection for citrate-use under the conditions of the LTEE perpetually impeded each generation of ''E. coli'' from reaching the next stages of aerobic citrate utilization.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting" /&gt;

In response, Blount and Lenski acknowledge that the problem is not with the experiments or the data, but with the interpretations made by Van Hofwegen et al. and Maisnier-Patin and Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45423/title/Similar-Data--Different-Conclusions/|title=Similar Data, Different Conclusions {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|website=The Scientist|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski notes that the rapid evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was not necessarily unexpected since his team was also able to produce multiple Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mutants in a few weeks during the replay experiments they reported in the 2008 paper in which his team first described the evolution of aerobic citrate use in the LTEE.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/on-the-evolution-of-citrate-use/|title=On the Evolution of Citrate Use|website=Telliamed Revisited|last1=Lenski|first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a "speciation event" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said "that becoming Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was only a first step on the road to possible speciation", and thus did not propose that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; Lenski acknowledges that scientists, including him and his team, often use short hand and jargon when discussing speciation, instead of writing more carefully and precisely on the matter, and this can cause issues.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; However, he notes that speciation is generally considered by evolutionary biologists to be a process, and not an event.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; He also criticizes Van Hofwegen et al. and Roth and Maisnier-Patin for positing "false dichotomies" regarding the complex concept of historical contingency. He argues that historical contingency means that history matters, and that their 2008 paper presented data that showed that the evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the LTEE was contingent upon mutations that had accumulated earlier. He concludes that "...historical contingency was invoked and demonstrated in a specific context, namely that of the emergence of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the LTEE—it does not mean that the emergence of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is historically contingent in other experimental contexts, nor for that matter that other changes in the LTEE are historically contingent—in fact, some other evolved changes in the LTEE have been highly predictable and not (or at least not obviously) contingent on prior mutations in the populations."&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}

'''Earth science''' or '''geoscience''' includes all fields of [[natural science]] related to the [[planet]] [[Earth]]. It is the branch of science dealing with the physical constitution of the earth and its atmosphere. Earth science is the study of our planet’s physical characteristics, from earthquakes to raindrops, and floods to fossils. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of [[planetary science]], but with a much older history. “Earth science” encompasses four main branches of study, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]], each of which is further broken down into more specialized fields.

There are both [[reductionism|reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. It is also the study of the Earth and its neighbors in space. Some Earth [[Scientist|scientists]] use their knowledge of the Earth to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about Earth processes such as [[Volcano|volcanoes]], [[Earthquake|earthquakes]], and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events. 

The Earth sciences can include the study of [[geology]], the [[lithosphere]], and the large-scale structure of the Earth's interior, as well as the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[biosphere]]. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from [[geography]], [[chronology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth works and evolves. Earth science affects our everyday lives. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists study water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to predict where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists mainly work “in the field”—climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then they record their findings on charts and maps.

== Fields of study ==
The following [[branches of science|fields of science]] are generally categorized within the Earth sciences:
* [[Physical geography]], covers aspects of [[geomorphology]], [[pedology (soil study)|soil study]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], and [[biogeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html|title=1(b). Elements of Geography – 2nd Edition, by M. Pidwirny, 2006|work=physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geology]] describes the [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] parts of the [[Earth's crust]] (or [[lithosphere]]) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]], [[geochemistry]], geomorphology, [[paleontology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[structural geology]], [[engineering geology]], and [[sedimentology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name="smith 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geophysics]] and [[geodesy]] investigate the [[figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]], its reaction to forces and its [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity field]]s. Geophysicists explore the [[Inner core|Earth's core]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] as well as the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[Seismology|seismic]] activity of the lithosphere.&lt;ref name="smith 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geodesy&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0|title=WordNet Search – 3.1|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/geodesy/welcome.html|title=NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Global Positioning Tutorial|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of [[geologist]]s in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology, particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration. [[Seismologist]]s use geophysics to understand plate tectonic shifting, as well as predict seismic activity. See [[geophysical survey]].
* [[Soil science]] covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or [[pedosphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub] broken link? {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030004610/http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm |date=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major subdisciplines include [[edaphology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~doetqp-p/courses/env320/lec1/Lec1.html|title=Duane Gardiner, Lecture: Why Study Soils? excerpted from Miller, R.W. &amp; D.T. Gardiner, 1998. Soils in our Environment, 8th Edition|work=nau.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology]] covers the interactions between the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], with their natural environment. This field of study differentiates the study of the Earth, from the study of other planets in the [[Solar System]]; the Earth being the only planet teeming with life.
* [[Hydrology]], [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] are a study revolved around the movement, distribution, and quality of the water and involves all the components of the hydrologic cycle on the earth and its atmosphere (or [[hydrosphere]]). "Sub-disciplines of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface water hydrology, hydrogeology, watershed science, forest hydrology, and water chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flatheadwatershed.org/watershed/hydrology.shtml|title=Hydrology of the Watershed|last=Craig|first=Kendall|authorlink=Craig N. Kendall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Glaciology]] covers the [[ice|icy]] parts of the Earth (or [[cryosphere]]).
* [[Atmospheric sciences]] cover the [[gas]]eous parts of the Earth (or [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]) between the surface and the [[exosphere]] (about 1000&amp;nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines include meteorology, climatology, [[atmospheric chemistry]], and [[atmospheric physics]].

== Earth's interior ==
[[File:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[volcanic]] eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth.&lt;!---originating from radioactive decay and season gravitational sorting in Earth's core and mantle, and residual energy gained during the Earth's formation---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, Academic Press, London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Plate tectonics]], [[mountain]] ranges, [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are [[geology|geological phenomena]] that can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes in the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html|title=Earth's Energy Budget|work=ou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- A diagram is needed here. --&gt;
Beneath the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] lies the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] which is heated by the [[radioactive decay]] of [[heavy elements]]. The mantle is not quite solid and consists of [[magma]] which is in a state of semi-perpetual [[wikt:convection|convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simison|2007|loc=paragraph 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams tectonics"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 94–95, 100, 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 13–17, 218, G-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|pp= 101,103,104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of [[seafloor spreading]], new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through  [[subduction]], oceanic crust and lithosphere returns to the convecting mantle.&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the crust where new crust is created are called ''divergent boundaries'', those where it is brought back into the Earth are ''convergent boundaries'' and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as [[transform fault|transform]] (or conservative) boundaries&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earthquakes]] result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the Earth as part of subduction.&lt;ref name="smith subduction"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 325–26, 329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- A diagram is needed here. --&gt;
[[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the [[asthenosphere]] melts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surface—giving birth to volcanoes.&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smith subduction" /&gt;

== Earth's atmosphere ==
{{Main article|Atmosphere of Earth}}
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[magnetosphere]] shields the surface of Earth from the charged particles of the [[solar wind]].&lt;!---It is compressed on the day (Sun) side due to the force of the arriving particles, and extended on the night side.---&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(''image not to scale.'')]]
The [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]] are the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% [[nitrogen]], 20.9% [[oxygen]], and 0.92% [[argon]]. 75% of the gases in the atmosphere are located within the troposphere, the bottom-most layer. The remaining one percent of the atmosphere (all but the nitrogen, oxygen, and argon) contains small amounts of other gases including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water vapors.&lt;ref name="adams atmosphere"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water vapors and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allow the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through a phenomenon called the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water and support life. In addition to storing heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding some of the Earth's surface from [[cosmic rays]]—of which are often incorrectly thought to be deflected by the [[magnetic field]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parker|first=Eugene|title=Shielding Space|publisher=Scientific American|date=March 2006 |url=https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field—created by the internal motions of the core—produces the [[magnetosphere]] which protects the Earth's atmosphere from the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Earth is [[Age of the earth|4.5 billion]] years old,&lt;ref name="age earth"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere.

== Earth's magnetic field ==
An [[electromagnet]] is a magnet that is created by an electric current.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 576}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth has a solid iron [[Earth core|inner core]] surrounded by fluid [[outer core]] that convects;&lt;ref name="oldroyd core" /&gt; therefore, the Earth is an [[electromagnet]]. The motion of fluid convection [[dynamo theory|sustains]] the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="oldroyd core"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|p= 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf |title=Dynamo Theory and Earth's Magnetic Field. |author=Demorest, Paul |date=2001-05-21 |accessdate=2007-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221094040/http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
Methodologies vary depending on the nature of the subjects being studied. Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or go to many of the world's most exotic locations to study Earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or hot spot island chains).

A foundational idea within the study Earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism. Uniformitarianism dictates that "ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study Earth's history to apply knowledge of how Earth processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout deep history.

== Earth's spheres ==
{{Nature timeline}}
Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]];&lt;ref name="wheeling"&gt;[http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html Earth's Spheres] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831022404/http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html |date=August 31, 2007 }}. ©1997–2000. Wheeling Jesuit University/NASA Classroom of the Future. Retrieved November 11, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; these correspond to [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[water]], [[air]] and [[life]]. Also included by some are the [[cryosphere]] (corresponding to [[ice]]) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere and the [[pedosphere]] (corresponding to [[soil]]) as an active and intermixed sphere.

An '''engineer's degree''' is an advanced [[academic degree]] in [[engineering]] that is conferred in [[Europe]], some countries of [[Latin America]], North Africa and a few institutions in the [[United States]].

In the [[United States]], the engineer's degree is at a more advanced level than a standard US master's degree. It may include a graduate thesis, and [[dissertation]] at the level of the doctorates such as the Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=49–58|publisher=The [[UNESCO]] Press|location=Paris|date=1974|author=Antoly I. Bologomov|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED107515.pdf|title=Comparability of Engineering Courses and Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==
=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the engineer's degree normally requires a further year of study beyond a master's degree, or two years from a bachelor's degree, and often includes a requirement for a research thesis.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/masters/engineers-degree/|title=Engineer’s degree|publisher=MIT|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aa.stanford.edu/academics/graduate-programs/degree-engineer-post-ms-program|publisher=Stanford University|title=Degree of Engineer — Post MS Program|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCU&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/graduate/engineers-degree/|title=Engineer's degree|publisher=Santa Clara University|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] the thesis is required to be "more extensive and complete in problem scope and solution than a master's thesis", although "not necessarily meeting the test of original research and contribution to fundamental knowledge that is applied to Ph.D. dissertations".&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://my.nps.edu/web/ece/engineer-degree|title= Electrical Engineer Degree Program|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], the engineer degree is explicitly set at the level of the preliminary Ph.D. examination, i.e. not including the research or thesis components.&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/ucla-catalog2017-85.html|title=UCLA General Catalog 2017-18|at=Engineer Degree|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of degrees and the specific requirements differ considerably between institutions and between specialties within an institution. In the past, it was not uncommon for a would-be engineer to earn an engineering degree as their first and only college degree. But since [[World War II]] this has fallen out of favor, and it becomes continually more difficult to find a school that offers this option.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A degree with some form of the word ''engineer'' or ''engineering'' in the title is not necessarily an engineer's degree. Particularly, a "[[Master of Engineering]]" (M.Eng.) or "[[Bachelor of Engineering]]" (B.Eng.) degree is ''not'' an Engineer's degree, nor is any other bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Rather, the engineer's degree is in a category of its own. For example, a student with a B.S. and M.S. in [[electrical engineering]] might next earn the degree ''Electrical Engineer''. The person would then have a B.S. in E.E., a M.S. in E.E., and an E.E. degree. The former two are degrees in engineering, and only the latter degree is actually an engineer's degree.

=== Canada ===
Through the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers|Engineers Canada]] accredits Canadian undergraduate engineering programs that meet the standards of the profession. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to pursue further training towards becoming a licensed professional engineer in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_accreditation.cfm|title=Accreditation Resources|work=Engineers Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[P.Eng]] license is the ultimate qualification for the practicing professional engineering in Canada.

In Canada, A CEAB-accredited engineer degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a P.Eng ([[professional engineer]]) anywhere in Canada, and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured.&lt;ref name="apegm.mb.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202014748/http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A graduate of a non-CEAB-accredited program must demonstrate that his or her education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.&lt;ref name="apegm.mb.ca"/&gt;

== Latin America ==
In [[Latin America]], a degree or title of "Ingeniero" is awarded after completing five years of college.  This may be translated as "Engineer", however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country's educational system, and can be compared to a six-year post-master's degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state [[licence]] to legally practice in the field, or a professional certification outside the academic environment.

=== Mexico ===
{{see also|Licentiate (degree)#Mexico}}
In [[Mexico]], the educational system follows closely that of the [[United States]]. University education is structured in three cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''Maestría'' (master's degree), and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate).

The ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer) degree is awarded depending on the nature of the studies pursued. In order to be called an Engineer, one must have passed certain courses related to engineering and been awarded a professional [[credential]] (''cédula profesional'') that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional [[credential]] (''cédula profesional'') in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities, and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceead.org.mx/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=137818|title=Ley del Ejercicio Profesional|last=LA H. XLIX LEGISLATURA DEL ESTADO DE MEXICO|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For engineering, completing all taught courses of a ''Licenciatura'' does not automatically award the graduate the title and [[licence]] of ''Ingeniero''; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix ''Ingeniería'' attached to the name of the degree. It is the case that many people finish all courses in an engineering program, they obtain the [[diploma]] and title of Engineer, and the professional credential, after getting their professional [[credential]] (''cédula profesional'').

Degrees in engineering require four to five years to complete. After this, the graduate may enroll in a postgraduate program, such as a [[master's degree]], or in exceptional cases, directly into a [[doctoral degree]].

=== Chile ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In Chile, the educational system does not strictly follow that of the United States. University education is structured in four cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''Título Profesional'' (professional title), ''Magíster'' (master's degree) and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate or Ph.D).

In this case, the ''engineer'' status is a general denomination for a person who has a professional title in engineering (Título Profesional en Ingeniería). The title is obtained after six years of study; in this way including a bachelor's degree in science, which is obtained after four years of study.

As in other countries, students only need to obtain the bachelor's degree to enter a master's degree or doctoral program, which commonly take two and three years, respectively. Since a professional title will take six years of study, after obtaining this title the graduate can enroll directly into a [[doctoral degree]]. In this manner, the international academic equivalence of a professional title in Chile corresponds to a six-year post-master's degree.

== Europe (prior to the Bologna Process) ==
prior to the [[Bologna Process]], In most countries of [[continental Europe]], universities specializing in technical fields have traditionally awarded their students an engineer's degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing [[secondary education]], and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a [[doctorate]].

Following German custom in higher education, the engineer's degree is called ''[[Diplom]]''. In addition to [[Germany]] itself, this system was common in states like [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[R. Macedonia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Vietnam]].

=== Germany and Austria ===

In [[German language|German]], the traditional engineer's degree is called ''Diplom-Ingenieur''. This supersedes Ing. (Grad) the old form in Germany. (''Dipl.-Ing.'', in Austria also ''DI'') . This degree is generally equivalent to a [[Master's degree]], which is not to be confused with the old ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' degree. Most programs that used to lead to a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' degree lead to master's degrees today, as the ''Diplom-Ingenieur'' as an academic title is phased out because of the [[Bologna Process]]. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' with the newly introduced M.Sc. Degrees.

The German "Universities of Applied Sciences" (''[[Fachhochschule]]'') award the traditional engineering degree ''Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)'' (''Dipl.-Ing. (FH)''). A requirement for the degree is to write a ''[[Diplom]]'' [[thesis]]. This is also being modified by the [[Bologna Process]], as bachelor's and master's degrees from a University of Applied Sciences are equal to degrees from a ''traditional'' university.&lt;ref&gt;Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 07.02.2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Universities of Applied Sciences are phased out and they are changed to universities with own faculties and research institutes. These universities are strongly focused on fields like computer science, engineering or business schools. Subjects like Law or Human Medicine etc. which requires a ''Staatsexamen'' (state exam) can only be studied at ''traditional'' universities. Since 2009, most Universities in Germany offer bachelor's degree programmes (B.Sc., B.Eng., M.Sc., M.Eng, M.C.A. and others) and Master programmes that lead to the academic degree Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others.

In Austria there also exists the ''Ingenieur'' (respectively ''Ing.''). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of a so-called ''HTL'' (''Höhere Technische Lehranstalt'') which is a high school with a very technical background. Graduates of these schools are allowed to start their studies at universities. The title ''Ingenieur (Ing.)'' could only be obtained after proof of at least three years of practice, which requires higher technical knowledge in the field of education.

With a revision of the Austrian engineer’s law (Ingenieurgesetz 2017&lt;ref&gt;Ingenieurgesetz 2017 [https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&amp;Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2017_I_23 BGBl. I Nr. 23/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;) in May 2017, the requirements of the conferment of the degree were tightened. Next to the existing requirements for graduation from a technical high school (HTL) and a verifiable practical experience of three years, the replicant must take an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. As a result, the degree was included in the [[National Qualifications Framework]] on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor's degree. The engineering degree does not meet the requirements to enter a master's program in Austria.

=== France ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[France]], the engineer's degree is called ''[[Diplôme d'Ingénieur]]'' (often abbreviated as ''Dipl. Ing.''), which is a postgraduate engineering degree (recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States) delivered primarily by the French engineering [[Grandes Ecoles]] while the academic title is ''Ingénieur Diplômé'' (''ID''; Graduate Engineer) but is never used before the holder's name. While the title "Ingénieur" is unregulated and can be used even without an academic degree, anyone misusing the title "Ingénieur Diplomé" is liable for a fine and prison sentence.

The engineer's degree in France is obtained after five to six years of engineering studies after the [[Baccalauréat]] (high school diploma). The degree deliverance is regulated by the [[Commission des titres d'ingénieur]] (CTI) independent organism. The CTI mandates the French engineering schools (mainly [[Grandes Écoles]]) to deliver the ''Diplôme d'Ingénieur''. This degree has been officially considered as a European [[Master's Degree]] since the [[Bologna Process]].

After the French ''Baccalaureat'', about top 10 per cent of the students are accepted in "[[Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles]]" (intensive preparatory classes), where mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and technology disciplines are taught. After two years of study in preparatory classes, students must take competitive national examinations (written and oral) in order to compete for a place in the engineering [[Grandes Ecoles]].

Otherwise, the ''Diplôme d'Ingénieur'' can be also delivered by engineering faculties affiliated to a French public university, but the curriculum must be accredited by the CTI. Admission to such programs is based on continuous assessments rather than a nationwide competitive examination.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
The highest engineer qualification in the UK and Ireland is the [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] (C.Eng) which is a minimum of eight years but usually 12 years of education, training and professional peer reviewed practice process. Chartered Engineer is a terminal qualification. The academic qualification. which is minimum for gaining chartership in engineering is the Master of Engineering (MEng) or BEng plus MSc or MA in addition to four to six years peer-reviewed professional practice including a project report / thesis. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales this is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland), or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng, and may then allow a transfer to the MEng.

The [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] have established a recognized route to higher engineering qualifications with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). CGLI has align the Graduate Diploma (level 6) and Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) with the registration requirements for Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer status. The Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng and its Postgraduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British MEng.
UK Professional institutions have delegated authority from the engineering council to approve university degrees and also award the Chartered Engineer qualification in a specific discipline.  For example, IMechE awards C.Eng, MIMechE, ICE awards CEng, MICE, and IET awards CEng, MIET.

Engineers who have been awarded a BEng(Ordinary) or BEng(Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the workplace are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng), if the qualification has been accepted for this classification, by the engineering council. If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of postgraduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of four to eight years in practice for a total of eight to 12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured postgraduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development programme administered by IMechE enables the engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.[5]

Chartered Engineer and [[Incorporated Engineer]] titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are similar but not equivalent to North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. The UK and North American system of regulating engineering professional qualifications is very different and not equivalent. In the US and Canada engineering is a regulated profession in terms of practice and enforced by law and licensing. It is more than the regulation of engineering titles—like the UK. This means that many UK chartered Engineers who are grandfathered to the title or are non degree holders (HNC/HND) will not be recognized formally as professional engineers in Canada and US. There is strict interpretation of qualifications and education because there are legal implications. There is no back door entry or experiential exemption from the formal academic requirements. This is simply because of the legal legislation on practice. This licensed based engineering governance legal framework does not exist in the UK.

MIET-Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology is recognised as regulated engineering profession by virtue of the Statutory Instruments n.2007/2781-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2007-Directive European Union 2005/36/EC. http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?fuseaction=profession.regProfs&amp;profId=6361&amp;mode=desc&amp;cId=0&amp;quid=3

This meaning retains the 19th century idea that "real" engineers were military personnel, while "other" engineers were civilians.

=== Spain ===
The situation in [[Spain]] is very similar to France but without the ''[[grandes écoles]]'' and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the ''Proyecto de Fin de Carrera'' (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer), or other degree called ''Ingeniero Técnico'' (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field. A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/a5.pdf "National systems of engineering education, QA and accreditation"], TREE – Teaching and Research in Engineering in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In Portugal, Engineer ({{lang-pt|engenheiro}}, feminine: ''engenheira'', abrev.: ''eng.'') is a professional degree reserved for the effective members of the [[Ordem dos Engenheiros|Portuguese Institution of the Engineers (OE, ''Ordem dos Engenheiros'')]] and [[Ordem dos Engenheiros Técnicos|Portuguese Institution of Technical Engineers (OET, ''Ordem dos Engenheiros Técnicos'')]]. There is not an academic degree of ''engenheiro'', despite the title being used informally to refer to anyone who has a degree in engineering, even a nonmember of the OE or OET.

Until the [[Bologna Process]], having a ''licenciado'' (five-year) degree in engineering was a previous condition to be able to be admitted to the OE. Presently, admission to the OE requires a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' (3 years) degree or a ''mestre'' (five-year) master in engineering. OE members holders of a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' degree are now classified as E1 grade engineers, while holders of a pre-Bologna ''licenciado'' or a ''mestre'' are classified as E2 grade engineers.

=== Italy ===
In [[Italy]] until 2001 there were two degrees: a three-year ''diploma in ingegneria'' (BEng level, title abbrev. "dipl. ing.") and a five-year ''laurea in ingegneria'' (MEng level, title abbrev. "ing."). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor's level is called ''laurea'' (abbrev. "L") and master's degree level is called ''laurea specialistica'' or ''laurea magistrale'' (abbrev. "LS"). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea in ingegneria'' (BEng level) and the title of ''dottore in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. "dott.") can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea magistrale in ingegneria'' (MEng level) and the title of ''dottore magistrale in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. "dott.") can be obtained. After a "state exam" you become "Ingegnere" (abbrev. Ing).&lt;ref&gt;In Italy the state accreditation system, degrees and titles are regulated by state law. See regulations (in Italian) [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm0804l.htm DM 4 Agosto 2000] for "laurea" (bachelor) and [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm001128.htm DM 28 Novembre 2000] for "laurea specialistica" (BEng(Hon)-master). Chartered professions (including engineering) are regulated by state law 328/01 [http://www.miur.it/regolame/2001/professioniregolam/AgrArch/DPR328_2001.htm ("D.P.R. 5 giugno 2001, n. 328")].
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
In Greece, the title of "Engineer" is awarded by two parallel and complementary parts of public higher education.

The title "Diplomate (Graduated) Engineer" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course (300 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]], [[ISCED]] 7) at a University or a Technical University. The Diploma is equivalent to an Integrated master's degree. (Institutions have been issuing certificates of equivalence; officially recognized by the Greek legislation since August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fme.aegean.gr/sites/default/files/docs/2017/fek114.pdf|title=Government's Gazette. Law 4485/2017 ΦΕΚ Α 114 / Article 46 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of "Certified Engineer" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies, equivalent to Honours bachelor's degree (240 ECTS, ISCED 6), at a Technological Educational Institute - T.E.I.

The newly founded University of Western Attica, in 2018, (after merging the former TEI of Athens and Piraeus) is the only University to award degrees, and not diplomas, equivalent to bachelor's degree (240 ECTS, ISCED 6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwa.gr/en/feng/|title=Faculty of Engineering, UniWA |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In Belgium, there are three types of engineering degrees :
* "Burgerlijk Ingenieur" /"Ingénieur civil" or "Master of Science in Engineering" (abbrev. "ir.") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.)
* "Bio-ingenieur"/ "Bioingénieur" or "Master of Science in Bioscience Engineering" (abbrev. "ir.") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.)
* "Industrieel Ingenieur" or "Master of Science in Engineering Technology" (abbrev. "Ing.") - five years study in the Walloon region (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.) Four years of study in Flanders ( 3 BSc. + 1 MSc.).

Names are traditionally prefixed with the ir. and/ or Ing. titles, although this practice is not as widespread as in the Netherlands. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by law.
Belgium is particularly noteworthy as having a system under which demands made on students of engineering are particularly severe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

=== The Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]], somebody holding an engineer's degree is an ''ingenieur''. There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations:
* ''ir.'' is obtained by university graduates (''Wetenschappelijk onderwijs'' or WO). It is the highest engineer qualification. - five years study (3 B.Sc. + 2 M.Sc.)
* ''ing.'' is obtained by graduates from polytechnics (''hoger beroeps onderwijs'' or HBO). - four years study (4 B.Eng. or B.ASc.)

Names are traditionally prefixed with the ''ir.'' or ''ing.'' titles. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_07-05-2013 "Artikel 435 lid 3 Wetboek van strafrecht"] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Bologna agreement the titles are increasingly interchanged with the English-language degrees (B.Sc., BBE, M.Sc., etc.).

Completion of Dutch engineering qualifications have historically demanded a lot of effort. On average the five-year course takes seven years to finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studenten.net/studieleven/nieuws/17783/uitwonende_studenten_doen_langer_over_studie "Opleidingen met een zogenoemd 'zwaar wiskundig profiel' als Bouwkunde, Econometrie en Elektrotechniek zorgen voor de meeste vertraging bij wo-studenten"] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/onderwijs/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2010/2010-3078-wm.htm "Vooral bij techniek, industrie en bouwkunde is de wo-studieduur veel langer"] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the engineer's degree is called ''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'' and abbreviated ''dipl.ins.'', ''DI'' or ''M.Sc.(Tech.)''. It is possible to obtain after five years of studying, or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' (''B.Sc.(Tech.)'') degree.

The degree of ''[[insinööri (AMK)]]'' is a bachelor's degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (''[[ammattikorkeakoulu]]''), similar to a German ''[[Fachhochschule]]'', but it is not interchangeable with the academic ''tekniikan kandidaatti''.

Due to the Bologna process, a new master's degree called ''insinööri (ylempi AMK)'' or "engineer (higher amk)" has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of ''insinööri (AMK)'' and further studies.

=== Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer's degree is called ''inżynier'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), ''inžinier'' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]) or ''inženýr'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]), and the abbreviation is ''inż.'' in [[Poland]], and ''Ing.'' in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], which may be written before the person's name.

In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the degree of ''Ing.'' is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]''.

In [[Poland]], the degree of ''inżynier'' is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the ''[[licencjat]]'' in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A ''magister inżynier'' (abbreviated ''mgr inż.'') refers to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]'', after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were "inżynier" studies that lasted for four years, and afterward one could obtain the "magister" title in two years of studies—the total of six years resulted in two degrees, "magister" and "inżynier". In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the "magister inżynier" five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the "magister inżynier" (mgr inż. before the name) was the equivalent degree with "inżynier" designating the professional level and "magister" designating the academic level.
After the [[Bologna process]] the first level is "inżynier," obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before, and "masters" after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that "magister inżynier" be made a basis for professional rights.

=== Belarus and Ukraine ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], the degree is ''спеціаліст інженер'' (specialist inzhener), a first degree after five years of study.

=== Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Ex-Yugoslavia ===
In [[Croatia]], the old system included the engineer's degrees ''diplomirani inženjer'' (abbr. ''dipl.ing.'') which was awarded by university faculties, and a lower ranked engineer's degree ''inženjer'' (abbr. ''ing.'') which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the [[Netherlands]]. The old ''dipl.ing.'' degree could later be upgraded to a ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr.'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and then a ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr.'', [[Doctorate]]). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the abbreviation is ''dipl.inž''.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Klajn, Rečnik jezičkih nedoumica (NOLIT, Beograd)&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian titles of ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr'', [[Doctorate]]) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end.

=== Romania ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[Romania]] followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called ''Diploma de inginer'', and the graduate was called a ''Inginer diplomat''. These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master(M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (''examen de diploma''). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called ''Diploma de Sub-inginer'' which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the [[Bologna process]], the graduates obtain the ''Inginer licentiat'' degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the ''Inginer Master'' degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program.

== Europe (according to the Bologna Process) ==
{{main|Bologna process}}

Following the introduction of the [[Bologna process]], universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year [[bachelor's degree]], a one to two-year [[master's degree]], and a [[doctoral degree]]. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the [[bachelor's degree]] (''baccalaureus'', three to four years), and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer's degree or a [[master's degree]] (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single 'integrated' degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).  But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor's) and second (master's) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice|date= 2015|title=The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report|publisher= Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/Publications:The_European_Higher_Education_Area_in_2015:_Bologna_Process_Implementation_Report|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year ''Civilingenjör'' in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor's and master's degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the ''civilingenjör'' degree.

In France, engineering is taught in ''écoles d’ingénieurs'', which are part of the French ''[[grandes écoles]]'' system. Since the [[Bologna Process]], the ''Diplôme d’Ingénieur'' is officially considered to be at the level of a European master's degree.

== Russia ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
As of 2012 in [[Russia]], following degrees correspond to the "engineer's degree" in the sense of this article:
* '''Инженер''' - "engineer", which was formerly awarded after four, five, six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as "mining engineer" or "systems engineer".
* '''Инженер по специальности''' - "engineer at specialty" (where specialty's name is mentioned), currently awarded after five or six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as "engineer-ecologist at specialty Rational usage of natural resources and protection of the environment"
* '''Инженер-исследователь по специальности''' - "engineer-researcher at specialty" (where specialty's name is mentioned), was formerly awarded after seven years of study
* '''Бакалавр по направлению''' - "bachelor at area" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after four years of study, and "area" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former "specialties"
* '''Магистр по направлению''' - "magister (master) at area" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after two years of study to those already having any higher-education degree, and "area" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former "specialties"
Anything but "bachelor" is considered "second-level" higher education and gives access to postgraduate education for "candidate of sciences" degree, "bachelor" is considered "first-level" higher education degree and gives access to study for master's (magister) degree.

Post-graduate scientific degrees in engineering areas include '''кандидат технических наук''' - "candidate of technical sciences" and '''доктор технических наук''' - "doctor of technical sciences". Sometimes in English translations "...of technical sciences" is exchanged for "...of engineering".

== Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, engineering qualifications include the following:

* '''BE (Bachelor of Engineering)''' or '''BS/BSc Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering)''' - four years' duration.

* '''ME (Master of Engineering)''' or '''MS/MSc Engineering (Master of Science in Engineering)''' - 1.5 to 2 years' duration.

* '''PhD (Engineering)''' - minimum three years' duration.

[[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession. PEC is a full signatory of [[Washington Accord]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/&lt;/ref&gt; and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieagreements.org/agreements/ipea/members/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkey ==
In [[Turkey]] typical length of study for bachelor's degree at any engineering program is four years. Owner of a valid degree which is given by an engineering faculty at Turkish universities, can be called ''Mühendis'', meaning "Engineers". The ''"Mühendis"'' title is limited by law to people with a valid engineering degree, and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal. (Law No: 3458 ''Law about Engineers and Architects 28.06.1938'' Publish no:3945) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmmob.org.tr/hukuk/yasal-cerceve/3458-sayili-muhendislik-ve-mimarlik-hakkinda-kanun|title=3458 Sayılı Mühendislik ve Mimarlık Hakkında Kanun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may earn a master's degree in the same field as the bachelor's and be called as ''"Yüksek Mühendis"'' (meaning Higher Engineer).

== Bangladesh ==
In [[Bangladesh]], the engineering degree is referred to as B.Sc. Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) at the undergraduate level. Likewise, a master's degree is referred to as Master of Engineering (M.Eng) and Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Engg). At the undergraduate level, the course takes four years whereas a master's degree usually takes 1.5 years. Graduated engineers who are members of [[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]] are legally and formally allowed to use 'Engr.' before their names.

== India ==
The engineering courses in India are regulated and set up under the aegis of the [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

In India, engineering qualifications include the following:
* '''Bachelor's degrees''' (four years after class 12 and three years after [[Diploma in Engineering]]): BE ([[Bachelor of Engineering]]) and BTech ([[Bachelor of Technology]]). Both are same. Admission is usually through an engineering entrance examination.

* '''Master's degrees''' (two or more years after BE and BTech): ME ([[Master of Engineering]]), MTech ([[Master of Technology]]) and MSc (Eng) ([[Master of Science in Engineering]]). Admission usually requires qualification in the [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] or some work experience in an engineering field. The MTech and ME degrees are same and of two years' duration. MTech/ME usually has coursework in the first year and a project in the second year. The MSc (Eng) degree is usually research oriented and may requires two or more years to complete.

* '''Doctoral degrees''' (three to five years): PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). Admission requirements vary across universities but usually include a master's degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in engineering with an exceptionally good academic record.

== Vietnam ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[Vietnam]], The degree is ''Bằng kỹ sư'' (specialist kỹ sư), a first degree after five years of study. The Ministry of Education of Vietnam has also issued separate regulation for the naming of degrees not in accordance with international regulation. The Engineer's degree is named "[[The Degree of Engineer]]" in the degree (e.g. ''The Degree of Engineer in Information Technology''). The degree of engineer is ranked at the same academic level as a bachelor's degree or master's degree, and is often known literally as an "engineer diploma" (abbreviated Dipl.-Ing. or DI).

'''Flux balance analysis''' ('''FBA''') is a mathematical method for simulating metabolism in genome-scale reconstructions of [[metabolic network]]s. In comparison to traditional methods of modeling, FBA is less intensive in terms of the input data required for constructing the model. Simulations performed using FBA are computationally inexpensive and can calculate steady-state metabolic fluxes for large models (over 2000 reactions) in a few seconds on modern personal computers.

[[File:Results of FBA.png|right|thumb|The results of FBA on a prepared metabolic network of the top six reactions of [[glycolysis]]. The predicted flux through each reaction is proportional to the width of the line. Objective function in red, constraints on alpha-D-glucose and beta-D-glucose import represented as red bars.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

FBA finds applications in [[bioprocess engineering]] to systematically identify modifications to the metabolic networks of microbes used in fermentation processes that improve product yields of industrially important chemicals such as ethanol and succinic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ranganathan | first1 = Sridhar | last2 = Suthers | first2 = Patrick F. | last3 = Maranas | first3 = Costas D. | year = 2010 | title = OptForce: An Optimization Procedure for Identifying All Genetic Manipulations Leading to Targeted Overproductions | url = | journal = PLoS Comput Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 4| page = e1000744 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000744 | pmid = 20419153 | pmc = 2855329 | bibcode = 2010PLSCB...6E0744R }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used for the identification of putative drug targets in cancer &lt;ref name="genome_scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, NE|author2=Abdel-Haleem, AM|title=The evolution of genome-scale models of cancer metabolism|journal=Front.

The thickness of the arrows is proportional to the flux through the reaction.

FBA formalizes the system of equations describing the concentration changes in a metabolic network as the dot product of a matrix of the stoichiometric coefficients (the stoichiometric matrix '''S''') and the vector '''v''' of the unsolved fluxes. The right-hand side of the dot product is a vector of zeros representing the system at [[steady state]]. [[Linear programming]] is then used to calculate a solution of fluxes corresponding to the steady state.

==History==

Some of the earliest work in FBA dates back to the early 1980s. Papoutsakis&lt;ref name="Papoutsakis, ET. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papoutsakis | first1 = ET | year = 1984 | title = Equations and calculations for fermentations of butyric acid bacteria | url = | journal = Biotech Bioeng | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 174–187 | doi=10.1002/bit.260260210| pmid = 18551704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that it was possible to construct flux balance equations using a metabolic map. It was Watson,&lt;ref name="Watson, MR. 1984"&gt;Watson MR (1984) Metabolic maps for the Apple II. 12, 1093-1094&lt;/ref&gt; however, who first introduced the idea of using linear programming and an objective function to solve for the fluxes in a pathway. The first significant study was subsequently published by Fell and Small,&lt;ref name="Fell DA and Small JR. 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fell | first1 = DA | last2 = Small | first2 = JR | year = 1986 | title = Fat synthesis in adipose tissue.

FBA is not computationally intensive, taking on the order of seconds to calculate optimal fluxes for biomass production for a typical network (around 2000 reactions). This means that the effect of deleting reactions from the network and/or changing flux constraints can be sensibly modelled on a single computer.

===Gene/reaction deletion and perturbation studies===

====Single reaction deletion====
A frequently used technique to search a metabolic network for reactions that are particularly critical to the production of biomass. By removing each reaction in a network in turn and measuring the predicted flux through the biomass function, each reaction can be classified as either essential (if the flux through the biomass function is substantially reduced) or non-essential (if the flux through the biomass function is unchanged or only slightly reduced).

====Pairwise reaction deletion====
Pairwise reaction deletion of all possible pairs of reactions is useful when looking for drug targets, as it allows the simulation of multi-target treatments, either by a single drug with multiple targets or by drug combinations. Double deletion studies can also quantify the synthetic lethal interactions between different pathways providing a measure of the contribution of the pathway to overall network robustness.

==== Single and multiple gene deletions====
Genes are connected to enzyme-catalyzed reactions by [[Boolean expression]]s known as Gene-Protein-Reaction expressions (GPR). Typically a GPR takes the form (Gene A AND Gene B) to indicate that the products of genes A and B are protein sub-units that assemble to form the complete protein and therefore the absence of either would result in deletion of the reaction. On the other hand, if the GPR is (Gene A OR Gene B) it implies that the products of genes A and B are [[isozymes]].

Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the effect of single or multiple gene deletions by evaluation of the GPR as a Boolean expression. If the GPR evaluates to '''false''', the reaction is constrained to zero in the model prior to performing FBA. Thus gene knockouts can be simulated using FBA.

====Interpretation of gene and reaction deletion results====
The utility of reaction inhibition and deletion analyses becomes most apparent if a gene-protein-reaction matrix has been assembled for the network being studied with FBA. The gene-protein-reaction matrix is a binary matrix connecting genes with the proteins made from them. Using this matrix, reaction essentiality can be converted into gene essentiality indicating the gene defects which may cause a certain disease phenotype or the proteins/enzymes which are essential (and thus what enzymes are the most promising drug targets in pathogens). However, the gene-protein-reaction matrix does not specify the Boolean relationship between genes with respect to the enzyme, instead it merely indicates an association between them. Therefore, it should be used only if the Boolean GPR expression is unavailable.

====Reaction inhibition====
The effect of inhibiting a reaction, rather than removing it entirely, can be simulated in FBA by restricting the allowed flux through it. The effect of an inhibition can be classified as lethal or non-lethal by applying the same criteria as in the case of a deletion where a suitable threshold is used to distinguish “substantially reduced” from “slightly reduced”. Generally the choice of threshold is arbitrary but a reasonable estimate can be obtained from growth experiments where the simulated inhibitions/deletions are actually performed and growth rate is measured.

====Growth media optimization====
To design optimal growth media with respect to enhanced growth rates or useful by-product secretion, it is possible to use a method known as Phenotypic Phase Plane analysis. PhPP involves applying FBA repeatedly on the model while co-varying the nutrient uptake constraints and observing the value of the objective function (or by-product fluxes). PhPP makes it possible to find the optimal combination of nutrients that favor a particular phenotype or a mode of metabolism resulting in higher growth rates or secretion of industrially useful by-products. The predicted growth rates of bacteria in varying media have been shown to correlate well with experimental results.&lt;ref name="Edwards, J. 2001" /&gt; as well as to define precise minimal media for the culture of ''Salmonella typhimurium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raghunathan | first1 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Constraint-based analysis of metabolic capacity of ''Salmonella typhimurium'' during host-pathogen interaction | url = | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 38 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-3-38 | pmid=19356237 | pmc=2678070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description==

In contrast to the traditionally followed approach of metabolic modeling using coupled [[ordinary differential equations]], flux balance analysis requires very little information in terms of the enzyme kinetic parameters and concentration of metabolites in the system. It achieves this by making two assumptions, [[steady state]] and optimality. The first assumption is that the modeled system has entered a steady state, where the metabolite concentrations no longer change, i.e. in each metabolite node the producing and consuming fluxes cancel each other out. The second assumption is that the organism has been optimized through evolution for some biological goal, such as optimal growth or conservation of resources. The steady-state assumption reduces the system to a set of linear equations, which is then solved to find a flux distribution that satisfies the steady-state condition subject to the stoichiometry constraints while maximizing the value of a pseudo-reaction (the objective function) representing the conversion of biomass precursors into biomass.

The steady-state assumption dates to the ideas of [[material balance]] developed to model the growth of microbial cells in fermenters in bioprocess engineering. During microbial growth, a substrate consisting of a complex mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen sources along with trace elements are consumed to generate biomass.
The material balance model for this process becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} + \mathrm{Accumulation} &lt;/math&gt;

If we consider the system of microbial cells to be at steady state then we may set the accumulation term to zero and reduce the material balance equations to simple algebraic equations. In such a system, substrate becomes the input to the system which is consumed and biomass is produced becoming the output from the system. The material balance may then be represented as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} - \mathrm{Output} = \mathrm{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, the algebraic equations can be represented as a dot product of a matrix of coefficients and a vector of the unknowns. Since the steady-state assumption puts the accumulation term to zero. The system can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt; \qquad A \cdot\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Extending this idea to metabolic networks, it is possible to represent a metabolic network as a stoichiometry balanced set of equations. Moving to the matrix formalism, we can represent the equations as the dot product of a matrix of stoichiometry coefficients (stoichiometric matrix &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) and the vector of fluxes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; as the unknowns and set the right hand side to 0 implying the steady state.

: &lt;math&gt; \qquad S \cdot\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Metabolic networks typically have more reactions than metabolites and this gives an under-determined system of linear equations containing more variables than equations. The standard approach to solve such under-determined systems is to apply [[linear programming]].

Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in [[canonical form]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{maximize} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x}\\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; A \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b} \\
&amp; \text{and} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{x} \ge \mathbf{0}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''x''' represents the vector of variables (to be determined), '''c''' and '''b''' are [[vector space|vectors]] of (known) coefficients, ''A'' is a (known) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix transpose]]. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the ''objective function'' ('''c'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''x''' in this case). The inequalities ''A'''''x'''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;'''b''' are the constraints which specify a [[convex polytope]] over which the objective function is to be optimized.

Linear Programming requires the definition of an objective function. The optimal solution to the LP problem is considered to be the solution which maximizes or minimizes the value of the objective function depending on the case in point. In the case of flux balance analysis, the objective function '''Z''' for the LP is often defined as biomass production. Biomass production is simulated by an equation representing a lumped reaction that converts various biomass precursors into one unit of biomass.

Therefore, the canonical form of a Flux Balance Analysis problem would be:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{maximize} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{v}\\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; S \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
&amp; \text{and} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{lower bound} \le \mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{upper bound}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; represents the vector of fluxes (to be determined), &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the ''objective function'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in this case). The inequalities &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{lower bound} \le \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{upper bound}&lt;/math&gt; define, respectively, the minimal and the maximal rates of flux for every reaction corresponding to the columns of the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; matrix. These rates can be experimentally determined to constrain and improve the predictive accuracy of the model even further or they can be specified to an arbitrarily high value indicating no constraint on the flux through the reaction.

The main advantage of the flux balance approach is that it does not require any knowledge of the metabolite concentrations, or more importantly, the [[enzyme kinetics]] of the system; the homeostasis assumption precludes the need for knowledge of metabolite concentrations at any time as long as that quantity remains constant, and additionally it removes the need for specific [[Rate equation|rate laws]] since it assumes that at steady state, there is no change in the size of the metabolite pool in the system. The stoichiometric coefficients alone are sufficient for the mathematical maximization of a specific [[objective function]].

The objective function is essentially a measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, but one of the most common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the [[prokaryote]] ''[[E. coli]]'' when cultured in different conditions.&lt;ref name="Edwards, J. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = J. | last2 = Ibarra | first2 = R. | last3 = Palsson | first3 = B. | year = 2001 | title = ''In silico'' predictions of Escherichia coli metabolic capabilities are consistent with experimental data | doi = 10.1038/84379| journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 125–130 | pmid=11175725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass objective function. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some [[Biotechnology|biotechnologically]] relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a [[chemostat]] or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.

==Model preparation and refinement==
The key parts of model preparation are: creating a metabolic network without gaps, adding constraints to the model, and finally adding an objective function (often called the Biomass function), usually to simulate the growth of the organism being modelled.

===Metabolic network and software tools===
[[File:Prepare for FBA.png|right|thumb|The first six reactions in Glycolysis prepared for FBA through the addition of an objective function (red) and the import and export of nutrients (ATP, ADP, BDG, ADG) across the system boundary (dashed green line).{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

Metabolic networks can vary in scope from those describing a single [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]], up to the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] or [[organism]]. The main requirement of a metabolic network that forms the basis of an FBA-ready network is that it contains no gaps. This typically means that extensive manual curation is required, making the preparation of a metabolic network for flux-balance analysis a process that can take months or years.  However, recent advances such as so-called gap-filling methods can
reduce the required time to weeks or months.

Software packages for creation of FBA models include [http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/ Pathway Tools/MetaFlux],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karp | first1 = P.D. | last2 = Paley | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Krummenacker | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = Pathway Tools version 13.0: Integrated Software for Pathway/Genome Informatics and Systems Biology | url = | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 40–79 | doi=10.1093/bib/bbp043 | pmid=19955237 | pmc=2810111| arxiv = 1510.03964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latendresse | first1 = M. | last2 = Krummenacker | first2 = M. | last3 = Trupp | first3 = M. | last4 = Karp | first4 = P.D. | year = 2012| title = Construction and completion of flux balance models from pathway databases | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 28 | issue = 388–96| pages = 388–96 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr681 | pmid=22262672 | pmc=3268246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpheny,&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, C.H. et al.

Generally models are created in [[BioPAX]] or [[SBML]] format so that further analysis or visualization can take place in other software although this is not a requirement.

===Constraints===
A key part of FBA is the ability to add constraints to the flux rates of reactions within networks, forcing them to stay within a range of selected values. This lets the model more accurately simulate real metabolism. The constraints belong to two subsets from a biological perspective; boundary constraints that limit nutrient uptake/excretion and internal constraints that limit the flux through reactions within the organism.  In mathematical terms, the application of constraints can be considered to reduce the solution space of the FBA model. In addition to constraints applied at the edges of a metabolic network, constraints can be applied to reactions deep within the network. These constraints are usually simple; they may constrain the direction of a reaction due to energy considerations or constrain the maximum speed of a reaction due to the finite speed of all reactions in nature.

====Growth media constraints====
Organisms, and all other metabolic systems, require some input of nutrients. Typically the rate of uptake of nutrients is dictated by their availability (a nutrient that is not present cannot be absorbed), their concentration and diffusion constants (higher concentrations of quickly-diffusing metabolites are absorbed more quickly) and the method of absorption (such as [[active transport]] or [[facilitated diffusion]] versus simple diffusion).

If the rate of absorption (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate at the edges of a metabolic model. This ensures that nutrients that are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method of making sure that the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.

====Thermodynamical reaction constraints====
In principle, all reactions are reversible however in practice reactions often effectively occur in only one direction. This may be due to significantly higher concentration of reactants compared to the concentration of the products of the reaction. But more often it happens because the products of a reaction have a much lower free energy than the reactants and therefore the forward direction of a reaction is favored more.

For ideal reactions,

: &lt;math&gt; - \infty &lt;  v_i &lt; \infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

For certain reactions a thermodynamic constraint can be applied implying direction (in this case forward)

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;  v_i &lt; \infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

Realistically the flux through a reaction cannot be infinite (given that enzymes in the real system are finite) which implies that,

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; v_i &lt; v_\max \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Experimentally measured flux Constraints====

Certain flux rates can be measured experimentally (&lt;math&gt;v_{i,m}\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the fluxes within a metabolic model can be constrained, within some error (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt;), to ensure these known flux rates are accurately reproduced in the simulation.

: &lt;math&gt;v_{i,m} - \varepsilon &lt; v_i &lt;v_{i,m}+ \varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt;

Flux rates are most easily measured for nutrient uptake at the edge of the network. Measurements of internal fluxes is possible using radioactively labelled or NMR visible metabolites.

Constrained FBA-ready metabolic models can be analyzed using software such as the COBRA toolbox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = S.A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2007 | title = Quantitative prediction of cellular metabolism with constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 727–38 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.99| pmid = 17406635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(available implementations in [[MATLAB]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), SurreyFBA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gevorgyan | first1 = A | last2 = Bushell | first2 = ME | last3 = Avignone-Rossa | first3 = C | last4 = Kierzek | first4 = AM | year = 2011 | title = SurreyFBA: a command line tool and graphics user interface for constraint-based modeling of genome-scale metabolic reaction networks | url = | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 433–4 | pmid = 21148545 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq679}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the web-based FAME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boele | first1 = J | last2 = Olivier | first2 = BG | last3 = Teusink | first3 = B | year = 2012| title = FAME: the Flux Analysis and Modeling Environment | url = | journal = BMC Syst Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 8 | pmid = 22289213 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-8 | pmc=3317868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional software packages have been listed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/ | title=CoBRA Methods - Constraint-based analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review of all such software and their functionalities has been recently reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakshmanan|first=M|author2=Koh, G |author3=Chung, BK |author4= Lee, DY |title=Software applications for flux balance analysis.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Jan 2014|volume=15|issue=1|pages=108–22|pmid=23131418 |doi=10.1093/bib/bbs069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abcdeFBA/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective function===
FBA can give a large number of mathematically acceptable solutions to the steady-state problem &lt;math&gt;(S\vec v=0)&lt;/math&gt;. However  solutions of biological interest are the ones which produce the desired metabolites in the correct proportion. The objective function defines the proportion of these metabolites. For instance when modelling the growth of an organism the objective function is generally defined as biomass. Mathematically, it is a column in the stoichiometry matrix the entries of which place a "demand" or act as a "sink" for biosynthetic precursors such as fatty acids, amino acids and cell wall components which are present on the corresponding rows of the '''S''' matrix. These entries represent experimentally measured, dry weight proportions of cellular components. Therefore, this column becomes a lumped reaction that simulates growth and reproduction. Therefore, the accuracy of experimental measurements plays an essential role in the correct definition of the biomass function and makes the results of FBA biologically applicable by ensuring that the correct proportion of metabolites are produced by metabolism.

When modeling smaller networks the objective function can be changed accordingly. An example of this would be in the study of the [[Glycolysis|carbohydrate metabolism]] pathways where the objective function would probably be defined as a certain proportion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADH]] and thus simulate the production of high energy metabolites by this pathway.

====Optimization of the objective/biomass function====
Linear programming can be used to find a single optimal solution. The most common biological optimization goal for a whole-organism metabolic network would be to choose the flux vector &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; that maximises the flux through a biomass function composed of the constituent metabolites of the organism placed into the stoichiometric matrix and denoted &lt;math&gt;v_\textrm{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;v_b&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\max_{ \vec v}\ v_b  \qquad \textrm{s. t.} \qquad \mathbf{S} \, \vec v=0
&lt;/math&gt;

In the more general case any reaction can be defined and added to the biomass function with either the condition that it be maximised or minimised if a single “optimal” solution is desired. Alternatively, and in the most general case, a vector &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; can be introduced, which defines the weighted set of reactions that the linear programming model should aim to maximise or minimise,

: &lt;math&gt; 
\max_{ \vec v}\ \vec v \cdot \vec c \qquad \textrm{s. t.} \qquad \mathbf{S}\,\vec{v}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of there being only a single separate biomass function/reaction within the stoichiometric matrix &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; would simplify to all zeroes with a value of 1 (or any non-zero value) in the position corresponding to that biomass function. Where there were multiple separate objective functions &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; would simplify to all zeroes with weighted values in the positions corresponding to all objective functions.

=== Reducing the solution space – biological considerations for the system ===
The analysis of the null space of matrices is implemented in software packages specialized for matrix operations such as Matlab and Octave. Determination of the null space of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; tells us all the possible collections of flux vectors (or linear combinations thereof) that balance fluxes within the biological network.  The advantage of this approach becomes evident in biological systems which are described by differential equation systems with many unknowns. The velocities in the differential equations above - &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; - are dependent on the reaction rates of the underlying equations. The velocities are generally taken from the [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten kinetic theory]], which involves the kinetic parameters of the enzymes catalyzing the reactions and the concentration of the metabolites themselves. Isolating enzymes from living organisms and measuring their kinetic parameters is a difficult task, as is measuring the internal concentrations and diffusion constants of metabolites within an organism. Therefore, the differential equation approach to metabolic modeling is beyond the current scope of science for all but the most studied organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kotte | first1 = O. | last2 = Zaugg | first2 = J. B. | last3 = [[Matthias Heinemann|Heinemann]] | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Bacterial adaptation through distributed sensing of metabolic fluxes | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 355| page = 355 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2010.10 | pmid=20212527 | pmc=2858440}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBA avoids this impediment by applying the homeostatic assumption, which is a reasonably approximate description of biological systems.

Although FBA avoids that biological obstacle, the mathematical issue of a large solution space remains. FBA has a two-fold purpose. Accurately representing the biological limits of the system and returning the flux distribution closest to the natural fluxes within the target system/organism. Certain biological principles can help overcome the mathematical difficulties. While the stoichiometric matrix is almost always under-determined initially (meaning that the solution space to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S} \, \vec v = 0&lt;/math&gt; is very large), the size of the solution space can be reduced and be made more reflective of the biology of the problem through the application of certain constraints on the solutions.

==Extensions==

The success of FBA and the realization of its limitations has led to extensions that attempt to mediate the limitations of the technique.

===Flux variability analysis===
[[Image:FVA1TomForth.png|right|thumb|Visual and numerical representation of FVA on a complete network.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

The optimal solution to the flux-balance problem is rarely unique with many possible, and equally optimal, solutions existing. Flux variability analysis (FVA), built into some analysis software, returns the boundaries for the fluxes through each reaction that can, paired with the right combination of other fluxes, estimate the optimal solution.

[[Image:FVA2TomForth.png|right|thumb|Visual and numerical representation of FVA on a network with non-lethal deletion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

Reactions which can support a low variability of fluxes through them are likely to be of a higher importance to an organism and FVA is a promising technique for the identification of reactions that are important.

===Minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA)===

When simulating knockouts or growth on media, FBA gives the final steady-state flux distribution. This final steady state is reached in varying time-scales. For example, the predicted growth rate of ''E. coli'' on glycerol as the primary carbon source did not match the FBA predictions; however, on sub-culturing for 40 days or 700 generations, the growth rate adaptively evolved to match the FBA prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ibarra | first1 = Rafael U. | last2 = Edwards | first2 = Jeremy S. | last3 = Palsson | first3 = Bernhard O. | year = 2002 | title = Escherichia Coli K-12 Undergoes Adaptive Evolution to Achieve in Silico Predicted Optimal Growth | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6912| pages = 186–189 | doi = 10.1038/nature01149 | pmid=12432395| bibcode = 2002Natur.420..186I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is of interest to find out what is the immediate effect of a perturbation or knockout, since it takes time for regulatory changes to occur and for the organism to re-organize fluxes to optimally utilize a different carbon source or circumvent the effect of the knockout. MOMA predicts the immediate sub-optimal flux distribution following the perturbation by minimizing the distance (Euclidean) between the wild-type FBA flux distribution and the mutant flux distribution using quadratic programming. This yields an optimization problem of the form.

&lt;math&gt;
\min\ ||\mathbf{v_w} - \mathbf{v_d}||^2 \qquad s. t.\quad \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{v_d}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_w}&lt;/math&gt; represents the wild-type (or unperturbed state) flux distribution and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_d}&lt;/math&gt; represents the flux distribution on gene deletion that is to be solved for. This simplifies to:

&lt;math&gt;
\min\ \frac{1}{2}\,{\mathbf{v_d}}^T\,\mathbf{I}\,\mathbf{v_d} + (\mathbf{-v_w})\cdot\mathbf{v_d} \qquad s. t.\quad \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{v_d}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the MOMA solution which represents the flux distribution immediately post-perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segrè | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Vitkup | first2 = Dennis | last3 = Church | first3 = George M. | year = 2002 | title = Analysis of Optimality in Natural and Perturbed Metabolic Networks | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 23| pages = 15112–15117 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.232349399 | pmid = 12415116 | pmc=137552| bibcode = 2002PNAS...9915112S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory on-off minimization (ROOM)===
ROOM attempts to improve the prediction of the metabolic state of an organism after a gene knockout. It follows the same premise as MOMA that an organism would try to restore a flux distribution as close as possible to the wild-type after a knockout. However it further hypothesizes that this steady state would be reached through a series of transient metabolic changes by the regulatory network and that the organism would try to minimize the number of regulatory changes required to reach the wild-type state. Instead of using a distance metric minimization however it uses a mixed integer linear programming method.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomi, Tomer, Omer Berkman, and Eytan Ruppin. "Regulatory On/off Minimization of Metabolic Flux Changes After Genetic Perturbations." ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' 102, no. 21 (May 24, 2005): 7695–7700. doi:10.1073/pnas.0406346102.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic FBA===
Dynamic FBA attempts to add the ability for models to change over time, thus in some ways avoiding the strict steady state condition of pure FBA. Typically the technique involves running an FBA simulation, changing the model based on the outputs of that simulation, and rerunning the simulation. By repeating this process an element of feedback is achieved over time.

==Comparison with other techniques==

FBA provides a less simplistic analysis than Choke Point Analysis while requiring far less information on reaction rates and a much less complete network reconstruction than a full dynamic simulation would require. In filling this niche, FBA has been shown to be a very useful technique for analysis of the metabolic capabilities of cellular systems.

===Choke point analysis===

Unlike [[choke point analysis]] which only considers points in the network where metabolites are produced but not consumed or vice versa, FBA is a true form of [[metabolic network modelling]] because it considers the metabolic network as a single complete entity ([[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometry matrix|the stoichiometric matrix]]) at all stages of analysis. This means that network effects, such as chemical reactions in distant pathways affecting each other, can be reproduced in the model. The upside to the inability of choke point analysis to simulate  network effects is that it considers each reaction within a network in isolation and thus can suggest important reactions in a network even if a network is highly fragmented and contains many gaps.

===Dynamic metabolic simulation===

Unlike [[dynamic metabolic simulation]], FBA assumes that the internal concentration of metabolites within a system stays constant over time and thus is unable to provide anything other than steady-state solutions. It is unlikely that FBA could, for example, simulate the functioning of a nerve cell. Since the internal concentration of metabolites is not considered within a model, it is possible that an FBA solution could contain metabolites at a concentration too high to be biologically acceptable. This is a problem that dynamic metabolic simulations would probably avoid. One advantage of the simplicity of FBA over dynamic simulations is that they are far less computationally expensive, allowing the simulation of large numbers of perturbations to the network. A second advantage is that the reconstructed model can be substantially simpler by avoiding the need to consider enzyme rates and the effect of complex interactions on enzyme kinetics.

A '''focus group''' is a small, but  demographically diverse group of people and whose reactions are studied especially in market research or political analysis in guided or open discussions about a new product or something else to determine the reactions that can be expected from a larger population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/focus+group|title=Definition of FOCUS GROUP|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504021742/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/focus+group|archivedate=4 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/focus_group|title=focus group - Definition of focus group in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044025/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/focus_group|archivedate=9 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=focus+group|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: focus group|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|date=|website=www.ahdictionary.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509164640/https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=focus+group|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[qualitative research]] consisting of interviews in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging. Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.  During this process, the researcher either takes notes or records the vital points he or she is getting from the group. Researchers should select members of the focus group carefully for effective and authoritative responses.

==History==

Focus groups have a long history and were used{{by whom|date=May 2016}} during the [[Second World War]] (1939-1945) to examine the effectiveness of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Associate director sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] set up focus groups at the [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] in the USA prior to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html |title=Robert K.

==Use in disciplines==
===Library and information science===

In library and information science, when the library intends to work on its collection, the library consults the users who are the reason the library was established. This is an important process in meeting the needs of the users.

===Social sciences===
In the [[social sciences]] and [[urban planning]], focus groups allow interviewers to study people in a more natural conversation pattern than typically occurs in a one-to-one interview. In combination with [[participant observation]], they can be used for learning about groups and their patterns of interaction. An advantage is their fairly low cost compared to [[Opinion poll|surveys]], as one can get results relatively quickly and increase the sample size of a report by talking with several people at once.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine and Gretchen B. Rossman. 1999. ''Designing Qualitative Research''. 3rd Ed. London: Sage Publications, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage is that they can be used as an occasion for participants to learn from one another as they exchange and build on one another's views, so that the participants can experience the research as an enriching encounter. This counteracts the extractive nature of research which seeks to "mine" participants for data (with no benefit for them) as criticized by various authors, and in particular Indigenous-oriented authors (and others sharing similar sentiments), as explained, for example, by Romm (2015): http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/2087.

===Marketing===
In the world of [[marketing]], focus groups are seen as an important tool for acquiring feedback regarding new products, as well as various other topics. In marketing, focus groups are usually used in the early stages of product or concept development, when organizations are trying to create an overall direction for marketing initiative. In particular, focus groups allow companies wishing to develop, package, name, or test market a new product, to discuss, view, and/or test the new product before it is made available to the public. This can provide valuable information about the potential market acceptance of the product.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A focus group is an interview, conducted by a trained moderator among a small group of respondents. The interview is conducted in an informal and natural way where respondents are free to give views from any aspect. Focus groups are similar to, but should not be confused with in-depth interviews. The moderator uses a discussion guide that has been prepared in advance of the focus group to guide the discussion.  Generally the discussion goes from overall impressions of a brand or product category and becomes more specific as the discussion progresses.

Participants are recruited on the basis of similar demographics, psychographics, buying attitudes, or behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenbaum |first=Thomas|title=Moderating Focus Groups|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-2044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of the stake holder (often a design team in the case of testing acceptance on a new product) are not involved in the focus group, not to bias the exercise. However they may attend the focus group, either through video cameras, or by watching through a one way mirror.

Traditional focus groups can provide accurate information, and are less expensive than other forms of traditional [[marketing research]]. There can be significant costs however: if a product is to be marketed on a nationwide basis, it would be critical to gather respondents from various locales throughout the country since attitudes about a new product may vary due to geographical considerations. This would require a considerable expenditure in travel and lodging expenses. Additionally, the site of a traditional focus group may or may not be in a locale convenient to a specific client, so client representatives may have to incur travel and lodging expenses as well.

Today, using [[audience response]] keypads to collect questionnaire answers is the new industry trend.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Usability engineering===
* In [[usability engineering]], a focus group is a survey method to collect the feedback of users on software or a website. This marketing method can be applied to computer products to better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product. Unlike other methods of [[ergonomics]], focus group implies several participants: users or future users of the application. The focus group can only collect subjective data, not objective data on the use of the application as the [[usability test]] for example.

==Types==
Variants of focus groups include:
* '''Two-way focus group''' - one focus group watches another focus group and discusses the observed interactions and conclusion
* '''Dual moderator focus group''' - one moderator ensures the session progresses smoothly, while another ensures that all the topics are covered
* '''Dueling moderator focus group''' (fencing-moderator) - two moderators deliberately take opposite sides on the issue under discussion
* '''Respondent moderator focus group''' - one and only one of the respondents is asked to act as the moderator temporarily
* '''Client participant focus groups''' - one or more client representatives participate in the discussion, either covertly or overtly
* '''Mini focus groups''' - groups are composed of four or five members rather than 6 to 12
* '''Teleconference focus groups ''' - telephone network is used
* '''Creativity groups'''
* '''Band obsessive group'''
* '''[[Online focus group]]s''' - computers connected via the internet are used

==Discussions==
* Group discussion produces data and insights that would be less accessible without interaction found in a group setting—listening to others’ verbalized experiences stimulates memories, ideas, and experiences in participants. This is also known as the group effect where group members engage in "a kind of ‘chaining’ or ‘cascading’ effect; talk links to, or tumbles out of, the topics and expressions preceding it" (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182)&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof, T. R., &amp; Taylor, B. C. (2002). ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods, 2nd Edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Group members discover a common language to describe similar experiences. This enables the capture of a form of "native language" or "vernacular speech" to understand the situation
* Focus groups also provide an opportunity for disclosure among similar others in a setting where participants are validated. For example, in the context of [[workplace bullying]], targeted employees often find themselves in situations where they experience lack of voice and feelings of isolation. Use of focus groups to study workplace bullying therefore serve as both an efficacious and ethical venue for collecting data (see, e.g., Tracy, Lutgen-Sandvik, &amp; Alberts, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, S. J., Lutgen-Sandvik, P., &amp; Alberts, J. K. (2006). Nightmares, demons and slaves: Exploring the painful metaphors of workplace bullying. ''Management Communication Quarterly, 20'', 148-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and criticism==
A fundamental difficulty with focus groups (and other forms of [[qualitative research]]) is the issue of ''observer dependency'': the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his or her own reading of the group's discussion, raising questions of validity (see [[experimenter's bias]]).
Focus groups are "One shot case studies" especially if they are measuring a property-disposition relationship within the social sciences, unless they are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmais, Chava Frankfort; Nachmais, David. 2008. ''Research methods in the Social Sciences: Seventh Edition'' New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Focus groups can create severe issues of external validity, especially the reactive effects of the testing arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Donald T., Stanley, Juilian C. ''Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research.'' Chicago, IL: Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common (and related) criticism involve [[groupthink]] and [[social desirability bias]].

Another issue is with the setting itself.  If the focus groups are held in a laboratory setting with a moderator who is a professor and the recording instrument is obtrusive, the participants may either hold back on their responses and/or try to answer the moderator's questions with answers the participants feel that the moderator wants to hear.  Another issue with the focus group setting is the lack of anonymity.  With all of the other participants, there can not be any guarantee of confidentiality.

[[Douglas Rushkoff]]&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas, ''Get back in the box : innovation from the inside out'', New York : Collins, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; argues that focus groups are often useless, and frequently cause more trouble than they are intended to solve, with focus groups often aiming to please rather than offering their own opinions or evaluations, and with data often [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]] to support a foregone conclusion. Rushkoff cites the disastrous introduction of [[New Coke]] in the 1980s as a vivid example of focus group analysis gone bad.

Jonathan Ive, Apple’s senior vice president of industrial design, also said that Apple had found a good reason not to do focus groups: "They just ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Data analysis==
The analysis of focus group data presents both challenges and opportunities when compared to other types of qualitative data. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Jamie|title=Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish|isbn=978-0-85702-138-0|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that data should be analysed in the same manner as interview data, while others have suggested that the unique features of focus group data – particularly the opportunity that it provides to observe interactions between group members - means that distinctive forms of analysis should be used. Data analysis can take place at the level of the individual or the group.

Focus group data provides the opportunity to analyse the strength with which an individual holds an opinion.  If they are presented with opposing opinions or directly challenged, the individual may either modify their position or defend it. Bringing together all the comments that an individual makes in order can enable the researcher to determine whether their view changes in the course of discussion and, if so, further examination of the transcript may reveal which contributions by other focus group members brought about the change.

At the collective level, focus group data can sometimes reveal shared understandings or common views.  However, there is a danger that a consensus can be assumed when not every person has spoken: the researcher will need to consider carefully whether the people who have not expressed a view can be assumed to agree with the majority, or whether they may simply be unwilling to voice their disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Jamie. 2013. ''Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish'' London, SAGE Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States government==
The [[United States]] federal government makes extensive use of focus groups to assess public education materials and messages for their many programs.  While many of these are appropriate for the purpose, many others are reluctant compromises which federal officials have had to make as a result of studies independent of whether a focus group is the best or even appropriate methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Srivastava|first1=T N|title=Business Research Methodology|isbn=0-07-015910-6|page=6.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Swedish artist [[Måns Wrange]] has used the concept of the focus group in his work ''The Good Rumor Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manswrange.com|title=Måns Wrange|author=|date=|website=www.manswrange.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050721/http://www.manswrange.com/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance the focus group situation is used not only as a means to investigate the opinions of the group members, but also to spread an idea (the ''rumor'') across society with the help of the group members.

== Exercises ==
Various creative activity-oriented questions can serve as supplements to verbal questions including but not limited to the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colucci|first=Erminia|date=December 2007|title=Focus groups can be fun": The use of activity-oriented questions in focus group discussions|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.833.1072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Qualitative Health Research|volume=17 |issue=10|pages=1422–1433|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509164640/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.833.1072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Free listings'''- participants produce a list of all elements of a domain 
* '''Rating'''- participants have a list of items which must be rated on a scale, typically using a numbers or adjectives
* '''Ranking'''- participants can either receive a list of items to rank according to a specified dimension or participants can combine items in pairs to compare elements in the pairs
* '''Pile sorting'''- participants sort cards representing elements of a domain into piles according to their similarities and differences
* '''Picture sort'''- Participants are distributed selected pictures from magazines or photographs to sort through, finding matches of a definite characteristic or that best represent a certain category
* '''Magic tools and fantasy'''- the moderator can literally or symbolically pass around a "magical" tool to each participant as he or she shares a fantasy, dream, or idea
* '''Storytelling'''- participants create a narrative around the topic of interest to make others think about a solution to a problem, gauge reactions to a situation, and observe attitudes towards the topic under study
* '''Role-playing'''- participants demonstrate through action how they would behave or act in a situation, how they would solve a problem, or deal with a difficulty
* '''Sentence completion'''- participants are given printed out partial sentences on a topic to complete and share within a group
* '''Collage'''- a moderator assigns a theme and then distributes print materials to participants (who are divided into small groups), so they can use these materials, drawings, and their own words to create a relevant collage.

He graduated the Budapest Technical University ([[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]) in 1972, with a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Prior to which, he studied chemical engineering at the Leningrad Technology Institute ([[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology]]).

He is an [[IBM Fellow]] (2003), an IBM Distinguished Engineer and a member of the IBM Academy of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/5250.wss IBM Honors and Rewards Elite Technical Employees]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOialXpj?url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/5250.wss |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He holds the office of CTO, Global Services (IGS) IBM Canada.

Dr. Galambos was a designer on the team that built the Interac network connecting bank machines around the world. The result was an open system that allowed almost any card to be used in almost any machine, regardless of the user’s financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/Home/News.asp?id=1872 Interac architect sounds off on SOA]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOib2yra?url=http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/Home/News.asp?id=1872 |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Galambos advises companies on advanced systems design and strategic IT plans. His current interest includes system design patterns, with a focus on integration.

Dr. Galambos holds patent for 'System and method for transforming an enterprise using a component business model' (Patent #20070174109, Class: 705010000 (USPTO)), A system and method are described for using a Component Business Model (CBM) to transform a business. A CBM map is used to identify components that collaborate to provide a specified capability, and a repository supporting the CBM map is filtered to provide a view of the identified components that highlights how they collaborate. The view is used to identify component features contributing to the specified capability. The specified capability is then enhanced by a transformation strategy that includes re-engineering particular components, identifying a pattern characterizing the collaboration between components and adding a component to perform the collaborative pattern, or adding another feature to the collaboration and adding component to perform the additional feature. The CBM repository provides exemplar best practices that can be adapted for use in a re-engineered component.

'''Germination''' is the process by which an organism grows from a seed or similar structure. The most common example of germination is the [[sprouting]] of a [[seedling]] from a [[seed]] of an [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] or [[gymnosperm]]. In addition, the growth of a [[sporeling]] from a [[spore]], such as the spores of [[hypha]]e from [[Fungus|fungal]] spores, is also germination. Thus, in a general sense, germination can be thought of as anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or [[Germ cell|germ]].
{{TOC limit}} Most seeds do not need sunlight to germinate but some seeds such as sunflower seeds, mustard seeds and blosnian seeds need sunlight to successfully germinate. Experiments were carried out to prove this.{{Citation Needed|date=September 2018}}

Germination is usually the growth of a plant contained within a seed; it results in the formation of the seedling, it is also the process of reactivation of metabolic machinery of the seed resulting in the emergence of radicle and plumule. The seed of a [[vascular plant]] is a small package produced in a [[fruit]] or [[conifer cone|cone]] after the union of male and female reproductive cells. All fully developed seeds contain an [[embryo]] and, in most plant species some store of food reserves, wrapped in a seed coat.  Some plants produce varying numbers of seeds that lack embryos; these are called  and never germinate. Dormant seeds are ripe seeds that do not germinate because they are subject to external environmental conditions that prevent the initiation of metabolic processes and cell growth. Under proper conditions, the seed begins to germinate and the embryonic tissues resume growth, developing towards a seedling.
[[File:Seed Germination.png|thumb|&lt;br&gt;
-Step 1- Water imbibition, the uptake of water, results in rupture of seed coat. &lt;br&gt;
-Step 2-The imbibition of the seed coat results in emergence of the [[radicle]] (1) and the [[plumule]](2), the [[cotyledons]] get unfolded(3). &lt;br&gt;
-Step 3-This marks the final step in the germination of the seed  where the cotyledons are expanded which are the true leaves/peasNote-  Temperature must be kept at an optimum level.]] 
Seed germination depends on both internal and external conditions. The most important external factors include right [[temperature]], [[water]], [[oxygen]] or [[air]] and sometimes [[light]] or [[darkness]].&lt;ref name="Raven" /&gt; Various plants require different variables for successful seed germination. Often this depends on the individual seed variety and is closely linked to the [[Ecology|ecological conditions]] of a plant's [[natural habitat]].  For some seeds, their future germination response is affected by environmental conditions during seed formation; most often these responses are types of [[seed dormancy]].

* '''Water'''  is required for germination. Mature seeds are often extremely dry and need to take in significant amounts of water, relative to the dry weight of the seed, before cellular [[metabolism]] and growth can resume. Most seeds need enough water to moisten the seeds but not enough to soak them.  The uptake of water by seeds is called [[imbibition]], which leads to the swelling and the breaking of the seed coat. When seeds are formed, most plants store a food reserve with the seed, such as [[starch]], [[protein]]s, or [[oil]]s. This food reserve provides nourishment to the growing embryo. When the seed imbibes water, [[hydrolytic enzyme]]s are activated which break down these stored food resources into metabolically useful [[chemical]]s.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;  After the seedling emerges from the seed coat and starts growing roots and leaves, the seedling's food reserves are typically exhausted; at this point photosynthesis provides the energy needed for continued growth and the seedling now requires a continuous supply of water, nutrients, and light.
* '''Oxygen  '''is required by the germinating seed for [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegel | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = L. A. | year = 1962 | title = Effects of Reduced Oxygen Tension on Germination and Seedling Growth | url = | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 437–444 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1962.tb08047.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxygen is used in [[aerobic respiration]], the main source of the seedling's energy until it grows leaves.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; Oxygen is an [[atmospheric gas]] that is found in [[soil]] pore spaces; if a seed is buried too deeply within the soil or the soil is waterlogged, the seed can be oxygen starved.  Some seeds have impermeable seed coats that prevent oxygen from entering the seed, causing a type of physical dormancy which is broken when the seed coat is worn away enough to allow gas exchange and water uptake from the environment.
* '''Temperature'''  affects cellular metabolic and growth rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds from the same plant germinate over a wide range of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) [room-temperature if you live in a centrally heated house], while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C).  Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures ([[vernalization]]) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy.  For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Variation in Seed Dormancy and Germination within and between Individuals and Populations of a Species. Seeds: Ecology, Biogeography, and, Evolution of Dormancy and Germination.|last=Baskin and Baskin|first=Carol C. and Jerry M.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2014|isbn=9780124166837|location=Burlington|pages=Pages 5–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family [[Ranunculaceae]] and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a [[forest fire]] which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy. 
Most common annual [[vegetable]]s have optimal germination temperatures between 75-90 F (24-32 C), though many species (e.g. [[radish]]es or [[spinach]]) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, as low as 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. Suboptimal temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer germination periods.
* '''Light or darkness'''  can be an environmental trigger for germination and is a type of physiological dormancy. Most seeds are not affected by light or darkness, but many seeds, including species found in forest settings, will not germinate until an opening in the canopy allows sufficient light for growth of the seedling.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;
Scarification mimics natural processes that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, such as the heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking in a body of water for a long period of time. Others need to be passed through an animal's [[digestive tract]] to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;
[[Image:Sjb whiskey malt.jpg|thumb|250px|Malted (germinated) [[barley]] grains]]

=== Dormancy ===
Some live seeds are [[dormancy|dormant]] and need more time, and/or need to be subjected to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. [[Seed dormancy]] can originate in different parts of the seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The encyclopedia of seeds: science, technology and uses Cabi Series| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aE414KuXu4gC&amp;pg=PA203| year = 2006| journal = CABI| pages = 203| isbn = 0-85199-723-6| last1 = Derek Bewley | first1 =  J.| last2 =  Black | first2 =  Michael| last3 =  Halmer | first3 =  Peter| accessdate = 2009-08-28| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably [[abscisic acid]], which inhibits germination, and [[gibberellin]], which ends seed dormancy. In [[brewing]], barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley [[malt]].&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

=== Seedling establishment ===
In some definitions, the appearance of the [[radicle]] marks the end of germination and the beginning of "establishment", a period that utilizes the food reserves stored in the seed. Germination and establishment as an independent organism are critical phases in the life of a plant when they are the most vulnerable to injury, disease, and water stress.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; The germination index can be used as an indicator of [[phytotoxicity]] in soils. The mortality between dispersal of seeds and completion of establishment can be so high that many species have adapted to produce large numbers of seeds.

== Germination rate and germination capacity ==
[[File:Seedling of Eucalyptus.jpg|thumb|Germination of [[seedlings]] raised from [[seeds]] of [[eucalyptus]] after 3 days of [[sowing]].]]
In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], the '''germination rate''' describes how many seeds of a particular [[plant]] [[species]], variety or seedlot are likely to germinate over a given period. It is a measure of germination time course and is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., an 85% germination rate indicates that about 85 out of 100 seeds will probably germinate under proper conditions over the germination period given. The germination rate is useful for calculating the seed requirements for a given area or desired number of plants. In seed physiologists and seed scientists "germination rate" is the reciprocal of time taken for the process of germination to complete starting from time of sowing. On the other hand, the number of seed able to complete germination in a population (i.e. seed lot) is referred as '''germination capacity'''.

===Repair of DNA damage===

[[Seed]] quality deteriorates with age, and this is associated with accumulation of genome damage.&lt;ref name="pmid25750428"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterworth WM, Bray CM, West CE |title=The importance of safeguarding genome integrity in germination and seed longevity |journal=J. Exp.

=== Dicot germination ===
The part of the plant that first emerges from the seed is the embryonic root, termed the [[radicle]] or primary root. It allows the seedling to become anchored in the ground and start absorbing water. After the root absorbs water, an embryonic [[shoot]] emerges from the seed. This shoot comprises three main parts: the [[cotyledon]]s (seed leaves), the section of shoot below the cotyledons ([[hypocotyl]]), and the section of shoot above the cotyledons ([[epicotyl]]). The way the shoot emerges differs among plant groups.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. |author2=Ray F. Evert |author3=Susan E. Eichhorn  | title = Biology of Plants, 7th Edition | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers | year = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 504–508 | isbn = 0-7167-1007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Epigeal ====
In '''[[epigeal germination]]''' (or epigeous germination), the ''hypocotyl'' elongates and forms a hook, pulling rather than pushing the [[cotyledon]]s and [[apical meristem]] through the soil. Once it reaches the surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. [[Bean]]s, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

==== Hypogeal ====
Germination can also be done by hypogeal germination  (or hypogeous germination), where the epicotyl elongates and forms the hook. In this type of germination, the cotyledons stay underground where they eventually decompose. Peas, [[Gram (disambiguation)#Agriculture and horticulture|gram]] and mango, for example, germinate this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sadhu, M.K.|title=Plant propagation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K-gQh6OI7GcC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=mango+hypogeous+germination#v=onepage&amp;q=mango%20hypogeous%20germination&amp;f=false|year=1989|publisher=New Age International|page=61|isbn=978-81-224-0065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monocot germination ===
In [[monocot]] seeds, the embryo's radicle and cotyledon are covered by a [[coleorhiza]] and [[coleoptile]], respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, followed by the radicle. The coleoptile is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface. There, it stops elongating and the first leaves emerge.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

=== Precocious germination ===
When a seed germinates without undergoing all four stages of seed development, i.e., globular, heart shape, torpedo shape, and cotyledonary stage, it is known as precocious germination.

== Pollen germination ==
Another germination event during the life cycle of [[gymnosperm]]s and [[flowering plant]]s is the germination of a pollen grain after [[pollination]]. Like seeds, [[pollen]] grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2-3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a [[tube cell (plant)|tube cell]]. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive [[flower]] (or a female [[Conifer cone|cone]] in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by [[Tissue hydration|hydration]] on the stigma, as well as by the structure and [[physiology]] of the stigma and style.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; Pollen can also be induced to germinate ''in vitro'' (in a [[petri dish]] or test tube).&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin FW |title=In Vitro Measurement of Pollen Tube Growth Inhibition |journal=Plant Physiol |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=924–925 |year=1972 |pmid=16658085 |pmc=366081 |doi=10.1104/pp.49.6.924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfahler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pfahler PL |title=In vitro germination characteristics of maize pollen to detect biological activity of environmental pollutants |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=37 |issue= |pages=125–32 |year=1981 |pmid=7460877 |pmc=1568653|doi=10.2307/3429260 |jstor=3429260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During germination, the tube cell elongates into a [[pollen tube]]. In the flower, the pollen tube then grows towards the [[ovule]] where it discharges the [[sperm]] produced in the pollen grain for fertilization. The germinated pollen grain with its two sperm cells is the mature male [[Gametophyte|microgametophyte]] of these plants.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

=== Self-incompatibility ===
Since most plants carry both male and female reproductive organs in their flowers, there is a high risk of self-pollination and thus [[inbreeding]]. Some plants use the control of pollen germination as a way to prevent this self-pollination. Germination and growth of the pollen tube involve molecular signaling between stigma and pollen. In [[self-incompatibility in plants]], the stigma of certain plants can molecularly recognize pollen from the same plant and prevent it from germinating.&lt;ref name="Takayama"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takayama S, Isogai A |title=Self-incompatibility in plants |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=56 |issue= 1|pages=467–89 |year=2005 |pmid=15862104 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spore germination ==
Germination can also refer to the emergence of cells from [[resting spore]]s and the growth of [[sporeling]] [[hypha]]e or [[Thallus|thalli]] from spores in [[Fungus|fungi]], [[alga]]e and some plants.

[[Conidia]] are asexual reproductive (reproduction without the fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. Another type of cell is a conidial anastomosis tube (CAT); these differ from germ tubes in that they are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial anastomosis tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roca | first1 = M. | last2 = Davide | first2 = L.C. | last3 = Davide | first3 = L.M. | last4 = Mendes-Costa | first4 = M.C. | last5 = Schwan | first5 = R.F. | last6 = Wheals | first6 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Conidial anastomoses fusions between Colletotrichum species | url = | journal = Mycological Research | volume = 108 | issue = 11| pages = 1320–1326 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756204000838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roca | first1 = M.G. | last2 = Arlt | first2 = J. | last3 = Jeffree | first3 = C.E. | last4 = Read | first4 = N.D. | year = 2005 | title = Cell biology of conidial anastomosis tubes in Neurospora crassa | url = | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 911–919 | doi = 10.1128/EC.4.5.911-919.2005 | pmid = 15879525 | pmc = 1140100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resting spores ===
In [[resting spore]]s, germination involves cracking the thick cell wall of the dormant spore. For example, in [[zygomycete]]s the thick-walled zygosporangium cracks open and the [[zygospore]] inside gives rise to the emerging sporangiophore. In [[Slime mould|slime molds]], germination refers to the emergence of [[amoeboid]] cells from the hardened spore. After cracking the spore coat, further development involves cell division, but not necessarily the development of a multicellular organism (for example in the free-living amoebas of slime molds).&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

=== Ferns and mosses ===
In [[plant]]s such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and a few others, spores germinate into independent [[gametophyte]]s. In the bryophytes (e.g., [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]), spores germinate into [[protonema]]ta, similar to fungal hyphae, from which the gametophyte grows. In [[fern]]s, the gametophytes are small, heart-shaped [[Prothallium|prothalli]] that can often be found underneath a spore-shedding adult plant.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

'''Human systems engineering''' ('''HSE''') is a field based on [[systems theory]] intended as a structured approach to influence the intangible reality in organizations in a desirable direction. HSE claims to turn complexity into an advantage, to ease innovation processes in organizations and to master problems rooted in negative emotions and lack of motivation. It is taught in a Master of Advanced Studies program of the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO) as a complementary and postgraduate program for students who have already achieved a bachelor level or an MBA.

Recently, after the crisis of the Swiss banking system due to [[whistle blowing]] and to the stealing and selling to intelligence services of sensitive data by bank personnel, numerous articles featured "human risks" as a major problem in organisations. According to [[:de:Lutz von Rosenstiel]]&lt;ref&gt;von Rosenstiel L., Nerdinger F., Spiess E., Was morgen alles anders läuft, Econ Verlag 1991&lt;/ref&gt; the "lack of meaning" and conflicts between personal and organisational values systems is becoming increasingly a problem; people have not any more the feeling to "belong" to an organization if every relation is to be seen as a commercial interaction. [[Chris Argyris]] sees the same problem from the point of view of learning interactions between the organization and personnel, where the organization expects from its personnel to learn in order to fulfil jobs, but the organization is not prepared to learn from its personnel through [[double-loop learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Argyris C., Organizational Learning II. Theory, Method and Practice, Addison-Wesley Pub. Co, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

To handle these issues, in HSE, the organization is seen as a living system according to [[Living systems#Miller's living systems theory|J.G. Millers theory of open and self organizing systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller J.G., ''Living Systems'', McGraw-Hill, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In HSE, the 3 systemic levels "individual", "group" and "organization" are considered as main entities and targets to influence, whereas the levels "society" and "supranational system" supply the criteria for a positive insertion of the organization in its environment. This approach is intended to help managers to understand the organization as a complex and organic system where functional relations, hierarchy and processes are only the visible and tangible part of the "iceberg". HSE claims the invisible part is as important as the tangible and structural aspects of the organizations. HSE sees the invisible as the unconscious part of both the individual and the organization as a collective entity. [[Fritjof Capra]] describes the subtle interactions between the tangible and the invisible in one of his books.&lt;ref&gt;Capra F., The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living,Doubleday 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From an epistemological point of view HSE refers explicitly to [[Edgar Morin]]'s proposal to link sciences and practices &lt;ref&gt;Morin E., Relier les connaissances – Le défi du XXIe siècle, Ed. Seuil 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Jean Piaget]]'s concept of "[[transdisciplinarity]]".

As a result of the program, human risks and the resources deriving from a positive interaction are now better understood.&lt;ref&gt;Dubouloz C., Le bonheur des collaborateurs est un facteur décisif du succès, in Le Temps, 29.04.2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch E. Entreprises: gros protentiels pour les biens intangibles, in AGEFI 04.07.2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodard Senn J., Maîtriser les facteurs humains, in Swiss Engineering, 12–2003,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stöcklin V., L'entreprise, un système vivant, in 24 heures, 20.11.2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baillod G., Le secret des processus humains, in Bilan, 1–2005&lt;/ref&gt; As in a part of the Swiss academic system  ([[Fachhochschule|University of Applied Sciences]]) Master Thesis' include applications of contents and learned skills, HSE is becoming increasingly popular amongst private or public organizations when resolving problems on the intangible side becomes critical for survival or for success. Further, 7 cohorts of students who achieved their master's degree "teach the gospel" in and around Switzerland. 

HSE was first launched in French in 2002 at the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland and in 2004 at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in German language.

The program was founded in 2002 by two professors of the university:
* Prof. [[Christa Muth]] PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Dorier R, Muth C., Comment utiliser la complexité – Outils, attitudes et compétences à développer, jobindex media ag, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; who did several years research in organizational psychosociology and was developer of the Leonardo 3.4.5 methodology for strategy analysis in relation with team-members thought patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo345.com Leonardo 3.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Muth was the main conceptor of HSE.
* Prof. Marie-France Bourdais, specialist in communication and coaching, joined the team at an early stage and contributed her experience in using [[Neuro-linguistic-programming]] for modelling human and business processes.

Recently [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] started using the term "Human Systems Engineering" in its Engineering Systems Division, putting the focus on how people and organizations, conceive, develop and handle technological systems. Specialised courses focus on topics such as "The Human Side of Technology" or more human risk oriented courses as for example "Managing Nuclear Technology".

A similar program exists in Canada: [[Human Systems Intervention]].

The '''Indian Council of Social Science Research''' ('''ICSSR''') is the national body overseeing research in the [[social sciences]] in India. It was established in [[New Delhi]] in 1969.{{r|epw|page=3606}} It provides funding to scholars and to a network of twenty-seven [[research institutes]],{{r|epw|page=3606}} among them:

* the [[Centre for Development Studies]], Thiruvananthapuram
* the [[Centre for Policy Research]], New Delhi
* the [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]]
* the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]], Delhi
* the Centre for Multi-Disciplinary Development Research
* the [[Centre for Women's Development Studies]], Delhi
* the [[Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute]], Allahabad
* the Indian Institute Of Economics, Hyderabad
* the [[Institute of Public Enterprise]], Hyderabad
* the [[Institute for Social and Economic Change]], Bangalore
* the [[Institute for Studies in Industrial Development]], New Delhi
* the [[Madras Institute of Development Studies]].

A large proportion of its budget is spent on its own administration; in 1996–1997, this amounted to 23% of total expenditure.{{r|epw|page=3607}} It has been described as an "oversized, unimaginative and inefficient bureaucrac[y]".{{r|epw|page=3604}}

This usually excludes the case of birds feeding [[brood parasitism|brood parasites]].

Such behaviour is also related to [[alloparenting]], [[cross-fostering]] and brood [[adoption]]. Several situations have been suggested that lead to this including:&lt;ref name=shy/&gt;
# Bird raised in a mixed clutch &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samplonius|first1=Jelmer M|last2=Both|first2=Christiaan|title=A Case of a Three Species Mixed Brood after Two Interspecific Nest Takeovers|journal=Ardea|date=2014|volume=102|issue=1|pages=105-107|doi=10.5253/078.102.0113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Original nest and brood of bird destroyed
# Nests in very close proximity
# Calling of young birds stimulates behaviour
# Orphaned birds adopted temporarily or permanently
# Male bird feeding another species while mate incubated
# Feeding bird is mateless and finds a mateless bird at nest

Shy (1982) listed 65 species of birds involved in interspecific feeding. Riedman (1982) listed 150 species of birds that adopted young that did not belong to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marianne L.|last=Riedman|year=1982|title=The Evolution of Alloparental Care and Adoption in Mammals and Birds| jstor=2826887| journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=57|issue= 4|pages=405–435|doi=10.1086/412936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- Very poorly written, rewrite with context of interspecific feeding in focus
Shy (1982) also recorded a Yellowhammer feeding a juvenile of another species,{{clarify|What species}} as well as the first case of a Great Grey Shrike being fed by a heterospecific adult{{clarify|What species}}. Yellowhammers are common prey of Great Grey Shrikes in the study area according to Shy's studies. Canada shows cases of interspecific feeding on juveniles of another species according to shy. Yellowhammers are smaller than young Great Grey Shrikes. Young great grey shrikes have blazing{{clarify|What ?}} characteristics related with begging behaviour yellow corners of the bill, bright orange mouth, combined with wing waving and intensive calls. An accelerated begging shrike fledgling could enact a normal charge for the
Yellowhammer older ones that might have been lately feeding their little ones, and the two species begin to forage the shrike fledgling and carry on doing this for three hours.

[[File:Abdul Qadir al-Rassam - Title Unknown - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Abdul Qadir Al Rassam]], 1901]]

'''Iraqi art''', throughout its entire history, has been influenced by war, revolutions and frequent political changes. For centuries, the capital, Baghdad was the Medieval centre of the literary and artistic Arab world, but its artistic traditions suffered at the hands of the Mongol invaders in the 13th century. During other periods it has flourished, such as during the reign of [[Pir Budaq]], or under Ottoman rule in the 16th century when Baghdad was known for its [[Ottoman miniature]] painting. During the rule of the [[Safavids]], Iraqi art was influenced by [[Persian art]], and it became a centre of poetry as well as arts. In the 20th century, an art revival, which combined both tradition and modern techniques, produced many notable poets, painters and sculptors who contributed to the inventory of public artworks, especially in Baghdad. These artists are highly regarded in the Middle East, and some have earned international recognition. The Iraqi modern art movement had a profound influence on pan-Arab art generally.

==History==
[[File:Yahyâ ibn Mahmûd al-Wâsitî 005.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the manuscript of ''Maqâmât'' written by al-Harîrî'', illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], c. 13th century]]
The art historian, Nada Shabout, points out that Iraqi art remains largely undocumented. The West has very little idea about Iraqi art. Problems associated with documenting a complete picture of Iraqi art have been compounded by the fact that many 20th-century artists, art historians and philosophers have been forced into exile, where they are isolated from their heritage and current practices.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, p. 94: it may be worth noting that the Ministry of Culture estimates that 80 percent of Iraqi artists are now living in exile, See: ''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, much of Iraq's art heritage has been looted or destroyed during periods of revolution, war and political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levi, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2010, pp 105-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq's art has a deep heritage that extends back in time to ancient [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian art]]. Iraq has one of the longest written traditions in the world. [[Arabic maqam|Maqam]] traditions in music and calligraphy have survived into the modern day.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, A., ''State-Society Relations in Ba'thist Iraq: Facing Dictatorship,'' Routledge, 2010, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continuity of Iraq's arts culture has been subject to the vicissitudes of invading armies for centuries. The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the 13th-century devastated much traditional art and craft and is generally seen as a break in the tradition of Iraqi art.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B., "The Iraqi Century of Art," ''Artnet Magazine'', July 2008, Online: http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/davis/davis7-14-08.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although British archaeologists excavated a number of Iraqi sites, including [[Nimrud]], [[Ninevah]] and [[Tell Halaf]] in Iraq in the 19th-century,&lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; they sent many of the artefacts and statues to museums around the world. It was not until the early 20th-century when a small group of Iraqi artists were awarded scholarships to study abroad that they became aware of ancient [[Sumerian art]] by visiting pretigious museums such as the [[Louvre]], enabling them to reconnect with their cultural and intellectual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, figurines, dating to the [[Neolithic]] period, found at the Palace of [[Tell Halaf]] and elsewhere, attest to Iraq's ancient artistic heritage.

The [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] ruled the region that is now Iraq and Iran between the 3rd and 7th centuries. [[Sasanian art]] is best represented in metalwork, jewellery, architecture and wall-reliefs. Few paintings from this period have survived, but an understanding of jewellery ornamentation can be inferred from pictorial and sculptural representations.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, E., Grabar,O. and Jenkins, M., ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250,'' Yale University Press, 2001,  pp 66-68&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the early Islamic period, writing was transformed into an "iconophoric message...a carrier of meaning independent of its form [and] into a subject worthy of the most elaborate ornamentation." &lt;ref name="Ettinghausen, E. 1250, p. 79"&gt;Ettinghausen, E., Grabar,O. and Jenkins, M., ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250,'' Yale University Press, 2001,  p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Another development during this period was the use of repeating patterns or motifs on scrolls and wall-reliefs. Inherited from the Muslims, this highly stylised system of ornamentation was subsequently given the label of ''[[arabesque]]''.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen, E. 1250, p. 79"/&gt;

The [[Abassid]] Dynasty controlled much of the region now encompassed by Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria, between the 8th and 13th-centuries. During the Abassid period, pottery achieved a high level of sophistication, calligraphy began to be used to decorate the surface of decorative objects and illuminated manuscripts, particularly [[Quran|Q'ranic]] texts became more complex and stylised.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, R., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Thames &amp; Hudson, [World of Art series], 1999, London, p. 59 {{ISBN|978-0-500-20305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq's first art school was established during this period, allowing artisans and crafts to flourish. &lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Abassid period, in the late 12th-century, a stylistic movement of manuscript illustration and calligraphy emerged. Now known as the ''[[Baghdad School]]'' (or ''Mesopotamian School''), this movement of Islamic art was characterised by representations of everyday life and the use of highly expressive faces rather than the stereotypical characters that had been used in the past. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources.  The works were primarily scientific, philosophical, social commentary or humorous entertainments. This movement continued for at least four decades, and dominated art in the first half of the 13th-century.&lt;ref name="Online"&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry also flourished during the Abbasid period, producing notable poets including: the 9th-century Sufi poets [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] and [[Abu Nuwas|Abū Nuwās al-Ḥasan ibn Hānī al-Ḥakamī]].  

The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]] lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries) was the pre-eminent artist of the Baghdad school. His most well-known works include the llustrations for the book of the ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (Assemblies) in 1237, a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|al-Hariri]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]; Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Waiti's illustrations served as an inspiration for the 20th-century modern Baghdad art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,''Scorpion, 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of works in the style of the Baghdad School include the illustrations in ''Rasa'il al-Ikhwan al-Safa'' (''The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren''), (1287); an Arabic translation of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]’ medical text, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' (1224)&lt;ref name="Online"/&gt; and the illustrated ''Kalila wa Dimna'' ([[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]]), (1222); a collection of fables by the Hindu, Bidpai translated into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, Baghdad was the capital of the [[Abbasid caliphate]]; its library was unrivalled and a magnet for intellectuals around the known world. However, in 1258, Baghdad fell to the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invaders, who pillaged the city, decimating mosques, libraries and palaces, thereby destroying most of the city's literary, religious and artistic assets. The Mongols also killed between 200,000 and one million people, leaving the population totally demoralised and the city barely habitable.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, I., "Invaders: Destroying Baghdad," ''New Yorker Magazine,'' [Special edition: Annals of History], April 25, 2005, [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/25/invaders-3 Online Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi art historians view this period as a time when the "chain of pictorial art" was broken.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1400-1411 Iraq was ruled by the [[Jalayirid dynasty]]. During this time, Iraqi art and culture flourished. Between 1411 and 1469, during the rule of the [[Qara Quyunlu dynasty]] artists from different parts of the eastern Islamic world were invited to Iraq. Under the patronage of [[Pir Budaq]], son of the [[Kara Koyunlu|Qara Quyunlu]] ruler, [[Jahan Shah]] (r. 1439–67), Iranian styles from [[Tabriz]] and [[Shiraz]] and even the styles of [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] Central Asia were all brought together in Iraq. Baghdad's importance as a centre of the arts declined after Pir Budaq's death in 1466. The Qara Quyunlu period ended with the advent of the [[Aq Quyunlu]]. Though noted patrons of the arts, the Aq Quyunlu mostly focus on areas outside Iraq.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web| title = Iraq, 1400–1600 A.D. {{!}} Chronology| work = The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/wam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1508 and 1534, Iraq came under the rule of the [[Safavid dynasty]], which shifted the focus of arts to Iran. Baghdad experienced a revival in the arts during this period, and was also a centre for literary works. The poet Fuzûlî (ca. 1495–1556) wrote during the period. He wrote in the three dominant languages of his time: Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. Iraq was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1534, during the reign of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]. The Iraqi poet [[Fuzûlî]] wrote in Arabic, Persian and Turkish during this time, and continued writing poetry after Ottoman rule was established in 1534.&lt;ref name=met/&gt; During the 16th century, Baghdad underwent another period of artistic revival; Iraqi painting from this time is called the “Baghdad school” of Ottoman miniature painting.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

Iraqi experienced a cultural shift between the years 1400 and 1600 CE, which is also reflected in its arts. In the 16th century, political rule in Iraq transitioned from the [[Mongol Empire|Turco-Mongol dynasties]] to the Ottoman Empire. In its past Iraq had been a centre of [[illuminated manuscripts]] but this art form experienced a general decline during this period.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

==19th-century==
Until the 20th-century, Iraq had no tradition of easel painting. Traditional art, which included metal-work, rug-making and weaving, glass-blowing, ceramic tiles, calligraphy and wall murals were widely practised during the 19th-century. Some traditional practices traced their origins back to the 9th-century Assyrians. However, in the 19th-century, mural painters were generally seen as artisans rather than artists - although in traditional Islamic society, the distinction between artists and artists was not well defined. A few named individuals are known, including the painter, Abbud 'the Jewish' Naqqash and the calligrapher, painter and decorator; [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashim al-Khattat]] ("Hashim the Calligrapher", early 20th-century) (d. 1973) and [[Niazi Mawlawi hashim]] (19th century), but relatively few details of their lives and careers are known.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 19th-century, the rise of nationalistic and intellectual movements across the Arab world led to calls for an Arab-lslamic cultural revival. Artists and intellectuals felt that the growth in Western influences was a threat to Arab cultural identity. At the same time as local artists began to adopt Western practices such as easel painting. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; they also searched consciously for a distinct national style.&lt;ref&gt;Tibi, B., ''Arab Nationalism between Islam and the Nation-state'', 3rd edn., New York, Saint Martin's Press, 1997, pp. 49-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th-century==
The late 19th-century and early 20th-century are known as ''Nahda'' in Arabic. This term loosely translates as a "revival" or "renaissance." Nahda became an important cultural movement which influenced all art forms - architecture, literature, poetry and the visual arts. &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the turn of the 20th-century, a small group of Iraqis were sent to Istanbul for military training, where painting and drawing was included as part of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Tejel, J., ''Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges,'' World Scientific, 2012, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which became known as the ''Ottoman artists,'' included [[Abdul Qadir Al Rassam]] (1882-1952); Mohammed Salim Moussali (1886-?); Hassan Sami, Assem Hafith (1886-1978); Mohammed Saleh Zaki (1888-1974) and [[Mohammed Hajji Selim|Hajji Mohammed Salim]] (1883-1941).&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; were exposed to European painting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Their style of painting was realism, impressionism or romanticism. &lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, S., Mohammadzade, M.,  Naef, S. and Mehraee, M., "Cultural Continuity in Modern Iraqi Painting between 1950- 1980," ''The Scientific Journal of NAZAR Research Center (Nrc) for Art, Architecture &amp; Urbanism,'' vol.14, no.47, May 2017, pp 43-54&lt;/ref&gt; On their return to Baghdad, they set up studios and began to offer painting lessons to talented, local artists. Many of the next generation of artists began by studying with the artists from the Ottoman group. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Their public works, which included murals, public monuments and artworks in the foyers of institutions or commercial buildings, exposed Iraqi people to Western art and contributed to art appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Middle-Eastern nations began to emerge from colonial rule, a nationalist sentiment developed. Artists consciously sought out ways to combine Western art techniques with traditional art and local subject matter. In Iraq, 20th century artists were at the forefront of developing a national style, and provided a model for other Arab nations who wanted to forge their own national identities. &lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levi, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2010, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Poetry and verse remains a major art form in modern Iraq and Iraqi poets were inspired by the literature of the 15th and 16th-centuries when Iraq was the centre of Arabic world. Notable 20th-century poets include [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (1923-2007), one of the best known woman poets in the Arab world and who wrote the poem ''My Brother Jafaar'' for her brother, who was killed during the [[Al-Wathbah uprising]] in 1948; [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri|Muḥammad Mahdī al-Jawāhirī]] (1899-1997); [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]] (1926-1964); [[Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati]] (1926-1999) &lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web| title = Iraq - The arts {{!}} history - geography| work = Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Iraq/The-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ma'rif al-Rasafi (1875-1845); Abdulraziq Abdulwahed (b. 1930); the revolutionary poet, [[Muzaffar Al-Nawab]] (b. 1934); Buland Al Haidari (b. 1926) and Janil Sidiq al-Zahaiwi (1863-1936). In post-war Iraq, poetry was very much influenced by the political and social upheavals that Iraqis had experienced throughout the 20th-century and with many poets living in exile, themes of 'strangeness' and 'being a stranger' often dominated contemporary poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Altoma, S.J., "Postwar Iraqi Literature: Agonies of Rebirth", ''Books Abroad'', Vol. 46, No. 2 (Spring, 1972), pp. 211-217 DOI: 10.2307/40126073&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi poets, including Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, often turned to Iraqi folklore which they often integrated with Western mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Gohar, S.M., "Appropriating English Literature in Post-WWII Iraqi Poetry", ''The Victorian'', vol. 5, no. 2. 2017, pp 10-22&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the most influential Arab poets because he was the first to develop the free form style of poetry, and therefore a prime mover in the development of modernist poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and  Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Iraqi poetry is considerably freer than traditional verse, and is imbued with social and political awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
[[File:Murad-Net Casting.jpg|thumb|left|''Casting the Net'' photograph by [[Murad al-Daghistani]] whose work captured the life and work of every-day people in 1930s' Mosul]]
Scholars point out that very little is known about photography in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, T., ''Photography, History, Difference'', Dartmouth College Press, 2014, pp 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq was relatively slow to adopt photography as an industry and art form, due to the religious and social prohibitions on making figurative images. The first camera entered Iraq as late as 1895 when an Iraqi photographer, Abdul-Karim Tiouti, from Basra, returned to Iraq following a trip to India where he had studied the art of photography. He founded a photographic studio and practiced this profession for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Kalash, K., "In Digital Technology, Solar Photography is a Time-immemorial Profession, " ''Iraq Journal,''; also reproduced in: ''Alahad News'', 26 May, 2016 [http://alahadnews.net/index.php/permalink/10051.html Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decades of the 20th-century, several factors contributed to the spread of photography. Firstly, British and European archaeologists began using photography to document ancient sites in the second half of the 19th-century. Religious missionaries were also using the camera to document historic religious sites. These activities exposed local Iraqis to the technology, and provided young men with employment opportunities as photographers and camera-men assisting archaeological teams. For instance, throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, the American anthropologist, [[Henry Field (anthropologist)|Professor Henry Field]] was involved in several expeditions to ancient Mesopotamian sites and in his publications, he acknowledged the assistance of Iraqi photographer by the name of Shauqat (who was a nephew of the photographer, Abdul-Karim Tiouti). The writer, [[Gertrude Bell]] also reports training a young boy in the process of developing photographs in Baghdad in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, G., ''The Letters of Gertrude Bell'',   Vol. 2 (1927), Project Gutenberg edition, 2004, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400461h.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; A second factor was that, in the 1920s, [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal I]] arranged for a photographic portrait of his wife, thereby popularising photographic portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;"The First Photographers", Iraq National Library and Archives, [http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/fp/journal60/30.htm Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the years following the first world war, a number of photographers arrived in Iraq. Some of these were displaced Armenians, who had prior experience working with precision equipment, including cameras.&lt;ref&gt;El-Hagem B., "The Armenian Pioneers of Middle Eastern Photography," ''Palestine Studies,'' pp 22-26, [http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/31_hage_1.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; These early photographers were mostly concerned with photographing military scenes and personnel. Around this time, a photographer named Tartaran, set up a studio at the entrance to the Mosul Elementary School.&lt;ref&gt;Alaq, A., "The Origins of Photography in Iraq", ''Arab Pictures'', 24 December 2015, [https://blog.arabpx.com/التصوير-الفوتوغرافي-في-التاريخ-والعر-2/ Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; From there, local school children could observe the photographer at work. The influential Mosul photographer, [[Murad al-Daghistani]], who specialised in capturing the life and work of every-day people in Mosul, may have developed his passion for photography after watching Tartaran developing photographs in his dark-room. By the 1940s, the number of photographic studios had proliferated, especially in Mosul, Basra and Baghdad. Important 20th-century Iraqi photographers include: Amri Salim, Hazem Bak, Murad Daghistani, Covadis Makarian, Sami Nasrawi, Ahmed Al-Qabbani, Jassem Al-Zubaidi, Fouad Shaker and Rashad Ghazi amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;"The First Photographers", Iraq National Library and Archives, [http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/fp/journal60/30.htm Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest photographers used the medium to record an Iraqi way of life that was in danger of being lost as the country 'modernised'. The photographer, [[Latif al-Ani]], who is often described as the "father of Iraqi photography", was very much concerned with documenting cosmopolitan Iraqi life in the 1950s, as he saw it.&lt;ref&gt;Gronlund, M., "How Latif Al Ani Captured Iraq’s Golden Era through a Lens," ''The National,'' 6 May, 2018, [https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/how-latif-al-ani-captured-iraq-s-golden-era-through-a-lens-1.727789 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 20th-century, photography had become a popular medium for expressing social and political concerns. The artist, [[Jananne Al-Ani|Jananne al-Ani]] has explored the dichotomy of Orient/ Occident in her work, and has also used photography to question the wearing of the veil while Halim Alkarim uses blurred images to suggest the political instability of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Dabbagh, S., "Photographing Against the Grain: A History of Photography," Part I, ''Contemporary Practices,'' vol. 5, pp 40-51 [http://www.contemporarypractices.net/essays/volumeixphotographing%20against%20the%20grain.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Old city of Basra 1954.jpg|thumb|Shanashil (distinctive oriel window) in Basra, 1954]]
Modern architecture presented contemporary architects with a major challenge. A continuous tradition of both domestic and public architecture was evident, but failed to conform with modern materials and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th-century, architecture employed new styles and new materials and public taste became progressively modern. The period was characterised by original designs produced by local architects, who had been trained in Europe, including: [[Mohamed Makiya]], Makkiyya al-Jadiri, Mazlum, Qatan Adani and [[Rifat Chadirji]].&lt;ref&gt;Munif, A.R., "The Monument of Freedom," ''The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle Easern Studies,'' Spring, 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like visual artists, Iraqi architects searched for a distinctly national style of architecture and this became a priority in the 20th-century. Mohammed Makkiyya and Rifat Chadirji were the two most influential architects in terms of defining modern Iraqi architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Elsheshtawy, Y. (ed), ''Planning Middle Eastern Cities: An Urban Kaleidoscope'', Routledge, 2004, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Chadirji, who wrote a seminal book on Iraqi architecture, called this approach ''international regionalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., "Baghdad 1921-1958. Reflections on History as a ”strategy of vigilance”," Mona Deeb, World Congress for Middle-Eastern Studies, Jun 2005, Amman, Jordan, Al-Nashra, vol. 8, no 1-2, pp.69-93, 2006; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 80; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; He explains: 

{{blockquote|"From the very outset of my practice, I thought it imperative that, sooner or later, Iraq create for itself an architecture regional in character yet simultaneously modern, part of the current   international avant-garde style." &lt;ref&gt;Cited in Pieri, C., " Modernity and its Posts in constructing an Arab capital.: Baghdad’s urban space and architecture, context and questions," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin,'' The Middle East Studies Association of North, 2009, Vol. 42, No. 1-2, pp.32-39, &lt;halshs-00941172&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

Architects sought an architectural language that would remind visitors of ancient Iraqi architectural history.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, architects used Iraqi motifs in their designs&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardsson, M.T., "Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad," in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century,'' University of Washington Press, 2008, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated traditional design practices, such as temperature control, natural ventilation, courtyards, screen walls and reflected light within their work.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects also became designers who designed furniture and lighting with reference to the peculiarities of Iraqi climate, culture and material availability.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

As cities underwent a period of "modernisation" in the early decades of the 20th-century, traditional structures came under threat and subject to demolition.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., "Baghdad 1921-1958. Reflections on History as a ”strategy of vigilance”," Mona Deeb, World Congress for Middle-Eastern Studies, Jun 2005, Amman, Jordan.

The architect, Rifat Chadirji along with his father, Kamil Chadirji, feared the [[vernacular architecture]] and ancient monuments would be lost to the new development associated with the oil boom in the mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; They documented the region photographically and in 1995, published a book entitled, ''The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940,'' which recorded the buildings and lifestyles of the Iraqi people.&lt;ref&gt;Chadirji, R., ''The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940,'' London, I.B. Tauris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, [[Lorna Selim]], who taught drawing at [[Baghdad University]]'s Department of Architecture, in the 1960s took her students to sketch traditional buildings along the Tigris and was especially interested in exposing young architects to Iraq's [[vernacular architecture]], alley-ways and historical monuments. The work of Selim and Chadirji inspired a new generation of architects to consider including traditional design features - such as Iraqi practices of temperature control, natural ventilation, courtyards, screen walls and reflected light - in their designs.&lt;ref&gt;Uduku, O.

=== Visual arts===
During the first three decades of the 20th-century, there was little progress in art. Following World War One, a group of Polish officers, who had been part of the Foreign Legion,&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in Baghdad and introduced local artists to a European style of painting, which in turn fostered a public appreciation of art. The Institute of Fine Arts and the Fine Arts Society were established in 1940-41 &lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, D., ''Images of Enchantment: Visual and Performing Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 1998, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi Artists' Society was founded in 1956, after which many exhibitions were mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Salīm, N., ''Iraq: Contemporary Art,'' Volume 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, British rule was overthrown and [[Abdul Karim Qasim]] assumed power. This led to triumphant demonstrations and expressions of national pride. In early 1959, Qasim commissioned [[Jawad Saleem]] to create ''[[Freedom Monument (Baghdad)|Nasb al-Hurriyah]]'' (''Monument to Freedom,'')  to commemorate Iraq's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, N., "Political Modernism, Jabrā, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group," ''CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture,'' Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&amp;context=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes] in: ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began to look to their history for inspiration and employed arabesque geometry and calligraphy as visual elements in their compositions, and referred to folk tales and scenes drawn from everyday life for artistic inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, the Ba'ath Party mounted a program to beautify the city of Baghdad which led to numerous public art works being commissioned. Designed to instil a sense of national pride within the population, and to immortalise the leader, Saddam Hussein, these works provided work opportunities to the nation's architects, engineers and sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;al-Kalil, S., ''Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq.'' Berkeley, University of California Press, pp 72-75&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, artists showed a distinct preference for abstract works, which allowed them to evade censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The "Free" art of Occupation: Images for a "New" Iraq," ''Arab Studies Quarterly,'' Vol. 28, No. 3/4 2006, pp. 41-53&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad is now dotted with monuments, including [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] and [[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier]] and the [[Victory Arch]], along with many smaller statues, fountains and sculptures; all constructed in the second half of the 20th-century, and showing increasing levels of abstraction over time. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the Iraqi visual arts scene lies in artists' desires to link tradition and modernity in artworks. For a number of artists, the use of calligraphy or script has become an important part of integrating traditional artistic elements into an abstract artwork. In this way, the use of letters connects Iraqi artists with the broader [[hurufiyya movement]] (also known as the ''North African Lettrist Movement).'' The Iraqi artist, [[Madiha Omar]], who was active from the mid-1940s, was one of the pioneers of the hurufiyya movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington as early as 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119; Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], Online: https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

===Art groups===

The 20th-century Iraqi arts scene is notable for the number of different art groups or art movements that emerged in the post-colonial period. Each of these groups sought to forge a national art aesthetic that acknowledged Iraq's deep art heritage and incorporated it in contemporary artworks. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80&lt;/ref&gt; collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; These groups include:

====''Al-Ruwad'' (The Pioneers) ====
: The Pioneers, Iraq's first modern art group, was formed by painter, [[Faeq Hassan|Faiq Hassan]] in the 1930s. This group was stimulated by the contact between Iraqi artists and European artists who had resided in Iraq during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq,'' University of California Press, 2005, p. 82; Kohl, P.L. Kozelsky, M., Ben-Yehuda, N. (eds), ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; This group consciously developed a distinct Iraqi style by incorporating local phenomena and traditional village life into artworks. &lt;ref&gt; Kohl, P.L. Kozelsky, M., Ben-Yehuda, N. (eds), ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008, pp 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected the artificial atmosphere of the artist’s studio and encouraged artists to engage with nature and traditional Iraqi life. They held their first exhibition in 1931.&lt;ref name="Sabrah,S.A 2010, pp 7-9"&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

:This group was responsible for taking the first steps towards bridging the gap between modernity and heritage. Artists active in the group had been educated abroad, returned with a European aesthtic, yet wanted to paint local scenes and landscapes. Members included: [[Faeq Hassan]], [[Jawad Saleem]], Ismail al Sheikhli, Nadhim Ramzi and the architect-painter, Kamil Chadirji.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The group continued to meet into the 1970s, although some of its high profile members withdrew from the group at different times. For instance, Faeq Hassan left the group in 1962. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] also broke away from the Pioneers and formed a different group in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 69-70; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:];  Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Jum'at al Ruwwad'' (The Avantgarde Group and later known as the Primitive Group)====
: Formed in 1950, the ''Jum'at al Ruwwad'' (Avantgarde Group) was inspired by Mespotamian art and Iraqi folklore. It later changed its name to the ''Primitive Group.''&lt;ref&gt; Baram, A., "Culture in the Service of Wataniyya: The Treatment of Mesopotamian Art," ''Asian and African Studies,'' Vol. 17, Nos. 1-3, 1983, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The group was initially led by [[Faeq Hassan]] (Baghdad 1914-1992) and later by Isma'il al-Shaykhali (Turkey b. 1927). Artists in this group were inspired by ancient art of the 13th-century [[Baghdad School]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,''Scorpion, 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group included: Ismail Al-Sheikhly, Issa Hanna, Zeid Salih, [[Mahmoud  Sabri]], Khalid Al Qassab, Dr Qutaiba Al Sheikh Nouri, Dr Nouri Mutafa Bahjat, Kadhem Hayder, [[Nuri al-Rawi]], Ghazi Al Saudi, Mahmoud Ahmed, Mohammed Ali Shakir, Sami Haqqi, Hassan Abid Alwan, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Lorna Selim|Lorna Saleem]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khamis, U. (ed.), "An Historical Overview: 1900s-1990s," in: ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London, Saqi Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

: Under B'ath rule, the group grew in prestige, and its members were frequently offered lucrative posts at the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; This group was one of the more enduring, and continued meeting throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Jama’et  Baghdad  lil  Fen  al-Hadith'' (The  Baghdad  Modern  Art  Group)====
: Established in 1951, by [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], after they broke away from the Pioneers group,&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 69-70; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:];  Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; its aims were to reassert a national identity and use art to build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced its ancient heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan, the group's leader promoted the idea of ''istilham al-turath'' – "seeking inspiration from tradition" and wrote a manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founder, Hassan, wrote that, after the 1958 independence, artists were no longer responsible for preserving art and culture, instead the state was responsible for "turath" - safeguarding public taste; all that remained was for artists to absorb turath, free from historical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan, and others, believed that earlier artists, such as Jawad Saleem, had shouldered too great a burden of historical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; This group is credited with being the first Islamic art group to develop a local style.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

: While the Modern Art Group sought to connect with Islamic tradition, the group was distinguished from earlier art groups in that it sought to express modern life, while keeping tradition and heritage in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Key members of this group included: Nuri al-Rawi (b. 1925) who became the Minister for Culture; [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] (1920-1994); [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] (1929-2011); [[Khaled al-Rahal]] (1926-1987) and 'Atta Sabri (1913-1987), all of whom had been members from the group's foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 495; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Mahmud Sabri (1927-2012); Tariq Mazlum (b.1933), [[Nuri al-Rawi]] (b. 1925), Mahmoud Sabri (b. 1927), Ata Sabri (b.1913), and [[Kadhim Hayder]].&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, p. 69; Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 495; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Baghdad Modern Art Group was moribund within a decade of its formation.&lt;ref name="Salīm, N. 1977, p. 7"&gt;Salīm, N., ''Iraq: Contemporary Art,'' Volume 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; One of its co-founders, Jawad Saleem died in 1961, while the other co-founder, Shakir Hassan Al Said, suffered a mental and spiritual crisis as a result of the continuing turbulence and political instability following the 1958 revolution and the overthrow of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M12&lt;/ref&gt;   

====''The Impressionists'' ====
: The Impressionists emerged in 1953, and organised around the artist, [[Hafidh al-Droubi]] (1914-1991), who had trained in London and had turned to impressionism and cubism.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 278; Faraj, M., ''Strokes Of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, a trend towards abstraction was evident amongst Iraqi artists, who wanted to embrace a more modern aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; However, al-Droubi pointed out that the Iraqi landscape, with its endless horizons, bright colours and open fields, was quite different to European landscapes and required different techniques. Unlike the art groups that preceded it, the Impressionists published no manifesto, and lacked the philosophical underpinnings evident in the Baghdad Modern Art Group or the New Vision.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Haydari, B., "Jawad Salim and Faiq Hasan and the Birth of Modern Art in Iraq," ''Ur,'' Vol. 4, 1985,  p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Al Mujadidin'' (The Innovationists)====
: Established in 1965, the ''Al Mujadidin'' was formed by a group of younger artists including: [[Salim al-Dabbagh]], [[Faeq Hassan]], [[Saleh al-Jumai'e]] and [[Ali Talib (artist)| Ali Talib]]. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 50-51; Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Group members were united along intellectual, rather than stylistic grounds. This group, which lasted only four years,&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; rebelled against traditional art styles and explored the use of new materials such as collage, aluminum and mono-type.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, C., "The Reason for the Project Art in Iraq Today", in: Azzawi, D. (ed.), ''Art in Iraq Today'', Abu Dhabi, Skira and Meem, 2011, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; These artists exhibited distinct individual styles, but often chose war and conflict for their themes, especially the 1967 war.&lt;ref&gt;Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M.,  ''Modernism and Iraq'', Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University, New York, 2009, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Majmueat Al-Zawiya'' (The Corners Group)====
: Simply known as the al-Zawiya group, it was founded in 1967 by [[Faeq Hassan]], against a highly political backdrop.  This group wanted to use art to focus on social and political issues and to serve national causes. The group held just one exhibition in its inaugural year. &lt;ref&gt;"Profile: Faik Hassan," ''Al Jazeera'', 31 October, 2005, [https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html Online"]; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 141; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Al-Ru’yah al-Jadida'' (The New Vision) ====
: Following decades of war and conflict, culminating in the July Revolution of 1958, artists began to feel free to find inspiration in a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Culture and Arts, ''Culture and arts in Iraq: Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the July 17–30 Revolution,'' The Ministry, Iraq, 1978, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the Baghdad Modern Art Group contributed to an environment where many artists worked individually, developing their own style, while still maintaining the broad trends of the Modern Baghdad Art group. Founded in 1968, by artists  [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]]; Muhammed  Muhr al-Din, Hashimi al-Samarchi, Salih Jumai'e, Rafa al-Nadiri and [[Dia Azzawi]], &lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al-Ru’yah al-Jadida'', represented a free art style where many artists believed that they needed to be true to their own era.&lt;ref name="Salīm, N. 1977, p. 7"/&gt; This group promoted the idea of freedom of creativity within a framework of heritage.&lt;ref name="Sabrah,S.A 2010, pp 7-9"/&gt; 

:The group's manifesto articulated the need for new and daring ideas, &lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and read in part:

{{Blockquote|"We believe that heritage is not a prison, a static phenomenon or a force capable of repressing creativity so long as we have the freedom to accept or challenge its norms... We are the new generation. We demand change, progression and creativity. Art stands in opposition to stasis. Art is continually creative. It is a mirror to the present moment and it’s the soul of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Saad, Q., "Contemporary Iraqi Art: Origins and Development," ''Scope'' vol. 3, November, 2008, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''Jama’et al-Bu’d al Wahid'' ([[One Dimension Group]]) ====
: Founded in around 1971 by the Iraqi artist and intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], this group sought a new artistic identity, drawn from within Iraqi culture and heritage. The group's founder, Al Said, published a manifesto for the group in the Iraqi newspaper, ''al-Jamhuriyyah,''  in which he outlined his vision for a national art aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. For al-Said, the one dimension was "eternity' - the relationship between the past and the present - the linking of Iraq's artistic heritage with modern abstract art. &lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The group held their first exhibition in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G.

: In practice, this group blended Arabic motifs, especially calligraphy, albeit in a deconstructed form, and geometric shapes into their contemporary and abstract artworks. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of this group was significant for the Calligraphic School of Art, which was based on the principles set out by Al-Said.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The New Vision had a lasting impact on the pan-Arab region, through the art movement known as hurufiyya.&lt;ref&gt;Baram A., "Art With Local and Mesopotamian Components," in: ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba‘thist Iraq, 1968–89,'' [St Antony’s/Macmillan Series], London, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 1991, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

: Founding members of the One Dimension group include: [[Rafa al-Nasiri]], [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], [[Nuri al-Rawi]], [[Dia Azzawi]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]], Hashem Samarchi (b. 1939), [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashem al-Baghdadi]] (1917-1973) and Saad Shaker (1935-2005).&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture'', Kassel University Press, 2017, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other 20th-century groups ====
Other art groups, including the ''Triangle Group'', the ''Shadows'' (formed by [[Ali Talib (artist)|Ali Talib]]) and the ''Academicians'' formed throughout the 1970s, but few lasted for more than a year or two.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Jamaat el-Jidaar'' (The Wall Group)====
: Established in 2007, this group of artists, many students at the Institute of Fine Arts, work on public projects in order to beautify the city of Baghdad. Paid a very modest stipend by the Ministry of Works, these artists have painted concrete slabs along the Tigris River, thereby transforming ruins left over from the revolution into modern works of art. (The slabs had previously served as protection from bombardment.) Although this group did little to develop a new aesthetic, it was able to provide employment and encouragement for young artists, who at that time were operating in a void since most of the artists of the preceding generation were living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, pp 95- 96; Farrell, S., "With Fixtures of War as Their Canvas, Muralists Add Beauty to Baghdad," ''New York Times,'' August 11, 2007, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/world/middleeast/11murals.html Online:]; Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Artists active in ''Jamaat el-Jidaar'' include  Ali Saleem Badran and Gyan Shrosbree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B., "Artists resist pressure to be more sectarian," Associated Press and Charlotte Observer, July 26, 2008 [http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/article8995490.html#storylink=cpy Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable Iraqi artists===
{{See|List of Iraqi artists}}

[[File:20160102-Tahrir square Baghdad.jpg|thumb|''Nasb al-Hurriyah'' [[Freedom Monument (Baghdad)]], a sculpture by [[Jawad Saleem]], 1959-1961]]
Iraq has produced a number of world-class painters and sculptors including [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]] (1934-2008), Khalid Al-Jadir (1924-1990), and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Faeq Hassan]] (1914-1992), considered the founder of modern [[Plastic arts|plastic art]] in Iraq, was among several Iraqi artists who were selected to study art at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] before the [[Second World War]]. Hassan and the art group he founded formed the foundation of Iraq's strong 20th-century artistic tradition. Hassan founded the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad; many of Iraq's best known artists studied at this institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Profile: Faik Hassan - Al Jazeera English| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jawad Saleem]] (b. 1919) is a painter and sculptor from Baghdad who (together with [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat|Mohammed Ghani]] (1929-2011) and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Hassan Shakir]]) (1925-2004), founded the influential Baghdad Modern Art Group in 1951. Saleem was commissioned to create the ''Monument of Freedom'' in Baghdad's city centre overlooking Liberation Square.&lt;ref name=kember&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Kember| first = Pamela| title = Benezit Dictionary of Asian Artists| accessdate = July 20, 2017| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleem, and his student, [[Khaled al-Rahal]] have been described as "the two pillars of modern Iraqi art." &lt;ref&gt; Kahalid al-Kishtyan in 1981, cited in: Baram, A., "Culture in the Service of Wataniyya: The Treatment of Mesopotamian Art," ''Asian and African Studies,'' Vol. 17, Nos. 1-3, 1983, pp 265-309 and in Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dia Azzawi]]{{'}}s (b. 1939) work, described as contemporary art, includes references to [[Arabic calligraphy]], as well as [[Sumer]]ian and [[Assyria]]n art.&lt;ref name=kember/&gt; Azzawi has been the inspiration for many contemporary [[calligraffiti]] artists. 

[[Jamil Hamoudi]] (1924-2003) is both a painter and sculptor. Like Azzawi, Hamoudi also studied at the Baghdad School of Fine Art. He was interested in the [[cubist]] movement and in 1947, he self-identified with the [[surrealist]] movement, only to later distance himself citing "A dark, saturnine atmosphere emanated from [their canvases] the effect of which was to arouse a feeling of despair in human beings."  His paintings are brightly coloured and make use of shapes like circles, triangles and arches. For sculpture he frequently uses plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.&lt;ref name=kember/&gt; In 1973 he was appointed to the directorship of the Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture. 

Other notable artists include: [[Madiha Omar]] (1908–2005) who is regarded as a pioneer of the [[Hurufiyya movement]]; [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] (1925-2004); [[Hassan Massoudy]] (b. 1944); [[Khaled al-Rahal]] (1926-1987); Saadi Al Kaabi (b 1937); Ismael Al Khaid (b. abt 1900) and [[Rafa al-Nasiri]] (b. 1940).

==Recent developments==

From 1969, the [[Arab nationalist]] political agenda of the [[Baath party|Ba'ath Party]] encouraged Iraqi artists to create work that would explain Iraq's new national identity in terms of its historical roots. The Iraqi Ministry of Culture is involved in efforts to preserve tradition Irai crafts like leatherworking, copper working, and carpet making.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;
[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|The toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in [[Firdos Square]], Baghdad shortly after the Iraq War invasion. The removal of statues was part of a de-Ba'athification process]]
In 2003, during the overthrow of the Ba'ath government, key institutions, including the Pioneers Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, were looted and vandalised. Approximately 8,500 paintings and sculptures, especially were stolen or vandalised. The occupying forces insisted on a voluntary return of stolen artworks, a position which resulted in very few works being returned. A few independent galleries purchased artworks with a view to returning them once a suitable national museum could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; A committee, headed by the respected artist and sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], was formed with the objective of recovering stolen artworks and proved somehwat more effective.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, pp 105 -120; Sabrah, S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, pp 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, some 1,500 artworks had been recovered, including important works, such as the statue, ''Motherhood'' by Jawad Saleem.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, pp 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, attempts at de-Ba'athification have been evident, with the announcement of plans to rid Baghdad's cityscape of monuments constructed during Saddam Husssein's rule. However, due to public pressure, plans have been made to store such monuments rather than arrange for their total destruction as had occurred in previous regimes. In addition, efforts are underway to erect new monuments which display significant figures from Iraq's history and culture. Recent developments also include plans to conserve and convert the former homes of Iraqi artists and intellectuals, inclduing the artist, Jawad Saleem, the poet, [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Future Pasts: Iraq in a State of Suspension," in: ''Through the roadblocks: Realities in Raw Motion: Conference Reader,'' School of Fine and Applied Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, 2012, pp 89-102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Iraq was again involved in violence as coalition forces entered the country. Many artists fled Iraq. The Ministry of Culture has estimated that more than 80 percent of all Iraqi artists are now living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The number of artists living abroad has created opportunities for new galleries in London and other major centres to mount exhibitions featuring the work of exiled artists from Iraqi and Middle Eastern. One such gallery is Soho's Pomegranate gallery established in the 1970s by the modernist Iraqi sculptor, Oded Halahmy, which not only mounts exhibitions, but also holds permanent collections of notable Iraqi artists. &lt;ref&gt;Hope, B., "Iraqi Art - in New York," ''New York Sun,'' March 3, 2006; Riccardo, B., Hamit, B. and Sluglett,P., ''Writing the Modern History Of Iraq: Historiographical And Political Challenges,''World Scientific, 2012  pp 490-93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortages of art materials were commonplace in the aftermath of war.&lt;ref&gt;Rellstab, F.H. and  Schlote, C., ''Representations of War, Migration, and Refugeehood: Interdisciplinary Perspectives,'' Routledge,  2014, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, visual artists such as [[Hanaa Malallah]] and [[Sadik Kwaish Alfraji ]] turned to "found objects" and incorporated these into their artworks. Malallah consciously included shrapnel and bullets in her paintings and called this the ''Ruins Technique'' which allows her to not only make statements about war, but also to explore how objects become ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Asfahani, R., "Interview With Hanaa Malallah: Iraq’s Pioneering Female Artist," ''Culturetrip,'' 29 November 2016, [https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iraq/articles/interview-with-hanaa-malallah-iraq-s-pioneering-female-artist/ Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature, art and architecture are cultural assets in Iraq. However, certain archaeological sites, and museums have been ransacked by Islamic terrorists, notably the ancient city of Nimrud, near Mosul;&lt;ref&gt;Shaheen, K., "Outcry over ISIS destruction of Ancient Assyrian site of Nimrud," ''The Guardian,'' March 7, 2015, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/isis-destroys-ancient-assyrian-site-of-nimrud Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; the  Adad and Mashqi gates at Nineveh; the ancient city of Hatra &lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, A., "Photos of Ancient Landmarks and World Heritage Sites Destroyed by Terrorist Groups," ''International Business Times,'' August 23, 2016, [https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/photos-ancient-landmarks-world-heritage-sites-destroyed-by-terrorist-groups-1577633 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations has described acts of cultural vandalism as ''war crimes.'' &lt;ref&gt;Cullinane, S., Alkhshali, H. and Tawfee, M., "Tracking a Trail of Historical Obliteration: ISIS Trumpets Destruction of Nimrud," ''CNN News,'' [https://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/09/world/iraq-isis-heritage/index.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Islamic militants invaded the city of Mosul, destroying ancient monuments and statues, which they perceived to be blasphemous, and ransacked the History Museum. Mostafa Taei, a resident of [[Hamam al-Alil]] was jailed by [[ISIL]] when the terrorists took over his town in 2014. ISIL banned any images or artworks of the human form, and Taei says he was beaten when the group learned that he was still painiting. During this period, Taei's art "took a subversive turn, becoming a gruesome record of atrocities: decapitations, hangings, injured children and sobbing widows, all painted in an unschooled Naive art style." He also started to paint "martyr posters" that depict the soldiers and police officers who have died during the military operations to liberate [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = MacDiarmid| first = Campbell| title = Iraqi artist depicts life under ISIL| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/iraqi-artist-depicts-life-isil-170502162738617.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Nada Shabout, notes that the destruction of Iraqi art in the period after 2003, assumed both tangible and intangible forms. Not only were the artworks and art institutions looted or destroyed, but art production also suffered from the lack of availability of art materials and the loss of many intellectuals, including artists, who were forced into exile. This contributed to an environment that failed to nurture artists, and saw young, upcoming artists operating in a void.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, pp 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi monumental artworks, both ancient and modern, feature prominently on banknotes of the [[Iraqi dinar]].

The '''''Iron Science Teacher''''' is a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching. The competition originated at the [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher 2011|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/march15-2011/iron_science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, “[[Iron Chef]],” this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher: At the Explo and Live Webcast|url=http://press.exploratorium.edu/iron-science-teacher-live-webcast-june-2011/|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Contestants are currently or formally part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher."  Shows are also archived on the [http://www.exploratorium.edu/tv/index.php?project=11 Exploratorium's site].

Astrophysicist Dr. Linda Shore, Director of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute and host of the competition, says one goal of the Iron Science Teacher is to "provide teachers with ideas about how to teach multimillion dollar state and national science teaching standards using, trash, recyclables, and inexpensive materials" as well as "to allow teachers to receive applause for great teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.exo.net/~pauld/iron_science_teacher/ironsciencensta2003.html|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Back in 1997, the Exploratorium's Phyllis C. Wattis Webcast Studio was looking for new shows. During a staff brainstorming session, a fan of the popular Food Network television show, [[The Iron Chef]], suggested naming a secret ingredient for science teachers to use in an experiment to present to the audience. "It was honestly and truly a joke," Shore says. "We thought we'd do one show."&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.districtadministration.com/article/iron-science-teacher|publisher=District Administration|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Shows==
Now 10 to 12 shows are produced annually for the Exploratorium's website. "Secret" ingredients, which are revealed in advance to participants so they can practice, have included everything from ordinary baking soda and food coloring to Marshmallow Peeps and pantyhose.&lt;ref name=da /&gt;

==Spin-offs==
The Canadian Iron Science Teacher also parodies the popular TV series Iron Chef and is hosted by Jay Ingram of Daily Planet on Discovery Channel.&lt;ref name=calgary /&gt;   Unlike the Exploratorium version, where championship comes with no tangible prize, in the Canadian version, five "finalist" teachers, with their support teams, are selected to compete in the Iron Science Teacher finals at the University of Calgary in order to win a variety of cash prizes.  

Colorado Springs, CO initiated their own CoOL Iron Science Teacher Competition as part of their What If: A Festival of Creativity &amp; Innovation on September 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Springs CoOL Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.coolscience.org/CoolScience/Teachers/CSCSF2010-IronScience.htm|publisher=Cool Science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Duva Burke''' (May 5, 1897 – November 19, 1993) was an American [[literary theory|literary theorist]], as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[criticism]], and [[rhetoric|rhetorical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Toye, ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional [[rhetoric]] and view literature as "[[symbol|symbolic action]]."

Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his career, Burke has been praised by ''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'' as "one of the most unorthodox, challenging, and theoretically sophisticated American-born literary critics of the twentieth century." His work continues to be discussed by rhetoricians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;"Kenneth Burke." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85395/Kenneth-Burke] Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal history==
He was born on May 5 in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and graduated from [[Peabody High School (Pennsylvania)|Peabody High School]], where his friend [[Malcolm Cowley]] was also a student. While he attended [[Ohio State University]] to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the [[Boar's Head Society]].&lt;ref name=wolin&gt;

Edited by Bekah Shaia Dickstein, 2004. http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Burke__Kenneth.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenwich Village]] he kept company with [[avant-garde]] writers such as [[Hart Crane]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Gorham Munson]], and later [[Allen Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;Selzer, Jack. ''Kenneth Burke in Greenwich Village: Conversing with the Moderns, 1915–1931''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.

In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist  anthropologist [[Eleanor Leacock]] (1922–1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the [[The Dial#The Dial Award|Dial Award]] in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1934–1936, and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', edited by [[Stanley Kunitz|Stanley J. Kunitz]] and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight.  As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including [[Bennington College]], while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at [[Pennsylvania State University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110807002118/http://www.libraries.psu.edu//psul/speccolls/rbm/burke.html Special Collections Library]. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an [[autodidact]] and a self-taught scholar.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters from Kenneth Burke to William H. Rueckert, 1959-198", edited by William H. Rueckert, Indiana, Parlor Press LLC, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson [[Harry Chapin]], a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in [[Andover, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADE099E1B49D55&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "KENNETH BURKE, 96 PHILOSOPHER, WRITER ON LANGUAGE"], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', November 22, 1993. Accessed July 16, 2008. "Kenneth Burke, a philosopher who was influential in American literary circles, has died. He was 96. Mr. Burke died Friday of heart failure at his home in Andover, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persuasions and influences==
Burke, like many twentieth century theorists and critics, was heavily influenced by the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He was a lifelong interpreter of [[Shakespeare]] and was also significantly influenced by [[Thorstein Veblen]]. He resisted being pigeonholed as a follower of any philosophical or political school of thought, and had a notable and very public break with the [[Marxism|Marxists]] who dominated the literary criticism set in the 1930s.

Burke corresponded with a number of literary critics, thinkers, and writers over the years, including [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]], [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Hart Crane]], and [[Marianne Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.psu.edu/content/dam/psul/up/speccolls/documents/Burke-1_Correspondents.pdf "List of Correspondents in Kenneth Burke Papers"], Kenneth Burke Papers, Special Collections Library, Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers who have acknowledged Burke's influence include [[Harold Bloom]], [[Stanley Cavell]], [[J. Hillis Miller]], [[Susan Sontag]] (his student at the University of Chicago), [[Erving Goffman]],&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. N. (1978). ''Social Exchange, Dramaturgy and Ethnomethodology: Toward a Paradigmatic Synthesis.'' New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Hartman]], [[Edward Said]], [[René Girard]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Michael Calvin McGee]], [[Dell Hymes]] and [[Clifford Geertz]]. Burke was one of the first prominent American critics to appreciate and articulate the importance of Thomas Mann and André Gide; Burke produced the first English translation of "Death in Venice", which first appeared in ''The Dial'' in 1924. It is now considered to be much more faithful and explicit than H. T. Lowe-Porter's more famous 1930 translation.

Burke's political engagement is evident—''A Grammar of Motives'' takes as its epigraph, ''ad bellum purificandum'' (toward the purification of war).

American literary critic Harold Bloom singled out Burke's ''Counterstatement'' and ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' for inclusion in his "Western Canon".

Beyond his contemporary influences, Burke took [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teachings into account while developing his theories on rhetoric. A significant source of his ideas is Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''. Drawing from this work, Burke oriented his writing about language specifically to its social context. Similarly, he studied language as involving more than logical discourse and grammatical structure because he recognized that the social context of language cannot be reduced to principles of pure reason.

Burke draws a line between a Platonic and a more contemporary view of rhetoric, described as "old rhetoric" and "new rhetoric" respectively. The former is defined by persuasion by any means, while the latter is concerned with "[[Identification in Burkean rhetoric|identification]]."  In Burke's use of the word identification he is describing the process by which the speaker associates herself/himself with certain groups, such as a target audience.  
His idea of "identification" is similar to ethos of classical rhetoric, but it also explains the use of logos and pathos in an effort to create a lasting impression on the auditors. This theory differs from ethos most significantly in Burke's conception of artistic communication that he believes is defined by eloquence, which is "simply the end of art and therefore its essence."  The use of rhetoric conveys aesthetic and social competence which is why a text can rarely be reduced to purely scientific or political implications, according to Burke. Rhetoric forms our social identity by a series of events usually based on linguistics, but more generally by the use of any symbolic figures.  He uses the metaphor of a drama to articulate this point, where interdependent characters speak and communicate with each other while allowing the others to do the same.  Also, Burke describes identification as a function of persuasive appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Gregory. [https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/2207/27%281%29+50-59.pdf?sequence=1 "Kenneth Burke's Rhetorical Theory within the Construction of the Enthnography of Speaking."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke defined [[rhetoric]] as the "use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents." His definition builds on the preexisting ideas of how people understand the meaning of rhetoric. Burke describes rhetoric as using words to move people or encourage action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Furthermore, he described rhetoric as being almost synonymous with persuasion (A Rhetoric of Motives, 1950). Burke argued that rhetoric works to bring about change in people. This change can be evident through attitude, motives or intentions as Burke stated but it can also be physical. Calling for help is an act of rhetoric. Rhetoric is symbolic action that calls people to physical action. Ultimately, rhetoric and persuasion become interchangeable words according to Burke. Other scholars have similar definitions of rhetoric. [[Aristotle]] argued that rhetoric was a tool for persuading people (but also for gaining information). He stated that rhetoric had the power to persuade people if the speaker knew how. One way in which Aristotle formed his arguments was through [[syllogism]]. Another example of how rhetoric was used to persuade was deliberate discourse. Here, politicians and lawyers used speech to pass or reject policies. [[Sally Miller Gearhart|Sally Gearhart]] states that rhetoric uses persuasion to induce change. Although she argues persuasion is violent and harmful, she uses it as a tool herself to bring about change.

==Philosophy==
The political and social power of ''symbols'' was central to Burke's scholarship throughout his career. He felt that through understanding "what is involved when we say what people are doing and why they are doing it", we could gain insight into the cognitive basis for our perception of the world. For Burke, the way in which we decide to narrate gives importance to specific qualities over others. He believed that this could tell us a great deal about how we see the world.

===Dramatism===
Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis "[[dramatism]]" and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality.

Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as "a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."  His [[definition of humanity]] states that "man" is "the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Definition of Man." ''The Hudson Review'' 16 4 (1963/1964): 491-514&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Richard M. "Defining Rhetoric—and Us: A Meditation on Burke's Definition." ''Composition Theory for the Postmodern Classroom''. Eds. Olson, Gary A. and Sidney I. Dobrin. Albany: SUNY Press, 1994. 332-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols.

Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the [[dramatistic pentad]].  The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism "invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action" (Grammar of Motives xxii).  Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant [[sociological criticism|sociological]] impact; he saw literature as "equipment for living," offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives.

===Rebirth Cycle===
Through the use of dramatism, one can ultimately utilize Burke's Rebirth Cycle.  This cycle encompasses three distinct phases, which include: Guilt/Pollution, Purification, and Redemption.  Burke introduced the phases and their functionality through the use of a poem.  The poem follows, 
Here are the steps
In the Iron Law of History That welds Order and Sacrifice 
Order leads to Guilt
(For who can keep commandments!) Guilt needs Redemption
(for who would not be cleaned!) Redemption needs Redeemer (which is to say, a Victim!) 
Order
Through Guilt
To Victimage
(hence: Cult of the Kill)..." (p. 4-5) &lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Burke's poem provides a basis of for the interactions of the three phases. Order's introduction into the life of human enables the creation of guilt. In order to alleviate the results produced by the creation of Guilt, redemption is necessitated.  Through the abstraction of redemption, Burke leads to the completion of the cycle.

Pollution initially constitutes actions taken by an individual that result in the creation of Guilt.  The creation of Guilt occurs upon the rejection of a hierarchy. Challenges to relationships, changes in power, and appropriateness of behaviors to change are each contributing factors toward the formation of Guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Rybacki, Karyn &amp; Rybacki, Donald. Communication Criticism: Approaches and Genres. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is appropriate to draw parallels between the creation of Guilt, and the concept of original sin. Original sin constitutes "... an offense that cannot be avoided or a condition in which all people share".&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K., Foss, Karen A., and Trapp, Robert. Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, Inc., 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt represents the initial action that strips a situation of its perceived purity. The establishment of Guilt necessarily leads to the need to undergo purification to cleanse the individual affected by its recognition.  Purification is thus accomplished through two forms of "ritual purification." Mortification and victimage represent the available avenues of purification

Stratification within society created by hierarchies allows for marginalization within societies.  Marginalization thus is a leading factor in the creation of Guilt, and leads to the need for mortification. Burke stated, "In an emphatic way, mortification is the exercising of oneself in 'virtue'; it is a systematic way of saying no to Disorder, or obediently saying yes to Order".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. The Rhetoric of Religion. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortification allows an individual's self-sacrifice which consequently enables them to rid themselves of impurities. Purification will only be reached, if it is equal to an individual's degree of guilt.  If mortification cannot be reached, individuals will ultimately be forced to project, "his conflict upon a scapegoat, by 'passing the buck,' by seeking a sacrificial vessel upon which he can vent, as from without, a turmoil that is actually within".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kennth. A Rhetoric of Motives. Berkley: University of California Press, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrificial vessels allow for the extermination of an individual's Guilt while enabling them to remain virtuous. 
Victimage is the second form of ritual purification. Burke highlights society's need to rectify division within its ranks. He contended that "People so dislike the idea of division, their dislike can easily be turned against the man or group who would so much as name it, let alone proposing to act upon it".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth"The Rhetoric of Hitler's "Battle."" Readings in Rhetorical Criticism. Ed. Carl R. Burgchardt. State College: STRATA Publishing, Inc. 2010. 238-253.&lt;/ref&gt; Victimage allows for the creation of a scapegoat that serves as a depository of impurities in order to protect against entities that are alien to a particular society. The scapegoat takes on the sins of the impure, thus allowing redemption for the Guilty party.  Unfortunately, through the course of these actions the scape goat is harnessed with the sins of the Guilty.

Redemption is reached through one of two options. Tragic redemption revolves around the idea that guilt combines with the principles of perfection and substitution in order that victimage can be utilized. This can be viewed as the "guilty is removed from the rhetorical community through either scapegoating or mortification".&lt;ref&gt;Borchers, Timothy. Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction, Long Grove: Waveland Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Comic enlightenment is the second form of redemption.  This option allows the sins of the guilty to be adopted by Society as a whole, ultimately making Society guilty by association.

===Terministic screen===
Another key concept for Burke is the [[Terministic screens|Terministic screen]]—a ''set'' of symbols that becomes a kind of ''screen'' or grid of intelligibility through which the world makes sense to us.  Here Burke offers rhetorical theorists and critics a way of understanding the relationship between language and ideology.  Language, Burke thought, doesn't simply "reflect" reality; it also helps ''select'' reality as well as ''deflect'' reality. In ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), he writes, "Even if any given terminology is a ''reflection'' of reality, by its very nature as a terminology it must be a ''selection'' of reality; and to this extent must function also as a ''deflection'' of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bizzell | last2 = Herzberg | title = The Rhetorical Tradition | edition = 2 | editors = Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg | pages = 1340–47 | accessdate = 2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Burke describes terministic screens as reflections of reality—we see these symbols as things that direct our attention to the topic at hand. For example, photos of the same object with different filters each direct the viewer's attention differently, much like how different subjects in academia grab the attention differently.  Burke states, "We must use terministic screens, since we can't say anything without the use of terms; whatever terms we use, they necessarily constitute a corresponding kind of screen; and any such screen necessarily directs the attention to one field rather than another." Burke drew not only from the works of Shakespeare and Sophocles, but from films and radio that were important to pop culture, because they were teeming with "symbolic and rhetorical ingredients." We as a people can be cued to accept the screen put in front of us, and mass culture such as TV and websites can be to blame for this. Media today has altered terministic screens, or as [[Richard Toye]] wrote in his book ''Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction'',  the "linguistic filters which cause us to see situations in particular fashions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Killian, Justin |author2=Larson, Sean |author3=Emanuelle Wessels |title=Language as Symbolic Action|url=http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/LASA.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toye|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-19-965136-8|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==
In "Definition of Man", the first essay of his collection ''Language as Symbolic Action'' (1966), Burke defined humankind as a "symbol using animal" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). This [[definition of man]], he argued, means that "reality" has actually "been built up for us through nothing but our symbol system" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Without our encyclopedias, atlases, and other assorted reference guides, we would know little about the world that lies beyond our immediate sensory experience. What we call "reality," Burke stated, is actually a "clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present . . . a construct of our symbol systems" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). College students wandering from class to class, from English literature to sociology to biology to calculus, encounter a new reality each time they enter a classroom; the courses listed in a university's catalogue "are in effect but so many different terminologies" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). It stands to reason then that people who consider themselves to be Christian, and who internalize that religion's symbol system, inhabit a reality that is different from the one of practicing Buddhists, or Jews, or Muslims. The same would hold true for people who believe in the tenets of free market capitalism or socialism, Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian depth psychology, as well as mysticism or materialism. Each belief system has its own vocabulary to describe how the world works and what things mean, thus presenting its adherents with a specific reality (no page reference).

Burke's poetry appears in four collections: ''Book of Moments'' (1955), ''Collected Poems 1915–1967'' (1968), the posthumously published ''The Late Poems: 1968-1993 Attitudinizings Verse-wise, While Fending for One's Selph, and in a Style Somewhat Artificially Colloquial'' (2005), and ''Here &amp; Elsewhere: The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Burke'' (2005).

'''Maker education''' (a term coined by [[Dale Dougherty]] in 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators|last=Dougherty|first=Dale|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-0415539203|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] learning, is an approach to [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and [[project-based learning]] that relies upon hands-on, often collaborative, learning experiences as a method for solving authentic problems. People who participate in making often call themselves "makers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifehacker.com/im-dale-dougherty-founder-of-make-magazine-and-this-i-1742793651|title=I'm Dale Dougherty, Founder of Make: Magazine, and This Is How I Work|last=Orin|first=Andy|newspaper=Lifehacker|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[maker movement]] and develop their projects in [[makerspace]]s, or development studios which emphasize prototyping and the repurposing of found objects in service of creating new inventions or innovations. Culturally, makerspaces, both inside and outside of schools, are associated with collaboration and the free flow of ideas. In schools, maker education stresses the importance of learner-driven experience, interdisciplinary learning, peer-to-peer teaching, iteration, and the notion of "failing forward", or the idea that mistake-based learning is crucial to the [[Learning|learning process]] and eventual success of a project.

== Influences ==
Maker education is an offshoot of the [[maker movement]], which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described as "the umbrella term for independent innovators, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]'', as well as hands-on [[Maker Faire]]s that are catnip for [[:Category:Do it yourself|DIYers]] who used to toil in solitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/104210/maker-faire-maker-movement/|title=Why the Maker Movement Is Important to America's Future|last=Bajarin|first=Tim|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale Dougherty, founder of the Maker Faire and ''Make'' magazine, stated in his 2011 TED Talk that "We are all makers. We are born makers. We don't just live, but we make." In the same TED Talk, Dougherty also called for making to be embraced in education, as students are the new generation of makers. Another central contributor to the maker movement, [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], who was once the editor-in-chief of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] and is now the CEO of [[3D Robotics]], wrote a manifesto of the maker movement in 2012, called "Makers". His third book, ''[[Makers: The New Industrial Revolution]]'' (2012), emphasizes the role that making has to play in the renaissance of American manufacturing. Mark Hatch, who is now the CEO of [[TechShop]], also published "The Maker Movement Manifesto". In addition to these contributions, seminal texts include, ''Invent To Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom'' by [[Sylvia Libow Martinez]], and ''The Art of Tinkering,'' by Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich, founders of The Tinkering Studio at the [[Exploratorium]].

In the United States, hands-on learning through making has roots in the nineteenth century, as a result of the influence of educators such as [[Calvin M. Woodward]], who established the Manual Training School of Washington University on June 6, 1879. Unlike later [[Vocational education in the United States|vocational education]] that would take hold in 1917 through the Smith-Hughes Act that had the aim of reducing the United States reliance on foreign trade, the impetus for the Manual Training School was to provide students with training in making and craftsmanship that had "no immediate vocational goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Transformation of the School: Progressivism in American Education, 1876–1957]]|last=Cremin|first=Lawrence|publisher=Vintage|year=1961|isbn=978-0394705194|location=New York|pages=26|quote="no immediate vocational goal."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's maker education highlights students' potential to "change the world"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makered.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=About Maker Ed|website=makered.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "let their imaginations run wild"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while also emphasizing building students' entrepreneurship skills and ability to earn money by selling their inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Make:|title=Why Education Needs the Maker Movement - Betty Ray|date=2015-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twcuJG733y4|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of the late nineteenth century is sometimes also referenced in relationship with the maker movement. The Arts and Crafts movement, which originated in Britain before taking hold in Europe and North America, was anti-industrial, critical of machinery and factory production, advocating instead for a return to traditional craftsmanship.

== Development and expansion ==
Since 2005, maker education has gained momentum in schools across the United States and around the world. Proponents of the [[maker movement]] cite the potential for making to bring more women to [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields and close the [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gap]]. Other potential benefits and goals for making include creating greater [[educational equity]] among students in public schools, and the possibility for making to be a driver in educational and societal change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fablearn.stanford.edu/fellows/blog/steam-de-trojan-horse-making-%E2%80%9Dinclusivity%E2%80%9D|title=STEAM, de Trojan Horse for Making "Inclusivity" {{!}} FabLearn Fellows|website=fablearn.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other educators and innovators have developed offshoot curriculum and technologies related to the intersection of [[critical thinking]] and [[making]], called [[critical making]].

In school models, such as the Lighthouse Community Charter, a charter school in Oakland, California, Aaron Van der Woorf, the robotics teacher leads the students in Maker Ed. At the [[The Park School|Park School]], in collaboration with Harvard's Project Zero, students hold a mini maker faire in school that also acts as a fundraiser for the school. Some districts have also adopted maker education district-wide, such as the district of [[Elizabeth Forward School District|Elizabeth Forward]], just south of Pittsburgh, which partnered with [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] to provide professional development for teachers through working with students on Maker Ed. Principals in Albemarle County schools cite Superintendent Pam Moran as instrumental in bringing maker education to their school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-02-albemarle-county-schools-journey-from-a-makerspace-to-a-maker-district|title=Albemarle County Schools' Journey From a Makerspace to a Maker District (EdSurge News)|newspaper=EdSurge|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to bringing maker education to schools, scholars like Paulo Blikstein of Stanford University and Dennis Krannich of the University Bremen, in Germany, state that, "Digital fabrication and 'making,' and the positive social movement around them, could be an unprecedented opportunity for educators to advance a progressive educational agenda in which project-based, interest-driven, student-centered learning are at the center stage of students' educational experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blikstein|first=Paulo|last2=Krannich|first2=Dennis|year=2013|title=The makers' movement and FabLabs in education: experiences, technologies, and research|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 12th international conference on interaction design and children|volume=|pages=613–616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penketh High School Became the first school in the United Kingdom to embedded maker education into the UK education system in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/16038242.Penketh_High_becomes_first_state_school_in_the_country_to_build_dedicated__makerspace_/|title=Penketh High becomes first state school in the country to build dedicated 'makerspace'|website=Warrington Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama Administration has also strongly supported the growing maker movement as an integral part of STEM education, which it hopes will increase American students ability to compete globally in the areas of science, engineering, and math. At the White House, President Obama hosted the first ever White House Maker Faire in June, 2014, adopting the idea that Americans are a "Nation of Makers". On the Nation of Makers webpage, Americans are encouraged to join the movement, asserting that "empowering students and adults to create, innovate, tinker, and make their ideas and solutions into reality is at the heart of the Maker Movement". Since the first-ever White House Maker Faire, the Obama Administration has "continued to support opportunities for students to learn about STEM through making, expand the resources available for maker entrepreneurs, and foster the development of advanced manufacturing in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/nation-of-makers|title=The First White House Maker Faire|website=The White House|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2015, the President announced the National Week of Making, June 17–23, to support the Nation of Makers. In 2016, President Obama renewed his commitment to maker education by continuing the National Week of Making. The National Maker Faire will include participation from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Navy (Navy), the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At the time of this announcement, the President also detailed the progress that had been made on the Nation of Makers. He announced, 
* Eight Federal agencies are announcing new grants, education initiatives, training, knowledge networks, and other supports to help create more makers and assist more entrepreneurs to take prototypes to scale with new ventures.
* More than 1,400 K–12 schools, representing almost 1 million students from all 50 states, are committing to dedicating a space for making, designating a champion for making, and having a public showcase of student projects.
* More than 100 additional commitments including the distribution of 1 million foldable microscopes to children around the world by Foldscope Instruments; the investment in 100 new makerspaces by Google as part of the Making Spaces program; and new steps to support making at 77 universities and colleges through Make Schools Alliance.
In addition to these developments, on June 17, 2016, the White House issued a press release, detailing the next steps the United States government will take to support the development and expansion of maker education.

== Critique ==
{{See also|Critical theory of maker education}}
Though maker education has been embraced by thousands of schools and school districts across the United States and abroad, there has also emerged criticism of the movement.

Among the critics is [[Evgeny Morozov]], a Belarusian writer and researcher, whose work focuses on the impact, both social and political, of technology. In his article published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', entitled, "Making It: Pick up a spot welder and join the revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/13/making-it-2|title=Making It|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morozov criticizes [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] for "confusing the history of the Web with the history of capitalism and ends by speculating about the future of the maker movement, which, on closer examination, is actually speculation on the future of capitalism". He also criticizes companies and organizations that were once committed to open source software for becoming acquired by for-profit companies and embroiled in copyright and trademark lawsuits. Morozov also criticizes the maker movement's major contributors financial relationship with [[DARPA]], which made a $10 million grant to support maker education for high school students, and $3.5 million to [[TechShop]] to establish new [[makerspaces]].

While Morozov is one of the more vocal critics of maker education, he is not the only one. Debbie Chachra, associate professor at Olin College of Engineering, in her article in January 23, 2015 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled, "Why I Am Not a Maker",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/|title=Why I Am Not a Maker|last=Chachra|first=Debbie|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; centers her criticism on "the social history of who makes things—and who doesn't". Chachra describes the history of the "makers" of products as men, rather than those who cared for "hearth and home", that is, historically, women. She calls for recognition of "the work of the educators, those that analyze and characterize and critique, everyone who fixes things, all the other people who do valuable work with and for others—above all, the caregivers—whose work isn't about something you can put in a box and sell". In "A more lovingly made world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=2013|title=A More Lovingly Made World|url=|journal=Cultural Studies Review|volume=19|pages=296–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[McKenzie Wark]] of [[The New School]], Wark writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don't actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn't teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] and Mark Hatch evoke Marx in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer.

Finally, Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of [[Northwestern University]], and Meg Escude of [[Exploratorium]], offer an in-depth look at the ways in which maker education reinforces [[educational inequality]]. They begin by offering Haitian writer, [[Edwidge Danticat]]'s commentary on making: "If you can't afford clothes, but you can make them--make them. You have to work with what you have, especially if you don't 'have a lot of money. You use creativity, and you use imagination." Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude make the case that true making is often born from difficult environmental circumstances, and that what local communities once did as part of their daily lives (offering an exchange of skills and knowledge, for example, to help others in need in the community) is now being offered to low-income neighborhoods as an intervention program, promising greater educational equality. They argue that the "American Maker" highlighted by [[Dale Dougherty]] in his 2011 Ted Talk, is symptomatic of the problems associated with [[American exceptionalism]], in that it is "grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices". Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for "equity-oriented design" of maker experiences which include, "critical analyses or educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making".

A '''mesophile''' is an [[organism]] that grows best in moderate [[temperature]], neither too hot nor too cold, typically between {{convert|20|and|45|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and Lansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is mainly applied to [[microorganism]]s.  Organisms that prefer extreme environments are known as [[extremophiles]]. Mesophiles have diverse classifications, belonging to two [[domain (biology)|domain]]s: [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and to [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Fungi]] of domain [[Eukaryote|Eucarya]].  Mesophiles belonging to the domain Bacteria can either be [[gram-positive]] or [[gram-negative]]. Gram-positive bacteria have a cell layer made of [[peptidoglycan]] and stains purple. Gram-negative bacteria also contains peptidoglycan, yet the layer is extremely thin and stains red or pink. Oxygen requirements for mesophiles are not just confined to [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]. There are three basic shapes of mesophiles: [[coccus]], [[bacillus]], and [[spiral]].

==Habitat==
The habitats of mesophiles can include [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]. They are often included during fermentation of [[beer]] and [[wine]] making.  Since normal human body temperature is 37 [[celsius|°C]], the majority of human [[pathogens]] are mesophiles, as are most of the organisms comprising the [[human microbiome]].

== Vs. extremophiles==
Mesophiles are the opposite of [[extremophile]]s. Extremophiles that prefer cold environments are termed  [[psychrophile|psychrophilic]], those preferring warmer temperatures are termed [[Thermophile|thermophilic or thermotropic]] and those thriving in extremely hot environments are [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]].
A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to classify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hao Zheng|author2=Hongwei Wu|title=Gene-centric association analysis for the correlation between the guanine-cytosine content levels and temperature range conditions of prokaryotic species|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|year=2010|volume=11|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S7|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-S11-S7|pmc=3024870|pmid=21172057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
All bacteria have their own optimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive. Many factors are responsible for a given organism's optimal temperature range, but evidence suggests that the expression of particular genetic elements ([[alleles]]) can alter the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the organism. A recently published study demonstrated that mesophilic bacteria could be genetically engineered to express certain alleles from psychrophilic bacteria, consequently shifting the restrictive temperature range of the mesophilic bacteria to closely match that of the psychrophilic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pankowski|first1=Jarosław A.|last2=Puckett|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Nano|first3=Francis E.|title=Temperature Sensitivity Conferred by ligA Alleles from Psychrophilic Bacteria upon Substitution in Mesophilic Bacteria and a Yeast Species|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=15 March 2016|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1924–1932|doi=10.1128/AEM.03890-15|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/82/6/1924.short|issn=0099-2240|pmid=26773080|pmc=4784036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the less stable structure of mesophiles, it has reduced flexibility for [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vijayabaskar, Mahalingam S. et al. "Construction of Energy Based Protein Structure Networks: Application in the Comparative Analysis of Thermophiles and Mesophiles" Biophysical Journal, Volume 98 , Issue 3 , 387a&lt;/ref&gt; Mesophiles are not able to synthesize proteins in low temperatures. It is more sensitive to temperature changes, and the [[fatty acid]] composition of the [[membrane]] does not allow for much [[Membrane fluidity|fluidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = K.Y. | last2 = Torres | first2 = J. A. | year = 1993 | title = EFFECTS of TEMPERATURE and SOLUTE ON the MINIMUM WATER ACTIVITY FOR GROWTH and TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTIC of SELECTED MESOPHILES and PSYCHROTROPHS | url = | journal = Journal of Food Processing and Preservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 305–318 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-4549.1993.tb00733.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the optimal temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 8&amp;nbsp;°C leads to a gradual decrease in protein synthesis. [[Cold-induced proteins]] (CIPs) are induced during low temperatures, which then allows [[Cold-shock domain|cold-shock proteins]] (CSPs) to synthesize. The shift back to the optimal temperature sees an increase, indicating that mesophiles are highly dependent on temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, F., Hébraud, M., Junter, G.-A. and Jouenne, T. "Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli at 4°C. Electrophoresis." 2000, 21: 1625–1629. doi:10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(20000501)21:8&lt;1625::AID-ELPS1625&gt;3.0.CO;2-4&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen availability also affects microorganism growth.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, N. A. ; Stokes, J. L. " ROLE OF OXYGEN IN THE HIGH CELL YIELDS OF PSYCHROPHILES AND MESOPHILES AT LOW TEMPERATURES." The Journal of Bacteriology, 1963, Vol. 85(1), p.164 [Peer Reviewed Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two explanations for thermophiles being able to survive at such high temperatures whereas mesophiles can not. The most evident explanation is that thermophiles are believed to have cell components that are relatively more stable than the cell components of mesophiles which is why thermophiles are able to live at higher temperatures than mesophiles.&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koffler|first=Henry|date=2016-11-28|title=PROTOPLASMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MESOPHILES AND THERMOPHILES1|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=21|issue=4|pages=227–240|issn=0005-3678|pmc=180904|pmid=13488883}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A second school of thought, as represented by the writings of Gaughran (21) and Allen (3), believes that rapid resynthesis of damaged or destroyed cell constituents is the key to the problem of biological stability to heat."&lt;ref name="Koffler 227–240"/&gt;

==Oxygen requirements==
Due to the diversity of mesophiles, oxygen requirements greatly vary. [[Aerobic respiration]] requires the use of [[oxygen]] and anaerobic does not. There are three types of [[anaerobes]]. [[Facultative anaerobes]] grow in the absence of oxygen, using [[fermentation]] instead. During fermentation, sugars are converted to [[acids]], [[alcohol]], or [[gasses]]. If there is oxygen present, it will use aerobic respiration instead. [[Obligate anaerobe]]s cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. [[Aerotolerant anaerobe]]s can withstand oxygen.

==Roles==
Microorganisms play an important role in [[decomposition]] of organic matter and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of [[nutrients]]. In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] environments, the diversity of the [[ecosystem]] allows for the diversity of mesophiles. The functions of each mesophile rely on the surroundings, most importantly temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;Ferroni, G.D., Kaminski, J.S. "Psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, and mesophiles in an environment which experiences seasonal temperature fluctuations." Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 1980, 26:1184-1191, 10.1139/m80-198&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacteria]] such as mesophiles and [[thermophile]]s are used in the [[cheesemaking]] due to their role in [[fermentation]]. "Traditional [[microbiologist]]s use the following terms to indicate the general (slightly arbitrary) optimum temperature for the growth of bacteria: [[psychrophile]]s (15–20 °C), [[mesophiles]] (30–37 °C), thermophiles (50–60 °C) and extreme thermophiles (up to 122 °C)".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark. "Mesophilic and Thermophilic Cultures Used in Traditional Cheesemaking." Cheese and Microbes. Washington: ASM Publishing. 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Both mesophiles and thermophiles are used in cheesemaking for the same reason; however, they grow, thrive and die at different temperatures. [[Psychrotrophic bacteria|Psychrotrophic]] bacteria contribute to dairy products spoiling, getting mouldy or going bad due to their ability to grow at lower temperatures such as in a refrigerator.

==Examples==
Some notable mesophiles include ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Other examples of [[species]] of mesophiles are ''[[Clostridium kluyveri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas maltophilia]]'', ''[[Thiobacillus novellus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. Different types of diseases and infections typically have pathogens from mesophilic bacteria such as the ones listed above.

===''Listeria monocytogenes''===
''Listeria monocytogenes'' is a gram-positive bacterium. It is closely related to ''Bacillus'' and ''Staphylococcus''. It is a rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe that is motile by peritrichous [[flagella]]. ''L. monocytogenes'' motility is limited from 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA/&gt; At the optimal temperature, it loses its motility. This bacterium is responsible for [[listeriosis]] which derives from contaminated food.&lt;ref name=LISTERIA&gt;Magalhã£Es, R. (2014). Listeria monocytogenes. 450-461.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
''Staphylococcus aureus'' was first identified in 1880.&lt;ref name=AUREUS/&gt; It is responsible for different infections stemming from an injury. The bacterium overcomes the body's natural mechanisms. Long lasting infections of ''S. aureus'' includes [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], and [[osteomyelitis]]. ''S. aureus'' is commonly contracted in hospital settings.&lt;ref name=AUREUS&gt;Todd, E. (2014). Staphylococcus Aureus. 530-534&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Escherichia coli''===
''Escherichia coli'' is a gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobic bacterium that does not produce [[spores]].&lt;ref name=COLI/&gt; The bacterium is a member of [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. It is capable of producing [[enterotoxins]] which are [[thermolabile]] or [[thermostable]].&lt;ref name=COLI&gt;Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt0051LGG3/encyclopedia-food-microbiology/escherichia-coli&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of ''E. coli'' are that it is [[oxidase]]-negative, [[citrate]]-negative, [[methyl red|methyl-red]] positive, and [[Voges-Proskauer]]-negative. To sum up ''E. coli'', it is a [[coliform]]. It is able to use [[glucose]] and [[acetate]] as a carbon source for fermentation. ''E. coli'' is commonly found in the [[Digestive system|gut]] of living organisms.&lt;ref name=ROBINSON/&gt; ''E. coli'' has many capabilities such as being a [[host (biology)|host]] for [[recombinant DNA]] and being a pathogen.&lt;ref name=ROBINSON&gt;Robinson, Richard K.. (2000). Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Volumes 1-3 - Escherichia Coli. Elsevier.

* '''''Master-classes'''''

The Contemporary museum of calligraphy regularly organizes master-classes of Russian calligraphers and famous masters of writing art from abroad.

As the link between calligraphy and other kinds of art is very close, the museum cooperates with the artists, musicians, poets and other people of art for organization of little events.

* '''''The National School of Calligraphy'''''

The School was open on November, 2010. The School’s aim is to show people what calligraphy art is, explore the history of different fonts, teach to use different pens, give basics of beautiful writing. The senior professor is Yury Koverdyaev, graphic artist, calligrapher, member of Russian Union of Artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/about/Reports/VideoReports.aspx?ItemID=1681 |title=Kultura (Culture) TV-channel – Culture News (News Hour).

== Impact ==
NECTEC has used green technology in the field of printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/gadget/288200/nectec-promotes-printing-future&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the foundation of  [[Thailand Organic and Printed Electronics Innovation Centre]] (TOPIC). NECTEC along with public and private sectors have researched the technical feasibility of using [[organic electronics]] in printing ink. It has successfully developed [[graphene]]-based conductive ink in 2011. The ink has five times more conductivity than a typical ink. It is also cheap, contains no contamination, and is suitable for various applications.
It has also developed a software called "Size-Thai"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sizethailand.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; that uses [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] body scan to measure the anatomical dimensions of Thai people. This makes Thailand the second nation in Asia to use such a software after Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationmultimedia.com/2009/03/03/technology/technology_30096958.php&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to reduce wastage and help garment retailers to reduce losses. It also has business applications like "virtual-try on" and "made to measure".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16551">A '''paperless office''' (or '''paper-free office''') is a work environment in which the use of paper is eliminated or greatly reduced. This is done by converting documents and other papers into digital form, a process known as [[digitization]]. Proponents claim that "going paperless" can save money, boost productivity, save space, make documentation and information sharing easier, keep personal information more secure, and [[Environmental impact of paper|help the environment]]. The concept can be extended to communications outside the office as well.

==Definition==
The paperless world was a [[publicist]]'s slogan, intended to describe the [[office of the future]]. It was facilitated by the popularization of video display computer terminals like the 1964 [[IBM 2260]]. An early prediction of the paperless office was made in a 1975 ''[[Business Week]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Office of the Future |journal=Business Week |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1975-06-30/the-office-of-the-futurebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |issue=2387 |date=30 June 1975 |pages=48–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that office automation would make paper redundant for routine tasks such as record-keeping and [[bookkeeping]], and it came to prominence with the introduction of the [[personal computer]]. While the prediction of a PC on every desk was remarkably prophetic, the "paperless office" was not. Improvements in [[computer printer|printer]]s and [[photocopier]]s have made it much easier to reproduce documents in bulk, causing the worldwide use of office paper to more than double from 1980 to 2000.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{Citation |title=Technological comebacks: Not dead, just resting|journal=The Economist|date=2008-10-09|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to the increased ease of document production&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; and widespread use of electronic communication, which has resulted in users receiving large numbers of documents that are often printed out. However, since about 2000, at least in the US, the use of office paper has leveled off and is now decreasing, which has been attributed to a generation shift;&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; younger people are believed to be less inclined to print out documents, and more inclined to read them on a full-color interactive display screen. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the average office worker generates approximately two pounds of paper and paperboard products each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/paper/setting/schoolwork.htm |title= Wastes - Resource Conservation - Common Wastes &amp; Materials - Paper Recycling |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "The Paperless Office" was first used in commerce by [[Micronet, Inc.]], an automated office equipment company, in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Paperless Office Trademark Registration |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4801:gp9aaa.2.7 |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditional offices have [[paper]]-based filing systems, which may include [[filing cabinet]]s, folders, shelves, [[microfiche]] systems, and drawing cabinets, all of which require maintenance, equipment, considerable space, and are resource-intensive. In contrast, a paperless office could simply have a desk, chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dK-kontorstole.dk/| title=Office Chairs}} Retrieved 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and computer (with a modest amount of local or network storage), and all of the information would be stored in digital form. [[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] could also be used to facilitate the storage of information digitally.

Once computer data is printed on paper, it becomes out-of-sync with [[computer database]] updates. Paper is difficult to search and arrange in multiple sort arrangements, and similar paper data stored in multiple locations is often difficult and costly to track and update. A paperless office would have a single-source collection point for [[distributed database]] updates, and a [[publish-subscribe]] system. Modern computer screens make reading less exhausting for the eyes; a laptop computer can be used on a couch or in bed. With [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, with many other low-cost value-added features like video animation, video clips, and full-length movies, many argue that paper is now obsolete to all but those who are resistant to technological change. [[eBook]]s are often free or low cost compared to hard-copy books.

Others argue that paper will always have a place because it affords different uses than screens [Sellen, A. J., &amp; Harper, R. H. R. (2003). The myth of the paperless office. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.]

==Environmental impact of paper==
{{Main|Environmental impact of paper}}
Paper product manufacturing contributes significantly to [[deforestation]] and man-made [[climate change]], and produces [[greenhouse gas]]es. According to the [[American Forest &amp; Paper Association]], paper manufacturing is the third largest user of fossil fuels worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technewsworld.com/story/68834.html |title= Sustainability Software, Part 2: Cutting the Paper Chase |last1= Madden |first1= Ned |last2= |first2= |date= December 8, 2009 |work= |publisher= TechNewsWorld |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although measures such as [[recycling]] and using [[tree-free paper]] can help reduce the environmental impact of paper, most paper still ends up in landfills. Paper production also leads to air pollution, as paper manufacturing releases [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/air/do/asab/apoc/criteria_pollutants.htm |title= Air Pollutants of Concern |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |work= |publisher= New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are major contributors to [[acid rain]], whereas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[greenhouse gas]] responsible for [[climate change]]. Waste water discharged from pulp and paper mills contains solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter that are classified as [[pollutant]]s. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus can cause or exacerbate [[eutrophication]] of fresh water bodies.

Printing [[ink]]s and [[toner]]s are very expensive and use environment-damaging [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and non-renewable oils, although standards for the amount of heavy metals in ink have been set by some regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508062911/http://cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Which|date=May 2011}} [[Deinking]] recycled paper pulp results in a waste slurry, sometimes weighing 22% of the weight of the recycled wastepaper, which may go to [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html|title=Recycling Paper and Glass|date=September 2006|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eliminating paper via automation and electronic forms automation==
The need for paper is eliminated by using online systems, such as replacing index cards and [[rolodex]]es with databases, typed letters and faxes with email, and reference books with the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to eliminate paper is to automate paper-based processes that rely on forms, applications and surveys to capture and share data. This method is referred to as "electronic forms" or e-forms and is typically accomplished by using existing print-perfect documents in electronic format to allow for pre-filling of existing data, capturing data manually entered online by end-users, providing secure methods to submit form data to processing systems, and digitally signing the electronic documents without printing.

The technologies that may be used with electronic forms automation include -
* Portable Document Format ([[PDF]]) - to create, display and interact with electronic documents and forms
* E-form (electronic form) management software - to create, integrate and route forms and form data with processing systems
* Databases - to capture data for prefilling and processing documents
* Workflow platforms - to route information, documents and direct process flow
* E-mail (electronics email) communication which allows sending and receiving information of all kinds and enable attachments
* [[Digital signature]] solutions - to digitally sign documents (used by end-users)
* Web servers - to host the process, receive submitted data, store documents and manage document rights

One of the main issues that has kept companies from adopting paperwork automation is difficulty capturing digital signatures in a cost-effective and compliant manner. The [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act|E-Sign Act of 2000]] in the United States provided that a document cannot be rejected on the basis of an electronic signature and required all companies to accept digital signatures on documents. Today there are sufficient cost-effective options available, including solutions that do not require end-users to purchase hardware or software.

One of the great benefits of this type of software is that you can use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to search the full text of any file. Additionally, tags can be added to each file to make it easier to locate certain files throughout the entire system.

Some paperless software offers a scanner, hardware and software and works seamlessly in separating and organizing important documents. Paperless software might also allow people to enable online signatures for important documents that can be used in any small business or office. Document management and archiving systems do offer some methods of automating forms. Typically, the point in which document management systems start working with a document is when the document is scanned and/or sent into the system. Many document management systems include the ability to read documents via [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) and use that data within the document management system’s framework. While this technology is essential to achieving a paperless office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quikforms.com/WHITEPAPERAchievingThePaperlessOffice.pdf |title=Achieving The Paperless Office |last=Walker |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard D. Walker |journal=Efficient Technology Inc |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not address the processes that generate paper in the first place.

==Digitizing paper-based documents==
Another key aspect of the paperless office philosophy is the conversion of paper documents, [[photo]]s, engineering plans, [[microfiche]] and all the other paper based systems to digital documents. Technologies that may be used for this include [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, digital mail solutions, book copiers, wide format scanners (for engineering drawings), [[microfiche]] scanners, fax to PDF conversion, [[online post offices]], [[multifunction printer]]s and [[document management system]]s. Each of these technologies uses [[software]] that converts the [[raster format]]s (bitmaps) into other forms depending on need. Generally, they involve some form of [[image compression]] technology that produces smaller [[raster image]]s or use [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) to convert a document into text. A combination of OCR and raster is used to enable search ability while maintaining the original form of the document. An important step is the labeling related to paper-to-digital conversion and the cataloging of scanned documents. Some technologies have been developed to do this, but they generally involve either human cataloging or automated indexing on the OCR document. However, scanners and software continue to improve with the development of small, portable scanners that are able to scan doubled-sided A4 documents at around 30-35ppm to a raster format (typically [[TIFF]] fax 4 or [[PDF]]).

An issue faced by those wishing to take the paperless philosophy to the limit has been [[copyright]] laws. These laws may restrict the transfer of documents protected by copyright from one medium to another, such as converting books to electronic format.

==Securing and tracing documents==

As awareness of identity theft and data breaches became more widespread, new laws and regulations were enacted, requiring companies that manage or store [[personally identifiable information]] to take proper care of those documents. Paperless office systems are easier to secure than traditional filing cabinets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11678601/E-Office_An_Eco-friendly_Advent_of_Cloud_Computing_Technology|title=E-Office: An Eco-friendly Advent of Cloud Computing Technology|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and can track individual accesses to each document.

==Difficulties in adopting the paperless office==
A major difficulty in "going paperless" is that much of a business's communication is with other businesses and individuals, as opposed to just being internal. Electronic communication requires both the sender and the recipient to have easy access to appropriate software and hardware.  Costs and temporary productivity losses when converting to a paperless office are also a factor, as are government regulations, industry standards, legal requirements, and business policies which may also slow down the change. Businesses may encounter technological difficulties such as file format compatibility, longevity of digital documents, system stability, and employees and clients not having appropriate technological skills.

For these reasons, while there may be a reduction of paper, some uses of paper will likely remain indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Sellen, A. J., &amp; Harper, R. H. R. (2003). The myth of the paperless office. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a 2015 questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nearly Half of Businesses are or could go Paperless in 2015|url=http://www.margolis.co.uk/half-businesses-could-go-paperless-2015|publisher=www.margolis.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that nearly half of small/medium-sized businesses believed they were or could go paperless by the end of that year.

The '''Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology''', ('''POST''') is the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s in-house source of independent, balanced and accessible analysis of public policy issues related to science and technology.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/ |title=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST (rather distinctively) serves BOTH Houses of Parliament (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and equally the [[House of Lords]]) as a joint establishment, through output that is apolitical and of widely acclaimed value to Parliamentarians of all parties. Thorough quality-control ensures that [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Peerage|Peers]] can have confidence in its analyses should they wish to cite them in debate. These principles are reflected in the structure of [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#The POST Board|POST’s Board]] with members from the Commons and Lords together with distinguished scientists and engineers from the wider world.


==History==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Year !! Event
|-
| 1980s || Office first suggested
|-
| 1989 || POST launched (with charitable funding). Among other support, the UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development raised funds to provide POST with its first in-house environmental specialist adviser.
|-
| 1992 || POST was adopted as Parliamentary body by both Houses of the UK Parliament and subjected to five year reviews.

The UK Parliament made POST a permanent institution in 2001, after Dr Ian Gibson MP, POST's Chairman, Lord Flowers - vice-Chairman and Professor David Cope, Director, presented evidence to the then House of Commons Administration Committee to support the decision, which was endorsed later by the House of Lords.
|}

Since 1939, a group of MPs and peers interested in science and technology, through the first parliamentary "All Party Group",   the UK Parliamentary and Scientific Committee&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceinparliament.org.uk/ |title=Parliamentary and Scientific Committee |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (P&amp;S), had encouraged UK Parliamentarians to explore the implications of scientific developments for society and public policy. As the UK economy became more dependent on technological progress, and the varied effects of technology (especially on the environment) became more apparent, it was felt that UK Parliament needed its own resources on such issues. Parliamentarians not only required access to knowledge and insights into the implications of technology for their constituents and society, but also needed to exercise their scrutiny functions over UK government legislation and administration. This thinking was also influenced by the fact that specialised parliamentary science and technology organisations already existed overseas.

P&amp;S members ([[Ian Lloyd (UK politician)|Sir Ian Lloyd MP]], [[Trevor Skeet|Sir Trevor Skeet MP]], [[Gerard Vaughan (British politician)|Sir Gerry Vaughan MP]], Lords [[Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet|Kennet]], Gregson and [[Brian Flowers, Baron Flowers|Flowers]] among others) visited already established organisations in the US, Germany and France, and this reinforced their view that modern Parliaments needed their own ‘intelligence’ on science and technology-related issues. Initially they asked the then [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] to fund such services at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but were asked first to demonstrate a real need. This led to the P&amp;S creating a charitable foundation to raise funds from P&amp;S members.

The parliamentary reaction was positive and led to the appointment of a first Director, Dr Michael Norton.  In 1989, POST was formally established as a charitable foundation, though not an internal part of Parliament.

POST had attracted more resources by 1992 and then recruited 3 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Permanent staff|specialist science advisers]] and began its [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Fellows|fellowship]] programme with the [[UK research councils]].

In 1992 the House of Commons Information Committee, supported by the House of Lords, recommended that Parliament should itself fund POST for 3 years, and a subsequent review in 1995 extended this for a further 5 years. This was the result of POST demonstrating real interest and demand from MPs and peers.

POST's financial reliance on donations from bodies external to Parliament, even those as prestigious as the Royal Society, had always slightly compromised the perceived independence of the office.

From 1997 the chair of the POST board was appointed by government Whips. Since then, chairs have been [[Ian Gibson (politician)|Dr Ian Gibson MP]] 1997-2001, [[Phyllis Starkey|Dr Phyllis Starkey MP]] 2001-2005, and [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Dr Ashok Kumar MP]] 2005-2010. Dr Kumar died shortly before the UK 2010 General Election.  Since then, subject to parliamentary approval, the Chair of POST has been Adam Afiyie, MP.

In 1998 [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology#Officers|Professor David Cope]] took over as Director of POST. He guided the Office towards the goal of establishing POST as a permanent office of the UK Parliament - and dramatically expanded its staffing, wider links and more general recognition of its role as a special, distinctive, institution that the UK Parliament had agreed, enthusiastically, to endorse.

In 2001, both Houses decided that POST should indeed be established as a permanent [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] institution, funded exclusively by Parliament itself, through the two Houses, in a ratio of 70%/30%, Commons/Lords.

In 2009, POST celebrated its 20th anniversary with, among other events, a special conference, arranged by the Director, Prof Cope, on "Images of the Future".  The keynote participants were the Hon. Bart Gordon, Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology and Dr Jim Dator of the University of Hawaii Futures Research Centre, along with many other Members and staff of Parliaments across the world.

Because of the enthusiasm of Members of both Houses, POST had enjoyed a unique status within Parliament. It was from its inception attached administratively to the House of Commons COMMISSION (though always with its link to the House of Lords.)

This arrangement was intended specifically to distinguish the office and its functions from the Libraries of either House.  These conduct non peer-reviewed "studies", of varying quality.  POST - on the other hand - was expected to provide proactive analysis and options, freed from the immediate pressure of political or administrative expectations, trying to embrace futures thinking, and above all, to subject all its work to the most critical peer review analysis.

POST'S Director, Prof David Cope, returned to Cambridge University in 2012 and Dr. Chris Tyler was appointed by parliamentary authorities to a reduced role, which saw the fundamental rationale of POST as a "science and technology assessment" institution increasingly changed to one which more engaged with the ongoing debate on "science policy".

POST, from its foundation, had always been an institution "of", rather than "for" - science and technology -in other words - it did not in any way lobby for more public funds for scientific or technological research.  Dr Tyler, however, was closely involved with the "Campaign for Science and Engineering" - a UK body which does so lobby.  On appointment, he did not immediately resign his role in any lobbying body, and this continued seriously to undermine his perceived independence while head of POST.

Dr. Tyler left POST in 2017 for a secondary position at University College London.

The Acting Directorship of POST was taken over by a longstanding staff member, Dr Chandrika Nath, who was totally immune from any such lobbying role. In 2018, in a reconfirmed acknowledgement of POST's immutable science and technology assessment role, she was appointed Executive Director of the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the highly prestigious intergovernmental organisation.

Dr. Grant Hill-Cawthorne (University of Sydney) became Head of POST from May 2018.  

==Activities==

===Science and Technology in Parliament===
Most parliamentarians do not have a scientific or technological background but science and technology issues are increasingly integral to public policy. Parliamentarians are bombarded daily with lobbying, public enquiries and media stories about science and technology. These cover diverse areas such as medical advances, environmental issues and global communications. POST helps parliamentarians examine such issues effectively by providing information resources, in depth analysis and impartial advice. POST works closely with a wide range of organisations involved in science and technology, including [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committees]], [[All-Party Parliamentary Group|all-party parliamentary groups]], [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]], scientific societies, [[Think tank|policy think tanks]], business, academia and research funders.

===POST's aim===
POST's aim is to inform parliamentary debate through:
*Publishing POSTnotes (short briefing notes) and longer reports. POSTnotes can be downloaded from the publications section of the POST website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/publications/ POST Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Both focus on current science and technology issues and aim to anticipate policy implications for parliamentarians.
*Supporting select committees, with informal advice, oral briefings, data analyses, background papers or follow-up research. Committees may approach POST for such advice at any stage in an inquiry.
*Informing both Houses on public dialogue activities in science and technology.
*Organising discussions to stimulate debate on a wide range of topical issues, from small working groups to large lectures.&lt;ref name="Seminars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/ |title=POST Events |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Horizon-scanning to anticipate issues of science and technology that are likely to impact on policy

===How POST works===
A parliamentary board guides POST's choice of subjects. A team of advisers conduct analyses, drawing on a wide range of external expertise. All reports and POSTnotes are externally peer reviewed, and scrutinised by the board before publication.

POST's work falls into four topical areas:
*Biological Sciences and Health
*Physical Sciences and ICT
*Environment and Energy
*Social Sciences

===International activities===
POST is a member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] network, which brings together parliamentary organisations throughout Europe sharing information and working on joint projects.&lt;ref name="EPTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eptanetwork.org/|title=European Parliamentary Technology Assessment |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; POST also liaises with science and technology organisations across the world.

Between November 2005 to 2009, POST, collaborating with four of its sister organisations - at the [[Folketing|Danish]], [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Flemish Parliament|Flemish]] and [[Bundestag|German]] Parliaments - provided [[technology assessment]] services to the [[Science and Technology Options Assessment]] unit of the [[European Parliament]], in [[Brussels]] and [[Strasbourg]].

====POST Africa Programme====
From 2001 POST received a growing number of requests for advice from parliamentarians in developing countries. It became clear that a real need existed to strengthen capacity in developing country parliaments. In 2005, POST held discussions on this issue with the Gatsby Foundation,&lt;ref name="Gatsby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatsby.org.uk/ |title=The Gatsby Charitable Foundation |accessdate= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a special initiative to assist African Parliaments, and other organisations in their countries, in building parliamentary capacity to handle policy issues related to science and technology. At a time when there is growing awareness of the importance of science and technology in decision making, as demonstrated by, for example, the focus on science, technology and innovation at the [[African Union]] summit meeting in January 2007, this programme continues to contribute towards the overall objective of ensuring that parliaments have the capacity to scrutinise decision making processes and act as the national fora for discussion and debate on the broad implications of issues with a basis in science and technology. By sharing information and best practice with overseas parliaments and assemblies, the programme supports one of the primary objectives of the House: to promote public knowledge and understanding of the work and role of Parliament through the provision of information and access.

==The POST Board==
(Appointed 2010)

The POST Board oversees POST's objectives, outputs and future work programme. It meets quarterly. The Board comprises:
* 14 parliamentarians drawn from the House of Commons (10) and the House of Lords (4), roughly reflecting the balance of parties in Parliament.
* Leading non-parliamentarians from the science and technology community.
* Representatives of the House of Lords and the Department of Information Services of the House of Commons.

===Officers===
*Chairman: [[Adam Afriyie|Adam Afriyie MP]]
*Vice-Chairman: [[Robert Winston|Professor the Lord Winston]]
*Head: Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne

===House of Lords===
*Lord Oxburgh, KBE, PhD, FRS
*[[Simon Haskel, Baron Haskel|Lord Haskel]]
*Lord Patel, KT, FMedSci, FRSE

=== Externals ===
*Professor Frances R. Balkwill, OBE
*Professor Sarah Whatmore, FBA
*Paul Martynenko, FBCS
*Professor Sir Bernard Silverman, FRS, FAcSS

===''Ex Officio'' Board Members===
*Penny Young, [[The House of Commons Librarian]] and Managing Director Research &amp; Information, House of Commons
*Nicolas Besly, Clerk of Select Committees, House of Lords
*Edward Potton, Head of Science and Environment Section, House of Commons Library
*Lynn Gardner, Principal Clerk, Committee Office, House of Commons
*Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne, Head of POST

==POST staff==

===Permanent staff===
POST has eight science advisers, covering the fields of biology and health; physical sciences and ICT; environment and energy; and social sciences. Science advisers generally have a postgraduate qualification and science policy experience.

===Fellows===
POST runs formal fellowship schemes with scientific societies and research councils, whereby PhD students can spend three months working at POST through an extension of their maintenance grants. These include:

*[[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]

From the application point of view, the main objective of soil mapping is to accurately predict response of a soil-plant ecosystem to various soil management strategies. In other words, the main objective of pedometric mapping is to generate maps of [[soil map|soil properties and soil classes]] that can be used to feed other environmental models or for decision making. Pedometric mapping is largely based on applying [[geostatistics]] in soil science and other statistical methods used in [[pedometrics]].

Although pedometric mapping is mainly data-driven, it can also largely be based on use of expert knowledge. The expert knowledge, however, needs to be ''plugged-in'' into a pedometric computational framework so that it can be used to produce more accurate prediction models. For example, [[data assimilation]] techniques, such as the space–time [[Kalman filter]], can be used to integrate pedogenetic knowledge and field observations.&lt;ref name="Heuvelink2001Geoderma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heuvelink|first=G.B.M|author2=Webster, R|title=Modelling soil variation: past, present, and future|journal=Geoderma|date=30 April 2001|volume=100|issue=3-4|pages=269–301|doi=10.1016/S0016-7061(01)00025-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[information theory]] context, the objective of pedometric mapping is to describe the spatial complexity of soils (information content of soil variables over a geographical area), then represent this complexity using maps, summary measures, mathematical models and simulations.&lt;ref name=Hengl2012JAG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hengl|first=T.|author2=Nikolić, M. |author3=MacMillan, R.A. |title=Mapping efficiency and information content|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|date=31 March 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2012.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations are a preferred way of visualizing soil patterns as they represent both the deterministic pattern due to the landscape, geographic hot-spots and short range variability (see image below).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Pedometric vs traditional soil mapping ==

In traditional soil survey, spatial distribution of soil properties and soil bodies can be inferred using mental models which leads to manual delineations. Such methods can be considered to be subjective, and it is hence difficult or impossible to statistically assess the accuracy of such maps without additional field sampling. Traditional soil survey mapping has some limitations for use in a multithematic GIS related to the fact that is often not consistently applied by different mappers, it is largely manual and it is difficult to automate. Most of traditional soil maps in the world are based on manual delineations of assumed soil bodies, to which then soil attributes are attached.&lt;ref name="McBratney2003Geoderma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McBratney|first=A.B |author2=Mendonça Santos, M.L |author3=Minasny, B|title=On digital soil mapping|journal=Geoderma|date=1 November 2003|volume=117|issue=1-2|pages=3–52|doi=10.1016/S0016-7061(03)00223-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorsten2006JPNSS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Thorsten|author2=Scholten, Thomas|title=Digital soil mapping in Germany—a review|journal=Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=169|issue=3|pages=434–443|doi=10.1002/jpln.200521962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of pedometric mapping, all outputs are based on using rigorous statistical computing and are hence [[reproducible research|reproducible]].

Pedometric mapping is largely based on using extensive and detailed covariate layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derivatives, remote sensing imagery, climatic, land cover and geological GIS layers and imagery. Evolution of pedometric mapping can be closely connected with the emergence of new technologies and global, publicly available data sources such as the [[SRTM]] DEM, [[MODIS]], [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] and [[Landsat]] imagery, gamma radiometrics and LiDAR imagery, and new [[automated mapping]] methods.

== Pedometric mapping methods ==

Pedometric mapping methods differ based on the soil survey data processing steps:
* Sampling
* Data screening 
* Preprocessing of soil covariates
* Fitting of geostatistical model
* Spatial prediction
* Cross-validation / accuracy assessment
* Visualization of outputs

One of the main theoretical basis for pedometric mapping is the universal model of soil variation:&lt;ref name="Heuvelink2001Geoderma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burrough1986PGIS&gt;{{cite book|last=Burrough|first=P.A.|title=Principles of Geographical Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment|year=1986|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{s}) = m(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon '(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon ''&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{m(\mathbf{s})}&lt;/math&gt; is the deterministic part of soil variation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varepsilon '(\mathbf{s})}&lt;/math&gt; is the stochastic, spatially auto-correlated part of variation, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varepsilon ''}&lt;/math&gt; is the remaining residual variation (measurement errors, short-range variability etc.) that is also possibly dependent on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not modeled. This model has been first time introduced by French mathematician [[Georges Matheron]], and has shown to be the [[BLUP|Best Unbiased Linear Predictor]] for spatial data. One way of using this model to produce predictions or simulations is by means of [[regression-kriging]] (also known as universal [[kriging]]). In the case of soil data, the deterministic component of the model is often modeled using the soil forming factors: climate, organism, relief, parent material, or lithology, and time. This conceptual model is known as the [[Clorpt|CLORPT]] model, and has been the first time introduced to soil-landscape modelling by [[Hans Jenny (pedologist)|Hans Jenny]].&lt;ref name="Grunwald2006CRC" /&gt;

A special group of techniques of pedometric mapping focus on downscaling the spatial information that can be area-based or continuous. Prediction of [[soil taxonomy|soil classes]] is also another sub-field of pedometric mapping where specific geostatistical methods are used for the purpose of interpolation of factor-type of variables.

Pedometric mapping is also largely based on using novel technologies for measuring soil properties, also referred to as the [[digital soil mapping]] techniques. These include:
* [[Soil spectroscopy]] and proximal soil sensing (hand-held or vehicle-driven devices)
* [[Remote sensing]] systems for mapping and monitoring soils (e.g. [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]])
* [[LiDAR]] technology to produce [[digital elevation model]]s
* [[Precision agriculture]] technologies

While it focuses on the perspective of [[condensed matter physics]], polymer physics is originally a branch of [[statistical physics]]. Polymer physics and [[polymer chemistry]] are also related with the field of [[polymer science]], where this is considered the applicative part of polymers.

Polymers are large molecules and thus are very complicated for solving using a deterministic method. Yet, statistical approaches can yield results and are often pertinent, since large polymers (i.e., polymers with a large number of [[monomer]]s) are describable efficiently in the [[thermodynamic limit]] of infinitely many monomers (although the actual size is clearly finite).

Thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions, and modeling their effect requires using  principles from [[statistical mechanics]] and dynamics. As a corollary, temperature strongly affects the physical behavior of polymers in solution, causing phase transitions, melts, and so on.

The statistical approach for polymer physics is based on an analogy between a polymer and either a [[Brownian motion]], or other type of a [[random walk]], the [[self-avoiding walk]]. The simplest possible polymer model is presented by the [[ideal chain]], corresponding to a simple random walk. Experimental approaches for characterizing polymers are also common, using [[polymer characterization]] methods, such as [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[viscometry]], [[dynamic light scattering]], and Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions ([[ACOMP]])&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6052184 and US Patent 6653150, other patents pending&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

These experimental methods also helped the mathematical modeling of polymers and even for a better understanding of the properties of polymers.

==Models==

Models of polymer chains are split into two types: "ideal" models, and "real" models. Ideal chain models assume that there are no interactions between chain monomers. This assumption is valid for certain polymeric systems, where the positive and negative interactions between the monomer effectively cancel out. Ideal chain models provide a good starting point for investigation of more complex systems and are better suited for equations with more parameters.

===Ideal chains=== 
{{anchor|Ideal Chains}}

* The '''freely-jointed''' chain is the simplest model of a polymer. In this model, fixed length polymer segments are linearly connected, and all bond and torsion angles are equiprobable.&lt;ref&gt;H. Yamakawa, "Helical Wormlike Chains in Polymer Solution", (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The polymer can therefore be described by a simple random walk and [[ideal chain]].
* The '''freely-rotating''' chain improves the freely-jointed chain model by taking into account that polymer segments make a fixed bond angle to neighbouring units because of specific chemical bonding. Under this fixed angle, the segments are still free to rotate and all torsion angles are equally likely.
* The '''hindered rotation''' model assumes that the torsion angle is hindered by a potential energy. This makes the probability of each torsion angle proportional to a [[Boltzmann factor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\theta)\propto{}\exp\left(-U(\theta)/kT\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the potential determining the probability of each value of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

* In the '''rotational isomeric''' state model, the allowed torsion angles are determined by the positions of the minima in the rotational potential energy. Bond lengths and bond angles are constant.
* The '''[[Worm-like chain]]''' is a more complex model.  It takes the [[persistence length]] into account.  Polymers are not completely flexible; bending them requires energy.  At the length scale below persistence length, the polymer behaves more or less like a rigid rod.

===Real chains===

Interactions between chain monomers can be modelled as [[Excluded volume#In polymer science|excluded volume]]. This causes a reduction in the conformational possibilities of the chain, and leads to a self-avoiding random walk. Self-avoiding random walks have different statistics to simple random walks.

==Solvent and temperature effect==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The statistics of a single polymer chain depends upon the solubility of the polymer in the solvent. For a solvent in which the polymer is very soluble (a "good" solvent), the chain is more expanded, while for a solvent in which the polymer is insoluble or barely soluble (a "bad" solvent), the chain segments stay close to each other.  In the limit of a very bad solvent the polymer chain merely collapses to form a hard sphere, while in a good solvent the chain swells in order to maximize the number of polymer-fluid contacts.  For this case the [[radius of gyration]] is approximated using Flory's mean field approach which yields a scaling for the radius of gyration of:
::&lt;math&gt;R_g \sim N^\nu&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;R_g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of gyration]] of the polymer, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bond segments (equal to the degree of polymerization) of the chain and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Flory exponent]].

For good solvent, &lt;math&gt;\nu\approx3/5&lt;/math&gt;; for poor solvent, &lt;math&gt;\nu=1/3&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, polymer in good solvent has larger size and behaves like a [[fractal]] object.  In bad solvent it behaves like a solid sphere.

In the so-called &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; solvent, &lt;math&gt;\nu=1/2&lt;/math&gt;, which is the result of simple random walk.  The chain behaves as if it were an ideal chain.

The quality of solvent depends also on temperature.  For a flexible polymer, low temperature may correspond to poor quality and high temperature makes the same solvent good.  At a particular temperature called theta (θ) temperature, the solvent behaves as if an [[ideal chain]].

==Excluded volume interaction==
The [[ideal chain]] model assumes that polymer segments can overlap with each other as if the chain were a phantom chain.  In reality, two segments cannot occupy the same space at the same time.  This interaction between segments is called the [[excluded volume]] interaction.

The simplest formulation of excluded volume is the self-avoiding random walk, a random walk that cannot repeat its previous path.  A path of this walk of ''N'' steps in three dimensions represents a conformation of a polymer with excluded volume interaction.  Because of the self-avoiding nature of this model, the number of possible conformations is significantly reduced.  The radius of gyration is generally larger than that of the ideal chain.

==Flexibility and reptation==
Whether a polymer is flexible or not depends on the scale of interest.  For example, the [[persistence length]] of double-stranded [[DNA]] is about 50&amp;nbsp;nm. Looking at length scale smaller than 50&amp;nbsp;nm (Known as the McGuinness limit), it behaves more or less like a rigid rod.&lt;ref&gt;G.McGuinness, ''Polymer Physics'', Oxford University Press, p347&lt;/ref&gt; At length scale much larger than 50&amp;nbsp;nm, it behaves like a flexible chain.
[[Reptation]] is the thermal motion of very long linear, ''entangled'' [[macromolecules]] in [[polymer]] melts or concentrated polymer solutions. Derived from the word [[reptile]], reptation suggests the movement of entangled polymer chains as being analogous to [[snake]]s slithering through one another.&lt;ref name="Rubinstein"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.aps.org/units/dpoly/resources/degennes.cfm | title=Dynamics of Entangled Polymers | publisher=American Physical Society | accessdate=6 April 2015 | author=Rubinstein, Michael |date=March 2008  | conference=Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Symposium | location=New Orleans, LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]] introduced (and named) the concept of reptation into polymer physics in 1971 to explain the dependence of the mobility of a macromolecule on its length.

==Example model (simple random-walk, freely jointed)==

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

The study of long chain [[polymers]] has been a source of problems within the realms of statistical mechanics since about the 1950s.  One of the reasons however that scientists were interested in their study is that the equations governing the behavior of a polymer chain were independent of the chain chemistry.  What is more, the governing equation turns out to be a [[random walk]], or diffusive walk, in space.  Indeed, the [[Schrödinger equation]] is itself  a [[diffusion equation]] in imaginary time, ''t' = it''.

===Random walks in time===
The first example of a random walk is one in space, whereby a particle undergoes a random motion due to external forces in its surrounding medium.  A typical example would be a pollen grain in a beaker of water.  If one could somehow "dye" the path the pollen grain has taken, the path observed is defined as a random walk.

Consider a toy problem, of a train moving along a 1D track in the x-direction.  Suppose that the train moves either a distance of +''b'' or −''b'' (''b'' is the same for each step), depending on whether a coin lands heads or tails when flipped.  Lets start by considering the statistics of the steps the toy train takes (where ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ith step taken):

:&lt;math&gt;\langle S_{i} \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; ; due to ''a priori'' equal probabilities
:&lt;math&gt;\langle S_{i} S_{j} \rangle = b^2 \delta_{ij}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second quantity is known as the [[correlation function]].  The delta is the [[kronecker delta]] which tells us that if the indices ''i'' and ''j'' are different, then the result is 0, but if ''i'' = ''j'' then the kronecker delta is 1, so the correlation function returns a value of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This makes sense, because if ''i'' = ''j'' then we are considering the same step.  Rather trivially then it can be shown that the average displacement of the train on the x-axis is 0;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x \rangle = \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N S_i \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N \langle S_i \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

As stated &lt;math&gt;\langle S_i \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so the sum is still 0.  
It can also be shown, using the same method demonstrated above, to calculate the root mean square value of problem.  The result of this calculation is given below

:&lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt {\langle x^2 \rangle} = b \sqrt N. &lt;/math&gt;

From the [[diffusion equation]] it can be shown that the distance a diffusing particle moves in a medium is proportional to the root of the time the system has been diffusing for, where the proportionality constant is the root of the diffusion constant.  The above relation, although cosmetically different reveals similar physics, where ''N'' is simply the number of steps moved (is loosely connected with time) and ''b'' is the characteristic step length.  As a consequence we can consider diffusion as a random walk process.

===Random walks in space===
{{main|Ideal chain}}
Random walks in space can be thought of as snapshots of the path taken by a random walker in time.  One such example is the spatial configuration of long chain polymers.

There are two types of random walk in space: ''[[Self-avoiding walk|self-avoiding random walks]]'', where the links of the polymer chain interact and do not overlap in space, and ''pure random'' walks, where the links of the polymer chain are non-interacting and links are free to lie on top of one another.  The former type is most applicable to physical systems, but their solutions are harder to get at from first principles.

By considering a freely jointed, non-interacting polymer chain, the end-to-end vector is 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the vector position of the ''i''-th link in the chain.  
As a result of the [[central limit theorem]], if ''N'' ≫ 1 then we expect a [[Gaussian distribution]] for the end-to-end vector.  We can also make statements of the statistics of the links themselves;

* &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{r}_{i} \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; ; by the isotropy of space
* &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{r}_{i} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{j} \rangle = 3 b^2 \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; ; all the links in the chain are uncorrelated with one another

Using the statistics of the individual links, it is easily shown that 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf R \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf R \cdot \mathbf R \rangle = 3Nb^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Notice this last result is the same as that found for random walks in time.

Assuming, as stated, that that distribution of end-to-end vectors for a very large number of identical polymer chains is gaussian, the probability distribution has the following form

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{\left (\frac{2 \pi N b^2}{3} \right )^{3/2}} \exp \left(\frac {- 3\mathbf R \cdot \mathbf R}{2Nb^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

What use is this to us?  Recall that according to the principle of equally likely ''a priori'' probabilities, the number of microstates, Ω, at some physical value is directly proportional to the probability distribution at that physical value, ''viz'';

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega \left ( \mathbf{R} \right ) = c P\left ( \mathbf{R} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is an arbitrary proportionality constant.  Given our distribution function, there is a maxima corresponding to '''R''' = '''0'''.  Physically this amounts to there being more microstates which have an end-to-end vector of 0 than any other microstate.  Now by considering

:&lt;math&gt;S \left ( \mathbf {R} \right ) = k_B \ln \Omega {\left ( \mathbf R \right) } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S \left( \mathbf {R} \right ) = S \left( \mathbf {R} \right ) - S \left (0 \right )&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta F = - T \Delta S \left ( \mathbf {R} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the [[Helmholtz free energy]], and it can be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta F = k_B T \frac {3R^2}{2Nb^2} = \frac {1}{2} K R^2 \quad ; K = \frac {3 k_B T}{Nb^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as the [[potential energy]] of a spring, obeying [[Hooke's law]].

This result is known as the ''entropic spring result'' and amounts to saying that upon stretching a polymer chain you are doing work on the system to drag it away from its (preferred) equilibrium state.  An example of this is a common elastic band, composed of long chain (rubber) polymers.  By stretching the elastic band you are doing work on the system and the band behaves like a conventional spring, except that unlike the case with a metal spring, all of the work done appears immediately as thermal energy, much as in the thermodynamically similar case of compressing an ideal gas in a piston.

It might at first be astonishing that the work done in stretching the polymer chain can be related entirely to the change in entropy of the system as a result of the stretching. However, this is typical of systems that do not store any energy as potential energy, such as ideal gases. That such systems are entirely driven by entropy changes at a given temperature, can be seen whenever it is the case that are allowed to do work on the surroundings (such as when an elastic band does work on the environment by contracting, or an ideal gas does work on the environment by expanding). Because the free energy change in such cases derives entirely from entropy change rather than internal (potential) energy conversion, in both cases the work done can be drawn entirely from thermal energy in the polymer, with 100% efficiency of conversion of thermal energy to work. In both the ideal gas and the polymer, this is made possible by a material entropy increase from contraction that makes up for the loss of entropy from absorption of the thermal energy, and cooling of the material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12892">In [[power engineering]], the '''power-flow study''',  or  '''load-flow study''', is a [[numerical analysis]] of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system. A power-flow study usually uses simplified notations such as a [[one-line diagram]] and [[per-unit system]], and focuses on various aspects of [[AC power]] parameters, such as voltages, voltage angles, real power and reactive power. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation.

Power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems. The principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each [[busbar|bus]], and the real and reactive power flowing in each line.

Commercial power systems are usually too complex to allow for hand solution of the power flow.  Special purpose [[Network analyzer (AC power)|network analyzers]] were built between 1929 and the early 1960s to provide laboratory-scale physical models of power systems. Large-scale digital computers replaced the analog methods with numerical solutions.

In addition to a power-flow study, computer programs perform related calculations such as [[short-circuit]] fault analysis, stability studies (transient and steady-state), unit commitment and [[economic dispatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Low | first1 = S. H. | chapter = Convex relaxation of optimal power flow: A tutorial | doi = 10.1109/IREP.2013.6629391 | title = 2013 IREP Symposium Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - IX Optimization, Security and Control of the Emerging Power Grid | pages = 1–06 | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-1-4799-0199-9 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some programs use [[linear programming]] to find the ''optimal power flow'', the conditions which give the lowest cost per [[kilowatt hour]] delivered.

A load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers, such as a refinery complex. The power flow study is an analysis of the system’s capability to adequately supply the connected load. The total system losses, as well as individual line losses, also are tabulated. Transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers. Performing a load flow study on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating costs. The results of such an analysis are in terms of active power, reactive power, magnitude and phase angle. Furthermore, power-flow computations are crucial for [[Unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production|optimal operations of groups of generating units]].

The [[Open Energy Modelling Initiative]] promotes [[open source]] load-flow models and other types of energy system models.

==Model==
An '''alternating current power-flow model''' is a model used in electrical engineering to analyze [[power grids]]. It provides a [[Nonlinear#Nonlinear systems|nonlinear system]] which describes the energy flow through each transmission line. The problem is non-linear because the power flow into load impedances is a function of the square of the applied voltages. Due to nonlinearity, in many cases the analysis of large network via AC power-flow model is not feasible, and a linear (but less accurate) DC power-flow model is used instead.

Usually analysis of a three-phase system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases. Steady-state operation is assumed, with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes. The system frequency is also assumed to be constant. A further simplification is to use the [[per-unit system]] to represent all voltages, power flows, and impedances, scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base. A system [[one-line diagram]] is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators, loads, buses, and transmission lines of the system, and their electrical impedances and ratings.

==Power-flow problem formulation==
The goal of a power-flow study is to obtain complete voltages angle and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator real power and voltage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=J. |last1=Grainger |first2= W.|last2= Stevenson|title=Power System Analysis|publisher= McGraw–Hill|location= New York|year=1994| isbn= 0-07-061293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this information is known, real and reactive power flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined. Due to the nonlinear nature of this problem, numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance.

The solution to the power-flow problem begins with identifying the known and unknown variables in the system. The known and unknown variables are dependent on the type of bus. A bus without any generators connected to it is called a Load Bus. With one exception, a bus with at least one generator connected to it is called a Generator Bus. The exception is one arbitrarily-selected bus that has a generator. This bus is referred to as the [[slack bus]].

In the power-flow problem, it is assumed that the real power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and reactive power ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; at each Load Bus are known. For this reason, Load Buses are also known as PQ Buses. For Generator Buses, it is assumed that the real power generated ''P&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the voltage magnitude |''V''| is known. For the Slack Bus, it is assumed that the voltage magnitude |''V''| and voltage phase ''Θ'' are known. Therefore, for each Load Bus, both the voltage magnitude and angle are unknown and must be solved for; for each Generator Bus, the voltage angle must be solved for; there are no variables that must be solved for the Slack Bus. In a system with ''N'' buses and ''R'' generators, there are then &lt;math&gt;2(N-1) - (R-1)&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

In order to solve for the &lt;math&gt;2(N-1) - (R-1)&lt;/math&gt; unknowns, there must be &lt;math&gt;2(N-1) - (R-1)&lt;/math&gt; equations that do not introduce any new unknown variables. The possible equations to use are power balance equations, which can be written for real and reactive power for each bus.
The real power balance equation is:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = -P_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik}+B_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the net active power injected at bus ''i'', &lt;math&gt;G_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is the real part of the element in the [[Ybus matrix|bus admittance matrix]] Y&lt;sub&gt;BUS&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt; row and &lt;math&gt;k_{th}&lt;/math&gt; column, &lt;math&gt;B_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the element in the Y&lt;sub&gt;BUS&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  row and &lt;math&gt;k_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  column and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in voltage angle between the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;k_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  buses (&lt;math&gt;\theta_{ik}=\delta_i-\delta_k&lt;/math&gt;). The reactive power balance equation is:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = -Q_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik}-B_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the net reactive power injected at bus ''i''.

Equations included are the real and reactive power balance equations for each Load Bus and the real power balance equation for each Generator Bus. Only the real power balance equation is written for a Generator Bus because the net reactive power injected is assumed to be unknown and therefore including the reactive power balance equation would result in an additional unknown variable. For similar reasons, there are no equations written for the Slack Bus.

In many transmission systems, the voltage angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; are usually relatively small. There is thus a strong coupling between real power and voltage angle, and between reactive power and voltage magnitude, while the coupling between real power and voltage magnitude, as well as reactive power and voltage angle, is weak. As a result, real power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage angle to the bus with lower voltage angle, and reactive power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage magnitude to the bus with lower voltage magnitude. However, this approximation does not hold when the voltage angle is very large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeh.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethstudies/modelling_hs08_script_02.pdf Andersson, G: Lectures on Modelling and Analysis of Electric Power Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215042633/http://www.eeh.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethstudies/modelling_hs08_script_02.pdf |date=2017-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newton–Raphson solution method==
There are several different methods of solving the resulting nonlinear system of equations. The most popular is known as the Newton–Raphson method. This method begins with initial guesses of all unknown variables (voltage magnitude and angles at Load Buses and voltage angles at Generator Buses). Next, a [[Taylor Series]] is written, with the higher order terms ignored, for each of the power balance equations included in the system of equations .
The result is a linear system of equations that can be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Delta \theta \\ \Delta |V|\end{bmatrix} = -J^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}\Delta P \\ \Delta Q \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q&lt;/math&gt; are called the mismatch equations:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta P_i = -P_i + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik}+B_{ik}\sin \theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_{i} =  -Q_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik}-B_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of partial derivatives known as a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]:
&lt;math&gt;J=\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial \Delta P}{\partial\theta} &amp; \dfrac{\partial \Delta P}{\partial |V|} \\ \dfrac{\partial \Delta Q}{\partial \theta}&amp; \dfrac{\partial \Delta Q}{\partial |V|}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The linearized system of equations is solved to determine the next guess (''m'' + 1) of voltage magnitude and angles based on:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta^{m+1} = \theta^m + \Delta \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|V|^{m+1} = |V|^m + \Delta |V|\,&lt;/math&gt;

The process continues until a stopping condition is met. A common stopping condition is to terminate if the [[Matrix norm|norm]] of the mismatch equations is below a specified tolerance.

A rough outline of solution of the power-flow problem is:
# Make an initial guess of all unknown voltage magnitudes and angles. It is common to use a "flat start" in which all voltage angles are set to zero and all voltage magnitudes are set to 1.0 p.u.
# Solve the power balance equations using the most recent voltage angle and magnitude values.
# Linearize the system around the most recent voltage angle and magnitude values
# Solve for the change in voltage angle and magnitude
# Update the voltage magnitude and angles
# Check the stopping conditions, if met then terminate, else go to step 2.

==Other power-flow methods==
*[[Gauss–Seidel method]]: This is the earliest devised method. It shows slower rates of convergence compared to other iterative methods, but it uses very little memory and does not need to solve a matrix system.
*[[Fast-decoupled-load-flow method]] is a variation on Newton-Raphson that exploits the approximate decoupling of active and reactive flows in well-behaved power networks, and additionally fixes the value of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] during the iteration in order to avoid costly matrix decompositions. Also referred to as "fixed-slope, decoupled NR". Within the algorithm, the Jacobian matrix gets inverted only once, and there are three assumptions. Firstly, the conductance between the buses is zero. Secondly, the magnitude of the bus voltage is one per unit. Thirdly, the sine of phases between buses is zero.  Fast decoupled load flow can return the answer within seconds whereas the Newton Raphson method takes much longer. This is useful for real-time management of power grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stott|first=B.|last2=Alsac|first2=O.|date=May 1974|title=Fast Decoupled Load Flow|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4075431/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems|language=en-US|volume=PAS-93|issue=3|pages=859–869|doi=10.1109/tpas.1974.293985|issn=0018-9510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Holomorphic embedding load flow method]]: A recently developed method based on advanced techniques of complex analysis. It is direct and guarantees the calculation of the correct (operative) branch, out of the multiple solutions present in the power flow equations.

The '''Institute of Food Research''' ('''IFR''') transitioned into [[Quadram Institute|the Quadram Institute]] Bioscience in April 2017. This restructuring was in preparation for moving to the [[Quadram Institute]] which is being constructed in partnership with the University of East Anglia and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

==Foundation==
The Institute of Food Research was created in {{Start date and age|1968}}, when it was spread over four sites; the [[Meat Research Institute]] (MRI) at Langford near [[Bristol]], the Food Research Institute (FRI) at [[Colney]] in Norwich, the National Institute for Research in Dairying (NIRD) in [[Shinfield]] near Reading, and the [[Long Ashton Research Station]] (food related departments only of the last two).  At the end of 1990, the Meat Research Institute Bristol laboratory was closed, and in 1992, the National Institute for Research in Dairying Reading laboratory was moved onto the campus of the [[University of Reading]].  In 1998, it was decided that the Institute's activities should be consolidated in one location: Norwich, which was completed in September 1999.&lt;ref name="IFR_history"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://IFR.ac.uk/about/history/|title=A Short History of Food Research|website=IFR.ac.uk|publisher=Institute of Food Research|location=[[Norwich]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baltimore]]-based '''Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS)''', not to be confused with the better-known [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, was among the several centers for research in the mathematical and physical sciences established throughout the United States after World War II, in recognition of the critical role that fundamental scientific research played in the outcome of that war. Although not as well known as other similar institutes, such as the IAS mentioned above, or the [[RAND Corporation]], it nevertheless made significant contributions to the sciences of systems and control theory, and various branches of mathematics, during its 18-year existence.&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, E, Conquest of Gravity Aim of Top Scientists in U.S., ''New York Harold Tribune'', (November 20, 1955), pp. 1, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Institute for Advanced Studies (sometimes referred to in the singular) was founded in 1955 by George Bunker of the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], the ancestor of the aerospace giant [[Lockheed Martin]]. Its founding was the idea of George Bunker, who took over from Glenn Martin as chairman of that company in 1952. Like the leaders of other aircraft companies in the United States, Bunker recognized that the future of aviation lay in applying new ideas of fundamental research in mathematics, electronics, and physics that had been developed during World War II. Bunker established the Institute in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, specifically chartered to support fundamental research. The RIAS's first Director was Welcome W. Bender.&lt;ref name=Harwood&gt;William B. Harwood, ''Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin-Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements'', (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute distinguished itself as one of the world's leading centers of mathematical research, especially in [[Control theory|control]] and [[systems theory]]. Among the mathematicians on its staff were [[Solomon Lefschetz]] and [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (who while at the Institute in 1960 published a famous paper that was the basis for the "[[Kalman Filter]]," a technique for extracting information from a noisy channel that finds applications in many facets of modern life), as well as [[Joseph P. LaSalle]] (who in 1960 published a paper describing [[LaSalle's invariance principle]]), [[Jack K. Hale]], [[Harold J. Kushner]] and others. While at RIAS in the early 1960s, [[Rod Driver|Rodney Driver]] undertook research on [[delay differential equation]]s and their applications.

The RIAS changed its name and turned its mission away from basic research in 1973, after the merger that produced the [[Martin Marietta]] Corporation.&lt;ref name=Harwood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Marietta Corporation Site|url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/brownfields/Martin_Marietta_corp.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''structure relocation''' is the process of moving a [[structure]] from one location to another. There are two main ways for a structure to be moved: disassembling and then reassembling it at the required destination, or transporting it whole. For the latter, the building is first [[House raising|raised]] and then may be pushed on temporary rails or dollies if the distance is short. Otherwise, wheels, such as [[flatbed truck]]s, are used. These moves can be complicated and require the removal of protruding parts of the building, such as the [[chimney]], as well as obstacles along the journey, such as [[overhead cable]]s and trees.

Reasons for moving a building range from commercial reasons such as scenery, to preserving an important or historic building. Moves may also be made simply at the whim of the owner, or to separate a building from the plot of land on which it stands.

==Equipment==
Elevating a whole structure is typically done by attaching a temporary steel framework under the structure to support the structure. A network of hydraulic jacks is placed under the framework and controlled by a unified jacking system, elevates the structure off the foundation. An older, low-technology method is to use building jacks called screw jacks or jackscrews which are manually turned.

With both types of jacking systems described here wood beams called cribs, cribbing or box cribs are stacked into piles to support both the structure and the jacks as the structure is lifted in increments. Once the structure is at a sufficient height, a flat bed truck or hydraulic dollies are placed under the steel framework to support moves to the final destination. After the move the structure is lowered reversing the steps just applied.

==Reasons for moving a structure==
There are several reasons why a structure may be moved. For example, a redevelopment, such as [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]], could cause a relocation. Additionally, it has been purchased and the buyer wishes to move it, for reasons such as the scenery from the building. The owner might also sell the land that the building is on, but keep the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mammothmovers.com/why_relocate|title=Why Relocate?|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=Mammoth Movers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason for the relocation of a building is to preserve it for historic interest. An example of such preservation is the [[Lin An Tai Historical House and Museum|Lin An Tai Historical House]] in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. Such a move could be made because a building is in danger at its present location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesis.lib.cycu.edu.tw/ETD-db/ETD-search/view_etd?URN=etd-0919106-184612|title=ETD Database|accessdate=2008-03-24|date=2003-10-21|publisher=Digital Library and Archives |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416154940/http://thesis.lib.cycu.edu.tw/ETD-db/ETD-search/view_etd?URN=etd-0919106-184612 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable moves==

===Whole moves===
[[London]]'s [[Marble Arch]] (1847) was originally the entrance to the newly-rebuilt [[Buckingham Palace]]. Following the expansion of Buckingham Palace, it was moved to a location near [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], with work being completed in 1851.&lt;ref name=past&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=1492760|mname= Marble Arch |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]. 28 February 2005.

In order to save a single tree, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the first President of the [[Republic of Turkey]], moved his summer house, the [[Yalova Atatürk Mansion]], four meters to the east in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yuruyenkosk.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the Compania Telefónica de Mexico (Telephone Company of Mexico) building located in the city of Guadalajara was moved 11.8 meters without any interruption of telephone operations. Building weights 1,700 metric tons. Project started on May and ended on November, 1950. The building movement itself took 5 days. Head of the project was Jorge Matute Remus,&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Jorge Matute Remus]]&lt;/ref&gt; construction engineer and headmaster of the Universidad De Guadalajara at the time.

The Cudecom Building in Bogotá, Colombia (Weight 7,000 Metric Tons, Distance Moved: 95 Feet); was moved in October 1974 using Steel Rollers. The 8 story building was moved westward to build an avenue. The move of the Cudecom Building was in the Guinness Book of World Records for 30 years. This structure was the heaviest building ever moved successfully until the Fu Gang Building in China was moved in 2004.

The [[Gem Theatre (Detroit)|Gem Theatre]] and [[Century Theatre (Detroit)|Century Theatre]], both housed within the same building in [[Detroit]], were moved five blocks on wheels to its new location at 333 Madison Avenue on 16 October 1997, because of the development of the [[Comerica Park]] area when it became home of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. At a distance of {{convert|563|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} it is the furthest known relocation of a sizable building setting a world record by [http://experthousemovers-texas.com Expert House Movers, LLC].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness World Records]]. "[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50127 Farthest Building Relocation]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structure relocation was common in the 1980s in [[Romania]] because of [[Nicolae Ceausescu|Ceausescu's]] building projects. Many buildings, including churches and older apartment blocks used to be relocated using hydraulics. One of the most notable feats achieved was on 27 May 1987, when a whole apartment block weighing 7600 Tonnes was split in half and completely relocated, with people left inside, with no damage whatsoever. As of this day the building still stands, and it was one of the most challenging relocations in the whole world.

As part of the [[Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center]] development the Shubert Theatre was moved between 9 February 1999 and 21 February 1999. The 2,638 [[tonne]] (2,596 [[short ton]]) building was moved three [[city block]]s and is the heaviest recorded building move done on wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness World Records.

The 850 tonne [[Belle Tout lighthouse]] was built in 1831 near the edge of the cliff on the next headland west from [[Beachy Head]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]]. It was moved more than {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=off}} further inland in 1999 due to cliff [[erosion]]. It was pushed by four [[hydraulics|hydraulic jacks]] along four steel and concrete beams to a new site that was designed specifically to allow for possible future relocations.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. 19 March 1999. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/specials/set99/298123.stm Lighthouse megamove complete]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the {{convert|208|ft|m|adj=on}} tall, 2540-tonne [[Cape Hatteras Lighthouse]] was moved {{convert|2900|ft|m}} to protect it from being undermined by [[beach erosion]]. When the [[North Carolina]] [[lighthouse]] was built in 1870, it was over {{convert|1500|ft|m}} from the [[Atlantic Ocean|sea]], but by 1935 the beach had eroded and the waves were only {{convert|100|ft|m}} away. Starting in 1930, many efforts to halt the erosion were attempted, including adding over a million cubic yards of loose sand, massive [[sandbag]]s, and steel and concrete walls. After nearly 70 years it became apparent that fighting the erosion was a never-ending battle, and the decision was made to move the lighthouse away from the sea.

The formerly [[Heritage conservation in Hong Kong|Grade-I Listed]] [[Murray House]] in [[Hong Kong]] (built 1844) was dismantled in 1982 to make way for the [[Bank of China Tower (Hong Kong)|Bank of China Tower]]. It was rebuilt brick-by-brick at [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]] in 2000. The relocation process, nonetheless, was said to have failed to meet 'the international standard of preservation'. Certain architectural features, such as the chimneys and stone columns were lost and was replaced with features taken from other contemporary buildings. Much of the structure, furthermore, was reconstructed to be held up by an added steel-and-concrete core that which was not representative of how it once existed. The Grade-I listed status has thus since been withdrawn. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/construction_archive/major_reference_pdf.aspx?id=265 Heritage Preservation: Hong Kong and Overseas Experiences], p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3,200-year-old [[Statue of Ramesses II (Mit Rahina)|Statue of Ramesses II]] in [[Cairo]] was moved on 25 August 2006 from [[Ramses Square]] to a new [[museum]] site. The [[statue]] was slowly being damaged by [[pollution]] and was in an area where it was difficult for people to visit. The move of the statue, which measures {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off}} high and weighs around 83 tonnes (91 short tons) was broadcast live on Egyptian television. Transported whole on the back of two trucks, the statue had previously been cut into eight pieces when it was moved from its excavation site in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. 25 August 2006.

In June 2008, [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial]], the 1802 home of [[Alexander Hamilton]] in [[New York City]], was relocated from a cramped lot on Convent Avenue to a more spacious setting facing West 141st Street in nearby [[St. Nicholas Park]], where it is currently undergoing a complete [[Building restoration|restoration]]. It is actually the second time the 298-ton mansion has been moved. In 1889, it was relocated from its original site on West 143rd Street to a church's property two blocks away.

In April 2013, due to construction works on Fuzuli Street the House of famous Baku millionaire, Isa bey Hajinski, in [[Baku]] ([[Azerbaijan]]), which was built in 1908, was moved 10 m to protect it as historical and architectural monument. The weight of this building is 18,000 tonnes.

===Reassembly moves===
The [[Warder Mansion]], the only surviving Washington, D.C. building by architect [[H. H. Richardson]], was saved from demolition in 1923 by [[George Oakley Totten, Jr.]] Totten bought the exterior stone &amp;ndash; except the main doorway, which reportedly went to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] &amp;ndash; and much of the interior woodwork, and transported it, piece by piece, in his [[Model T Ford]]. He reassembled the building about 1.5 miles north of its original site, and converted it into an apartment house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newcolumbiaheights.blogspot.com/2011/06/warder-mansion-house-that-was-moved.html The Warder Mansion] from NewColumbiaHeights.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Thomas C. Williams Jr. bought a 15th-century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]], [[Agecroft Hall]], which stood by the [[River Irwell]] in [[Pendlebury]], [[England]]. The hall was disassembled, crated and transported to [[Richmond, Virginia]], where it was reassembled as the centrepiece of a Tudor estate on the banks of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agecrofthall.com/ Agecroft Hall: A Tudor estate originally built in 15th-century England, now a Richmond Virginia museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century [[Priory Park, Warwick|Warwick Priory]] in [[Warwick, England]] was bought by [[Alexander W. Weddell|Alexander and Virginia Weddell]] in 1926, and relocated in the same manner. Architect [[Henry G. Morse]] oversaw both moves. He designed additions to the reassembled priory, inspired by [[Sulgrave Manor]] and [[Wormleighton Manor]]. The expanded building was renamed [[Virginia House]], and stands next door to Agecroft Hall.

Newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] purchased and attempted to relocate two [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[monastery|monasteries]] during his travels in [[Spain]], but neither was completed during his lifetime. The first was built about 1141, and found abandoned by Hearst in 1925. He purchased the ruin and attempted to ship it to his home in [[California]], [[San Simeon]]. The crates, however, were detained by customs officials in [[New York City]], and due to his deteriorating finances during the [[Great Depression]], Hearst was unable to complete the shipment. The stones were purchased in 1951 and reassembled in [[Florida]] as a tourist attraction. In 1964, the building was purchased by a local [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] diocese and restored to its original purpose as the [[St. Bernard de Clairvaux Episcopal Church (North Miami Beach)|Church of St. Bernard de Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

[[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]]'s second attempt at relocating a monastery was in 1931, when he found the closed Santa Maria de Ovila Monastery, built around 1200. He purchased the structure, disassembled it and successfully shipped it to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], but was unable to rebuild the monastery. Hearst eventually gave the stones to the city of San Francisco, where they sat for decades in [[Golden Gate Park]]. Eventually some of the stones were acquired by the [[Abbey of New Clairvaux]] in Vina, California, where they are currently being reconstructed;&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation.

[[Abu Simbel]] is an [[archaeological site]] comprising two massive rock [[temple]]s completed in 1244 [[BCE]], on the western bank of the [[Nile River|Nile]] in southern [[Egypt]]. Construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] would have submerged the temples beneath the waters of [[Lake Nasser]]. In 1959, an international donation campaign began to save the monuments of [[Nubia]]: the southernmost relics of this ancient human civilisation. The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964, and cost US $80 million. Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was cut into large blocks, dismantled and reassembled in a new location &amp;ndash; 65&amp;nbsp;m higher and 200&amp;nbsp;m back from the river, in what many consider one of the greatest feats of archaeological engineering. Today, thousands of tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from [[Aswan]], the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane, at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex.

On 18 April 1968, [[John Rennie (engineer)|John Rennie]]'s [[London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)|London Bridge]] (which had replaced the original bridge in 1831) was sold to the [[United States|American]] entrepreneur [[Robert P. McCulloch]] of [[McCulloch Oil]] for the sum of [[United States dollar|$]]2,460,000. The bridge was reconstructed at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona]], and opened on 10 October 1971. Not all of the bridge was transported to America, as some was kept behind in lieu of tax duties. The version of London Bridge that was rebuilt at Lake Havasu consists of a concrete frame with stones from the old (but not the original) London Bridge used as cladding. It spans a [[canal]] that leads from Lake Havasu to Thomson Bay, and forms the centrepiece of a [[theme park]] in English style, complete with [[Tudor Revival architecture|mock-Tudor]] [[shopping mall]]. The bridge has become one of [[Arizona]]'s biggest tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outwestnewspaper.com/london.html Retrieved on 2008-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==
&lt;!-- should be prosified, will do soon --&gt;
Several [[museum]]s, particularly [[open-air museums]], move historic buildings into their surroundings, with some dedicated to showing what life was like in previous centuries called [[living history]].

Museums that have transported and reconstructed old buildings and structures include:
* [[Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings]], [[Bromsgrove]], [[Worcestershire]], England; centered on a collection of buildings which had to be relocated from their original sites and restored, along with a fully functioning [[windmill]], a 1940s [[Prefabricated housing|prefab]], and the UK national collection of [[telephone kiosk]]s.
* [[Beamish Museum]], [[Stanley, County Durham]], England; shows what life was like in a typical northern town in the early 20th century.
* [[Black Country Living Museum]], [[Dudley]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England; forty-two separate displays, including houses, shops and public buildings rebuilt to create a single early 20th century street.
* [[The Cloisters]], [[New York City]], a branch of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] dedicated to the art and architecture of the European [[Middle Ages]].
* [[Greenfield Village]] ([[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]]), [[Dearborn, Michigan]], which contains many historically significant buildings from around the United States, as well as a 17th-century farm from [[Cotswold (district)|Cotswold]], England.

* [[Landis Valley Museum]], [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], a collection of [[Pennsylvania German]] houses and early industrial buildings. 
* [[History Park at Kelley Park]], [[San Jose, California]], features historic city buildings which have been moved from their original locations. The History Park is an indoor/outdoor museum, arranged to replicate a small United States town from the 19th century with both original and historically accurate recreations of architecturally significant buildings.
* [[Holland Contracting ltd]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands, England]], Having had 40 years of experience in historical structure and buildings relocation they are a private commercial organisation offering services to the industry. www.hollandcontracting.co.uk
* [[Old Sturbridge Village]], [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]], a recreated [[New England]] village with 40 structures.
* [[Peabody Essex Museum]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]], a museum which features some relocated historic buildings, including [http://www.pem.org/sites/yinyutang/ ''Yin Yu Tang''], a late [[Qing dynasty]] merchant's house from southwestern [[China]].
* The [[St Fagans National History Museum]] near [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] consists almost entirely of relocated buildings from across Wales, aiming to chronicle the lifestyle, culture and architecture of the [[Welsh people]].
* [[Shelburne Museum]], [[Shelburne, Vermont]], a village of 25 relocated historic buildings and the 220-foot steamboat ''Ticonderoga''.
* [[Strawbery Banke]], [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], a historic seaport neighborhood museum. Although most of the [[American colonial architecture|Colonial]] and [[Federal style architecture|Federal style]] buildings are ''[[in situ]]'', some were moved for preservation.
* [[Woodman Institute Museum|Woodman Institute]], [[Dover, New Hampshire]], features the 1675 William Damm Garrison House, [[New Hampshire]]'s oldest intact garrison house, relocated to the museum's grounds in 1915 from elsewhere in the city.

==Relocation of towers==
In the past, it was not uncommon that as well free-standing as guyed radio towers were dismantled and rebuilt at another site. In some cases they were rebuilt just a few metres away from their original site, but in others far away from their original site. In first case these towers were nearly all part of a directional antenna system for long- and medium-wave for which the regulations of directional patterns were changed and the best way to fulfill it, was to build either a new tower or to dismantle one tower and to rebuild it on the new site. It was also done that a tower was dismantled and then used for the upper parts of a new radio tower. This was done for example with the masts at [[Sender Donebach]] in 1982 and with the wooden tower of [[Transmitter Ismaning]] in 1934.
After World War II some radio towers in former East Germany were dismantled by Soviet occupants and rebuilt in former Soviet Union, the most famous example herefore is [[Goliath transmitter]].
It is also common that electricity pylons are dismantled and rebuilt at a new site.
Also small observation towers built of steel were sometimes dismantled for renovation and afterwards rebuilt.

The tallest structure ever relocated is [[BREN Tower]]. In 1959 a 280-metre-tall radio mast was relocated at Felsberg-Berus without dismantling.{{Citation needed|reason=the link provided goes nowhere (http://www.dxradio-ffm.de/web//TafelEuropa1.jpg)|date=April 2014}}

==Financing building relocation==
Although smaller projects are usually paid for in cash, larger projects such as the relocation of a house to a new site are typically financed by banks. Finance is often a major problem faced by project managers as the house needs to be paid for prior to leaving its current site, but the lender for the project cannot take security over the house until it is complete and on the new site. This creates a short-term cashflow problem that unhinges many projects.

'''Substantive rights''' are basic [[human rights]] possessed by people in an ordered [[society]] and include [[rights]] granted by [[natural law]] as well as the [[substantive law]]. Substantive rights involve a right to the substance of being human (life, liberty, happiness), rather than a right to a procedure to enforce that right, which is defined by [[procedural law]].

'''Telepathology''' is the practice of [[pathology]] at a distance. It uses [[telecommunications]] technology to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathology data between distant locations for the purposes of [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical education|education]], and [[Medical research|research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weinstein | first = RS | last2 = Graham | first2 = AM | last3 = Richter | first3 = LC | last4 = Barker | first4 = GP | last5 = Krupinski | first5 = EA | last6 = Lopez | first6 = AM | last7 = Yagi | first7 = Y | last8 = Gilbertson | first8 = JR | last9 = Bhattacharyya | first9 = AK | last10 = Gilbertson | first10 = J.

The use of  "[[microscopy|television microscopy]]", the forerunner of telepathology, did not require that a pathologist have physical or virtual "hands-on" involvement in the selection of microscopic fields-of-view for analysis and diagnosis.

An [[academic]] pathologist, [[Ronald S. Weinstein]], M.D., coined the term "telepathology" in 1986.  In a [[medical journal]] [[editorial]], Weinstein outlined the actions that would be needed to create remote pathology diagnostic services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Weinstein  | first = RS | title = Prospects for telepathology (Editorial) | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1986 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–434|doi=10.1016/s0046-8177(86)80028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his collaborators published the first scientific paper on robotic telepathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Weinstein | first = RS | last2 = Bloom | first2 = KJ | last3 = Rozek | first3 = LS | title = Telepathology and the networking of pathology diagnostic services | journal = Arch Pathol Lab Med | volume = 111 | issue = 7 | year = 1987 | pages = 646–652| pmid = 3606341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein was also granted the first [[United States|U.S.]] [[patents]] for [[robotics|robotic]] telepathology systems and telepathology diagnostic networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kayser | first = K | last2 = Szymas | first2 = J | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = RS | title = Telepathology: Telecommunications, Electronic Education and Publication in Pathology | year = 1999 | pages = 1–186 | publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein is known to many as the "father of telepathology".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://archive.is/20120805232102/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8942 | title=ReUnion '10 award winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]], Eide and Nordrum implemented the first sustainable clinical telepathology service in 1989;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Nordrum | first = I | last2 = Engum | first2 = B | last3 = Rinde | first3 = E | title = Remote frozen section service: A telepathology project to northern Norway. | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 1991 | pages = 514–518 | volume = 1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is still in operation decades later. A number of clinical telepathology services have benefited many thousands of patients in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]].

Telepathology has been successfully used for many applications, including the rendering of [[histopathology]] tissue diagnoses at a distance. Although [[digital pathology]] imaging, including [[virtual microscopy]], is the mode of choice for telepathology services in developed countries, [[Analog signal|analog]] telepathology imaging is still used for patient services in some developing countries.

== Types of systems ==

Telepathology systems are divided into three major types: static image-based systems, [[real-time systems]], and [[virtual slide]] systems.

Static image systems have the benefit of being the most reasonably priced and usable systems.  They have the significant drawback in only being able to capture a selected subset of [[microscopic]] fields for off-site evaluation.

Real-time robotic microscopy systems and virtual slides allow a consultant pathologist the opportunity to evaluate histopathology slides in their entirety, from a distance. With real-time systems, the consultant actively operates a robotically controlled motorized [[microscope]] located at a distant site—changing focus, illumination, magnification, and field of view—at will.  Either an analog video camera or a digital video camera can be used for robotic microscopy. Another form of real-time microscopy involves utilizing a high resolution video camera mounted on a path lab microscope to send live digital video of a slide to a large computer monitor at the pathologist's remote location via encrypted store-and-forward software.  An echo-cancelling microphone at each end of the video conference allows the pathologist to communicate with the person moving the slide under the microscope.

[[Virtual slide]] systems utilize automated digital slide scanners that create a digital image file of an entire glass slide (whole slide image).  This file is stored on a computer server and can be navigated at a distance, over the [[Internet]], using a browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kayser | first = K | last2 = Molnar | first2 = B | last3 = Weinstein | first3 = RS | title = Digital pathology virtual slide technology in tissue-based diagnosis, research and education. | journal = VSV Interdisciplinary Medical Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 1–193 | issue = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital imaging]] is required for virtual microscopy.

While real-time and virtual slide systems offer higher diagnostic accuracy when compared with static-image telepathology, there are drawbacks to each. Real-time systems perform best on [[local area network]]s (LANs), but performance may suffer if employed during periods of high network traffic or using the Internet proper as a backbone. Expense is an issue with real-time systems and virtual slide systems as they can be costly.  Virtual slide telepathology is emerging as the technology of choice for telepathology services.  However, high throughput virtual slide scanners (those producing one virtual slide or more per minute) are currently expensive.  Also, virtual slide digital files are relatively large, often exceeding one [[gigabyte]] in size.  Storing and simultaneously retrieving large numbers of telepathology whole-slide image files can be cumbersome, introducing their own workflow challenges in the clinical laboratory.

== Uses and benefits ==

Telepathology is currently being used for a wide spectrum of clinical applications including diagnosing of [[frozen section]] [[Laboratory specimen|specimens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Evans | first = AJ | last2 = Chetty | first2 = R | last3 = Clarke | first3 = BA | last4 = Croul | first4 = S | last5 = Ghazarian | first5 = DM | last6 = Kiehl | first6 = TR | last7 = Ordonez | first7 = BP | last8 = Ilaalagan | first8 = S | last9 = Asa | first9 = SL | title = Primary frozen section diagnosis by robotic microscopy and virtual slide telepathology: the University Health Network experience | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 2009 | pages= 1069–1081 | volume = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; primary [[histopathology]] diagnoses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dunn | first = BE | last2 = Choi | first2 = H | last3 = Recla | first3 = DL | last4 = Kerr  | first4 = SE | last5 = Wagenman | first5 = BL | title = Robotic surgical telepathology between the Iron Mountain and Milwaukee Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers: a 12-year experience | journal = Hum Pathol | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages= 1092–1099| pmid = 19552935 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2009.04.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[second opinion]] diagnoses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Graham | first = AR | last2 = Bhattacharyya | first2 = AK | last3 = Scott | first3 = KM | last4 = Lian | first4 = F | last5 = Grasso | first5 = LL | last6 = Richter | first6 = LC | last7 = Henderson | first7 = JT | last8 = Carpenter | first8 = JB | last9 = Lopez | first9 = AM | last10 = Barker | first10 = GP | last11 = Weinstein | first11 = RS | last12 = Weinstein | first12 = R.

Benefits of telepathology include providing immediate access to off-site pathologists for rapid frozen section diagnoses. Another benefit can be gaining direct access to subspecialty pathologists such as a [[renal pathology|renal pathologist]], a [[neuropathologist]], or a [[dermatopathologist]], for immediate consultations.

== Services by country ==

=== Canada ===

[[Canada Health Infoway]] is the organization responsible for the implementation of telepathology in [[Canada]]. Canada Health Infoway is a federal non-profit which provides funding for improving digital health infrastructure.

Canada Health Infoway has targeted funding of $1.2 million CAD to the Telepathology Solution for the province of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate=November 23, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is designed to connect all pathologists within the province. The long-term expectations are improvement to patient care and safety through access to pathology expertise, improved timeliness of results and quality of service.

In [[Ontario]], the [[University Health Network]] (UHN) hospitals are the primary drivers of the development of telepathology. The three northern Ontario communities of [[Timmins]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and [[Kapuskasing]] have several community hospitals virtually linked to UHN pathologists via the Internet 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/lang-en/about-infoway/news/news-releases/613-uhn-establishes-first-telepathology-system-in-ontario |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803205309/http://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/lang-en/about-infoway/news/news-releases/613-uhn-establishes-first-telepathology-system-in-ontario |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 3, 2010 |title=UHN establishes first telepathology system in Ontario |work=News Releases |publisher=[[Canada Health Infoway]] |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit''''', is the first book by historian and Detroit native [[Thomas J. Sugrue]] in which he examines the role race, housing, job discrimination, and capital flight played in the [[decline of Detroit]]. Sugrue argues that the decline of Detroit began long before the [[1967 Detroit riot|1967 race riot]]. Sugrue argues that institutionalized and often legalized racism resulted in sharply limited opportunities for Detroit blacks for most of the twentieth century. He also argues that the process of deindustrialization, the flight of investment and jobs from the city, began in the 1950s as employers moved to suburban areas and small towns and also introduced new labor saving technologies. The book has won multiple awards including a [[Bancroft Prize]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.columbia.edu/eguides/amerihist/bancroft/previous_awards.html|title=The Bancroft Prizes: Previous Awards|work=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410205503/http://library.columbia.edu/eguides/amerihist/bancroft/previous_awards.html|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">A [[Routing|routing algorithm]] decides the path followed by a [[Network packet|packet]] from the source to destination [[Router (computing)|routers]] in a [[Computer network|network]]. An important aspect to be considered while designing a routing algorithm is avoiding a [[deadlock]]. '''Turn restriction routing'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=390–392|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHRISTOPHER J.

All packets in output buffers are to be forwarded to next channel. But since their input buffers are full, this forwarding cannot take place. As a result, no packet can be moved any further. This results in a deadlock.|389x389px]]

== Reason for deadlock ==
A deadlock (shown in fig 1) is a situation in which no further transportation of packets can take place due to the saturation of network resources like [[Data buffer|buffers]] or [[Data link|links]]. The main reason for a deadlock&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=388–389|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the cyclic acquisition of [[Channel (communications)|channels]] in the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distributed Systems Concepts and Design|last=Coulouris|first=George|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-273-76059-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider there are four channels in a network. Four packets have filled up the input buffers of these four channels and needs to be forwarded to the next channel. Now assume that the output buffers of all these channels are also filled with packets that need to be transmitted to the next channel. If these four channels form a cycle, it is impossible to transmit packets any further because the output buffers and input buffers of all channels are already full. This is known as cyclic acquisition of channels and this results in a deadlock.

== Solution to deadlock ==
Deadlocks can either be [[Deadlock#Detection|detected]], broken or [[Deadlock prevention algorithms|avoided]] from happening altogether.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|page=390|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detecting and breaking deadlocks in the network is expensive in terms of [[Network latency|latency]] and resources. So an easy and inexpensive solution is to avoid deadlocks by choosing routing techniques that prevent cyclic acquisition of channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havender|first=James W|year=1968|title=Avoiding deadlock in multitasking systems|url=http://domino.research.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/a3807c5b4823c53f85256561006324be/c014b699abf7b9ea85256bfa00685a38?OpenDocument|journal=IBM Systems Journal|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:All turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 2: All possible turns in a network route- clockwise and anti-clockwise.|390x390px]]

== Logic behind turn restriction routing ==
Logic behind turn restriction routing derives from a key observation. A cyclic acquisition of channels can take place only if all the four possible clockwise (or anti-clockwise) turns have occurred. This means deadlocks can be avoided by prohibiting at least one of the clockwise turns and one of the anti-clockwise turns. All the clockwise and anti-clockwise turns that are possible in a non restricted routing algorithm are shown in fig 2.
[[File:XY Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 3: Dimension-ordered (X-Y) routing|390x390px]]

== Examples of turn restriction routing ==
A turn restriction routing can be obtained by prohibiting at least one of the four possible clockwise turns and at least one of the four possible anti-clockwise turns in the routing algorithm. This means there are at least 16 (4x4)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; possible turn restriction routing techniques as you have 4 clockwise turns and 4 anti-clockwise turns to choose from. Some of these techniques have been listed below.[[File:West First Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 4: West first routing|390x390px]][[File:North Last Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 5: North last routing|390x390px]][[File:Negative First Turns.jpg|thumb|Fig 6: Negative first routing|390x390px]]

=== Dimension-ordered (X-Y) routing===
Dimension ordered (X-Y) routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (shown in fig 3) restricts all turns from y-dimension to x-dimension. This prohibits two anti-clockwise and two clockwise turns which is more than what is actually required. Even then since it restricts the number of turns that are allowed we can tell that this is an example for turn restriction routing.

=== West first routing===
West first routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (shown in fig 4) restricts all turns to the west direction. This means west direction should be taken first if needed in the proposed route.

=== North last routing===
North last routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=Solihin books|year=2016|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=390–391|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (shown in fig 5) restricts turning to any other direction if the current direction is north. This means north direction should be taken last if needed in the proposed route.

=== Negative first routing ===
Negative first routing&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (shown in fig 6) restricts turning to a negative direction while the current direction is positive. West is considered as the negative direction in X-dimension and south is considered as the negative direction in Y-dimension. This means any [[Network hop|hop]] in one of the negative directions should be taken before taking any other turn.

== Advantages of turn restriction routing==
* Avoiding deadlocks is less expensive to implement than deadlock detecting and breaking techniques.
* Turn restrictions provide alternate [[Shortest path problem|minimum length paths]] as well as non minimum length paths from one node to another, which allows routing around [[Network congestion|congested]] or failed links.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=fundamentals of parallel computer architecture|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=solihin books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=392|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, consider figure 7 below. Say there are multiple routers, F1, F2 etc., that feed packets to a congested, but low-cost link from source router S to destination router D. Implementing Turn restriction routing means that some of the turns from any of the feeder routers to the congested router S may now be restricted. Those feeder routers may have to use a longer path to get to destination D, thereby decongesting the link from S to D to an extend.

The '''Vega Science Trust''' was a [[not-for-profit]] organisation which provided a platform from which [[scientists]] can communicate directly with the public on [[science]] by using [[moving image]], sound and other related means. The Trust closed in 2012 but the website and streaming video remains active (based at Sheffield University).

== History ==
Founded in 1995 by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Sir Harry Kroto]] and [[BBC]] Education Producer Patrick Reams the Vega Science Trust was awarded a [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science|COPUS]] start-up grant from the [[Royal Society]] in 1995 and then went on in 1999 to be allocated core funding from the [[Office of Science and Technology]] (OST).  Starting with recording science programmes for terrestrial television the Vega Science Trust produced a number of programmes such as recordings of [[Royal Institution]] Discources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/12/ Royal Institution Discourse Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt; which were broadcast on [[BBC 2]] and a set of Masterclasses.  In 2001 Harry Kroto was awarded the Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize - the UK's premier award for science communication&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/Michael-Faraday-Prize/ The Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; 'for his dedication to the notion of working scientists being communicators of their work and in particular for his establishment of the Vega Science Trust whose films and related activities reflect the excitement of scientific discovery to the public'.  The Trust went on to co-produce with the BBC [[Open University]] a set of science discussion programmes covering hot topics such as [[Stem Cells]], [[Energy]], [[Mobile Phones]], [[GM Food]], [[Disease]], [[Nanotechnology]] and [[Ageing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/series/2 The Next Big Thing Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the BBC/Open University the Trust also produced with sponsorship from [[HEFCE]] Widening Participation Team a set of award-winning&lt;ref&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/events/learningonscreen Learning on Screen Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; career programmes featuring young scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/series/10 Snapshots Young Scientist Career Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both series were broadcast on BBC2.

Very early audio-visual recordings of individual scientists are relatively rare but in the recent past some recordings were  carried out by such organisations as the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/scientists/ BBC Interviews with Scientists 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 the Vega Science Trust embarked on a plan to record in-depth interviews with scientists such as [[Joseph Rotblat|Rotblat]], [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]], [[Perutz]], [[Cornforth]], [[Walter Kohn]] and [[Richard R. Ernst|Richard Ernst]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/series/1 Face-to-Face Interviews with Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; which could be both viewed and preserved as an historical record for the future.  More recently the [[British Library]] embarked on a similar project of recording audio-visual interviews under the National Life Stories project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls British Library National Life Stories]&lt;/ref&gt; although at present their archive consists of oral recordings of scientists.  The Vega Science Trust's in-depth interviews with scientists led onto a project recording interviews with Nobel Laureates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/series/4 Nobel Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt; attending the annual [[Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau]] in 2004/5/6.  In 2006 the Vega Science Trust's website received a special mention at The International Association for Media Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-in-science.org/ The International Association for Media Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Awards.

In 2007 the Vega Science Trust started on-going work with [[Jonathan Hare]] BBC [[Rough Science]] on a series of short instructional films&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/27 Instructional Mini Films by Jonathan Hare]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to show how things work.  For instance a number of the films show how we can generate [[electricity]], another shows how we can generate [[wind power]], others the [[molecular]] structure of [[Buckminsterfullerene|C60]], carbon [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]]s and [[graphene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=19146.php Article Nanowerk on Graphene modules]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007-2010 the Trust concentrated on bringing to the public's attention the process of science research.  The Nano2Hybrids&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano2hybrids.net/ Nano2hybrids website]&lt;/ref&gt; EU [[STReP]] project for instance was an innovative project where research scientists recorded their own progress on a research project to invent a gas sensor made using carbon nanotubes.  In addition recording science in society projects such as Women in Nanotechnology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninnano.de/ Women in Nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Diversity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversity-fp7.eu/ Diversity Project]&lt;/ref&gt; illuminate work&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/198 Women in Nanotechnology film]&lt;/ref&gt; towards promoting women scientists into decision making positions in science research environments.

The Vega Science Trust closed in March 2012 after 17 years of operation. However, the website will continue to host the existing film archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vega.org.uk/news/details/8|title = Latest News|date = |accessdate = 17 April 2015|website = The Vega Science Trust|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The Vega Science Trust was governed by a board of five [[Trustee]]s who are active research scientists, media, copyright, and educational specialists. Trustees step down and/or are re-elected each year.

The Vega Science Trust employed one member of staff (and for a period, a second technical member) and operated in a mixed economy of core grant-in-aid support from [[Florida State University]], and from [[research grant]]s and [[sponsorship]]. It was an independent body with its own self-contained offices, initially in the University of Sussex chemistry department, and later at the Innovation Centre, [[University of Sussex]], [[Brighton]].

== Vision ==

The Vega Science Trust aimed to see science more fully integrated into our everyday culture. Vega's vision has been to do so by providing a platform from which scientists can broadcast science programmes directly to the public.

'''Activities'''

* Recording scientists.
:Covering a wide array of research.
* Making available to the public by streaming from the Vega Science Trust's website.
:Videos stream in different formats.
* Creating an historical archive of some of the world's most eminent scientists.
:Interviewing Nobel Laureates and other eminent scientists.
* Experimenting with new ways of outreaching/engaging with the public via audio-visual means.
:Creating different programme formats.
* Provide on-line science resources for school, university and the public via informal learning.
:Creating informative videos for inparting scientific concepts.

'''Vega Science Trust Collection'''

The collection of recordings also acts as an historical record and archive of world scientists and their research discoveries.  Recorded to broadcast quality they provide a valuable collection, much of which is open to the public via the Vega Science Trust's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/ Vega Science Trust's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition''' is a research organisation owned by [[Mars, Incorporated]] located at [[Waltham on the Wolds]], [[Leicestershire]], United Kingdom. Waltham conducts scientific research into pet care and nutrition, and works with a number of animal breeds including dogs, cats, birds, fish and horses.

==History==

The pet food subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated (Mars Petcare) began research into pet nutrition in the early 1950s, formally founding a Nutrition Research Unit in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WALTHAM Heritage Awards|url=http://www.waltham.com/about-waltham/heritage-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the institute was housed at a nearby location but was moved to an old stud farm at Waltham-on-the-Wolds in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars UK History|url=http://www.mars.com/uk/en/who-we-are/our-history/mars-petcare.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, a non-charitable organisation called the Waltham Foundation has funded a number of humane scientific research projects dedicated to furthering the health and nutrition of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Waltham Foundation|url=http://www.waltham.com/waltham-research/funding-opportunities/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

*In July 2005, in collaboration with the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]] in [[Pennsylvania]], Waltham discovered that cats cannot taste [[Sweetness|sweet food]] because they have a faulty gene. Lions, tigers, leopards and pumas ([[Felidae]] family) have the same defective gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4707793.stm|title=Why cats don't go for sweet foods|date=1 August 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2007, in collaboration with the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] of [[Bethesda, Maryland]], Waltham found that the genetic variation of dogs' size is due to mutations in the [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] gene. This was discovered through research on the [[Portuguese Water Dog]]. This research was preparatory work for similar studies on the human genome.

==Publications==

*Waltham originally published the magazine ''Waltham Focus'' four times a year. This has since been renamed as ''Veterinary Focus'' and is distributed in more than fifty countries and is published in several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivis.org/journals/vetfocus/toc.asp|title=Veterinary Focus|work=ivis.org|publisher=International Veterinary Information Service|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5510">The '''Weatherhead East Asian Institute''' (WEAI) at [[Columbia University]] is a community of scholars affiliated with Columbia's schools, bringing together over 50 full-time faculty, a diverse group of visiting scholars and professionals, and students from the United States and abroad. Its mission is to train new generations of experts on East Asian topics in the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], and the professions and to enhance understanding of [[East Asia]] in the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weai.columbia.edu/about/ Weatherhead East Asian Institute home page]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its establishment in 1949 as the East Asian Institute, the WEAI has been the center for modern and contemporary East Asia research, studies, and publication at Columbia, covering China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Mongolia (Inner Asia), Tibet, and, increasingly, the countries of Southeast Asia. 

The Weatherhead East Asian Institute (WEAI) and East Asian Studies at Columbia has been recognized by a wide variety of funding sources, including the [[U.S. Department of Education]], which, since 1960, has designated Columbia as an East Asian National Resource Center.

Faculty and scholars at the Institute are distinguished by their interdisciplinary and multinational focus. Resources available to the Institute community include Columbia University's renowned C.V. Starr East Asian Library and the Institute's extensive ties to the business, diplomatic, legal, and media communities in New York City, the nation, and abroad. The Institute is also one of the leading centers for developing K-12 teacher resource and training programs in the United States.

In 2003, the Institute was renamed the Weatherhead East Asian Institute to honor the generosity of the Weatherhead Foundation. The Weatherhead endowment supports a significant expansion of Institute programs, including the creation of postdoctoral fellowships, visiting professorships, a faculty research program, graduate training grants, student internships, a resident fellows program, and symposiums and workshops. The endowment will also support graduate fellowships for students pursuing advanced degrees in East Asian-related fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/00/02/weatherhead.html Columbia University press release (23 February 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==M.A. Program==
The Weatherhead East Asian Institute administers the Master of Arts in Regional Studies--East Asia (MARSEA) program at Columbia. The MARSEA program, completed in two full-time semesters, is tailored to meet the needs of individuals entering professional careers, mid-career professionals, students preparing for entry into doctoral programs, and those pursuing a professional degree, such as the J.D. or M.B.A., who want to gain social science expertise in the modern politics, international relations, modern history, and cultural and social formations of the region with a country focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weai.columbia.edu/academics/marsea/]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Publications==
The Institute is also responsible for three major publication series. The first, Studies of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, was inaugurated in 1962 to bring to public attention the results of significant new research on modern and contemporary East Asia. The books in this series are published by academic and trade presses and represent scholars of East Asia from around the world. The second series, Weatherhead Books on Asia, is published by [[Columbia University Press]] and comprises high quality translations of works in Asian languages for scholars, students, and the interested general reader. The third series, Asia Perspectives: New Horizons in Asian History, Society and Culture, is also published by Columbia University Press and includes books on Asian subjects that cross the usual boundary between scholarly monographs and more encompassing general works for the classroom and the educated general reader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weai.columbia.edu/publications/]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Weatherhead Foundation==
The Weatherhead Foundation, which has supported the East Asian Institute since 1980, was founded by [[A. J. Weatherhead, Jr]]. in 1953 and is currently headed by his son, A. J. Weatherhead, III. The Weatherhead Fund at Columbia is named in honor of another of the founder's sons, the late Richard W. Weatherhead, who earned an M.A. in history from Columbia, followed by a Ph.D. in 1966.

The family foundation concentrates on endowments for higher education. Since its establishment, it has supported [[Case Western Reserve University]],&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, Michael.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">'''William Balée''' (born 1954) is a professor of [[anthropology]] at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. [[Image:BaleeBrazil.JPG|thumb|(R) William Balée, Anthropology professor at Tulane University, with (L) indigenous consultant on landscape transformation in Brazil]]

He was born in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida and educated at the [[University of Florida]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], where he received a B.A. in Anthropology before moving on to [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] where he earned his Ph.D. in Anthropology.

After earning his Ph.D., Balée worked for the [[New York Botanical Garden]], collecting plants for an [[ethnobotany]] project sponsored by a [[Noble Grant]].  Later he took up a research position with the [[Goeldi Museum|Museu Goeldi]] in [[Belém]], Brazil.

His primary ethnographic work was with the [[Ka'apor]] indigenous culture of [[Maranhão]], [[Brazil]] (Balée 1994). During his time in Brazil, however, he also carried out fieldwork with the [[Tembé]], the [[Assurini]] of the [[Xingu River]], the [[Araweté]] of the [[Ipishuna]], which is also a tributary of the Xingu, and the [[Guajá]].

However, he is most renowned as a proponent and foremost expert of [[historical ecology]] (Balée 1998). Balée has proposed four interdependent postulates, which set historical ecology apart from other more traditional research programs. Basically summarized, these postulates are: (1) Humans have affected nearly all environments on Earth; (2) Humans do not have an innate propensity to decrease biotic and landscape diversity or to increase it; (3) Various types of societies impact their landscapes in dissimilar ways; (4) Human interactions with landscapes can be comprehended holistically.

Historical ecologists study the interaction between the human and natural worlds and the subsequent human responses to environmental influences. Humans often respond to these environmental stimuli by altering their landscapes, but maintaining their culture and practices. Due to the constant human adaptation of the environment, it is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to behold an environment anywhere on the planet that is untouched. These human-created modifications are known as human-mediated disturbances, and are studied to learn of humans’ role in the history of the land.The second and third postulates emphasize the fact that humanity is not homogeneous, and therefore, our impacts will not be either.  Humans have been known to both increase and decrease the biodiversity of landscapes throughout time.  Broadcast fires, for example, can often create niches for new species in the landscape, while simple deforestation can drastically decrease the biodiversity.  Human impacts on the landscape are as varied as the languages, political systems, and societies present in the world. Finally, people and the landscape can be studied holistically because the landscape incorporates both people and the environment. The landscape is visual evidence of the interaction of culture and the environment.

Currently he is working on issues of applied historical ecology.

Dr. Balée has won the Mary W. Klinger Book Award from the [[Society for Economic Botany]] for two of his books, in 1996 (Footprints of the Forest) and 2014 (Cultural Forests of the Amazon). He was appointed Officer of the [[Order of the Golden Ark]], a Dutch conservation merit order, by Prince Bernhard in 1993. In 2016 he received the President’s Award for Excellence in Graduate and Professional Teaching from Tulane University.

'''William Webster''' (1855-1910) was an English [[chemical engineering|chemical engineer]] credited with developments in gas detection, sewage treatment and medical use of [[x-ray]]s. A gifted artist and musician, Webster also helped found the [[Blackheath Halls|Blackheath Concert Halls]] and the adjacent [[Blackheath Conservatoire|Conservatoire]] in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in south-east London during the 1890s.

==Career==
[[File:Wyberton House.jpg|thumb|Wyberton House]]
Webster was the son of [[William Webster (builder)|William Webster]], a successful building contractor who grew wealthy from constructing major civil engineering and building projects in London. The family lived from 1869 in Wyberton House in Lee Terrace, Blackheath.

The younger William Webster trained as a chemical engineer. A fellow of the [[Chemical Society]], he patented a system to detect hydrogenous gases in mines in 1876,&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|title=3993 | date=27 October 1876 | page=5730 |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/24376/page/5730/data.pdf|work=London Gazette|accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed a system for the [[Electrolysis|electrolytic]] purification of sewage (patent application filed on 22 December 1887; US patent awarded on 19 February 1889),&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;{{cite web|title=C02F1/463 Treatment of water, waste water, or sewage by electrochemical methods by electrolysis by electrocoagulation|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US398101A/en|website=Google Patents|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; trialled in 1888 at the [[Crossness Pumping Station|Crossness]] [[Southern Outfall Sewer|Southern Outfall]] works&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Electrical Treatment of Sewage|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DTN18890530.2.14|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 May 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merdinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merdinger|first1=C.J.|title=The Development of Modern Sewerage. Part II|journal=The Military Engineer|date=March–April 1953|volume=45|issue=304|page=123|jstor=44561586}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been built by his father's firm in the 1860s.

Webster was also a pioneer in [[x-ray]] research and a founder member of the [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] Society (since 1927 part of the [[British Institute of Radiology]]), assisting surgeon Thomas Moore in producing radiographs in 1896, after which Moore set up an x-ray unit at the [[Miller General Hospital]] in [[Greenwich, London|Greenwich]] High Road.&lt;ref name="Meggitt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meggitt|first1=Geoff|title=Taming the Rays: A history of radiation and protection|date=2008|isbn=9781409246671|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster is also believed to be the first person to experience radiation 'sunburn', suffered on his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, E.H. (1986). ''Pioneers and Early Years: A History of British Radiology'', Alderney, Colophon Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meggitt"/&gt; He wrote a letter on the subject of x-ray photography published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=William|title=X-Ray Photography|journal=Nature|date=1897|volume=55|issue=1433|pages=559–559|doi=10.1038/055559b0|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/055559b0|accessdate=14 May 2018|language=En|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=1897Natur..55..559W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster was an accomplished violinist, singer, and artist - his paintings were exhibited in the Summer Exhibition at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]]. In 1881 local residents formed the Blackheath Conservatoire of Music, and Webster founded the company which funded the building of a concert hall, today [[Blackheath Halls]], and its neighbouring schools for art and music, the [[Blackheath Conservatoire]]. The Conservatoire of Music opened in 1896 and the School of Art in 1897.&lt;ref name="Conservatoire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Open House 2017|url=http://www.conservatoire.org.uk/Events/Peter-and-the-Wolf-15.aspx/Open-House-London--254.aspx/|website=The Conservatoire|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
