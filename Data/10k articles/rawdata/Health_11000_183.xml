'''ASTM E 1714''' is a Standard Guide for Properties of a Universal Healthcare Identifier (UHID). This standard was create by the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] and [[ASTM International]].  

It defines thirty characteristics required of a UHID. The scope of the guide does not include implementation methodology, cost, or policy decisions. [[Encryption|Encrypted]] UHIDs (EUHIDs) are included in the guide for hiding the identity of individuals while linking information. Separate EUHIDs are allowed for different episodes of care for the same patient. The guide also recommends the use of temporary patient identifiers (TPIs) controlled by individual organizations for emergency use and requires them to subsequently transfer all information to the correct UHID.

== Functional characteristics ==

'''Accessible:''' Access is dependent upon the establishment of a network infrastructure, the trusted authority and policies and procedures that support the system.

'''Assignable:''' Assignment of the Sample UHID or EUHID, regardless of time or place of request, depends on the establishment and functions of a network infrastructure, the trusted authority, and the implementation of policies and procedures that support the system. It will also depend on the mechanism to request a Sample UHID. 

'''Identifiable:''' This will depend on the identification information that the trusted authority links to the Sample UHID.

'''Verifiable:''' The Sample UHID includes a six (6) digit check-digit for verification.

'''Mergeable:''' The internal data structure of the Sample UHID does not directly support merging duplicate or redundant identifiers. They can be linked at the trusted authority. 

'''Splittable:''' There is no inherent support for splitting the Sample UHID. New IDs can be issued for future use. Splitting for retroactive information must be handled by the trusted authority.

== Linkage of lifelong health record ==

'''Linkable:''' The Sample UHID has the ability to function as a data element and support the linkage of health records in both manual and automated environment.

'''Mappable:''' With the use of appropriate database system and software, the Sample UHID can be used to map currently existing healthcare identifiers.

== Patient confidentiality and access security ==

'''Content Free:''' The Sample UHID is free of information about the individual. 

'''Controllable:''' This depends on the policies and methods that will be adopted by the trusted authority.

'''Healthcare Focused:''' The Sample UHID is recommended solely for the purpose of healthcare application.

'''Secure:''' The Sample UHID includes an EUHID which offers mechanism for secure operation through the use of encryption and [[decryption]] processes. These capabilities depend on the policies and procedures that will be implemented by the trusted authority.

'''Dissidentifiable:''' EUHID supports multiple encryption schemes offering multiple EUHIDs to prevent revealing the identification of the individual. 

'''Public:''' The EUHID's encryption scheme is intended to hide the identity of individual when linking information. However, public disclosure of a patient identifier without any risk to the privacy and confidentiality of patient information depends on appropriate access security and privacy legislation, similar to other identifiers.

== Compatibility with standards and technology ==

'''Based on Industry Standards:''' The Sample UHID is not based on existing industry standards. It is based on [[ASTM_International#Standards|ASTM's Standard Guide]] for Properties of a Universal Healthcare Identifier (UHID). 

'''Deployable:''' The Sample UHID is capable of implementation in a variety of technologies such as scanners, [[bar code reader]]s, etc. 

'''Usable:''' The Sample UHID is capable of implementation in a variety of technologies such as scanners, bar code readers, etc. The 28 digit identifier will present difficulty for manual computation and transcription. It may be a time-consuming process and subject to human errors.

== Design characteristics ==

The ASTM guide and the proposed Sample UHID do not address the implementation issues and infrastructure requirements. 

'''Unique:''' The trusted authority will be responsible for the uniqueness of the Sample UHID. 

'''Repository-based:''' The Sample UHID can be stored in a repository.

'''Atomic:''' The Sample UHID consists of a sixteen (16) digit sequential identifier, a one (1) character delimiter, a six (6) digit check-digit and a six (6) digit encryption scheme. It can function as a single compound data element.

'''Concise:''' The Sample UHID is not concise. It is a 29-character length identifier.

'''Unambiguous:''' The Sample UHID is unambiguous. It uses numeric characters and a period as a delimiter. 

'''Permanent:''' The Sample UHID has sufficient capacity to prevent reuse of identifiers.

'''Centrally governed:''' This policy issue is not addressed. The Sample UHID requires central administration and is dependent on the establishment and functions of a trusted authority. 

'''Networked:''' The Sample UHID can be operated on a computer network. It requires establishment of the necessary network and technology infrastructure.

'''Longevity:''' The Sample UHID can support patient identification for a foreseeable future.

'''Retroactive:''' Has the capacity for retroactive assignment of the Sample UHID to every person in the United States

'''Universal:''' Can support patient identification for the entire world population

'''Incremental Implementation:''' The Sample UHID can be implemented on an incremental basis. With the development and use of appropriate procedures and establishment of the necessary bidirectional mapping, both the Sample UHID and existing patient identifiers can co-exist during the time of transition.

== Reduction of cost and enhanced health status ==

'''Cost-effectiveness:''' The Sample UHID has the potential to support the functions of a Unique Patient Identifier. The establishment of both the administrative and technology infrastructures, the creation of a Trusted Authority, the design and development of computer software, hardware and communication networks, and the implementation security measures will require substantial investment of resources, time and effort.

'''Allan Macy Butler''' (1894–1986) was Chief of the Children’s Medical Services at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and a professor of Pediatrics at [[Harvard Medical School]]. A pioneer in health services, Butler sought to change the structure of the American ‘[[fee-for-service]]’ system of health care to one based on government-paid medical care for the elderly and low-income people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|accessdate=2009-11-09 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p0v04k13206pv758/|title=The Pioneers of Pediatric Medicine: Allan Macy Butler|publisher=European Journal of Pediatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler was born April 3, 1894, in Yonkers, New York. The son of George Prentice Butler, a stockbroker, he was one of eight children. Butler spent [[World War I]] overseas, serving as an artillery officer in the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]. Afterward,  he served in Poland as part of the [[Hoover Commission]]. Butler entered Harvard Medical School in 1922.  After graduating in 1926, he worked at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]]. It was there that he developed an interest in fluid and [[electrolyte]] [[metabolism]]. During World War II, he worked on life-raft studies conducted by the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] that led to advancements in treating [[diarrhea]] and [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~med00117 Allan Macy Butler Papers], 1916-1986(inclusive), 1930-1969(bulk), HMSc313. Harvard Medical Library, Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, Boston, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Butler returned to Harvard as an instructor in [[Pediatrics]]. He attained the title of Professor of Pediatrics in 1944 and served as Chief of Children’s Medical Service and Staff Physician in charge of the Chemical Laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital. He would remain at these two posts, concurrently, until 1960.

Butler’s advocacy for medical insurance and pre-paid methods of health care embroiled him in the [[socialized medicine]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/pedresearch/Citation/1969/09000/Acceptance_of_the_Howland_Award.12.aspx Acceptance of the Howland Award]. Allan Macy Butler, Pediatric Research. Vol. 3, No.5: 475-480(1969)&lt;/ref&gt; He would also face a [[McCarthyism#Loyalty-security reviews|loyalty review]] by the Civil Service Commission [[Loyalty Review Board]]. After his trial he provided support in the form of testimony 
and letters for colleagues who were being tried under the [[Subversive Activities Control Act]] of 1950. 

He was a dedicated opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] and a supporter of [[abortion rights]], [[nuclear disarmament]], and [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan Macy Butler (1894-1986). Jane Pacht Brickman. Journal of Public Health Policy, Vol.20, No.3(1999) pp. 356-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Butler received the [[American Pediatric Society]]'s highest award, the [[John Howland Award]].

{{About|The AlterEgo Silent Speech Device [[MIT Media Lab|MIT Media Lab]]}}


'''AlterEgo''' is a wearable silent speech output-input device developed by [[MIT Media Lab]].&lt;ref name=Futurism&gt;{{cite web|url=https://futurism.com/alterego-talk-computer-without-words/ |title=This Crazy Gadget Helps You “Talk” To Your Computer Without Words|last1=Ossola|first1=Alexandra|date=April 5, 2018|work=Futurism|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is attached around the head, neck, and jawline and translates your brain speech center impulse input into words on a computer, without vocalization.

==Description==
The device consists of 7 small electrodes that attach at various points around the jaw-line and mouth to receive the electrical inputs to the muscles used for speech. It looks similar to a sling for the head, neck and jaw.

==Background==
Scientists [[Arnav Kapur]] of Fluid Interfaces group at MIT Media Lab with [[Shreyas Kapur]] and [[Pattie Maes]] designed the prototype and presented the work at the Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces in March 2018, in [[Tokyo]]. They reported that on standard testing it had a 92 percent accuracy rate of conversion of verbal thought to text, virtually on par or better than [[Siri]] and other speech input devices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/2018/03/23/p43-kapur_BRjFwE6.pdf AlterEgo: A Personalized Wearable Silent Speech Interface]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AntiGravity Fitness''' is a fitness company founded by [[Christopher Calvin Harrison|Christopher Harrison]] in 2007 and based in [[New York City]], specializing in hybrid aerial fitness techniques that combine [[aerial silk|silk hammocks]] with [[yoga|yoga practices]], [[Pilates]], [[barre (ballet)|ballet barre exercises]], and traditional [[strength training]] techniques into different exercise curriculums. Harrison first developed the initial program, AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, based on backstage warm-up exercises through which he would lead his athletes as director/choreographer of the performance troupe [[AntiGravity, Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/gym-class-antigravity-yoga/?_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Gym Class: AntiGravity Yoga | first=Karen | last=Barrow | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Harrison has developed seven proprietary fitness programs under the AntiGravity Fitness brand, currently [[brand licensing|licensed]] in [[health club|fitness centers]] in over 40 countries. AntiGravity Fitness also operates instructor training programs as part of their licensing agreements, certifying others to teach AntiGravity Fitness techniques.

==History==
In 1991, Christopher Harrison founded the acrobatic troupe [[AntiGravity, Inc|AntiGravity]] to choreograph a performance for the [[New York Marathon]]. In the following decade, they performed in hundreds of live shows, corporate events, and advertising campaigns. Then in 1997, AntiGravity performed during the opening ceremonies of the [[Femina Miss India]] pageant, and Harrison, while unable to perform due to injury, cites this time in [[India]] as his first exposure to [[yoga]] and a major influence on the development of aerial yoga and what would become AntiGravity Fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/flexibility/AntiGravity-Yogas-Upside-Down-Workout.html| work=Outside Online | title=The Upside Down Workout | first=Ali Taylor | last=Lange | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during a retreat at [[Club Med]], Harrison and his performers came across a [[gazebo]] with hammocks hanging from the ceiling. After experimenting and developing a few flips, they hung up similar hammocks in their [[New York City]] gym. Harrison states that they soon discovered that “hanging upside down for a minute would take all the kinks out.” The hammocks soon became a regular part of their warm-up routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/flexibility/AntiGravity-Yogas-Upside-Down-Workout.html| work=Outside Online | title=The Upside Down Workout | first=Ali Taylor | last=Lange | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Harrison launched AntiGravity Fitness which focused on aerial yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/beat-jet-lag-by-hanging-upside-down| title=Beat Jet Lag By Hanging Upside Down| author=Heather Thomas Shalabi| date=April 11, 2018| publisher=Hong Kong Tatler| accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012,  the chain had locations in China, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.voanews.com/a/antigravity-yoga-gains-popularity/1178817.html| title=AntiGravity Yoga Gains Popularity| author=Elizabeth Lee| date=June 5, 2012| publisher=VOA News| accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the first AntiGravity fitness studio, Fighting Gravity Fitness, opened in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.richmond.com/life/health/fitness/fitness-antigravity-unites-yoga-and-pilates-with-aerial-acrobatics/article_ffecd43a-f813-510c-be4d-4beddc37282c.html| title=Fitness: AntiGravity unites yoga and Pilates with aerial acrobatics| date=February 7, 2015| publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch| accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://richmondbizsense.com/2014/06/25/a-new-brand-of-fitness-swings-into-richmond/| title=A new brand of fitness swings into Richmond| author=Michael Thompson| date=June 25, 2014| publisher=Richmond BizSense| accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following October, the first AntiGravity yoga studio opened in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/lehigh-county/index.ssf/2014/10/pennsylvanias_first_antigravit.html| title=Pennsylvania’s first AntiGravity yoga studio opens next week in Lehigh Valley| date=October 16, 2014| publisher=Lehigh Valley Live| accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program overview==
AntiGravity classes are led by instructors trained in the programs, and typically last for 75 minutes. Before classes start, hammocks are adjusted to the individual heights of the students, and each lesson begins and ends with [[guided meditation]]s inside the hammock, referred to as “[[Womb]] Pose.” Students are then led by their instructor through a series of motions and poses adapted for the hammocks from [[yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[ballet]], and other exercise techniques, typically focusing on [[flexibility]] and [[core (anatomy)|core]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carolyn-gregoire/aerial-yoga_b_3093050.html| work=[[The Huffington Post]] | title=We Tried It: AntiGravity Aerial Yoga | first=Carolyn | last=Gregoire | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One cornerstone of AntiGravity techniques is the concept of “[[inversion therapy|zero-compression inversions]].” During the inversions, students hang upside-down, supported at the waist and hip by the hammock, relieving pressure from the neck and spine and increasing blood flow to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carolyn-gregoire/aerial-yoga_b_3093050.html| work=[[The Huffington Post]] | title=We Tried It: AntiGravity Aerial Yoga | first=Carolyn | last=Gregoire | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christopher Harrison and some students credit these inversions with a temporary increase in [[body height]] of up to an inch or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/flexibility/AntiGravity-Yogas-Upside-Down-Workout.html| work=Outside Online | title=The Upside Down Workout | first=Ali Taylor | last=Lange | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=16 August 2011 |title=Good Morning America |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB9YFlOVe2E |medium= Television production |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |location= [[New York City]]|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16393">[[File:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|Typhoid Mary in a 1909 newspaper illustration]]
An '''asymptomatic carrier''' ('''healthy carrier''' or just '''carrier''') is a person or other organism that has become infected with a pathogen, but who display no signs nor symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary Definition|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/asymptomatic+carrier|website=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com|access-date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unaffected by the pathogen themselves, carriers can transmit it to others or develop symptoms in later stages of disease. Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the transmission of common infectious diseases such as [[Typhoid fever|typhoid,]] ''[[Clostridium difficile infection|C. Difficile]],'' influenzas, and [[HIV]]. While the mechanism of disease carrying is still unknown, researchers have made progress towards understanding how certain pathogens can remain dormant in a human for a period of time&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikigenes.org/e/author/e/276076.html|title=Denise M. Monack|date=|publisher=WikiGenes|access-date=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A better understanding of asymptomatic disease carriers is crucial to the fields of medicine and public health as they work towards mitigating the spread of common infectious diseases'''.'''

== Types of asymptomatic carriers ==
Asymptomatic carriers can be further categorized by their current disease state&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/computers-and-electrical-engineering/computers-and-computing/carrier|title=Carrier {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  When an individual transmits pathogens immediately following infection but prior to developing symptoms, they are known as incubatory carriers. Humans are also capable of spreading disease following a period of illness. Typically thinking themselves cured of the disease, these individuals are known as convalescent carriers. Viral diseases such as [[hepatitis]] and [[poliomyelitis]] are frequently transmitted in this manner. Considered to the be classic asymptomatic carriers, “healthy carriers,” exhibit no signs or symptoms of disease yet are capable of infecting others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Significance in disease transmission ==
The limited information on the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers creates a considerable difficulty when planning public health initiatives. Given that [[disease surveillance]] is dependent on estimates for both the asymptomatic rates and symptomatic rates of disease, the lack of information on the prevalence of carriers can lead to insufficient initiatives for the mitigation of common public health concerns such as ''C. Difficile'' or influenza&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riggs MM, Sethi AK, Zabarsky TF, Eckstein EC, Jump RL, Donskey CJ | title = Asymptomatic carriers are a potential source for transmission of epidemic and nonepidemic Clostridium difficile strains among long-term care facility residents | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 45 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–8 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17879913 | doi = 10.1086/521854 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/521854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Furuya-Kanamori L, Cox M, Milinovich GJ, Magalhaes RJ, Mackay IM, Yakob L | title = Heterogeneous and Dynamic Prevalence of Asymptomatic Influenza Virus Infections | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1052–6 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27191967 | pmc = 4880086 | doi = 10.3201/eid2206.151080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Researchers have expressed desire to better predict transmission methods in order to determine the appropriate public health response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.contagionlive.com/news/asymptomatic-influenza-infection-rates-deserve-more-attention |title = Asymptomatic Influenza Infection Rates Deserve More Attention|last=Perlman|first=William | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 2016|website=Contagion Live |access-date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a disease with a known low asymptomatic rate may lead to increased surveillance of symptomatic cases, whereas a higher asymptomatic rate could lead to more aggressive methods such as travel-bans, compulsory quarantines since the number of infectious cases would be unknown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Possible explanations ==
While an exact explanation for aymsptomatic carriage is unknown, reasearchers have been dedicating their efforts towards understanding how specific bacteria thrive in human hosts in the hopes of determining a universal understanding of asymptomatic transmission.

=== A biological mechanism utilizing ''Salmonella'' ===
Numerous research publications have demonstrated how salmonella is able to remain in immune cells and alter their metabolic systems in order to further transmit the disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;Utilizing a closely related strand of bacterium (''S. typhimurium''), scientists have been able to create a mouse model that mimicks the persistent salmonella cases seen in carriers of typhoid. Knowing that the bacterium can reside in mice for their entire lives, researchers have been able to determine that the bacterium tends to reside in [[Macrophage|macrophages]]. Further examination of the gut lymph nodes of the mice reveals that ''S. typhimurium'' changes the inflammatory response of the macrophages. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=David|last2=Monack|first2=Denise M.|last3=Smith|first3=Mark R.|last4=Ghori|first4=Nafisa|last5=Falkow|first5=Stanley|last6=Zychlinsky|first6=Arturo|date=1999-03-02|title=The Salmonella invasin SipB induces macrophage apoptosis by binding to caspase-1|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/5/2396|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=96|issue=5|pages=2396–2401|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.5.2396|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10051653}}&lt;/ref&gt;Instead of eliciting an inflammatory response from the attack cells, the bacterium is able to convert them into an anti-inflammatory macrophage, allowing for optimal survival conditions. In the words of lead scientist Dr. Monack, “It wasn’t that inflammatory macrophages were invulnerable to infection, but rather that, having infected a macrophage, ''S. typhimurium'' was much more able to replicate in the anti-inflammatory type”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Investigators have also found that the presence of peroxide-proliferation-induced receptors, or PPARs, correlated to the presence of salmonella bacterium. PPARs, thought of as roaming genetic switches, are responsible for the fat metabolism needed to sustain anti-inflammatory macrophages in which ''S. typhimurium'' hides&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;'''.'''

== Asymptomatc bacteriuria ==

Asymptomatc [[bacteriuria]] is a condition that typically impacts 3-5% of women, with the most vulnerable populations being the elderly and those diagnosed with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/SupportingDoc/asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening/evidence-summary11 |title=Evidence Summary: Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults: Screening | work = US Preventive Services Task Force |access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the female population, the risk of bacteriuria increases with age. ''Escherichia coli'' is the most common organism found during urine anylsis though the variety of potentially infectious organisms is diverse and can include Enterobacteriaceae, ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'', Enterococcus species, and group B streptococcus.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colgan R, Nicolle LE, McGlone A, Hooton TM | title = Asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 985–90 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17002033 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0915/p985.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] has issued a set of screening recommendations as well as offered some inisght into the mechanism of bacteriuria.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Results of the meta-anylsis produced no clear explanation for asymptomatic carriage, but did yield new evidence that strengthened the support for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women only.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Infectious diseases ==
Asymptomatic carriers have furthered the spread of many infectious diseases. A common principle in epidemiology, the 80-20 rule speculates that 80% of the disease transmission is conducted by only 20% of people in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-02/ehs-zio022516.php|title=Zeroing in on 'super spreaders' and other hidden patterns of epidemics|website=EurekAlert!|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers are responsible for significant bacterium transmission in many common diseases such as the flu, but may also contribute to the spread of less common infections.

=== Typhoid fever ===
Typhoid fever is an ailment caused by bacterium ''Salmonella enterica'' ser. Typhi. An individual can acquire this infection from consuming risky foods or drinks, or by consuming foods or drinks prepared by an infected individual. (Hence, Typhoid Mary.) Those who recover from this infection can still carry the bacteria in their cells, and therefore be asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/typhoid_fever/|title=CDC - Typhoid Fever: General Information - NCZVED|date=|publisher=Cdc.gov|access-date=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary).jpg|thumb|Typhoid Mary in a New York Hospital]]

==== Typhoid Mary ====
[[Mary Mallon]], known as "Typhoid Mary", was an asymptomatic carrier of ''Salmonella'' ''enterica'' serovar typhi, the causative agent of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists get a handle on what made Typhoid Mary's infectious microbes tick |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2013/august/typhoid.html |website=Med.stanford.edu |access-date=20 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818111217/http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2013/august/typhoid.html |archive-date=18 August 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  cook for several families and soldiers in New York City during the late 1800’s, several cases of typhoid fever were traced to her by the Health Department. At the time, there was no way of eradicating the disease, and it was spread primarily through fecal-oral transmission. Most of Mary Mallon's transmission risk was thought to arise from her continued involvement in occupations involving food preparation and handling. New York City's public health officials initially sought to merely restrict her from such employment rather than permanently quarantining her. When she continued to be non-compliant, the Health Commission ordered that she be quarantined on one of the islands surrounding Manhattan. She remained there until her death.

Despite appearing perfectly healthy, it is estimated that Mary infected about 50 people before she was quarantined.Scientists calculate that between 1% and 6% of individuals infected with ''Salmonella'' ''typhi'' become chronic, asymptomatic carriers like Mary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===HIV===
[[HIV infection]] has a long period during which the person is [[asymptomatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siliciano|first=Robert F.|title=HIV Latency|url=http://perspectivesinmedicine.org/content/1/1/a007096.full|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|access-date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the host may not be experiencing symptoms, the virus can still be passed on to others. It is also possible for the infection to become symptomatic after this latent period. Whether the host is showing symptoms or not, opportunistic infections can take advantage of the weakened immune system and cause further complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000682.htm |title=Asymptomatic HIV infection: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2016-02-02 |access-date=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein-Barr virus ===
Many carriers are infected with persistent viruses such as [[Epstein-Barr Virus]] (EBV), which is a member of the herpes virus family. Studies show that about 95% of adults have antibodies against EBV, which means they were infected with the virus at some point in their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=89105 |title=The Broad Spectrum of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Disease on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |access-date=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Clostridium difficile===
[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]] has also been shown to be spread by asymptomatic carriers, and poses significant problems in care home settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riggs MM, Sethi AK, Zabarsky TF, Eckstein EC, Jump RL, Donskey CJ | title = Asymptomatic carriers are a potential source for transmission of epidemic and nonepidemic Clostridium difficile strains among long-term care facility residents | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 45 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–8 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17879913 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/521854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports indicating that over 50% of long-term patients presented with fecal contamination despite a lack of symptoms have led many hospitals to extend the contact precautions period until discharge&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

===Chlamydia===
Chlamydia, an STI that affects both men and women, can also be asymptomatic in most individuals. Although the infection is not yielding any symptoms, it can still damage the reproductive system. If the infection goes unnoticed for a long time, the infected individual(s) are at risk of developing [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID). Like Chlamydia, PID can also be asymptomatic. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm |title=STD Facts - Chlamydia |publisher=cdc.gov |date= |access-date=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poliomyelitis===
A small number of asymptomatic carriers (referred to as ''chronic excretors'') continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral [[Sabin vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses — Worldwide, January 2014–March 2015|author1=Ousmane M. Diop |author2=Cara C. Burns |author3=Roland W. Sutter |author4=Steven G. Wassilak |author5=Olen M. Kew |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=64 |pages=640–646 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6423a4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers of the [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] virus unintentionally spread the attenuated virus, inoculating others, giving them [[contact immunity]]; however some adults with weak immune systems have [[polio vaccine#Vaccine-induced polio|contracted paralytic polio]] from contact with recently immunized children. Carriers of virulent strains spread polio, increasing the difficulty of [[poliomyelitis eradication]].

=== Tuberculosis ===
Tuberculosis (TB) is an [[infectious disease]] usually caused by the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the [[Lung|lungs]], but can also affect other parts of the body&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis|title=Tuberculosis (TB)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Active or symptoamtic tuberculoisis is spread from person to person through the air through baterium spores that are released into the air following a cough or sneeze. Some individuals may be infected with the mycobacterium tuberculosis but never display symptoms&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/preventive-care/ltbi_faqs/en/.|title=Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Called [[Latent tuberculosis|latent turberculosis,]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;these cases while uncontagious are particularly problemtatic from a public health perspective since approximately 10% of those diagnosed with latent TB will go on to develop an active (and contagious) case&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;'''.'''

'''Bangsjøan''' is a man-made lake on the borders of the municipalities of [[Snåsa]], [[Grong]], [[Overhalla]], and [[Steinkjer]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]]. The lake lies about {{convert|10|km}} north of the lake [[Snåsavatnet]] and about {{convert|18|km}} northwest of the village of [[Snåsa (village)|Snåsa]].  The lake was created by the building of a [[dam]] which cause the water level of three lakes to rise and flow together into one large lake.  The dam is located on what is now the northwestern side of the lake.  

Originally, there were three lakes. The southwestern lake was called ''Ytter-Bangsjøen'', the middle lake was ''Midter-Bangsjøen'', and the northeastern lake was ''Øyster-Bangsjøen''. Today, the lakes flow together and the three old lake names are still used to refer to their respective areas in the large lake.  The lake empties through a [[dam]] at the northwestern end and into the river [[Bongna]].&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Bongna|title=Bongna|editor-first=Geir|editor-last= Thorsnæs|accessdate=2018-04-07|date=2017-11-13|encyclopedia =[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher= [[Kunnskapsforlaget]] |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Jane Bain''' is an [[haematologist]] and professor at the [[Imperial College School of Medicine|Imperial College Faculty of Medicine]], and consultant at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]].

== Life ==
Barbara Bain grew up in Australia and was educated in [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourfrasercoast.com.au/Portals/0/Walk%20of%20Achievers_booklet_2017_WEB.pdf|title=Walk of Achievers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Fraser Coast Regional Council]]|page=13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012145514/http://www.ourfrasercoast.com.au/Portals/0/Walk%20of%20Achievers_booklet_2017_WEB.pdf|archive-date=13 October 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took the exams of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]. She went to England in late 1971 to further her career abroad,&lt;ref name=EHA&gt;[https://podfanatic.com/podcast/eha-hematology-podcast/episode/interview-with-barbara-bain-on-what-i-have-seen-and-heard-during-the-last-few-years-an-interview-with-professor-barbara-bain-video-july-2015 EHA Hematology: Interview with Barbara Bain]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after some time back in Australia, in [[Brisbane]], returned to the UK. One reason for choosing haematology as her speciality was that it combined laboratory and clinical work.&lt;ref name=EHA/&gt; Influential mentors in her career were [[Sir John Dacie]], David Galton and, later on, Daniel Catovsky.&lt;ref name=bloodmed&gt;[http://www.bloodmed.com/home/profile1.asp?id=74 Barbara J.

She says her main interests are diagnostic haematology, writing and teaching.&lt;ref name=bloodmed /&gt; She has published various teaching materials and frequently-reissued textbooks as well as numerous other academic writings.

She was part of the International Working Group on Morphology of [[myelodysplastic syndromes|MDS]] and also in the group which devised the 2008 [[WHO]] classification of [[Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues|tumours of the lymphoid haematopoietic systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kenes.com/mds2011/scientific/Documents/barbara_bain.pdf MDS conference speaker's CV]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has translated two editions of an Italian work on the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the blood,&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe d'Onofrio, Gina Zini, trans. B.J.Bain ''Morphology of the blood'', Butterworth-Heinemann 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and gives Italian as one of her hobbies. Art history, visiting art galleries and the study of [[St Sebastian]] are other interests of hers.&lt;ref name=bloodmed /&gt;

}}'''Blepharitis''' ({{IPAc-en|b|l|ɛ|f|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|t|ᵻ|s}} {{respell|BLEF|ər|EYE|tis}}) is one of the most common ocular conditions characterized by [[inflammation]],  scaling, reddening, and crusting of the [[eyelid]]. This condition may also cause burning, itching, or a grainy sensation when introducing foreign objects or substances to the eye. Although blepharitis is not sight-threatening, it can lead to permanent alterations of the eyelid margin. The overall etiology is a result of bacteria and inflammation from congested [[Meibomian gland|meibomian]] oil glands at the base of each eyelash. Other conditions may give rise to blepharitis, whether they be infectious or noninfectious, including, but not limited to, [[bacterial infection]]s or [[allergies]].

Different variations of blepharitis can be classified as seborrheic, [[Staphylococcal infection|staphylococcal]], mixed, posterior or meibomitis, or [[Parasitic disease|parasitic]].&lt;ref name="vaughan2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vaughan &amp; Asbury's general ophthalmology.|author=Emmett T. Cunningham|author2=Paul Riordan-Eva|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|isbn=978-0071634205|edition=18th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of US ophthalmologists and optometrists, 37% to 47% of patients seen by those surveyed had signs of blepharitis, which can affect all ages and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eyewiki.aao.org/Blepharitis|title=Blepharitis|vauthors = Singh Tonk R, Hossain K|date=November 27, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One single-center study of 90 patients with chronic blepharitis found that the average age of patients was 50 years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Symptoms==
Blepharitis is characterized by chronic [[inflammation]] of the [[eyelid]], usually at the base of the [[eyelash]]es.&lt;ref name="autogenerated42"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blepharitis/basics/definition/con-20024605 Blepharitis Definition - Diseases and Conditions - Mayo Clinic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/blepharitis Blepharitis: Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated32"&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1211763-clinical Medscape: Medscape Access&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include inflammation, irritation, itchiness, a burning sensation, excessive tearing, and crusting and sticking of eyelids.&lt;ref name="autogenerated42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt; Additional symptoms may include visual impairment such as [[photophobia]] and [[blurred vision]]. Symptoms are generally worse in the mornings and patients may experience exacerbation and several remissions if left untreated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is typically caused by bacterial infection or blockage of the meibomian oil glands.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt; Diseases and conditions that may lead to blepharitis include: [[rosacea]], [[herpes simplex]] [[dermatitis]], [[varicella-zoster]] dermatitis, [[molluscum contagiosum]], allergic dermatitis, [[contact dermatitis]], [[seborrheic dermatitis]], [[staphylococcal]] dermatitis, [[demodicosis]] ([[Demodex]]), and [[parasitic infection]]s (''e.g.'', [[Demodex]] and [[Phthiriasis palpebrarum]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated32" /&gt;

The parasite[[Demodex folliculorum|,&amp;nbsp;''Demodex folliculorum'']] (''D. folliculorum''), causes blepharitis when the parasite is present in excessive numbers within the [[dermis]] of the eyelids. These parasites can live for approximately 15 days. The parasites (both adult and eggs) live on the hair follicle, inhabiting the sebaceous and [[apocrine gland]] of the human lid. Direct contact allows this pathogen to spread. Factors that allow this pathogen to multiply include hypervascular tissue, poor hygienic conditions, and immune deficiency. In treating Blepharitis caused by ''D. folliculorum'', mechanical cleaning and proper hygiene are important towards decreasing the parasites numbers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="pmid19367544"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inceboz T, Yaman A, Over L, Ozturk AT, Akisu C | title = Diagnosis and treatment of demodectic blepharitis | journal = Turkiye Parazitolojii Dergisi | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–6 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19367544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
The mechanism by which the bacteria causes symptoms of blepharitis is not fully understood and may include direct irritation of bacterial toxins and/or enhanced cell-mediated immunity to [[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]].

[http://www.medilexicon.com/dictionary/18899 Staphylococcal blepharitis] is caused by an infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid by [[Staphylococcus|Staphylococcal bacteria]]. In a study of ocular flora, 46% to 51% of those diagnosed with staphylococcal blepharitis had cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus in comparison to 8% of normal patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Staphylococcal blepharitis may start in childhood and continue into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclinic.com/blepharitis.htm|title=Blepharitis|publisher=Angeles Vision Clinic|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504114556/http://www.avclinic.com/blepharitis.htm|archivedate=4 May 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=21 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly recurrent and it requires special medical care. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in the conjunctival sac and on the lid margin varies among countries, likely due to differences in climate and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1977|title=Staphylococcal blepharitis|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|volume=95|issue=5|pages=812–816|doi=10.1001/archopht.1977.04450050090009|pmid=324453|vauthors=Smolin G, Okumoto M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.medilexicon.com/dictionary/18899 Seborrheic blepharitis] is characterized by less inflammation than Staphylococcal blepharitis; however, it causes more excess oil or greasy scaling. [[Meibomian gland|Meibomian Gland Dysfunction]] is a result of abnormalities of the meibomian glands and altered secretion [[meibum]], which plays an imperative role in lagging the evaporation of tear films and smoothing of the tear film to produce an even optical surface. Posterior blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids, secondary to dysfunction of the [[meibomian gland]]s. Like anterior blepharitis, it is a bilateral chronic condition and may be associated with skin [[rosacea]].&lt;ref name="vaughan2" /&gt;  There is growing evidence that, in some cases, it is caused by [[Demodex]] mites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2010|title=Pathogenic Role of Demodex Mites in Blepharitis|journal=Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol|volume=10|issue=5|pages=505–510|doi=10.1097/aci.0b013e32833df9f4|pmc=2946818|pmid=20689407|vauthors=Liu J, Sheha H, ((Tseng SCG))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Blepharitis.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blepharitis.JPG|thumb|Blepharitis: swollen and reddened eyelid]]
Diagnosis of the condition is done via a physical examination under a slit lamp. Cultures of debris are occasionally collected for bacterial or fungal testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blepharitis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20024605 Blepharitis Tests and diagnosis - Diseases and Conditions - Mayo Clinic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1211763-workup Medscape: Medscape Access&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical examination ===
In all forms of blepharitis, optometrists or ophthalmologists examine the tear film, which is the most efficient method in determining instability. The most frequently used method is to measure tear production via [[Tear break up time|tear break-up time]] (TBUT), which calculates the duration interval between complete blinks. This serves as a primary indication of regional dryness in the pre-corneal tear film after fluorescein injections. If TBUT is shorter than 10 seconds, then this suggests instability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Staphylococcal blepharitis is diagnosed by examining erythema and edema of the eyelid margin. Patients may exhibit [[alopecia areata]] of eyelashes and/or growth misdirection, [[trichiasis]]. Other signs may include [[telangiectasia]] on the anterior eyelid, collarettes encircling the lash base, and corneal changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Seborrheic blepharitis is distinguished by less [[erythema]], [[edema]], and telangiectasia of the eyelid margins. Posterior blepharitis and Meibomian gland dysfunction are frequently associated with rosacea and can be seen during an ocular examination of the posterior eyelid margin. The Meibomian glands may appear caked with oil or visibly obstructed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Diagnostic procedures ===
Cultures of the eyelid margins can be a clear indicator for patients suffering from recurrent anterior blepharitis with severe inflammation, in addition to patients who are not responding to therapy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Measurements of tear osmolarity may be beneficial in diagnosing concurrent [[dry eye syndrome]] (DES), which may be responsible for overlapping symptoms and would allow the physician to decipher between conditions and move forward with the most beneficial protocol for the patient. Consequently, the measurement of tear osmolarity has various limitations in differentiating between aqueous deficiencies and evaporative dry eye.&lt;ref name="pmid19668387"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Savini G, Prabhawasat P, Kojima T, Grueterich M, Espana E, Goto E | title = The challenge of dry eye diagnosis | journal = Clinical Ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.) | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–55 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 19668387 | pmc = 2698717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic evaluation of [[Epilation|epilated]] eyelashes may reveal mites, which have been evident in cases of chronic [[blepharoconjunctivitis]].

== Prevention ==
Blepharitis is a result of bacteria and inflammation from congested [[Meibomian gland|meibomian]] oil glands at the base of each eyelash. Routine washing of the eyelids helps subdue symptoms and prevent blepharitis.  Washing each eyelid for 30 seconds, twice a day, with a single drop of [[hypoallergenic]] soap (e.g. baby shampoo) and ample water can help. The most effective treatment is over the counter lid scrubs used twice a day. Some doctors may recommend using a hypochloric acid treatment depending on the severity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment and prognosis ==
Blepharitis is a chronic condition causing frequent exacerbation, thus requires routine eyelid hygiene. Hygienic practices include warm compresses, eyelid massages generating consistent heat at body temperature (98.6 degrees F), and eyelid scrubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Systematic Review]] of topical antibiotics was shown to be effective in providing symptomatic relief and clearing bacteria for individuals with anterior blepharitis.&lt;ref name="Lindsley2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2012|title=Interventions for chronic blepharitis|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=5|issue=5|pages=CD00556|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005556.pub2|pmc=4270370|pmid=22592706|vauthors=Lindsey K, Matsumara S, Hatel E, Akpek EK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topical steroids provided some symptomatic relief, but they were ineffective in clearing bacteria from the eyelids.&lt;ref name="Lindsley2" /&gt; Lid hygiene measures such as [[warm compresses]] and lid scrubs were found to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for participants with anterior and posterior blepharitis.&lt;ref name="Lindsley2" /&gt;

=== Home care treatment ===
'''Warm compresses''': ''Soften lid margin debris and oils'' by placing a very warm wet compress such as a clean, warm, wet [[washcloth]] over the closed eyelids for five minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated52"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blepharitis/basics/lifestyle-home-remedies/con-20024605 Blepharitis Lifestyle and home remedies - Diseases and Conditions - Mayo Clinic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Re-wet and reapply it as it cools.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated62" /&gt; This warms, softens, and loosens crusty and oily eyelid gland deposits.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated52" /&gt;

'''Eyelid hygiene''': ''Remove lid margin debris'' immediately after the warm compresses by gently washing the eyelids with a warm, wet, soapy washcloth to remove accumulated debris.&lt;ref name="autogenerated62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated82"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blepharitis/basics/treatment/con-20024605 Blepharitis Treatments and drugs - Diseases and Conditions - Mayo Clinic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Use a diluted, hypoallergenic [[baby shampoo]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated52" /&gt; Gently rub along the lid margins, keeping the eyes shut. Too much soap or shampoo may remove the essential oil layer of the eyes' tear film and create further stress to the eye, as well as dry eye discomfort. A moist [[cotton swab]] soaked in a cup of water and baby shampoo may be used to rub along the lid margins while tilting the lid outward with the other hand to avoid this problem. Finally, rinse the eyelid with warm water and gently dry with a towel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated52" /&gt; ''Eye make-up'' should not be used while inflammation is present.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated52" /&gt; ''Dandruff shampoo'' can be helpful if dandruff is contributing to blepharitis and may relieve blepharitis symptoms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated52" /&gt;

=== Medication therapy treatment ===
'''''Oral antibiotics&lt;ref name="autogenerated62" /&gt;''''':&lt;ref name="autogenerated82" /&gt; Ophthalmologists or optometrists may prescribe a low-dose, oral [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] such as [[Doxycycline]].&lt;ref name="vaughan2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Pathogenic role of Demodex mites in blepharitis|journal=Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol|volume=10|issue=5|pages=505–510|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833df9f4|pmc=2946818|pmid=20689407|vauthors=Liu J, Sheha H, Tsenga CG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Topical antibiotics''''': If prescribed, topical creams or ointments can be applied after the cleansing of the lid margin. A small amount of antibiotic ophthalmic ointment is spread along the lid fissure with a swab or fingertip, while the eyes are closed. It is prescribed for use prior to bedtime to avoid blurred vision. Another method to reduce side effects of blepharitis are antibiotics such as [[erythromycin]] or [[sulfacetamide]], which are used via eye drops, creams, or ointments on the eyelid margin. blepharitis caused by [[Demodex]] mites can be treated using a diluted solution of tea tree oil, via application by a cotton swab, for 5–10 minutes per day.

'''''Steroid eyedrops/ointments:''''' Eye drops or ointments containing [[corticosteroid]]s are frequently used in conjunction with antibiotics and can reduce eyelid inflammation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated82" /&gt;

'''''Hypochlorous acid products''''': Both over-the-counter and prescription products with [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl) can be used to alleviate the signs and symptoms of blepharitis. In a recent study, a saline hygiene solution with hypochlorous acid was shown to reduce the bacterial load significantly without altering the diversity of bacterial species on the eyelids. After 20 minutes of treatment, there was &gt;99% reduction of the Staphylococci bacteria, which is a common cause of blepharitis.&lt;ref name="pmid28458509"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stroman DW, Mintun K, Epstein AB, Brimer CM, Patel CR, Branch JD, Najafi-Tagol K | title = Reduction in bacterial load using hypochlorous acid hygiene solution on ocular skin | journal = Clinical Ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.) | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 707–714 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28458509 | pmc = 5402722 | doi = 10.2147/OPTH.S132851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prognosis ===
Blepharitis is a chronic condition that has periods of exacerbation and remission. Patients should be informed that symptoms can frequently improve but are rarely eliminated. Infrequently, severe blepharitis can result in permanent alterations in the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial [[Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy|keratopathy]], [[corneal neovascularization]], and [[ulceration]]. Patients with an inflammatory eyelid lesion that appears suspicious of malignancy should be referred to an appropriate specialist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/blepharitis/article.htm|title=Blepharitis|last=Dahl|first=Andrew A|date=|website=MedicineNet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research ==
A study conducted in November 2017, conveyed a correlation between blepharitis and early onset [[metabolic syndrome]] (MetS). To investigate the relationship between blepharitis and MetS, researchers used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. Results indicated that [[Hyperlipidemia|hyperlipidaemia]] and [[coronary artery disease]] were significantly correlated with the prior development of blepharitis. Therefore, blepharitis was shown to be significantly related to MetS and can serve as an early indication of the condition.&lt;ref name="pmid29146760"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee CY, Chen HC, Lin HW, Huang JY, Chao SC, Yeh CB, Lin HY, Yang SF | title = Blepharitis as an early sign of metabolic syndrome: a nationwide population-based study | journal = The British Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29146760 | doi = 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2017-310975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another recent study, the presence of [[Demodex]] has been unveiled as a common cause of blepharitis. However, the pathogenesis of [[demodicosis]] is still unclear. In this study, researchers provide a diagnosis of the disease and propose diagnostic criteria of Demodex blepharitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang LY, Liu Y|first=Li J|date=September 11, 2017|title=Diagnostic criteria of demodex blepharitis|pmid=28926882|journal=&amp;#91;Zhonghua yan ke za zhi&amp;#93; Chinese journal of ophthalmology|volume=53|issue=9|pages=648–652|doi=10.3760/cma.j.issn.0412-4081.2017.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlotte's Web''' is a high-[[cannabidiol]] (CBD), low-[[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) [[Cannabis strains|''Cannabis'']] strain marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] under federal law  of the United States.&lt;ref name=ROC_about_us/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cordell/&gt;  It is produced by the Stanley brothers in Colorado. It does not induce the [[psychoactive]] "[[Substance intoxication|high]]" typically associated with recreational marijuana strains that are high in THC.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; In September 2014, the Stanleys announced that they would ensure that the product consistently contained less than 0.3% THC.&lt;ref name=Waltz_shipped/&gt;

&lt;!--Society and culture--&gt;
Charlotte's Web is named after Charlotte Figi,  born {{birth date and age|2006|10|18}}, whose story has led to her being described as "the girl who is changing medical marijuana laws across America."&lt;ref name=Osborne/&gt; Her parents and physicians say she experienced a reduction of her [[epileptic seizure]]s brought on by [[Dravet syndrome]] after her first dose of medical marijuana at five years of age. Her usage of Charlotte's Web was first featured in the 2013 [[CNN]] documentary "Weed".  Media coverage increased demand for Charlotte's Web and similar products high in CBD, which has been used to treat [[epilepsy]] in toddlers and children. It was originally called "Hippie's Disappointment" as it was a strain that had high CBD and could not induce a "high".&lt;ref name="Producers 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS_Denver/&gt; 

&lt;!--Evidence--&gt;
While anecdotal reports have sparked interest in treatment with [[cannabinoids]],&lt;ref name=Melville/&gt; there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about their safety or efficacy.&lt;ref name=Melville/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gloss2014/&gt; Physicians worry that some parents are willing to try treatments before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are "alarmed by parallels to past [[patent medicine|miracle-cure manias]] later proved false..." and "...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents."&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

== Medical uses ==
=== Evidence ===

In 2014, there was little evidence about the safety or efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;ref name=Melville/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tedesco/&gt; A 2014 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane review]] did not find enough evidence to draw conclusions about its use.&lt;ref name="Gloss2014"/&gt; A 2014 [[systematic review|review]] by the [[American Academy of Neurology]] similarly concluded that "data are insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of cannabinoids for reducing seizure frequency."&lt;ref name=Koppel/&gt;

The Cochrane review suggests cannabinoids be reserved for people with symptoms that are not controllable by other means, who have been evaluated by [[Long-term video-EEG monitoring|EEG-video]] monitoring to confirm diagnosis, and are not eligible for better established treatments such as surgery and [[neurostimulation]].&lt;ref name=Benbadis/&gt; A second review described four placebo-controlled trials of cannabadiol including 48 people with a disease that was not manageable by other means. Three out of four trials reported some reduction in seizures, but no comparison with placebo was possible due to the small number of people in the trials. The drugs were well tolerated.&lt;ref name=Robson/&gt; A third review found that no reliable conclusions about the effect of cannabis on epilepsy could be drawn due to the poor quality of available data, but further research may be warranted because of the good safety profile observed in small clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Szaflarski/&gt;

A 2017 study in children with drug-resistant Dravet syndrome, using a comparatively high dose of 20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, found cannabidiol reduced convulsive seizures (but not non-convulsive seizures), and resulted in more side effects compared with placebo.&lt;ref name="Devinsky_NEJM_5/29/2017"/&gt;

Three phase 3 clinical trials completed in 2017 demonstrated the efficacy of cannabidiol in reducing convulsive seizure activity at doses of 10–20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg per day in children with treatment-resistant Dravet Syndrome and treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.&lt;ref name=O'Connell/&gt;

=== Statements ===

Due to the [[anecdote|anecdotal]] nature of the health claims being made medical bodies have published statements of concern.

A position statement by the American Epilepsy Society states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The recent anecdotal reports of positive effects of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope. However, we must remember that these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.&lt;ref name=AES/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cannabis-derived products are not mentioned in the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] epilepsy treatment guidelines.&lt;ref name=NICE/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Drop of cannabis oil.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cannabis oil]]

Charlotte's Web was developed in 2011 by the Stanley brothers (Joel, Jesse, Jon, Jordan, Jared and Josh&lt;ref name=Ferner_Weed_Pioneers/&gt;) through [[Plant breeding|crossbreeding]] a strain of marijuana with industrial hemp.&lt;ref name=Honan_Wired/&gt; This process created a variety with less [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and more [[cannabidiol]] (CBD) than typical varieties of marijuana.&lt;ref name=Young_Charlotte/&gt; The variety shows potential for medical usage, especially for those who do not wish to experience the typical high of recreational marijuana use.&lt;ref name=CNN_transcript_1/&gt; As it is so low in THC, the variety was originally called "Hippie's Disappointment",&lt;ref name=CBS_Denver/&gt; and also has been labeled "boring".&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; It is a less profitable plant&lt;ref name=CNN_transcript_2/&gt; with "close to no value to traditional marijuana consumers."&lt;ref name=Honan/&gt;

The Stanley brothers grow the plants at their farm and greenhouses. A CBD rich oil is extracted from the harvested plants and concentrated through [[Rotary evaporator|rotary evaporation]].&lt;ref name=Stewart_Utah_lawmaker/&gt; To make it easier to perform [[clinical trial]]s, they are planning to move the Charlotte's Web part of their operation to [[Cannabis in Uruguay|Uruguay]]. By doing so, they will also be able to import it into any U.S. state as [[hemp]].&lt;ref name=Martinez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cordell/&gt;

The Realm of Caring Foundation (RoC),&lt;ref name=ROC_about_us/&gt; a [[501(c) organization#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]],&lt;ref name=IRS/&gt; was set up by the Stanley brothers to help patients "who can't afford the treatment."&lt;ref name=CBS_Denver/&gt; They have also started "Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, Inc.",&lt;ref name=Cordell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia_SBSE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leasca/&gt; which has registered the [[trademark]] "Charlotte's Web Hemp Products".&lt;ref name=Justia_CWHP/&gt; Some products are marketed through CW Hemp (formerly CW Botanicals).&lt;ref name="AP_7/23/2016"/&gt;&lt;!-- By policy, judicious use of self-referential primary sources is justifiable and necessary in articles about the subject. --&gt;

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===

With the main ingredient being classified as "industrial hemp", (Farm Bill) Charlotte's Web Oil and other CBD products are legal in all 50 states;
(as long as the THC content is &lt;0.3%) as they are dietary supplements. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The publicity associated with Charlotte's Web has inspired a number of legislative bills, some of which are in the planning stages, and others which have been proposed or actually passed. Children, as "uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country,"&lt;ref name=Roller/&gt; have inspired "the movement to legalize medicinal marijuana," a movement which "has a face like Charlotte’s–and it’s a young one that’s hard to ignore. Lawmakers across the country are pushing legislation to legalize marijuana oil as a treatment for children with epilepsy."&lt;ref name=Crivelli/&gt;

Colorado law permits the use of [[medical cannabis]] for eight conditions: [[cancer]], [[glaucoma]], [[HIV/AIDS]], muscle spasms, [[seizure]]s, severe [[pain]], severe nausea and [[cachexia|dramatic weight loss]], and muscle atrophy.&lt;ref name=Young_Charlotte/&gt; The publicity surrounding anecdotal reports of successful treatment of intractable epilepsy with [[cannabinoid]]s is likely to lead to a surge in interest.&lt;ref name=Melville/&gt;

In 2013, the parents of a two-year-old with Dravet syndrome confronted New Jersey governor [[Chris Christie]], who signed a bill allowing access for sick children to medical marijuana&lt;ref name=Honan/&gt; in a controversy dubbed "pot for tots".&lt;ref name=Honan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mother_Investigated/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

In 2014, legislative proposals in Utah,&lt;ref name=Utah_Gov/&gt;&lt;ref name=HB0105/&gt; Arizona,&lt;ref name=Flatow/&gt; New York,&lt;ref name=Botelho/&gt; Washington state,&lt;ref name=Honan/&gt; Minnesota,&lt;ref name=Seavert/&gt; and Florida&lt;ref name=Cotterell/&gt;&lt;ref name=HB_843/&gt; were considered, where "even some staunch opponents of medical marijuana now are willing to make an exception" to allow the marijuana extract for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

In Utah, Rep. Gage Froerer, R-Huntsville, said in October 2013: "Nothing in federal or state law prohibits the sale or use of hemp products."&lt;ref name=Stewart_Utah_lawmaker/&gt; He pledged to consult with the Utah Substance Abuse Authority, saying: "We need to take a strong look at this and make sure that we as a legislature and we as citizens understand really what this is and what it's not."&lt;ref name= Adams/&gt;  In November 2013, he said he would address "three components in sponsoring legislation: access, quality control and research. He said the Utah Department of Health would probably be involved in quality-control efforts..."&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Annette Maughan, President of the Epilepsy Association of Utah, said: "The current Utah law doesn't exclude its use but also doesn't allow for its use. We are in limbo until Utah lawmakers decide what to call it."&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; On March 21, 2014, [[Gary Herbert]], the governor of Utah, signed a bill giving "families access to the marijuana extract for treating epilepsy."&lt;ref name=Flatow/&gt; The state bill, HB0105, allows import of Charlotte's Web extract across state lines from Colorado to Utah, and covers only use for intractable epilepsy with the consent of a neurologist.&lt;ref name=Utah_Gov/&gt;&lt;ref name=HB0105/&gt; Also on March 21, 2014, an Arizona court found "that Arizona's medical marijuana law allows consumption of the plant in extract form."&lt;ref name=Flatow/&gt;

On March 20, 2014, the [[Florida House of Representatives]] Budget Committee passed the "so-called Charlotte's Web measure (CS/HB 843)"&lt;ref name=HB_843/&gt; designed to limit prosecutors' ability to prosecute those in possession of low THC/high CBD marijuana ("0.5 percent or less of tetrahydrocannabinol and more than 15 percent of cannabidiol") used for treating seizures. The law took effect July 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Since then, Florida legislators have passed a bill with bipartisan support legalizing the use of Charlotte's Web,&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt; and Governor [[Rick Scott]] signed the "Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014" (SB 1030)&lt;ref name=Cotterell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida_Senate/&gt; into law on June 6, 2014. The law is also referred to as the "Charlotte's Web" law.&lt;ref name=Call/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; The law specifies the number of distribution centers, which types of nurseries can grow the plants, requires various other controls,&lt;ref name=Larrabee/&gt; and provides funding for research.&lt;ref name=Cotterell/&gt;

* Federal legislation was introduced in 2014 (U.S. 113th Congress 2013-2014) but was never brought to a vote and died in committee.&lt;ref name=H.R.5226/&gt;&lt;ref name=H.R.5226B/&gt;&lt;ref name=H.R.525/&gt;&lt;ref name=H.R.525B/&gt;
* Rep. Perry, Scott (R-PA-4) introduced to the U.S. 114th Congress (2015-2016) H.R.1635 - Charlotte's Web Medical Access Act of 2015&lt;ref name=H.R.1635/&gt; with 62 [[bipartisan]] co-sponsors.&lt;ref name=H.R.1635_Cosponsors/&gt; It has not been voted on yet, but it has made progress and been referred to the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], the [[House Committee on the Judiciary]], the [[Subcommittee on Health]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations]].
* The Therapeutic Hemp Medical Access Act of 2015 (Senate 1333) was introduced (not passed yet) with 11 co-sponsors to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude cannabidiol and cannabidiol-rich plants from the definition of marijuana. It was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.&lt;ref name=S.1333/&gt;

On October 31, 2017, the FDA sent warning letters to four CBD marketers, including Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, LLC (d/b/a CW Hemp), the producer of Charlotte's Web. They were warned "against making medical claims about cannabidiol (CBD). The agency also took issue with the businesses marketing CBD products as dietary supplements".&lt;ref name="Zhang_10/1/2017"/&gt;

=== Reactions to CBD-only laws ===

The federal [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule 1]] drug classification&lt;ref name=DEA_scheduling/&gt; blocks broad scientific research on cannabis. However, in late 2015, the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) eased some regulatory requirements imposed by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) for those who are conducting FDA-approved [[clinical trials]] on cannabidiol (CBD). These modifications will streamline the research process regarding CBD’s possible medicinal value and help foster ongoing scientific studies.&lt;ref name="DEA_12/23/15"/&gt;

But the [[Marijuana Policy Project]] has expressed frustration over the fact that many legislative efforts inspired by Charlotte's Web are aimed at only legalizing low or no THC, high CBD medical marijuana products. They believe that such legislation is too restrictive and ignores claimed benefits of THC, leaving "behind around 98% of the individuals who can benefit from it."&lt;ref name=MPP/&gt; Referring to the "Charlotte’s Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014", an editorial in ''Ladybud Magazine'' expressed concern that the law "leaves thousands of patients out in the cold without safe, legal access to medical cannabis. It also ignores science that seems to indicate that whole plant medicine is optimal."&lt;ref name=Ladybud_choking_out/&gt;

=== Name ===

Charlotte's Web is named after an American girl, Charlotte Figi. She developed Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI) as a baby.  By age three, Figi was severely disabled and having 300 [[Tonic–clonic seizure|grand mal seizures]] a week despite treatment.&lt;ref name=Young_Charlotte/&gt;&lt;ref name=The_View_Oct._17_2014/&gt;  Her parents learned about another child with Dravet Syndrome, who had been using a different type of medical marijuana since June 2011, and decided to try marijuana.&lt;ref name="Waltz_limited"/&gt;  Her parents and physicians said that she improved immediately.  She now follows a regular regimen that uses a solution of the high-CBD marijuana extract in [[olive oil]].  She is given the oil under her tongue or in her food.&lt;ref name="Young_Charlotte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotter"/&gt; Her parents said in 2013 that her epilepsy had improved so that she had only about four seizures per month, and she was able to engage in normal childhood activities.&lt;ref name="Young_Charlotte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"/&gt;

The type now named after Figi was not the first type her parents tried.  As their original supply, a type called R4 that is also high in CBD and low in THC, was running out, they contacted the Stanley brothers. From the Stanleys' stock, they chose the high-CBD variety that has since been renamed to Charlotte's Web.&lt;ref name="Young_Charlotte"/&gt;

Charlotte's story has been featured on two CNN documentaries,&lt;ref name=CNN_transcript_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN_transcript_2/&gt; ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' TV show,&lt;ref name=TheDoctors1/&gt; [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|''60 Minutes'' Australia]],&lt;ref name="Usher_7/31/2014"/&gt; and ''[[Dateline NBC]]'',&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; among many other sources. An article in the ''[[National Journal]]'' detailing the role of several children as "uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country" described Charlotte as the "first poster child for the issue...."&lt;ref name=Roller/&gt; Her story has led to her being described as "the girl who is changing medical marijuana laws across America,"&lt;ref name=Osborne/&gt; as well as the "most famous example of medicinal hemp use".&lt;ref name=Schaaf/&gt;

=== Publicity and demand ===

When Charlotte was five years old, her story was featured in the August 11, 2013 CNN documentary "Weed", hosted by [[Sanjay Gupta]].&lt;ref name=CNN_transcript_1/&gt; On November 24, 2013, Paige Figi was a guest on ''The Doctors'' TV show, where Charlotte's story was told.&lt;ref name=TheDoctors1/&gt; She was also featured in Gupta's March 11, 2014 CNN documentary "Weed 2: Cannabis Madness".&lt;ref name=CNN_transcript_2/&gt; The extract received more publicity on October 6, 2014, when ''The Doctors'' TV show again featured a story about usage of Charlotte's Web. The physicians called for a change of the Federal classification.&lt;ref name=TheDoctors2/&gt; Sanjay Gupta has also expressed his support for Charlotte's Web on ''The Doctors'' TV show.&lt;ref name=Gupta_TheDoctors/&gt; On the October 17, 2014 episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', Paige Figi and Joel Stanley were interviewed by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Nicolle Wallace]].&lt;ref name=The_View_Oct._17_2014/&gt;

The CNN documentaries received widespread publicity and popularized Charlotte's Web as a possible treatment for epilepsy and other conditions.&lt;ref name=Young_Charlotte/&gt; Colorado has legalized both the [[Medical cannabis in the United States#Colorado|medicinal]] and [[Colorado Amendment 64|recreational]] use of marijuana, and many parents have flocked there with their suffering children in search of Charlotte's Web and other forms of medical marijuana.&lt;ref name=Healy/&gt; In November 2013, [[CBS Denver]] reported that "[t]here is now a growing community of 93 families with epileptic children using marijuana daily. Hundreds are on a waiting list and thousands are calling."&lt;ref name=CBS_Denver/&gt; In October 2014, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted the Stanley brothers had a waiting list of "more than 12,000 families."&lt;ref name=Pickert_pot_kids/&gt; They have been termed "marijuana refugees",&lt;ref name=CBS_Denver/&gt; "part of a migration of families uprooting their lives and moving to Colorado, where the medicinal use of marijuana is permitted...forced to flee states where cannabis is off limits."&lt;ref name=Stewart_Families_migrate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillips_new_pot_laws/&gt; In November 2014, [[David Nutt]] mentioned Charlotte's Web in the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]'s ''[[Pharmaceutical Journal]]'', where he appealed for "the UK government [to] acts on evidence, allowing the use of medicinal cannabis and reducing barriers to its research."&lt;ref name=Nutt/&gt;

Families who say they have run out of pharmaceutical options have moved to Colorado to access Charlotte's Web. The demand has spurred calls for more research to determine whether these products actually do what is claimed. Amy Brooks-Kayal, vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, stated that epileptic seizures may come and go without any obvious explanation, and that Charlotte's web could cause developmental harm. She recommended that parents relocate so that their affected children could have access to one of the nation's top pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado.&lt;ref name=CBS_doctors_skeptical/&gt;

The product has been described as the "country's most famous brand of CBD oil",&lt;ref name="Abcarian_4/2/2017"/&gt; the "largest selling CBD oil in the country",&lt;ref name="Davidson_4/20/2017"/&gt; and the "number one brand", with 7% of the market.&lt;ref name="Borchardt_8/23/2017"/&gt;

=== Distribution ===

In November 2013, Josh Stanley said that Charlotte's web was 0.5% THC and 17% CBD,&lt;ref name=Ferner_Weed_Pioneers/&gt; and that it "is as legal as other hemp products already sold in stores across Utah, including other oils, clothing and hand creams, but is illegal, federally, to take across state lines."&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt; The legalities of selling the product to people who transport it across state lines is complicated, with difficulties for both the sellers and transporters. Regardless of state laws in Colorado and Utah which would allow the practice, it is still a Federal offense to transport hemp products across state lines.&lt;ref name=Stewart_How_will/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; In September 2014, the content was measured at 0.3% THC.&lt;ref name=Waltz_shipped/&gt;

=== Initial IPO offering in 2018 ===

On August 30, 2018, Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. (formerly Stanley Brothers Holdings Inc.) began its launch into the [[stock market]] with an [[initial public offering]] in Canada: "The offering included a treasury issuance by the company of common shares…moreover, a secondary offering of Common Shares…for total gross proceeds of C$115,115,000 (USD 87,598,872)."&lt;ref name="Somerset_9/9/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Somerset | first=Sara Brittany | title=CBD Company Charlotte's Web Debuts IPO | website=[[Forbes]] | date=September 9, 2018 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarabrittanysomerset/2018/09/09/cbd-company-charlottes-web-debuts-ipo/ | access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

The relationship between the Schedule I status of cannabis in the United States and the lack of scientific research on cannabis has been claimed by some to be directly related.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt; The situation has been described as a [[Catch-22 (logic)|"catch-22" paradox]]: "Marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions."&lt;ref name=Hellerman/&gt; Sanjay Gupta has described the complex interaction between restrictive laws and lack of scientific research:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gupta repeated throughout the evening that the "policy has outpaced the science." The states, he said, "are moving forward without waiting for the science, and the issue is only compounded by the fact that the 'policies and the laws we have in [the US] make it challenging for the science to get done."&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even though the Florida "Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014" (SB 1030)&lt;ref name=Cotterell/&gt; provides funding for research, the status of all cannabis products as illegal [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I drugs]] has limited the amount of research, with the [[University of Florida]] refusing to do such research for fear of losing federal funding.&lt;ref name=Call/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curry/&gt;

The interest created by the documentary highlighted a need for increased scientific research, as well as caution against "bad medicine" and raising false hopes: Ed Maa, a specialist in epilepsy, stated: "This is not going away. ...I think it needs to be studied vigorously and very quickly." He hopes to "launch a clinical trial to study the pot and its potential."&lt;ref name=CBS_Denver/&gt;  Physicians have called for more research to better understand the potential benefits of controlled use of medical marijuana;&lt;ref name=Melville/&gt;  Sharon Levy, director of the Adolescent Substance Abuse Program at Children's Hospital Boston said:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The AAP strongly supports more cannabinoid research to better understand both how these substances can be used therapeutically as well as their potential side effects—which we may well be underestimating...[But] the AAP does not support 'medical marijuana' laws as they circumvent regulations put in place to protect patients, and children are a particularly vulnerable population."&lt;ref name=Melville/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Physicians have expressed both positive interest and worry about the sudden explosion of interest in the legalization of medical marijuana and its research, admitting legalization is both "a scientist's dream or a doctor's nightmare." They fear that some parents are too open to trying anything before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are "alarmed by parallels to past miracle-cure manias later proved false..." and "...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents."&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; There is also danger that "the [legalization] movement also opens the way for bad medicine...through treatments at best giving hope to the hysterical and at worst delivering damaging side effects."&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; According to Alan Shackelford, Charlotte Figi's physician: "We really don't know how it works... The cannabidiol seems to act as a neuro-stabilizer, but how? The research is minuscule on this."&lt;ref name=Phillips_only_option_left/&gt;

[[Orrin Devinsky]], a neurologist at New York University's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, where he will conduct clinical trials on Epidiolex,&lt;ref name=GWPharma_Epidiolex/&gt; a high-CBD drug from [[GW Pharmaceuticals]], expressed his sympathy for those who do not want to wait for research results:&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; I had a child who had failed 15 medications and drug treatments and there was nothing else to do, and they were having many seizures a day that were terribly disabling, I think it would be a very reasonable thing to do to try a high-CBD cannabis product.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also expressed concern that the number of parents using the Charlotte's Web extract will make it harder to find children for the clinical trials, and that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many more unknowns than knowns...the focus of the community—lay and scientific and governmental—should be on getting good information. That should be the real focus of what we need right now.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Epilepsy Foundation]] and Devinsky issued a joint statement calling for increased research and immediate&lt;!-- "they need that access now." --&gt; access to medical marijuana, specifically naming Charlotte Figi's case.  Devinsky said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We need to make a balanced decision about compassionate use. If I were Charlotte Figi's parents and lived in Colorado I would have done exactly what they did. And as a doctor, I would gladly prescribe marijuana products for many of my patients who failed existing therapies if it were legal in my state.&amp;nbsp;... Until we have the scientific data, we should make medical marijuana available to physicians who care for people with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their patients.&lt;ref name=Gattone/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to reports that some people with Dravet syndrome seem to benefit from treatment with Charlotte's Web, an [[observational study|observational]] [[clinical trial]] was launched in September 2014 at the [[University of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=ClinicalTrials.gov_NCT02229032/&gt; The study will run until February 2016, will focus on [[genetics|genetic]] differences between people who respond and do not respond, and attempt to determine if such genetic factors may be related to the success or failure of treatment.&lt;ref name=Pickert_hard_science/&gt;

In January 2018, it was reported that trials with Epidiolex, a high-CBD pharmaceutical, had been successful enough that it might be "available as soon as the second half of 2018 in the United States, pending Food and Drug Administration approval."&lt;ref name="Cha_1/24/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cha | first=Ariana Eunjung | title=Marijuana-based anti-seizure drug could hit U.S. market in 2018 after strong study results | website=The Washington Post | date=January 24, 2018 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/01/24/marijuana-based-anti-seizure-drug-may-hit-u-s-market-in-2018-after-strong-study-results/ | access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chesil Cove.JPG|thumb|Chesil Cove at Chiswell with [[Chesil Beach]] stretching off into the distance.]]
[[File:Chesil cove from west cliff portland dorset.jpg|thumb|upright|Chesil Cove from [[West Cliff]].]]
'''Chesil Cove''' is a cove situated at the most southerly part of the {{convert|29|km|mi|0|adj=on}} long [[Chesil Beach]] in [[Dorset]], [[England]]. Chesil Beach itself is one of three major shingle structures in Britain, extending from [[West Bay, Dorset|West Bay]] to the [[Isle of Portland]], the latter acting as a large groyne holding the beach in place. It also provides shelter from the [[prevailing wind]]s and waves for the town of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and the village of [[Chiswell]].

==Flooding defences==
The adjoining village of Chiswell was established predominately as a fishing community. Despite its vulnerability to sea storms and flooding, Chiswell continued to develop into a thriving community.&lt;ref name="chiswellcommunity1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiswellcommunity.org/ccommunity/page.aspx |title=The History of the Site |publisher=Chiswellcommunity.org |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813022806/http://chiswellcommunity.org/ccommunity/page.aspx |archivedate=13 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best-documented incidents of flooding occurred in the [[Great Storm of 1824]]. The storm saw the death of thirty residents, the destruction of eighty houses, and the damage of many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2013/01/the-great-gale-of-1824/ |title=The Great Gale of 1824 &amp;#124; Dorset Life - The Dorset Magazine |publisher=Dorset Life |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of a sea wall finally commenced in 1958, and work on this scheme continued until 1965. The wall extended from the far end of Chesil Cove, at West Weares, to the location of the village's Cove House Inn.&lt;ref name="dorsetforyou1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/203969/Storms-and-Coastal-Defences-at-Chiswell/pdf/Storms_and_Coastal_Defences_at_Chiswell_WEB.pdf |format=PDF |title=Storms and Coastal Defences at Chiswell |publisher=Dorsetforyou.com |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promenade was laid-out on top of the wall, and this became a popular attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/680730/ |title=680730 |publisher=Geoffkirby.co.uk |date=15 January 1920 |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sea wall proving a worthy defence, incidents of widespread flooding continue. During December 1978 and February 1979, two major storms caused further devastation to Chiswell. Accordingly, further defence were installated during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.swgfl.org.uk/jurassic/chis11.htm |title=Jurassic Coast – Chiswell view today |publisher=Content.swgfl.org.uk |date= |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194839/http://content.swgfl.org.uk/jurassic/chis11.htm |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During January–February 2014, violent storms across the south-west of England caused more flooding in the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26050513 |title=UK storms: Waves crash over sea wall at Chiswell, overlooking Chesil Cove, Dorset - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{See also|Geology of Dorset}}
The [[Jurassic Coast]] stretches over a distance of {{convert|155|km|mi|0}}, from [[Orcombe Point]] near [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]], in the west, to [[Old Harry Rocks]] on the [[Isle of Purbeck]], in the east.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2001 | url = http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=1029 | title = Dorset and East Devon Coast | work = | publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre | accessdate = 14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of [[Triassic]], [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the [[Earth]]'s history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast includes a large range of important [[fossil]] zones.

==Recreation==
===Diving===
Chesil Cove is a popular site for [[scuba diver]]s. It has become one of the best known shore dives in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinharvey.com/dive/map-inshore.htm#chesil |title=Dives inshore |publisher=Martinharvey.com |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cove is a reasonably shallow shore dive, and has an interesting selection of south coast marine life, as well as an abundance of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="underwaterexplorers.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterexplorers.co.uk/projectchesil |title=Chesil Beach Project |publisher=Underwater Explorers |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been many [[shipwreck]]s in the cove, few significant divable remains exist close to the beach due to its exposure to strong waves.

===Fishing===
Through [[fishing]], the beach provided the main occupation for the villagers of Chiswell and the rest of the islanders. The beach is still used by [[sea angling|sea anglers]] and the British record for shore-captured [[shore rockling]] was set there in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portland Fishing &amp;ndash; Chesil Cove |publisher=portlandbill.co.uk| url=http://www.portlandbill.co.uk/fishing/chesil_cove.htm|accessdate=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recreational fishing is a popular pastime at the cove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandbill.co.uk/fishing/chesil_cove.htm |title=www.fancysfarm.co.uk |publisher=Portlandbill.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shipwrecks==
Chesil Beach, and the cove, have seen many cases of shipwrecks, more so than most other parts of the British coast, particularly during the [[age of sail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=John P.|title=The Book of the Chesil Beach – Dorset|year=1985|publisher=Nigel J. Clarke Publications|isbn=0907683185|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesilbeach.org/cfatoz/cfatoz_ST.html |title=Chesil and Fleet A to Z; S to T |publisher=Chesilbeach.org |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chesil Beach became infamously known as "Deadman's Bay", taken after the name [[Thomas Hardy]] gave West Bay, including Chesil Cove, in his novel ''The Well Beloved'' of 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Thomas|title=The Well-Beloved with The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved (Wordsworth Classics)|edition=New|year=2000|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=978-1840224054|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local fishermen, particularly at Portland, developed a purpose-built vessel to withstand the sea actions at Chesil Beach. The boat, known as a Lerret, is a double-ended open fishing boat, used for [[Seine fishing|seine net fishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritagecoast.co.uk/things_to_do/fishing/commercial_fishing/lerrets.htm |title=Heritage coast news - Lerrets |publisher=Theheritagecoast.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century public house [[The Cove House Inn]] remains one of Portland's most popular pubs and is Grade II Listed. Despite its particularly vulnerable position on the beach, the pub was a survivor of the [[Great Storm of 1824]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1280745 |desc=|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contrex''' is a brand of [[mineral water]] owned since 1992 by [[Nestlé Waters]], a branch of the Swiss group [[Nestlé]],  and is part of the ''Vittel'' mineral water company that includes [[Vittel]] and [[Hépar]]. The water, whose source is located in [[Contrexéville]] in the French ''département'' of [[Vosges (departement)|Vosges]], was discovered by Dr. Bagard, the first doctor of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The water is bottled in 250,000 m² factory complex that employs around 900 people. 635 million bottles of all kinds are produced, of which 11% are exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saga Contrex |url=http://www.prodimarques.com/sagas_marques/contrex/contrex.php |publisher=''Prodimarques'' |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottling factory is connected by pipelines with the Vittel factory in [[Vittel]], a few kilometers from Contrexéville, which permits bottling of the Contrex water in either Vittel or in Contrexéville.[[File:Usine embouteillage Contrex - Factory - Contrexéville 1.jpg|thumb|Bottling factory, Contrexéville|center]]Contrex is a highly mineralized water and has [[diuretic]] properties.

'''Design for All''' in the context of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) is the conscious and systematic effort to proactively apply principles, methods and tools to promote [[universal design]] in [[computer]]-related technologies, including [[Internet]]-based technologies, thus avoiding the need for ''a posteriori'' adaptations, or specialised design (Stephanidis et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Stephanidis"&gt;[http://www.ics.forth.gr/hci/publications/book.html User Interfaces for All: Concepts, Methods and Tools. Constantine Stephanidis, (Ed.) Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2001], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design for All is design for [[human diversity]], [[social inclusion]] and equality.&lt;ref&gt;EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be conceived of as an effort to advance a single solution for everybody, but as a user-centred approach to providing products that can automatically address the possible range of human abilities, skills, requirements, and preferences. Consequently, the outcome of the design process is not intended to be a singular design, but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives, together with the rationale underlying each alternative, that is, the specific user and usage context characteristics for which each alternative has been designed.

Traditionally, [[accessibility]] problems have been solved with adaptations and the use of [[assistive technology]] products has been a technical approach to obtain adaptations. Universal Access implies the accessibility and [[usability]] of information and telecommunications technologies by anyone at any place and at any time and their inclusion in any living context. It aims to enable equitable access and active participation of potentially all people in existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities, by developing universally accessible and usable products and services and suitable support functionalities in the environment. These products and services must be capable of accommodating individual user requirements in different contexts of use, independent of location, target machine, or runtime environment. Therefore, the approach aiming to grant the use of equipment or services is generalized, seeking to give access to the Information Society as such. Citizens are supposed to live in environments populated with [[intelligent objects]], where the tasks to be performed and the way of performing them are completely redefined, involving a combination of activities of access to information, interpersonal communication, and environmental control. Citizens must be given the possibility of carrying them out easily and pleasantly.

For a thorough discussion of the challenges and benefits of Design for All in the context of ICT, see also the EDeAN White Paper (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/e31p27x51v0mt60w/ EDeAN White Paper: promoting Design for All and e-Accessibility in Europe], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Report on the impact of technological developments on eAccessibility"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfaei.org/deliverables/D2.1.pdf Report on the impact of technological developments on eAccessibility] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232924/http://www.dfaei.org/deliverables/D2.1.pdf# |date=25 July 2011 }}, Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; of the DfA@eInclusion project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfaei.org DfA@eInclusion project website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425052041/http://www.dfaei.org/# |date=25 April 2010 }}, Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and challenges==
The [[European Commission]] Communication on e-Accessibility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0425en01.pdf Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: e Accessibility, Brussels 2005], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; identified a core of practical challenges, as well as market, legal and policy issues towards improving eAccessibility and [[e-Inclusion]] in Europe, and elaborated a three-fold approach based on:
* accessibility requirements in [[public procurement]]
* accessibility [[certification]] and
* better use of existing legislation.

In that respect, the challenges that need to be addressed include:
* the introduction of specific legislative measures to complement and enhance existing legislation,
* addressing and motivating the industry,
* effective [[benchmarking]],
* providing harmonised [[standardisation]],
* the creation of a curriculum for DfA and,
* addressing future research activities.

==Legislative and regulative background==
The present policy context of accessibility in the [[Information Society]] in Europe is the i2010 initiative.&lt;ref name=i2010_initiative&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/i2010/index_en.htm The i2010 initiative website], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The "i2010 – A European Information Society for growth and employment" initiative was launched by the European Commission as a framework for addressing the main challenges and developments in the information society and media sectors up to 2010. It promotes an open and competitive digital economy and emphasises ICT as a driver of inclusion and quality of life. The initiative contains a range of EU policy instruments to encourage the development of the digital economy, such as regulatory instruments, research and partnerships with stakeholders.

===Equality and non-discrimination===
The goal of the [[European Union]] Disability Strategy is a society that is open and accessible to all. The barriers need to be identified and removed. The European Union Disability Strategy has three main focuses: co-operation between the Commission and the [[Member States]], full participation of people with disabilities, and mainstreaming disability in policy formulation.
Non-discrimination is also one of the general principles of the "Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&amp;pid=150 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the [[United Nations]] General Assembly on 13 December 2006 and was opened for signatures on 30 March 2007.

===Telecommunications and information society===
There is a long tradition of European legislation with regard to telecommunications. In 2002, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, covering all forms of fixed and wireless telecoms, [[data transmission]] and broadcasting. From a Design for All perspective, the most important [[European Union directive|Directives]] are the Directive on a common regulatory framework&lt;ref name="Directive1"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/pri/en/oj/dat/2002/l_108/l_10820020424en00330050.pdf Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Directive on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services&lt;ref name="directive2"&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/l24108h_en.htm Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) [Official Journal L 108 of 24 April 2002&amp;#93;], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Universal Service Directive]]).

===Public procurement===
[[Public procurement]] is an important economic force, and therefore it is an important tool to promote accessibility. The legislative package of public procurement Directives, approved in 2004 by the [[European Parliament]] and the EU's Council of Ministers, will help simplify and modernize procurement procedures.

The new directives make it possible to take accessibility needs into account at several stages of a procurement process.
It is most convenient to refer to standards when making technical specifications. There are already many [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], [[ETSI]] and [[ITU]] standards which can be used for this purpose and many sources which can be useful in practice. Likewise, guidelines like the [[WAI]] guidelines, for example, or national guidelines have been used.
In the future it will be easier to find suitable standards. Mandate M/376&lt;ref name="M/376"&gt;European Commission Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General (2005): [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/archive/deploy/pubproc/eso-m376/a_documents/m376_en.pdf Standardisation Mandate to CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI in support of European accessibility requirements for public procurement of products and services in the ICT domain], Accessed 2009-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt; has been given by the European Commission to the European Standardisation Organisations [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], [[CENELEC]] and [[ETSI]], to come up with a solution for common requirements and conformance assessment.

===Copyright===
Not all products are accessible for persons with disabilities. When producing audio books, or certain other accessible works, an additional copy is created, and [[copyright]] can be a problem in this situation. On the other hand, copyright is an essential part of the sustainability of a creative society. This conflict of interests must be solved somehow in order to ensure the Information Society is a Society for All. There is international and European legislation in this field. The objectives of the Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society&lt;ref name="copyright directive"&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/businesses/intellectual_property/l26053_en.htm Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; are to adapt legislation on copyright and related rights to reflect technological developments and to transpose into Community law the main international obligations arising from the two treaties on copyright and related rights adopted within the framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/portal/index.html.en World Intellectual Property Organisation], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1996.

===Protection of privacy===
The relationship between design and [[privacy]] is not necessarily obvious. Modern technology, which is a result of design, is able to collect significant amounts of personal information. The user has an interest in that information being correct and in it being used appropriately. The person may want to keep something confidential and have access to the information that has been collected. In other words, privacy is desired.
In 1995 the European Union adopted a Directive on the processing of personal data.&lt;ref name="Personal data dir"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:NOT Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

This directive established the basic principles for the collection, storage and use of personal data which should be respected by governments, businesses and any other organizations or individuals engaged in handling personal data.
Within the context of Design for All (in ICT), privacy protection is called [[Privacy by Design]].

==Relevant guidelines and standards==
In the US, Australia, Japan and in the [[European Union]] more and more legislative actions are put in place to require public bodies and companies to make sure that their products and services are accessible and usable not only by “standard” users but also by others such as elderly persons or people with an impairment. As it would be unwise to write down technical – and therefore time-bound – requirements into a law, legislative texts preferably refer to (international) standards.

===Standardisation: general overview===
[[Standardisation]], i.e., in very general terms, producing a "standard" (French: {{lang|fr|norme, standard}}; German: {{lang|de|Norm}}; Spanish:
{{lang|es|norma}}) is a voluntary action set up in the past, almost uniquely, by commercial partners who believe that the standardisation will permit easier exchanges of products and goods. This implied very often that the acceptance of the standards is also voluntary and triggered by expected commercial benefits. Only to a very limited extent consumer representatives did participate in standardisation.
On the other hand, laws in many countries are referring more and more to the required acceptance of several standards (e.g. on safety or on ecological aspects). The net result of this need for standards is that nowadays many standardisation initiatives are stimulated (= subsidised) by public bodies or, in Europe, directly and indirectly by the European Commission. Also many guidelines have been created by stakeholder groups.

===Recent developments in DfA related standardisation (formal standards)===
As DfA standardisation was explicitly mentioned in the eEurope2002&lt;ref name="eEurope2002"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/2002/action_plan/pdf/actionplan_en.pdf Council of The European Union Commission of the European Communities: E-Europe2002: An Information Society For All Action Plan prepared by the Council and the European Commission for the Feira European Council], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and i2010&lt;ref name="i2010"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0229:EN:NOT Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - “i2010 – A European Information Society for growth and employment” {SEC(2005) 717}], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Action Plans
of the European Union, several new actions were established since then. Four major recent strategies can be distinguished:
* the set up of coordinating working groups and organisations;
* the democratisation of the standardisation processes themselves;
* the increasing impact of non-formal standardisation bodies and;
* the establishment of standardisation related discussion fora open for non-specialists.

Accessed 2009-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; is a technical standard that covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.

*'''BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility - Code of Practice'''

Accessed 2010-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt; provides guidance on how to embed accessibility concerns into organisation's policies and digital production processes. The Standard provides non-technical website owners a better understanding of the value of inclusive design, and a framework for how to use guidelines like WCAG 2.0 to help them create products which are Designed for All. The Standard's lead-author, Jonathan Hassell, has created a [http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ summary of BS 8878] to help organisations better understand how the standard can help them.

==Application domains==
The application domains of Design for All in the context of ICT, practically include every field involving Information and Communication Technologies.

The significance of the application domains reflects their role in establishing a coherent and socially acceptable Information Society, but also the diverse range of human activities affected.
The critical application domains for Design for All, can be summarised as follows:
* [[Life-long learning]]
* Public information systems, terminals and information appliances (e.g. kiosks, smart home environments)
* Transaction services (e.g., banking)
* [[Electronic commerce]] applications and services
* Social services for the citizens (e.g., administration, elderly, transport, health care, awareness)
* Tools to allow for added-value information services (e.g., creation, storage, retrieval and exchange of user experiences, traces and views)
* Security

The White Paper "Toward an Information Society for All: An International R&amp;D Agenda" (1998)&lt;ref name="White Paper 1998"&gt;Stephanidis, C. (Ed.), Salvendy, G., Akoumianakis, D., Bevan, N., Brewer, J., Emiliani, P.L., Galetsas, A., Haataja, S., Iakovidis, I., Jacko, J., Jenkins, P., Karshmer, A., Korn, P., Marcus, A., Murphy, H., Stary, C., Vanderheiden, G., Weber, G., &amp; Ziegler, J. (1998): [http://www.ics.forth.gr/proj/at-hci/files/white_paper_1998.pdf Towards an Information Society for All: An International R&amp;D Agenda. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 10 (2), 107-134], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; published by the International Scientific Forum "Towards an Information Society for All" (ISF-IS4ALL),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ui4all.ics.forth.gr/isf_is4all/about_us.html International Scientific Forum "Towards an Information Society for All"], Accessed 2009-10-05&lt;/ref&gt; has discussed the significance of these application domains:

{{Quotation|
"Life-long learning is a critical area where emphasis should be placed, in the "knowledge" society of the future. It entails a continuous engagement in the acquisition of knowledge and skills to facilitate and sustain equitable participation in the Information Society. New technologies may play a catalytic role in providing new educational mechanisms and structures, thus allowing learning to become an inseparable part of life-long human activities in the context of knowledge-intensive learning communities, and social interaction amongst groups of people.

Another important application area and a critical short-term target is the development of general purpose public information systems, terminals and information appliances, (e.g., information kiosks for access to community-wide information services). These are expected to be used in increasingly different contexts, including public places, homes, classrooms, etc., and provide the means for ubiquitous and nomadic access. Environmental control will also become increasingly important. Smart environments will progressively penetrate a wide range of human activities in hospitals, hotels, public administration buildings, etc. Teleoperation of such environments will also gain increasing attention to facilitate responsiveness to unforeseen events, enhanced mobility and security.

Finally, a broad range of transaction services (e.g., banking, advertising, entertainment), social services for the citizens (e.g., administration, health care, education, transport), and electronic commerce applications, will become increasingly important in reshaping business and residential human activities (...) security, privacy and control are central themes in the evolution of a socially acceptable Information Society and should receive immediate attention. At the same time, they will increasingly constitute more complex targets to accomplish, as they span across different levels of the telecommunications infrastructure, from network services to application services (such as business transactions and entertainment), terminals and information appliances."

==Education and training==
One major lever to improve awareness and practice in Design for All is the development of education and training programs. Professionals are needed who have acquired comprehensive specialist knowledge and skills in Design for All; in addition those professionals who currently work in ICT industry need to acquire additional knowledge and skills concerning Design for All.

Little evidence can be found of university degree programmes that specialize in Design for All (or Universal Design) or that explicitly includes a module about this.&lt;ref name="Whitney20008"&gt;Whitney G, Keith S (2008) European Developments in the Design and Implementation of Training for eInclusion. Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Computers Helping People with Special Needs (Book) Volume 5105/2008 pp156-161&lt;/ref&gt; This lack was tackled in the project DfA@eInclusion, which devised curricula:&lt;ref name="Del6.3"&gt;Keith S., Whitney G. [http://www.dfaei.org/deliverables/Del6.3a.pdf The production of syllabi for a range of DfA courses in ICT]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, November 2008. Accessed 2009-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A bachelor level introductory course which aims to enable students to have an understanding of the ethical and social issues of Design for All, and the role of Design for All as an enabler of accessibility and participation in the information society
* A masters level programme which aims to enable students to have the relevant knowledge, personal and professional skills &amp; competencies to design, develop, implement, evaluate and manage a wide range of ICT systems products and services that adhere to the principles and practices of Design for All.&lt;ref name="AAATE"&gt;Keith, S., G. Whitney, and J. Wilson, Design For All  @ eInclusion: Best Practice in Education And Training, in AAATE '09. 2009: Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;
The implementation of such programmes is already under way in a few places, for example at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hioa.no/eng/Studies/TKD/Master/UniversalDesignICT Master of Universal Design of ICT] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206121949/http://www.hioa.no/eng/Studies/TKD/Master/UniversalDesignICT# |date=6 February 2015 }}, Accessed 2014-06.02.&lt;/ref&gt; the Middlesex University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/digitalinclusion MSc Digital Inclusion at Middlesex University] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120527025938/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/digitalinclusion |date=27 May 2012 }}, Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; UK, University of Linz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jku.at/iis/content '{{lang|de|Institut Integriert Studieren}}' at the University of Linz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212081739/http://www.jku.at/iis/content# |date=12 December 2009 }}, Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria and the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utad.pt/vPT/Area2/estudar/oferta_educativa/Paginas/listagem_cursos_ciclos.aspx Licenciatura and master degree in Rehabilitation Engineering and Accessibility at UTAD] Accessed 2013-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal. Core topics include an understanding of the principles of human rights, the development of standards, regulations and legislation, the design and development of assistive technologies as well as improved access of mainstream products and services.

[[Web accessibility]] is an important component of accessing the information society and information and guidance is offered by the World Wide Web Consortium's [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/WAI/ W3C-WAI], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as online tutorials (for example, Opera's Web Standards Curriculum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/ Opera Web Standards Curriculum], Accessed 2009-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The complementary approach of training for professionals in ICT industry has also been tackled by the DfA@eInclusion project.&lt;ref name="D5.2"&gt;Schmidt-Belz, B. and Y. Mohamad, [http://www.dfaei.org/deliverables/dfa@einclusion%20-%20Del5.2.pdf Exemplary Training Modules on eAccessibility for industry training, 2009]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Accessed 2009-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
A comprehensive curriculum for such trainings has been recommended and is currently subject to a CEN workshop negotiation. The CEN workshop "Curriculum for training professionals in Universal Design (UD-Prof)"&lt;ref name="CEN Workshop"&gt;[http://www.cen.eu/cenorm/sectors/sectors/isss/workshops/ws-ud-prof-curriculum.asp CEN Workshop on 'Curriculum for training professionals in Universal Design' (WS/UD-PROF)], Accessed 2009-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; has been implemented in May 2009. Following the general rules for CEN workshops, it offers all interested stakeholders an opportunity to discuss and improve this DfA curriculum for ICT professionals.

==Examples of good practice==
* [[Opera (web browser)]] was designed with the commitment to be used by as many people as possible thus following a Design for All approach.
* [[Audiobook]]s are good examples for Design for All because they enable people to read a book. Virtually anyone who does not have a hearing disability can use audiobooks for leisure, learning, and information. [[Listening Books]] it is the only audiobook charity in the UK providing an internet streaming and postal service to anyone who has a disability or illness which makes it difficult to hold a book, turn its pages, or read in the usual way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listening-books.org.uk/ Listening Books], Accessed 2009-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[e-Government]] uses information and communication (ICT) technology to provide and improve government services, transactions and interactions with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.help.gv.at Austrian e-Government portal]. Accessed 2009-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amea.gov.gr Greek e-Government Portal]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Accessed 2009-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elevator]]s provide an alternative way to reach different floor levels. Modern accessible elevators use information and communication technology to adapt themselves to any user imaginable. The closing speed of the doors is adjustable so people can safely enter quickly or slowly as required. Controls of the elevator provide visual and audible feedback to the user so that people with different sensory abilities can operate the elevator without assistance. Blind people profit from tactile keys. [[Braille]] labeling is located besides the keys so that they are not accidentally pushed while reading them. The emergency intercom system operates aurally and visually. Wireless tagging (e.g. [[RFID]]), [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], remote controls further enhance the capabilities of a modern elevator which can be used by almost anyone.
* The Inclusive Design Toolkit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/betterdesign/ Inclusive Design Toolkit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126021738/http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/betterdesign/ |date=26 November 2009 }}, Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; presents examples of how Design for All principles can be implemented.
* Other examples of Design for All in ICT are presented in EDeAN's Education and Training Resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.edean.org/index.php?filters=f8 Education and Training Resource] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702102428/http://www.education.edean.org/index.php?filters=f8# |date=2 July 2009 }}, Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design for All Europe===
EIDD - Design for All Europe is a 100% self-financed European organisation that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD),to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2009) has active member organisations in 22 European countries. The aim of EIDD is to encourage active interaction and communication between professionals interested in the theory and practice of Design for All and to build bridges between, on the one hand, these and other members of the design community and, on the other hand, all those other communities where Design for All can make a real difference to the quality of life for everyone.

The '''Dogmatic school''' of [[medicine]] (''Dogmatics'', or ''Dogmatici'', {{lang-el|Δογματικοί}}) was a school of medicine in [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]]. They were the oldest of the medical sects of antiquity. They derived their name from ''[[dogma]]'', a philosophical tenet or opinion, because they professed to follow the opinions of [[Hippocrates]], hence they were sometimes called ''Hippocratici''. [[Thessalus (physician)|Thessalus]], the son, and [[Polybus (physician)|Polybus]], the son-in-law of Hippocrates, were the founders of this sect, c. 400 BC, which enjoyed great reputation, and held undisputed sway over the whole medical profession, until the establishment of the [[Alexandrian school]] known as the [[Empiric school]]. After the rise of Empiric school, for some centuries, every physician counted himself under either one or the other of the two parties. The most distinguished among this school were [[Diocles of Carystus]], [[Praxagoras of Cos]], and [[Plistonicus]]. The doctrines of this school are described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in the introduction to his ''[[De Medicina]]''.

== Doctrines ==
The Dogmatic school held that it was necessary to be acquainted with the ''hidden causes'' of diseases, as well as the ''more evident causes'', and to know how the ''natural actions and different functions'' of the human body take place, which necessarily assumes a knowledge of the ''interior parts''.

They gave the name of ''hidden causes'' to those things which concern the elements or principles of which our bodies are composed, and the occasion of good or ill health. It is impossible, they said, for people to know how to set about curing an illness unless they know what it comes from; since there is no doubt that they must treat it in one way, if diseases in general proceed from the excess or deficiency of one of the [[classical element|four elements]], as some philosophers supposed; in another way, if all the malady lies in the [[Humorism|humours]] of the body, as [[Herophilus]] thought; in another, if it is to be attributed to the [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], according to the idea of Hippocrates (perhaps alluding to the ''De Flatibus'', which is generally considered spurious); in another, if the [[blood]] excites [[inflammation]] by passing from the [[vein]]s which are meant to contain it into the vessels that ought only to contain [[air]], and if this inflammation produces the extraordinary movement of the blood that is remarked in [[fever]], according to the opinion of [[Erasistratus]]; and in another, if it is by means of corpuscles which stop in the invisible passages and block up the way, as [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]] affirms to be the case. If this be granted, it must necessarily appear that, of all physicians, he will succeed the best in the cure of diseased who understands best their first origin and cause.

The Dogmatic school did not deny the necessity of [[experiment]]s; but they said that these experiments could not be made, and never had been made, but by [[reason]]ing. They added, that it is probable that the first people who applied themselves to medicine, did not recommend to their patients the first thing that came into their thoughts, but that they deliberated about it, and that experiment and use then let them know if they had reasoned justly or not. It mattered little, they said, that people declared that the greater number of remedies had been the subject of experiment from the first, provided they confessed that these experiments were the results of the reasoning of those who tried the remedies. They went on to say, that we often see new sorts of diseases break out, for which neither experiment nor custom has yet found out any cure; and that, therefore, it is necessary to observe where they came from and how they first began, for otherwise no one can tell why, in such an emergency, one should makes use of one remedy rather than another. Such are the reasons why a physician ought to try to discover the ''hidden causes'' of diseases.

As for the ''evident causes'', which are such as can easily be discovered by anybody, and where one has only to know if the illness proceeds from heat or from cold, from having eaten too little or too much, etc., they said it was necessary to inform one's self of all of that, make on it the suitable reflections; but they did not think that one ought to stop there without going any further.

They said also, in regard to the ''natural actions'', that it was necessary to know wherefore and in what manner we receive the air into our [[lungs]], and why we afterward expire it; why [[food]] is taken into the body, how it is there prepared, and then distributed through every part of it; why the [[arteries]] are subject to pulsation; what is the cause of [[sleep]], [[wakefulness]], etc.; and they maintained that people could not cure diseases relating to these many functions unless they were able to explain these phenomena.

Lastly, they maintained that as the principal pains and diseases proceed from the ''internal parts'', it is impossible for people to administer any remedy unless they are acquainted with these parts. They therefore thought that it was necessary to [[dissect]] dead bodies, for it was not possible to treat sick organs if one did not understand the nature of healthy organs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6438">{{lowercase title}}'''eMix''', which stands for '''Electronic Medical Information Exchange''', is a [[cloud computing]]-based technology for secure sharing of [[medical imaging]] studies and reports between disparate healthcare facilities and physicians.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;Phillips, J (2010). "Will Cloud Computing Blow Over?," Imaging Technology News, Jan./Feb. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; eMix was developed to address a challenge in medical imaging: How to exchange medical imaging data between proprietary [[information technology]] (IT) systems that do not "talk to each other",&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt;&lt;ref name=McBride&gt;McBride, R (2010). "DR Systems Spins Off eMix to Provide Online Exchange for Medical Images," Xconomy, 6 April 2010. Retrieved on 9 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reicher&gt;Reicher, M (2010). "Safe and Sound: Providing Security for Exchanging Medical Records," RT-Image, 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The service also provides an alternative to legacy solutions typically used for sharing medical imaging data.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt;&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reicher /&gt; Examples of such legacy methods include:
*[[Virtual private networks]]
*Burning and mailing CDs
*Printing and mailing film, and 
*Faxing reports. 
eMix was one of the first cloud-based systems for accomplishing these tasks.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt;&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;

Cloud-based services are likely to help facilitate the trend toward universal access to medical imaging and other electronic medical information. For example, members of [[health information exchange]]s (HIEs) can use a service such as eMix to share radiology data even when those members have mutually incompatible IT systems. The service also makes it possible for a healthcare institution to include radiology data obtained from out-of-network facilities or physicians in the institution's [[Picture Archiving and Communication System|PACS]], [[radiology information system]] (RIS), [[healthcare information system]] (HIS), or [[electronic medical record]] (EMR). Finally, it is a logical system for patients to use when adding medical imaging information to their [[personal health record]] (PHR).&lt;ref name=Cadet /&gt;

A potential advantage of using a cloud-based system is affordability. Healthcare institutions, physician offices, and patients need no special infrastracture to use such a system—they only need a computer connected via [[broadband]] to the Internet. They don't need to acquire special hardware or software, and can pay for the service on a subscription basis, much like phone service.&lt;ref name=Reicher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang K (2009). "Cloud Computing Drives Design of New Imaging Management Platform," Diagnostic Imaging, 30 November 2009. Retrieved on 9 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The cloud-based service is a business venture of [[DR Systems]], an independent provider of enterprise imaging and [[information management]] systems for hospitals, integrated healthcare networks and diagnostic imaging centers,&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;Merrill, M (2010). "Montana Providers Use Cloud Computing to Share Radiology Data," Healthcare IT News, 4 January 2010. Retrieved on 9 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
eMix debuted in beta phase in late 2009. During this period, it was successfully tested by three medical facilities in Montana on behalf of Image Movement of Montana, an organization of 30 medical institutions in Montana that formed to seek more efficient ways of sharing medical imaging data,&lt;ref name=Cadet&gt;Cadet, J (2010). "Cloud Computing: The Forecast for Image Management," Health Imaging &amp; IT, 24 March 2010. Retrieved on 9 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt; The three IMOM members implemented eMix on a clinical basis in December 2009, becoming the first facilities in the nation to exchange data with the system,&lt;ref name=Reicher /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Merrill /&gt; Other IMOM facilities have since tested and implemented eMix, as well.&lt;ref name=HIMSS&gt;HIMSS10 NewsWire (2010). "eMix Presents Cloud Technology for Image Sharing," Healthcare IT News, 23 February 2010. Retrieved on 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
eMix was launched as a commercially available product in early 2010. Besides the IMOM facilities, eMix is currently being used by healthcare providers in Florida, California, Texas, Washington, Alaska, Tennessee, Arkansas, and South Dakota.&lt;ref name=HIMSS /&gt;
European eMix service is scheduled to debut in European countries in the Fall of 2010.&lt;ref name=biowire&gt;biowire (2010). "eMix Signs First European Distributor Agreement, Will Exhibit at German Radiology Congress," Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News, 3 May 2010. Retrieved on 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
DR System's Chairman of the Board is [[DR Systems|Murray Reicher]], M.D., a board-certified diagnostic radiologist and company co-founder. The company's President and Chief Executive Officer is [[DR Systems|Richard Porritt]]. The General Manager for eMix is Florent Saint-Clair.&lt;ref name=biowire /&gt;

==Workflow==
Workflow using eMix takes place as follows:
*The sender selects the exam and other desired documents to send from a worklist of electronically stored radiology files and uploads the "package" to eMix. 
*The sender then selects a recipient from a list of authorized users (user authorization and authentication preserve privacy and confidentiality and strengthen compliance with HIPAA provisions). 
*eMix sends a notification email to the recipient, who can then log in and click on links to the package to preview the images and reports, or download and view the DICOM image exam and related reports documents using a free DICOM viewer.&lt;ref name=Reicher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn C (2009).

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Epididymitis''' is a medical condition characterized by [[inflammation]] of the [[epididymis]], a curved structure at the back of the [[testicle]].&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Onset of pain is typically over a day or two.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; The pain may improve with raising the testicle.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Other symptoms may include swelling of the testicle, [[dysuria|burning with urination]], or frequent urination.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; [[Orchitis|Inflammation of the testicle]] is commonly also present.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
In those who are young and sexually active [[gonorrhea]] and [[chlamydia]] are frequently the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; In older males and [[males who have sex with males]] [[enteric bacteria]] are common.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Conditions that may result in similar symptoms include [[testicular torsion]], [[inguinal hernia]], and [[testicular cancer]].&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; [[Doppler ultrasound|Ultrasound]] can be useful if the diagnosis is unclear.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, prognosis, epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment may include [[pain medications]], [[NSAIDs]], and elevation.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Recommended [[antibiotics]] in those who are young and sexually active are [[ceftriaxone]] and [[doxycycline]].&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Among those who are older [[ofloxacin]] may be used.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Complications include [[infertility]] and [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Those ages 15 to 35 are most commonly affected with about 600,000 people within this age group affected per year in the United States.&lt;ref name=AFP2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trojian|first1=TH|last2=Lishnak|first2=TS|last3=Heiman|first3=D|title=Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview.|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 April 2009|volume=79|issue=7|pages=583–7|pmid=19378875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Those ages 15 to 35 are most commonly affected.&lt;ref name=AFP2009/&gt; The acute form usually develops over the course of several days, with pain and swelling frequently in only one testis, which will hang low in the scrotum.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  There will often be a recent history of [[dysuria]] or [[urethra|urethral discharge]].&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  Fever is also a common symptom.  In the chronic version, the patient may have painful point tenderness but may or may not have an irregular epididymis upon [[palpation]], though palpation may reveal an indurated epididymis.  A scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems with the epididymis, but such an ultrasound may also show nothing unusual.  The majority of patients who present with chronic epididymitis have had symptoms for over five years.&lt;ref name=kav/&gt;{{rp|p.311}}
===Complications===
Untreated, acute epididymitis's major complications are [[abscess]] formation and testicular [[infarction]].  Chronic  epididymitis can lead to permanent damage or even destruction of the epididymis and testicle (resulting in infertility and/or [[hypogonadism]]), and infection may spread to any other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or system of the body.  Chronic pain is also an associated complication for untreated chronic epididymitis.&lt;ref name=nickel/&gt;

== Causes ==
Though urinary tract infections in men are rare, bacterial infection is the most common cause of acute epididymitis.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt; The [[bacteria]] in the [[urethra]] back-track through the [[urinary tract|urinary]] and [[human reproductive system|reproductive structures]] to the epididymis. In rare circumstances, the infection reaches the epididymis via the bloodstream.

In sexually active men, ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' is responsible for two-thirds of acute cases, followed by ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' and ''[[E. coli]]'' (or other bacteria that cause [[urinary tract infection]]). Particularly among men over age 35 in whom the cause is ''E. coli'', epididymitis is commonly due to urinary tract obstruction.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford American Handbook of Emergency Medicine|last=Brown|first=Jeremy|year=2008|origyear=|page=992|publisher=Oxford University|place=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=csdGgwKCIQUC&amp;pg=PT841|isbn=978-0-19-518924-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Less common microbes include ''[[Ureaplasma]]'', [[Mycobacterium]], and ''[[cytomegalovirus]]'', or ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'' in patients with [[HIV infection]]. ''E. coli'' is more common in boys before [[puberty]], the [[elderly]], and [[homosexual men|men who have sex with men]].  In the majority of cases in which bacteria are the cause, only one side of the scrotum or the other is the locus of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases: A Physician Tells You What You Need to Know|last=Marr|first=Lisa|edition=Second|year=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aywGiP9w-u8C&amp;pg=PT36|isbn=9780801886591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-infectious causes are also possible. Reflux of sterile urine (urine without bacteria) through the [[ejaculatory duct]]s may cause inflammation with obstruction. In children, it may be a response following an infection with [[enterovirus]], [[adenovirus]] or ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''.  Rare non-infectious causes of chronic epididymitis include [[sarcoidosis]] (more prevalent in black men) and [[Behçet's disease]].&lt;ref name=kav/&gt;{{rp|p.311}}

Any form of epididymitis can be caused by genito-urinary [[surgery]], including [[prostatectomy]] and  [[urinary catheterization]]. [[Congestive epididymitis]] is a long-term complication of [[vasectomy]].&lt;ref name="pmid10785217"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwingl PJ, Guess HA |title=Safety and effectiveness of vasectomy |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=923–36 |year=2000 |pmid=10785217|doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(00)00482-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8237740"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raspa RF |title=Complications of vasectomy |journal=American Family Physician |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=1264–8 |year=1993 |pmid=8237740 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical epididymitis may also result from drugs such as [[amiodarone]].&lt;ref name="amiodarone"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ibsen HH, Frandsen F, Brandrup F, Møller M |title=Epididymitis caused by treatment with amiodarone |journal=Genitourin Med |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=257–8 |date=August 1989 |pmid=2807285 |pmc=1194364 |doi= 10.1136/sti.65.4.257|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasonography of epididymitis.jpg|thumb|[[Doppler ultrasound]] of epididymitis, seen as a substantial increase in blood flow in the left epididymis (top image), while it is normal in the right (bottom image). The thickness of the epididymis (between yellow crosses) is only slightly increased.]]

Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; Conditions that may result in similar symptoms include [[testicular torsion]], [[inguinal hernia]], and [[testicular cancer]].&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; [[Doppler ultrasound|Ultrasound]] can be useful if the diagnosis is unclear.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt;

Epididymitis usually has a gradual onset. Typical findings are redness, warmth and swelling of the scrotum, with tenderness behind the testicle, away from the middle (this is the normal position of the epididymis relative to the testicle). The [[cremasteric reflex]] (elevation of the testicle in response to stroking the upper inner thigh) remains normal.&lt;ref name=AFP2016/&gt; This is a useful sign to distinguish it from testicular torsion. If there is pain relieved by elevation of the testicle, this is called [[Prehn's sign]], which is, however, non-specific and is not useful for diagnosis.

Before the advent of sophisticated [[medical imaging]] techniques, surgical exploration was the standard of care. Today, [[Doppler ultrasound]] is a common test: it can demonstrate areas of blood flow and can distinguish clearly between epididymitis and torsion. However, as torsion and other sources of testicular pain can often be determined by palpation alone, some studies have suggested that the only real benefit of an ultrasound is to assure the person that they do not have testicular cancer.&lt;ref name=baran&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urogenital pain in clinical practice|last=Granitisioti|first=P.|editor1-last=Baranowski|editor1-first=Andrew Paul |editor2-last=Abrams|editor2-first=Paul|editor3-last=Fall|editor3-first=Magnus|chapter=Scrotal pain conditions|year=2008|publisher=Informa Healthcare USA|place=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZGA5vzK3V4cC&amp;pg=PA238|isbn=978-0849399329}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.237}} [[Nuclear medicine|Nuclear]] testicular blood flow testing is rarely used.

Additional tests may be necessary to identify underlying causes. In younger children, a urinary tract anomaly is frequently found. In sexually active men, tests for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s may be done. These may include [[microscopy]] and [[Microbiological culture|culture]] of a first void urine sample, [[Gram stain]] and culture of fluid or a swab from the [[urethra]], [[nucleic acid amplification test]]s (to amplify and detect microbial [[DNA]] or other [[nucleic acid]]s) or tests for [[syphilis]] and [[HIV]].

===Classification===
[[File:Suppurative epidydimo orchitis histopathology.jpg|thumbnail|right|Histopathology image of inflamed epididymis and testis]]
Epididymitis can be classified as acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms.&lt;ref name=AMP09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trojian TH, Lishnak TS, Heiman D |title=Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=583–7 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19378875 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronic epididymitis====
[[File:Epididymal calcifications and cyst.jpg|thumb|[[Scrotal ultrasound]] showing calcifications and cysts in a case of chronic epididymis.]]
Chronic epididymitis is epididymitis that is present for more than 3 months. Chronic epididymitis is characterized by inflammation even when there is no [[infection]] present. Tests are needed to distinguish chronic epididymitis from a range of other disorders that can cause constant scrotal pain including [[testicular cancer]] (though this is often painless), enlarged scrotal veins ([[varicocele]]), calcifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epididymal-calcification|title=Epididymal calcification|author=Matt A. Morgan and Yuranga Weerakkody|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible [[cyst]] within the epididymis. Some research has found that as much as 80% of visits to a urologist for scrotal pain are for chronic epididymitis.&lt;ref name=kav&gt;{{Cite book|title=Practical urology: essential principles and practice|last=Kavoussi|first=Parviz K.|last2=Costabile|first2=Raymond A.|editor1-last=Chapple|editor1-first=Christopher R.|editor2-last=Steers|editor2-first=William D.|year=2011|chapter=Disorders of scrotal contents: orchitis, epididimytis, testicular torsion, torsion of the appendages, and Fournier's gangrene|publisher=Springer-Verlag|place=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A9m8TkdCUqEC&amp;pg=PA315|isbn=978-1-84882-033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.311}} As a further complication, the nerves in the scrotal area are closely connected to those of the abdomen, sometimes causing abdominal pain similar to a hernia (see [[referred pain]]).

Chronic epididymitis is most commonly associated with lower back pain, and the onset of pain often co-occurs with activity that stresses the low back (i.e., heavy lifting, long periods of car driving, poor posture while sitting, or any other activity that interferes with the normal curve of the [[lumbar lordosis]] region).&lt;ref name=baran/&gt;{{rp|p.237}}

==Treatment==
In both the acute and chronic forms, [[antibiotics]] are used if an infection is suspected.  The treatment of choice is often [[azithromycin]] and [[cefixime]] to cover both gonorrhoeae and chlamydia.  [[Fluoroquinolone]]s are no longer recommended due to widespread resistance of gonorrhoeae to this class.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  [[Doxycycline]] may be used as an alternative to azithromycin.  In chronic epididymitis, a four- to six-week course of antibiotics may be prescribed to ensure the complete eradication of any possible bacterial cause, especially the various chlamydiae.

For cases caused by enteric organisms (such as ''E. coli''), [[ofloxacin]] or [[levofloxacin]] are recommended.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

In children, fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are best avoided. Since bacteria that cause urinary tract infections are often the cause of epididymitis in children, [[co-trimoxazole]] or suited [[penicillin]]s (for example, [[cephalexin]]) can be used.

Household remedies such as elevation of the [[scrotum]] and cold compresses applied regularly to the [[scrotum]] may relieve the pain in acute cases. [[Painkillers]] or [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|anti-inflammatory drugs]] are often used for treatment of both chronic and acute forms. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases.&lt;ref name=nickel/&gt;  However, in acute suppurating epididymitis (acute epididymitis with a discharge of pus), a [[epididymotomy]] may be recommended; in refractory cases, a full [[epididymectomy]] may be required.  In cases with unrelenting testicular pain, removal of the entire testicle—[[orchiectomy]]—may also be warranted.

It is generally believed that most cases of chronic epididymitis will eventually "burn out" of patient's system if left untreated, though this might take years or even decades.&lt;ref name=nickel&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diseases of the kidney and urinary tract|last=Nickel|first=J.

==Epidemiology==
Epididymitis makes up 1 in 144 visits for medical care (0.69 percent) in men 18 to 50 years old or 600,000 cases in males between 18 and 35 in the United States.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt;

It occurs primarily in those 16 to 30 years of age and 51 to 70 years.&lt;ref name=AMP09/&gt; As of 2008 there appears to be an increase in incidences in the United States that parallels an increase in reported cases of [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith DM|title=A Really Big Pain: Acute Epididymitis |journal=The AIDS Reader |date=September 1, 2008|url=http://www.consultantlive.com/pain/article/1145619/1361797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">'''Ethnopediatrics''' is a branch of research devoted to understanding the child-rearing practices of families around the world and throughout time. This relatively new field is informed by traditional disciplines like [[child development]] research, [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[pediatrics]].&lt;ref name="small"&gt;Meredith Small, ''Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent'', Anchor, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-385-48362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

In October 1994, Carol M. Worthman conducted a workshop at [[Emory University]] introducing this new field. The workshop was attended by participants from psychology, pediatrics, public health, and anthropology. The impetus was the growing understanding that health care improvements can be made more effective when all the affecting cultural influences are taken into account.&lt;ref name="worthman"&gt;Carol M. Worthman, 1995, "[https://webdrive.service.emory.edu/groups/research/lchb/PUBLICATIONS%20Worthman/PUBLICATIONS%20CMW%201995/Ethnopediatrics%20An%20Outline.pdf Ethnopediatrics: An outline]." ''Items'' 49:6-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural analysis ==

The ethnopediatric perspective analyzes the effects of a culture on a child's health and well-being by asking these questions:
* What are the culture's attitudes and beliefs towards illness and wellness?
* What are the culture's patterns of addressing (or not addressing) symptoms of illness?
* What are the culture's experiences and familiarity (or lack thereof) with a particular disease or a set of symptoms?
* What are its ideas of the developmental stages that children move through?
* How much does the culture value children? And which aspects of development are most valued (intellect, motor skills, verbal skills, etc.) &lt;ref name="worthman"/&gt;

== Specific aim ==

The specific aim of ethnopediatrics is to improve the welfare of children around the world in a way that is informed by and in harmony with the local culture. By promoting a [[Biocultural anthropology|biocultural]] framework for understanding the well-being and development of the child, facilitating cross-disciplinary dialog, and analyzing the interests of the individual child in the context of the surrounding cultural, social, and political framework, the field has the potential to better inform public health policy &lt;ref name="worthman"/&gt; and even directly influence prevailing childcare practices.&lt;ref name="small"/&gt;

== Impact on American parenting ==

Several books have been published in mainstream American culture that have been based on (and therefore have popularized) ethnopediatric research: 
* ''Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent'' by Meredith Small (cited by 40 other parenting books)
* ''Kids: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Raise Young Children'' by Meredith Small
* ''The Continuum Concept: In Search Of Happiness Lost'' by Jean Liedloff

Drawing conclusions from ethnopediatric research, these books challenge traditional Western parenting techniques such as [[Cry it out|Ferberization]] and strengthen the case for the [[family bed]] as well as other techniques often associated with [[attachment parenting]].

'''Georgetown Public Hospital''', in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]], is the country's largest hospital. Its Seaman's Ward, the oldest section, was constructed in 1838. The hospital is government-run with a capacity of 600 beds, although not all are used due to staff shortages.

[[File:Hersal and George Thomas.gif|thumb|200px|Hersal Thomas (seated) and his older brother George W. Thomas]]

'''Hersal Thomas''' (September 9, 1906 &amp;ndash; June 2, 1926)&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KF49-1MW Hersal Thomas, "Michigan, Death Certificates, 1921-1952"]. Familysearch.org. Retrieved 2013-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[blues]] pianist and composer. He recorded a number of sides for [[Okeh Records]] in 1925 and 1926.

Thomas was born in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], United States,&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hersal-thomas-mn0000673344 |title=Hersal Thomas &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and displayed an early talent for blues playing and composition. He was one of several musicians in his family. His brother [[George Washington Thomas]] was also a skilled piano player and composer, while his sister [[Sippie Wallace]] and niece [[Hociel Thomas]] were singers of note.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;

Though he died at a young age, Thomas was nonetheless an influence on the [[Chicago]] [[boogie woogie]] school of pianists. [[Albert Ammons]] and [[Meade Lux Lewis]] both cited him as an influence.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt; His most famous track was "Suitcase Blues" (8958-A Okeh 8227), which was issued on [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1992 as part of the [[box set]], ''[[Roots 'N Blues: The Retrospective]]''. The Thomas brothers also co-wrote "The Fives", which Ammons and Lewis cited as an essential boogie-woogie number.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;

Thomas recorded under his own name, and as an accompanist to Hociel Thomas, Sippie Wallace, Lilian Miller and possibly, Sodarisa Miller.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt; In 1926, he recorded a session with Hociel Thomas and [[Louis Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt; The songs recorded on that occasion were "Deep Water Blues" (9519-A Okeh 8297), "Lonesome Hours" (9522-A Okeh 8297), "Listen To Ma" (9521-A Okeh 8346), and "G'wan, I Told You" (9520-A Okeh 8346). The first three are listed as having been composed by "Thomas", though it is not clear if this refers to Hersal or his brother. He also worked in session with [[King Oliver]].

Sippie Wallace recorded seven of his compositions: "A Jealous Woman Like Me", "A Man For Every Day Of The Week", "Dead Drunk Blues", "Have You Ever Been Down?", "I Feel Good", "Shorty George Blues" and "Trouble Everywhere I Roam".

Thomas died of [[food poisoning]] while working at Penny's Pleasure Inn in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The circumstances of his death have never been clarified.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;

''HMHS'' is an [[acronym]] for His/Her Majesty's Hospital Ship.

==Early modern era==
===Seventeenth century===
The earliest record of British hospital ship was ''Goodwill'', which briefly accompanied a [[Royal Navy]] squadron in the Mediterranean in 1608 or 1609.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutherland Shaw|first=J.J.|title=The Hospital Ship, 1608{{ndash}}1740|journal=The Mariner's Mirror|volume=22|issue=4|year=1936|doi=10.1080/00253359.1936.10657206|pages=422-426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oppenheim|first=M.|title=A History of the Administration of the Royal Navy and of Merchant Shipping in Relation to the Navy|page=188|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofadminis00oppe#page/188/mode/2up|volume=1|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1896|oclc=506062953}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1665 the Royal Navy formally maintained two hospital ships at any time, these being either hired merchant ship or elderly [[sixth rate]]s, modified from their original design by the removal of internal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and addition of ports cut through the deck and hull for ventilation. The limit of two hospital ships at a time remained in place until the [[Nine Years' War]] at century's end. In 1691 there were four hospital ships in service, rising to five in 1693 and six in 1696.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt; 

In addition to their sailing crew, these seventeenth century hospital ships were staffed by a surgeon and four surgeon's mates. Standard medical supplies were bandages, soap, needles and [[bedpan]]s, and patients were issued with a clean pair of sheets. Infectious patients were quarantined from the general population behind a sheet of canvas. In addition to her sailing crew, each vessel was staffed with a surgeon and four surgeon's mates. The quality of food was very poor. In the 1690s the surgeon aboard ''Siam'' complained that the meat was in an advanced state of [[putrefaction]], the biscuits were weevil-ridden and bitter, and the bread was so hard that it stripped the skin from patient's mouths.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt;

This is a '''list of [[vaccine]]-related topics'''.

A '''vaccine''' is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular [[vaccine-preventable diseases|disease]]. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe or its toxins. The agent stimulates the body's [[immune system]] to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and "remember" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loehr |first=Jamie |chapter=Vaccine Basics |title=The Vaccine Answer Book |publisher=Sourcebooks Inc.|location=Naperville, IL |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-u5nbWzQxw8C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=What+is+a+Vaccine#v=onepage&amp;q=What%20is%20a%20Vaccine&amp;f=false |isbn=1402223781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maternal health''' is the health of women during [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and the [[postpartum period]]. It encompasses the [[health care]] dimensions of [[family planning]], [[Pre-conception counseling|preconception]], [[Prenatal care|prenatal]], and [[postnatal]] care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience in most cases and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO Maternal Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) estimated that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, all of which have highly effective interventions. As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deals per 100,000 live births in 2013.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; This has resulted in many countries halving their maternal death rates.

While there has been a decline in worldwide mortality rates much more has to be done. High rates still exist particularly in impoverished communities with over 85% living in Africa and Southern Asia.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; The effect of a mother's death results in vulnerable families, and their [[infant]]s, if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.

Both maternal mortality and severe maternal mortality (SMM) are "associated with a high rate of preventability."&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016"/&gt;

In 2010 the U.S. [[Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations]] described [[maternal mortality]] as a "[[sentinel event]]", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system.{{sfn|Joint Commission|2010}}

Four elements are essential to maternal death prevention. First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and foetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are haemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker is assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/your-postpartum-checkups.aspx|title=Your postpartum checkups|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing maternal health==
[[File:MDG5.svg|thumb|Logo of [[Millennium Development Goal]] 5|alt=Logo depicting pregnant woman, used in Millennium Development Goal 5, maternal health]]

=== Poverty and access to healthcare ===
According to a [[UNFPA]] report, social and economic status, culture norms and values, and geographic remoteness increase all increases a maternal mortality, and the risk for maternal death (during pregnancy or childbirth) in sub-Saharan Africa is 175 times higher than in developed countries, and risk for pregnancy-related illnesses and negative consequences after birth is even higher.&lt;ref name="Determinants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/EN-SRH%20fact%20sheet-Poormother.pdf|title=The social determinants of maternal death and disability|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty, maternal health, and outcomes for the child are all interconnected.&lt;ref name=Filippi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Filippi V, Ronsmans C, Campbell OM, Graham WJ, Mills A, Borghi J, Koblinsky M, Osrin D | title = Maternal health in poor countries: the broader context and a call for action | journal = Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9546 | pages = 1535–41 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17071287 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69384-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women living in poverty-stricken areas are more likely to be obese and engage in unhealthy behaviors such as cigarette smoking and [[Substance abuse|drug use]], are less likely to engage in or even have access to legitimate prenatal care, and are at a significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes for both the mother and child.&lt;ref name=Timmermans&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Timmermans S, Bonsel GJ, Steegers-Theunissen RP, Mackenbach JP, Steyerberg EW, Raat H, Verbrugh HA, Tiemeier HW, Hofman A, Birnie E, Looman CW, Jaddoe VW, Steegers EA | title = Individual accumulation of heterogeneous risks explains perinatal inequalities within deprived neighbourhoods | journal = European Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–80 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21203801 | pmc = 3043261 | doi = 10.1007/s10654-010-9542-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in Kenya observed that common maternal health problems in poverty-stricken areas include hemorrhaging, anemia, hypertension, malaria, placenta retention, premature labor, prolonged/complicated labor, and pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Izugbara&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Izugbara CO, Ngilangwa DP | title = Women, poverty and adverse maternal outcomes in Nairobi, Kenya | journal = BMC Women's Health | volume = 10 | issue = 33 | pages = 33 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21122118 | pmc = 3014866 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6874-10-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, adequate [[prenatal care]] encompasses medical care and educational, social, and nutritional services during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander G, Korenbrot CC |title=The Role of Prenatal Care in Preventing Low Birth Weight|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 1995|volume=5|series=Low Birth Weight|issue=1|pages=103–120|jstor=1602510|doi=10.2307/1602510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are a variety of reasons women choose not to engage in proper prenatal care, 71% of low-income women in a US national study had difficulties getting access to prenatal care when they sought it out.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt; Additionally, immigrants and Hispanic women are at higher risk than white or black women for receiving little to no prenatal care, where level of education is also an indicator (since education and race are correlated). Adolescents are least likely to receive any prenatal care at all. Throughout several studies, women and adolescents ranked inadequate finances and lack of transportation as the most common barriers to receiving proper prenatal care.&lt;ref name=Curry&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curry MA | title = Factors associated with inadequate prenatal care | journal = Journal of Community Health Nursing | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–52 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2243268 | doi = 10.1207/s15327655jchn0704_7 | jstor = 3427223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income is strongly correlated with quality of prenatal care.&lt;ref name=Curry /&gt;  Sometimes, proximity to healthcare facilities and access to transportation have significant effects on whether or not women have access to prenatal care.  An analysis conducted on maternal healthcare services in Mali found that women who lived in rural areas, far away from healthcare facilities were less likely to receive prenatal care than those who lived in urban areas.  Furthermore, researchers found an even stronger relationship between lack of transportation and prenatal and delivery care.&lt;ref name=Gage&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gage AJ | title = Barriers to the utilization of maternal health care in rural Mali | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 8 | pages = 1666–82 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17643685 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to proximity being a predictor of prenatal care access, Materia and colleagues found similar results for proximity and antenatal care in rural Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=Materia&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Materia E, Mehari W, Mele A, Rosmini F, Stazi MA, Damen HM, Basile G, Miuccio G, Ferrigno L, Miozzo A | title = A community survey on maternal and child health services utilization in rural Ethiopia | journal = European Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 511–6 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8307136 | doi = 10.1007/bf00209529 | jstor = 3520948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-existing conditions ===

====HIV/AIDS====
Maternal HIV rates vary around the world, ranging from 1% to 40%, with African and Asian countries having the highest rates.&lt;ref name=McIntyre2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McIntyre J | title = Maternal health and HIV | journal = Reproductive Health Matters | volume = 13 | issue = 25 | pages = 129–35 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 16035606 | doi = 10.1016/s0968-8080(05)25184-4 | jstor = 3776238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst maternal HIV infection largely has health implications for the child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.unicef.org/sowc2013/ | year = 2013 | title = The state of the world's children 2013 | location = Geneva | publisher = UNICEF }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in countries where poverty is high and education levels are low,&lt;ref name="pmid22340362"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toure K, Sankore R, Kuruvilla S, Scolaro E, Bustreo F, Osotimehin B | title = Positioning women's and children's health in African union policy-making: a policy analysis | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 3 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22340362 | pmc = 3298467 | doi = 10.1186/1744-8603-8-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having HIV/AIDS while pregnant can also cause heightened health risks for the mother. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/reducing-mother-to-child-risk/preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv|title=Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV|website=HIV.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07|date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large concern for HIV-positive pregnant women is the risk of contracting tuberculosis (TB) and/or malaria, in developing countries.&lt;ref name="McIntyre2" /&gt;

====Maternal weight====
Gestational weight gain should typically fall between {{convert|11|-|20|lb|0}} in order to improve outcomes for both mother and child.&lt;ref name="pmid21247811"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simmons D | title = Diabetes and obesity in pregnancy | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research.

===Oral hygiene===
{{Very long section|date=April 2018}}

'''Maternal oral health''' has been shown to affect the well-being of both the expectant mother and her unborn [[fetus]].

The 2000 Surgeon's General Report stressed the interdependence of oral health on the overall health and well-being of an individual.&lt;ref name="Surgeon"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research |title=Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |location=Rockville, Maryland |year=2000 |url=http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/DataStatistics/SurgeonGeneral}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral health]] is especially essential during perinatal period and the future development of the child.&lt;ref name="Dental"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oral Health During Pregnancy and Childhood: Evidence-based Guidelines for Health Professionals |year=2010 |publisher=California Dental Association |url=http://www.cdafoundation.org/library/docs/poh_guidelines.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525032223/http://www.cdafoundation.org/library/docs/poh_guidelines.pdf |archive-date=2010-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper management of oral health has benefits to both mother and child. Furthermore, lack of understanding or maintenance of good oral health for pregnant women may have adverse effects on them and their children. Hence, it is imperative to educate mothers regarding the significance of oral health. Moreover, collaboration and support among physicians across various fields, especially among family practitioners and obstetricians, is essential in addressing the concerns for maternal oral health.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;Brown A. 2008. Access to Oral Health Care During the Prenatal Period: A Policy Brief. Washington, DC: National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Maternal Oral Health Project was developed to provide routine oral care to low-income pregnant women in Nassau County, NY. Since its inception, the program has treated more than 2,000 pregnant women, many of whom had significant gum and/or tooth problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/partnership-between-private-practice-providers-and-hospitals-enhances-access-comprehensive |title=Partnership between private practice providers and hospitals enhances access to comprehensive dental care for underserved, low-income pregnant women |date=2013-02-27 |access-date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral health has numerous implications on overall general health and the quality of life of an individual. The ''Surgeon General's Report'' lists various systemic diseases and conditions that have oral manifestations.&lt;ref name="Surgeon" /&gt; The oral cavity serves as both a site of and a gateway entry of disease for microbial infections, which can affect general health status. In addition, some studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the report establishes a relationship between oral health and quality of life, including functional, psychosocial, and economic indicators. Poor oral health can affect diet, nutrition, sleep, psychological status, social interaction, school, and work.

Protection and control of oral health and diseases safeguards a woman's health and quality of life before and during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="OHRC Consensus Statement"&gt;{{cite web|author=Oral Health Care During Pregnancy Expert Workgroup |year=2012|title=Oral health care during pregnancy: a national consensus statement—summary of an expert workgroup meeting|location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center|url=http://www.mchoralhealth.org/PDFs/Oralhealthpregnancyconsensusmeetingsummary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it has the potential to decrease the transmission of pathogenic bacteria that occurs from mother to child.&lt;ref name="Dental" /&gt; Along with pregnancy, come physiological changes for a woman. The changes, including fluctuating hormones, increase the woman's susceptibility to oral infections such as periodontal disease. This disease impairs the body's ability to repair and maintain soft tissues.&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; It also causes indirect damage through bacterial induction of both inflammatory and immune responses of the host.&lt;ref name="Boggessa"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boggess KA, Edelstein BL | title = Oral health in women during preconception and pregnancy: implications for birth outcomes and infant oral health | journal = Maternal and Child Health Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = S169–74 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16816998 | pmc = 1592159 | doi = 10.1007/s10995-006-0095-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During pregnancy, mild inflammation of the gums, "pregnancy gingivitis", is quite common and if left untreated can lead to periodontal disease. There have been an increased number of studies establishing associations between, periodontal disease and negative health outcomes, which include tooth loss, cardiovascular disease, stroke, poor diabetes control, and adverse birth outcomes. For example, one such study found that moderate or severe periodontal disease early in pregnancy was associated with delivery of small-for-gestational-age infant.&lt;ref name="Boggessb"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boggess KA, Beck JD, Murtha AP, Moss K, Offenbacher S | title = Maternal periodontal disease in early pregnancy and risk for a small-for-gestational-age infant | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 194 | issue = 5 | pages = 1316–22 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16647916 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.11.059 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9378(05)02679-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have also found an association between periodontal disease and development of pre-eclampsia and pre-term births.&lt;ref name="Boggessa" /&gt;

Another notable oral disease pertinent to maternal child health is dental caries. Dental caries is the process of tooth decay, and the development of what is commonly known as cavities.&lt;ref name="Boggessa" /&gt; Dental caries are transmitted from mother to child vertically; colonization of cariogenic bacteria primarily occurs from mother to child through saliva-sharing activities. Maternal oral flora can ultimately foretell oral flora in offspring.&lt;ref name="Boggessc"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boggess KA | title = Maternal oral health in pregnancy | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 111 | issue = 4 | pages = 976–86 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378759 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e31816a49d3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other maternal factors such as social, behavioral, and biological factors can predispose a child's experience with tooth-decay.&lt;ref name="Boggessa" /&gt; Some of these factors include the lack of knowledge a mother possesses concerning oral health, which can influence the development of caries among her children. Compared to children whose mothers have good oral health, children whose mothers have bad oral health are five times as likely to have poor oral health.&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; Poor maintenance of oral health has profound implications on the development of children. As mentioned in the Surgeon's General Report, oral health affects the quality of life, especially children, with respect to functional, psychological, economic, and overall emotional well-being of an individual.&lt;ref name="Surgeon" /&gt; To demonstrate the adverse effects of poor oral health, take for example the consequences a simple cavity can have on a child. First, it is painful. This might cause a child to miss school or have poor concentration, eventually compromising school performance. In addition, due to the pain, it might result in poor weight gain or growth. Also, children may exhibit reduced self-esteem because of cosmetic issues. Furthermore, it can affect language and impair speech. Impaired speech development can also result in low self-esteem. Finally, cavities although easily preventable, can pose a financial burden of a family. Public dental services are scarce and costly to individuals who lack dental insurance. It may also result in unwarranted visits to emergency department. Poor oral health permeates into other aspects of life, posing threats to overall well-being, if not handled timely and effectively

The significance of oral health is apparent, however, many women do not receive dental services before, during, and after pregnancy, even with obvious signs of oral disease.&lt;ref name="OHRC Consensus Statement" /&gt; There are several factors at play regarding pregnant women not seeking dental care, including the role of the health care system and disposition of the woman herself. There is a common misconception that it is not safe to obtain dental services while pregnant. Many prenatal and oral health providers have limited knowledge about the impact and safety of delivering dental services; hence they might delay or withhold treatment during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Dental" /&gt; Moreover, some prenatal providers are not aware of the importance of oral health on overall general health, thus failing to refer their patients to dental providers.&lt;ref name="OHRC Consensus Statement" /&gt; First and foremost, the misconception regarding the impact of dental services while a woman is pregnant needs to be purged. There is a consensus that prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral diseases are highly beneficial and can be performed on pregnant women having no added fetal or maternal risk when compared to the risk of providing no oral care.&lt;ref name="OHRC Consensus Statement" /&gt;  Equally important is establishing collaboration among clinicians, especially maternal health providers, with other dental providers. There should be coordination among general health and oral health providers, especially because of the interdependence of the two fields.&lt;ref name="Surgeon" /&gt;  Thus, it is imperative to educate and train health providers of the significance of oral health, designing methods to incorporate in their respective practices. Providers most provide education to pregnant women addressing the importance of oral health, because these women ultimately control the fate of themselves and their offspring. For example, providers can illustrate to mothers how to reduce cavities by wiping down the gums of their children with a soft cloth after breastfeeding or bottle-feeding.&lt;ref name="Dental" /&gt; Bestowing knowledge and practical applications of good oral health maintenance measures to mothers can help improve overall health of the mother and child.  
There are still other factors in play when analyzing the low use of dental services by pregnant women, particularly prevalent among ethnic and racial minorities. A major factor is the lack of insurance and or access to dental services.&lt;ref name="Surgeon" /&gt; For this reason, more data needs to be collected and analyzed so that programs are set up to effectively to reach all segments of the population.

==Effects on child health and development==

===Prenatal health===

[[Prenatal care]] is an important part of basic maternal health care. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/prenatal-care-and-tests|title=Prenatal care and tests {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07|date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is recommended expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits, in which a health worker can check for signs of ill health – such as underweight, anaemia or infection – and monitor the health of the foetus.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; During these visits, women are counseled on nutrition and hygiene to improve their health prior to, and following, delivery. They can also develop a birth plan laying out how to reach care and what to do in case of an emergency.

Poverty, malnutrition, and substance abuse may contribute to impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral problems across childhood.&lt;ref name=Hurt&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurt H, Brodsky NL, Roth H, Malmud E, Giannetta JM | title = School performance of children with gestational cocaine exposure | journal = Neurotoxicology and Teratology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15734271 | doi = 10.1016/j.ntt.2004.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if a mother is not in optimal health during the prenatal period (the time while she is pregnant) and/or the fetus is exposed to teratogen(s), the child is more likely to experience health or developmental difficulties, or death. The environment in which the mother provides for the embryo/fetus is critical to its wellbeing well after gestation and birth.

A [[Teratology|teratogen]] is "any agent that can potentially cause a birth defect or negatively alter cognitive and behavioral outcomes." Dose, genetic susceptibility, and time of exposure are all factors for the extent of the effect of a teratogen on an embryo or fetus.&lt;ref name=Santrock&gt;{{cite book|last=Santrock|first=John W. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Life-Span Development (14th edition)|year=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-131868-6|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarette smoking during pregnancy can have a multitude of detrimental effects on the health and development of the offspring.  Common results of smoking during pregnancy include pre-term births, low birth weights, fetal and neonatal deaths, respiratory problems, and [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS),&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; as well as increased risk for cognitive impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abbott LC, Winzer-Serhan UH | title = Smoking during pregnancy: lessons learned from epidemiological studies and experimental studies using animal models | journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–303 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22394313 | doi = 10.3109/10408444.2012.658506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy experienced a 22% risk increase for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;ref name=Antonopoulos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Antonopoulos CN, Sergentanis TN, Papadopoulou C, Andrie E, Dessypris N, Panagopoulou P, Polychronopoulou S, Pourtsidis A, Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou F, Kalmanti M, Sidi V, Moschovi M, Petridou ET | title = Maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood lymphoma: a meta-analysis | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 129 | issue = 11 | pages = 2694–703 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21225624 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.25929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although alcohol use in careful moderation (one to two servings a few days a week) during pregnancy are not generally known to cause [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]] (FASD), the US Surgeon General advises against the consumption of alcohol at all during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Cheng&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng D, Kettinger L, Uduhiri K, Hurt L | title = Alcohol consumption during pregnancy: prevalence and provider assessment | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 117 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 212–7 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21252732 | doi = 10.1097/aog.0b013e3182078569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive alcohol use during pregnancy can cause FASD, which commonly consist of physical and cognitive abnormalities in the child such as facial deformities, defective limbs, face, and heart, learning problems, below average intelligence, and intellectual disability (ID).&lt;ref name=Painter&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paintner A, Williams AD, Burd L | title = Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders-- implications for child neurology, part 1: prenatal exposure and dosimetry | journal = Journal of Child Neurology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 258–63 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22351188 | doi = 10.1177/0883073811428376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paintner A, Williams AD, Burd L | title = Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders--implications for child neurology, part 2: diagnosis and management | journal = Journal of Child Neurology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–62 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22241713 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1177/0883073811428377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although HIV/AIDS can be transmitted to offspring at different times, the most common time that mothers pass on the virus is during pregnancy. During the perinatal period, the embryo/fetus can contract the virus through the placenta.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

[[Gestational diabetes]] is directly linked with obesity in offspring through adolescence.&lt;ref name=Pettitt&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pettitt DJ, Baird HR, Aleck KA, Bennett PH, Knowler WC | title = Excessive obesity in offspring of Pima Indian women with diabetes during pregnancy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 308 | issue = 5 | pages = 242–5 | date = February 1983 | pmid = 6848933 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198302033080502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, children whose mothers had diabetes are more likely to develop [[Type II diabetes]].&lt;ref name=Dabelea&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dabelea D, Hanson RL, Bennett PH, Roumain J, Knowler WC, Pettitt DJ | title = Increasing prevalence of Type II diabetes in American Indian children | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 904–10 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9726592 | doi = 10.1007/s001250051006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who have gestational diabetes have a high chance of giving birth to very large infants (10 pounds or more).&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

Because the embryo or fetus's nutrition is based on maternal protein, vitamin, mineral, and total caloric intake, infants born to malnourished mothers are more likely to exhibit malformations. Additionally, maternal stress can affect the fetus both directly and indirectly.   When a mother is under stress, physiological changes occur in the body that could harm the developing fetus. Additionally, the mother is more likely to engage in behaviors that could negatively affect the fetus, such as tobacco smoking, drug use, and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

===Postpartum period===

Globally, more than eight million of the 136 million women giving birth each year suffer from excessive bleeding after childbirth.&lt;ref name="Medicines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicines for Maternal Health |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/medicines-maternal-health|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition—medically referred to as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)—causes one out of every four maternal deaths that occur annually and accounts for more maternal deaths than any other individual cause.&lt;ref name="Medicines"/&gt; Deaths due to postpartum hemorrhage disproportionately affect women in developing countries.

For every woman who dies from causes related to pregnancy, an estimated 20 to 30 encounter serious complications.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; At least 15 per cent of all births are complicated by a potentially fatal condition.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; Women who survive such complications often require lengthy recovery times and may face lasting physical, psychological, social and economic consequences. Although many of these complications are unpredictable, almost all are treatable.

During the [[postpartum period]], many mothers breastfeed their infants. Transmission of HIV/AIDS through breastfeeding is a huge issue in [[developing country|developing countries]], namely in African countries.&lt;ref name=McIntyre /&gt;  The majority of infants who contract HIV through breast milk do so within the first six weeks of life.&lt;ref name=Hollander&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollander D | title = Most Infant HIV Infection from Breast Milk Occurs within Six Weeks of Birth|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 2000|volume=26|issue=3|page=141|jstor=2648305|doi=10.2307/2648305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in healthy mothers, there are many benefits for infants who are breastfed.  The World Health Organization recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for the first two years of life, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend that mothers do so for at least the first six months, and continue as long as is mutually desired.&lt;ref name=Stuebe&amp;Schwarz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stuebe AM, Schwarz EB | title = The risks and benefits of infant feeding practices for women and their children | journal = Journal of Perinatology | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–62 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19609306 | doi = 10.1038/jp.2009.107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants who are breastfed by healthy mothers (not infected with HIV/AIDS) are less prone to infections such as ''Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneunoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Giardia lamblia'', group B streptococci, ''Staphylococcus epidermidis'', rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus-1, as well as gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media. Lower rates of infant mortality are observed in breastfed babies in addition to lower rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Decreases in obesity and diseases such as childhood metabolic disease, asthma, atopic dermatitis, Type I diabetes, and childhood cancers are also seen in children who are breastfed.&lt;ref name=Stuebe&amp;Schwarz /&gt;

== Long-term effects for the mother ==

Maternal health problems include complications from childbirth that do not result in death. For every woman that dies during childbirth, approximately 20 suffer from [[infection]], [[injury]], or [[disability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maternal deaths worldwide drop by third |date=15 September 2010 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2010/maternal_mortality_20100915/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 50% of the births in developing countries still take place without a [[birth attendant|medically skilled attendant]] to aid the mother, and the ratio is even higher in South Asia.&lt;ref name=UNICEF/&gt; Women in Sub-Saharan Africa mainly rely on [[traditional birth attendant]]s (TBAs), who have little or no formal health care training. In recognition of their role, some countries and non-governmental organizations are making efforts to train TBAs in maternal health topics, in order to improve the chances for better health outcomes among mothers and babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evaluation Findings: Support to traditional birth attendants |year=1996 |format=PDF |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/monitoring/pdf/n-issue7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breastfeeding provides women with several long-term benefits.  Women who breastfeed experience better glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure, and lose pregnancy weight faster than those who do not. Additionally, women who breastfeed experience lower rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name=Stuebe&amp;Schwarz /&gt; However, it is important to keep in mind that breastfeeding provides substantial benefits to women who are not infected with HIV.  In countries where HIV/AIDS rates are high, such as South Africa and Kenya, the virus is a leading cause of maternal mortality, especially in mothers who breastfeed.&lt;ref name=McIntyre /&gt;  A complication is that many HIV-infected mothers cannot afford formula, and thus have no way of preventing transmission to the child through breast milk or avoiding health risks for themselves.&lt;ref name=Hollander /&gt; In cases like this, mothers have no choice but to breastfeed their infants regardless of their knowledge of the harmful effects.

===Maternal mortality - a sentinel event===

In a September 2016 ACOG/SMFM consensus, published concurrently in the journal ''Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology'' and by the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), they noted that while they did not yet have a "single, comprehensive definition of severe maternal morbidity" (SMM), the rate of SMM is increasing in the United States as is maternal mortality. Both are "associated with a high rate of preventability."&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kilpatrick SK, Ecker JL | title = Severe maternal morbidity: screening and review | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 215 | issue = 3 | pages = B17–22 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27560600 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2016.07.050 | url = http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(16)30523-3/pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obstet_Gynecol_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Obstetric Care Consensus No 5 Summary: Severe Maternal Morbidity: Screening And Review | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 128 | issue = 3 | pages = 670–1 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27548549 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001635 | url = http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2016/09000/Obstetric_Care_Consensus_No_5_Summary___Severe.46.aspx | access-date = December 22, 2017 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations]] calls [[maternal mortality]] a "[[sentinel event]]", and uses it to assess the quality of a health care system.{{sfn|Joint Commission|2010}}

Maternal mortality data is said to be an important indicator of overall health system quality because pregnant women survive in sanitary, safe, well-staffed and stocked facilities. If new mothers are thriving, it indicates that the health care system is doing its job. If not, problems likely exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garret |first=Laurie | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Challenge of Global Health |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=14–38 |date=January–February 2007 |url=http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/faoInfo/Agricult/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf |format=PDF |ref=harv}}{{rp|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Garret, increasing maternal survival, along with life expectancy, is an important goal for the world health community, as they show that other health issues are also improving. If these areas improve, disease-specific improvements are also better able to positively impact populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garret|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMR in developing countries===
[[File:Merlin Maternal.jpg|thumb|Maternal health clinic in Afghanistan (source: [[Merlin]])]]
Decreasing the rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in developing countries is important because poor maternal health is both an indicator and a cause of extreme poverty. According to Tamar Manuelyan Atinc, Vice President for Human Development at the World Bank:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/membernews/2010/20100915_unreport_maternaldeaths/en/index.html UN HEALTH AGENCIES: "Maternal deaths worldwide drop by a third"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629045407/http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/membernews/2010/20100915_unreport_maternaldeaths/en/index.html |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Maternal deaths are both caused by poverty and are a cause of it. The costs of childbirth can quickly exhaust a family's income, bringing with it even more financial hardship."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many developing countries, [[complications of pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] are the leading causes of [[maternal mortality|death among women]] of reproductive age. A woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute.&lt;ref name=UNICEF&gt;{{harnvb|UNICEF Maternal Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], in its [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2005'']], poor maternal conditions account for the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |title=World Health Report 2005: make every mother and child count |year=2005 |publisher=WHO |location=Geneva |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2005/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most maternal deaths and injuries are caused by biological processes, not from disease, which can be prevented and have been largely eradicated in the [[developed world]] — such as [[postpartum hemorrhage|postpartum hemorrhaging]], which causes 34% of maternal deaths in the [[developing world]] but only 13% of maternal deaths in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Most Maternal Deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa Could Be Avoided |date=2 March 2010 | publisher = Science Daily | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100218092852.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although high-quality, accessible health care has made maternal death a rare event in developed countries, where only 1% of maternal deaths occur, these complications can often be fatal in the [[developing world]] because single most important intervention for safe motherhood is to make sure that a trained provider with midwifery skills is present at every birth, that transport is available to referral services, and that quality emergency obstetric care is available.&lt;ref name=UNICEF/&gt;  In 2008 342,900 women died while pregnant or from childbirth worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://maternalhealthtaskforce.org/component/wpmu/2010/04/ | title = Maternal Health Task Force | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110311044500/http://maternalhealthtaskforce.org/component/wpmu/2010/04/ | archive-date=2011-03-11 | dead-url = yes | work = Maternal Health Talk Force }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high number, this was a significant drop from 1980, when 526,300 women died from the same causes. This improvement was caused by lower pregnancy rates in some countries; higher income, which improves nutrition and access to health care; more education for women; and the increasing availability of [[birth attendant|"skilled birth attendants"]] — people with training in basic and emergency obstetric care — to help women give birth. The situation was especially led by improvements in large countries like India and China, which helped to drive down the overall death rates.  In India, the government started paying for prenatal and delivery care to ensure access, and saw successes in reducing maternal mortality, so much so that India is cited as the major reason for the decreasing global rates of maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=NYT20100413&gt;{{cite news | first = Denise | last = Grady | name-list-format = vanc |title=Maternal Deaths Decline Sharply Across the Globe |newspaper=New York Times |date=13 April 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/health/14births.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MMR in developed countries===
Until the early 20th century developed and developing countries had similar rates of maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="strategies_1998"/&gt; Since most maternal deaths and injuries are preventable,&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016"/&gt; they have been largely eradicated in the developed world.

The U.S. has the "highest rate of maternal mortality in the industrialized world."&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Ellison_2017"/&gt; It is also estimated that 50% of the deaths are from preventable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troiano|first=Nan H.|last2=Witcher|first2=Patricia M.|date=2018|title=Maternal Mortality and Morbidity in the United States|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005237-201807000-00007|journal=The Journal of Perinatal &amp; Neonatal Nursing|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=222–231|doi=10.1097/jpn.0000000000000349|pmid=30036304|issn=0893-2190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, [[ProPublica]] and [[NPR]] investigated factors that led to the increase in maternal mortality in the United States. They reported that the "rate of life-threatening complications for new mothers in the U.S. has more than doubled in two decades due to pre-existing conditions, medical errors and unequal access to care."&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Ellison_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/severe-complications-for-women-during-childbirth-are-skyrocketing-and-could-often-be-prevented |title=Severe Complications for Women During Childbirth Are Skyrocketing — and Could Often Be Prevented |series=Lost mothers |date=December 22, 2017 |access-date=December 22, 2017 |publisher=[[ProPublica]] |first1=Katherine |last1=Ellison |first2=Nina |last2=Martin | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, c. 4 million women who give birth in the US annually, over 50,000 a year, experience "dangerous and even life-threatening complications."&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Ellison_2017"/&gt; Of those 700 to 900 die every year "related to pregnancy and childbirth." A "pervasive problem" is the rapidly increasing rate of "severe maternal morbidity" (SMM), which does not yet have a "single, comprehensive definition".&lt;ref name="ACOG_SMFM_2016"/&gt;

According to a report by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], in 1993 the rate of Severe Maternal Morbidity, rose from 49.5 to 144 "per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations" in 2014, an increase of almost 200 percent. Blood transfusions also increased during the same period with "from 24.5 in 1993 to 122.3 in 2014 and are considered to be the major driver of the increase in SMM. After excluding blood transfusions, the rate of SMM increased by about 20% over time, from 28.6 in 1993 to 35.0 in 2014."&lt;ref name="CDC_SMM_2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/severematernalmorbidity.html|agency=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|date=November 27, 2017 |access-date=December 21, 2017  |location=Atlanta, Georgia }} Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed solutions ==
The [[World Bank]] estimated that a total of 3.00 US dollars per person a year can provide basic family planning and both maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalhealth.org/view_top.php3?id=225 Global Health Council: Women's Health]&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-profit organizations have programs educating the public and gaining access to emergency obstetric care for mothers in developing countries. The United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA) recently began its Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA), focusing on providing quality healthcare to mothers. One of the programs within CARMMA is Sierra Leone providing free healthcare to mothers and children. This initiative has widespread support from African leaders and was started in conjunction with the African Union Health Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/public/site/global/lang/en/pid/5479 UNFPA: "Creating Good CARMMA for African Mothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020211023/http://www.unfpa.org/public/site/global/lang/en/pid/5479 |date=2010-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving maternal health is the fifth of the United Nations' eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), targeting a reduction in the number of women dying during pregnancy and childbirth by three quarters by 2015, notably by increasing the usage of skilled birth attendants, contraception and family planning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no4/214-maternal-health.html United Nations: "Investing in the health of Africa's mothers"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rosenfield et al|2006}} The current decline of maternal deaths is only half of what is necessary to achieve this goal, and in several regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa the maternal mortality rate is actually increasing. However, one country that may meet their MDG 5 is Nepal, which has it appears reduced its maternal mortality by more than 50% since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Engel, Jonathan Glennie, Shiva Raj Adhikari, Sanju Wagle Bhattarai, Devi Prasad Prasai and Fiona Samuels, [http://www.developmentprogress.org/sites/developmentprogress.org/files/case-study-summary/development_progress_-_nepal_case_study_summary.pdf Nepal's Story, Understanding improvements in maternal health], March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As the 2015 deadline for the MDG's approaches, an understanding of the policy developments leading to the inclusion of maternal health within the MDG's is essential for future advocacy efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Boese K, Dogra N, Hosseinpour S, Kobylianskii A, Vakeesan V | chapter = Chapter 1 – Analyzing the Inclusion of MDG 5, Improving Maternal Health, among the UN's Millennium Development Goals. | veditors = Hoffman SJ, Ali M | chapter-url = https://www.mcmasterhealthforum.org/docs/default-source/Misc/student-voices-6_2013-06-26.pdf?sfvrsn=2 | title = Student Voices 6: Political Analyses of Five Global Health Decisions | location = Hamilton, Canada | publisher = McMaster Health Forum | year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[UNFPA]], maternal deaths would be reduced by about two-thirds, from 287,000 to 105,000, if needs for modern family planning and maternal and newborn health care were met.&lt;ref name="Determinants" /&gt; Therefore, investing in family planning and improved maternal health care brings many benefits including reduced risks of complications and improvement in health for mothers and their children. Education is also critical with research showing "that women with no education were nearly three times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than women who had finished secondary school." &lt;ref name="Determinants" /&gt; Evidence shows that women who are better educated tend to have healthier children. Education would also improve employment opportunities for women which results in improving their status, contributing to family savings, reducing poverty and contributing to economic growth. All of these invests bring significant benefits and effects not only for women and girls but also their children, families, communities and their country.

Developed countries had rates of maternal mortality similar to those of developing countries until the early 20th century, therefore several lessons can be learned from the west. During the 19th century Sweden had high levels of maternal mortality, and there was a strong support within the country to reduce mortality rate to fewer than 300 per 100,000 live births. The Swedish government began public health initiatives to train enough midwives to attend all births. This approach was also later used by Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands who also experienced similar successes.&lt;ref name="strategies_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Brouwere V, Tonglet R, Van Lerberghe W | title = Strategies for reducing maternal mortality in developing countries: what can we learn from the history of the industrialized West? | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 771–82 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9809910 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00310.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing contraceptive usage and family planning also improves maternal health through reduction in numbers of higher risk pregnancies and by lowering the [[Birth spacing|inter-pregnancy interval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wendt A, Gibbs CM, Peters S, Hogue CJ | title = Impact of increasing inter-pregnancy interval on maternal and infant health | journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology | volume = 26 Suppl 1 | pages = 239–58 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22742614 | pmc = 4562277 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2012.01285.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganatra B, Faundes A | title = Role of birth spacing, family planning services, safe abortion services and post-abortion care in reducing maternal mortality | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3282">'''Mink hunting''' is a country sport involving the hunting of [[American mink]] with [[Hunting with hounds|scent hounds]] along the waterways which make up their habitat, in a manner similar to [[fox hunting]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/2990618.stm "Mink hunting on the rise" ] BBC, 15 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Mink hunting took place in the countryside in the UK and Ireland, but since 2005 traditional mink hunting has been [[Hunting Act 2004|banned]] in England and Wales.

==Origins==
When the sport of [[otter]] hunting was given up in the British Isles in the late 1970s due to otters becoming endangered, many packs of Otterhounds converted to hunting the [[invasive species|invasive]] American mink,&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; which had become established in Britain from 1950 onward, from fur farm escapees. Unsuccessful efforts to eradicate the mink led to it being widely viewed as an invasive pest in Britain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildcru.org/research/research-detail/?project_id=37 Management of American mink and interactions with native mustelids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209002655/http://www.wildcru.org/research/research-detail/?project_id=37 |date=2011-12-09 }}, Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.

Accessed 6 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunting==
There are 22 packs of Minkhounds in the UK, registered with the Masters of Minkhounds Association, and four packs in Ireland, registered with the Mink Hounds Association.&lt;ref name=HAI&gt;[http://hai.ie/minkhounds.php "Irish Mink Hounds Association" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055014/http://www.hai.ie/minkhounds.php |date=2014-08-10 }} Hunting Association of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; Mink hunts meet once or twice a week over the Summer, from April to October, and draw waterways searching for mink. Followers try to keep up on foot, which may involve wading across a river. When a mink is found, a chase will ensue, with hounds hunting the scent of the mink until they catch it. It is estimated up to 1,400 mink were killed a year by mink hunts in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/using/hunting_1.shtml|title=Hunting|work=Ethics|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2005 ban, mink hunts in the UK have adapted to the new legislation by undertaking legal trail hunting and other forms of exempt hunting (such as hunting rats).

The hounds used for Minkhunting are usually elderly foxhounds, drafted from foxhound packs, though some packs also use the historic [[Otterhound]] breed.

A '''mobility aid''' is a device designed to assist [[walking]] or otherwise improve the mobility of people with a mobility impairment.

There are various walking aids which can help people with impaired ability to walk and wheelchairs or mobility scooters for more severe disability or longer journeys which would otherwise be undertaken on foot. For people who are blind or visually impaired the [[white cane]] and [[guide dog]] have a long history of use. Other aids can help with mobility or transfer within a building or where there are changes of level.

Traditionally the phrase "mobility aid" has applied mainly to low technology mechanical devices. The term also appears in government documents, for example dealing with tax concessions of various kinds.&lt;ref name="VAT"/&gt; It refers to those devices whose use enables a freedom of movement similar to that of unassisted walking or standing up from a chair.

Technical advances can be expected to increase the scope of these devices considerably, for example by use of sensors and audio or tactile feedback.&lt;ref name="skaters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camera"/&gt;

==Walking aids==
[[Image:Elleboogkruk.jpg|alt=a length adjustable forearm crutch with handgrip and forearm support|thumb|right|forearm crutch]]
Walking aids include [[assistive cane]]s (commonly referred to as [[walking stick]]s), [[crutch]]es, and [[walker (mobility)|walkers]]. As appropriate to the needs of the individual user, these devices help to maintain upright ambulation by providing any or all of: improved stability, reduced lower-limb loading and generating movement.
;Improved stability: By providing additional points of contact the walking aid provides both additional support and a wider range of stable centre of gravity positioning.
;Reduced lower-limb loading: By directing load through the arms and the walking aid, lower impact and static forces are transmitted through the affected limbs.
;Generating Movement: The walking aid and arms can substitute for the muscles and joints of the spine, pelvis and/or legs in the generation of dynamic forces during walking.

===Cane===
The cane or walking stick is the simplest form of walking aid. It is held in the hand and transmits loads to the floor through a shaft. The load which can be applied through a cane is transmitted through the user's hands and wrists and limited by these.

===Crutches===
A [[crutch]] also transmits loads to the ground through a shaft, but has two points of contact with the arm, at the hand and either below the elbow or below the armpit. This allows significantly greater loads to be exerted through a crutch in comparison with a cane.

===Canes, crutches, and forearm crutch combinations===
Devices on the market today include a number of combinations for canes, crutches, and forearm crutches. These crutches have bands that encircle the upper arms and handles for the patient to hold and rest their hands to support the body weight.&lt;ref name="forearm-crutch-1"/&gt; The forearm crutch typically gives a user the support of the cane but with additional forearm support to assist in mobility. The forearm portion helps increase balance, lateral stability and also reduces the load on the wrist.

===Walkers===
A [[Walker (mobility)|walker]] (also known as a Zimmer frame) is the most stable walking aid and consists of a freestanding metal framework with three or more points of contact which the user places in front of them and then grips during movement. The points of contact may be either fixed rubber ferrules as with crutches and canes, or wheels, or a combination of both. Wheeled walkers are also known as rollators. Many of these walkers also come with an inbuilt seat so that the user may rest during use and with metal pouches to carry personal belongings.

===Walker cane hybrid===
[[Image:Walker Cane Hybrid in 4 Configurations.jpg|thumb|190px|right|A Walker Cane Hybrid adjusted to four configurations.]]
A walker cane hybrid&lt;ref name="Hybrid" /&gt; was introduced in 2012 designed to bridge the gap between a cane and a walker. The hybrid has two legs which provide lateral (side-to-side) support which a cane does not. It can be used with two hands in front of the user, similar to a walker, and provides an increased level of support compared with a cane. It can be adjusted for use with either one or two hands, at the front and at the side, as well as a stair climbing assistant. The hybrid is not designed to replace a walker which normally has four legs and provides 4-way support using both hands.

===Gait trainers===
Another device to assist walking that has entered the market in recent years is the [[gait trainer]]. This is a mobility aid that is more supportive than the standard walker. It typically offers support that assists weight-bearing and balance. The accessories or product parts that attach to the product frame provide unweighting support and postural alignment to enable walking practice.


==Seated walking scooter==
[[File:Walking Aid Scooter and mobility aid.jpg|thumb|Walking Aid Scooter]]
The [[Walk Aid Scooter]] allows a user with normal balance and foot, knee or hip conditions to unload the lower extremities. The two-wheeled scooter has a bicycle-type seat and handlebars, and is manually propelled with one or both feet like a [[balance bicycle]]. This walking aid scooter provides more support than a cane and is lighter,less bulky and easier to propel than a wheelchair.

==Wheelchairs and scooters==
[[Wheelchair]]s and [[mobility scooter]]s substitute for walking by providing a wheeled device on which the user sits. Wheelchairs may be either manually propelled (by the user or by [[Personal Care Assistant|an aide]]) or [[Motorized wheelchair|electrically powered]] (commonly known as a "powerchair"). Mobility scooters are electrically powered, as are motorized wheelchairs.
Wheelchairs and Scooters are normally recommended for any individual due to significant mobility/balance impairment. A Registered Occupational Therapist or Physiotherapist (few cases) are able to provide object and clinical testing to ensure proper and safe device recommendations.

==Stairlifts and similar devices==
A [[stairlift]] is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs up and down stairs. Sometimes special purpose lifts are provided elsewhere to facilitate access for the disabled, for example at entrances to raised bus stops in [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]] ([[#bus-stop|illustrated above]]). A wheelchair lift is specifically designed to carry the user and the wheelchair. This can either be through floor or utilizing the staircase.

==Others==
Mobility aids may also include [[adaptive technology]] such as [[sling lift]]s or other patient transfer devices that help transfer users between beds and chairs or [[lift chair]]s (and other sit-to-stand devices), transfer or convertible chairs. [[Knee scooter]]s help some users.

{{Self-published|date=November 2018}}

The '''National Association of Boards of Pharmacy''' is an international association which assists member boards and jurisdictions in administrating its pharmacist license transfer and pharmacist competence assessment programs for the purpose of ensuring public health.&lt;ref name="NABP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nabp.pharmacy/about/|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=National Association of Boards of Pharmacy|publisher=National Association of Boards of Pharmacy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NABP membership is composed of 54 active members and 12 associate members. Active member boards include all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Associate member boards are Australia, Bahamas, and 10 Canadian provinces.&lt;ref name="NABP"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

NABP supports its member boards of pharmacy by offering:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nabp.pharmacy/member-services/nabp-and-the-boards-of-pharmacy/|title=NABP and the Boards of Pharmacy {{!}} National Association of Boards of Pharmacy|work=National Association of Boards of Pharmacy|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Examinations that assess pharmacists’ competency to practice pharmacy, providing boards a uniform, high-quality solution making a determination of competence. These examinations include the [[NAPLEX|North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX)]] and the [[Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination|Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE)]].
* License transfer program that alleviates the administrative burden on boards by verifying pharmacists’ applications for license transfer,
* Accreditation programs that create uniform standards and perform inspections to supplement board staff and alleviate financial burden.
* Many other services that provide pertinent resources to assist the boards of pharmacy as they work to protect the public health each day.

==History==
The NABP originated in the United States in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sonnedecker|first1=Glenn|last2=Kremers|first2=Edward|title=Kremers and Urdang's History of Pharmacy|date=1976|publisher=American Institute of the History of Pharmacy|isbn=0931292174|page=218|edition=4th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r__FmMNS7qIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the NABP developed the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) program to accredit online pharmacies. 

In 2004, the NABP developed the [[VAWD|Verified-Accredited Wholesale Distributors]] (VAWD) program to accredit Wholesale Distributors and to help protect the public from the threat of counterfeit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Background of the VAWD. Retrieved from http://www.nabp.net/vawd/VAWDbackground.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the NABP implemented a data exchange that allows authorized pharmacists, law enforcement agents, and regulatory boards to access patient-specific controlled substance prescription information. Known as ''NABP PMP InterConnect®'', the platform provides a single page summary of patient's drug seeking activities across state lines. As of 2018, authorized users in 42 states have accessed data using the system in order to prevent drug abuse and drug diversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nabp.pharmacy/initiatives/pmp-interconnect/|title=PMP InterConnect|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2018|website=NABP website|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top-level domain .pharmacy===
In 2014, the NABP launched the [[generic top-level domain]] (gTLD) ''[[.pharmacy]]'', "to provide consumers around the world a means for identifying safe, legal, and ethical online pharmacies and related resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://nabp.pharmacy/nabp-launches-pharmacy-generic-top-level-domain-to-help-consumers-find-safe-pharmacies-online/ |title= NABP Launches .Pharmacy Generic Top-Level Domain to Help Consumers Find Safe Pharmacies Online |publisher=National Association of Boards of Pharmacy |date=September 9, 2014 |accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impartiality of the domain has been questioned, because [[Eli Lilly and Company]], [[Merck &amp; Co.]], and [[Pfizer]] are the main contributors to the NABP application.  Previously, that application was challenged by [[Public Citizen]], [[Knowledge Ecology International]], and the [[Canadian International Pharmacy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/2014/07/21/can-the-dot-pharmacy-new-generic-domain-name-be-impartial/ Can The Dot Pharmacy New Generic Domain Be Impartial?]—''[[Intellectual Property Watch]]'' (July 7, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
{{Hatnote|For other uses of the term, please see [[Neutral zone (disambiguation)]]}}
In [[dentistry]], the '''neutral zone''' refers to that space in the [[oral cavity]] where the forces exerted by the musculature of the [[tongue]] are equal and balanced with the forces exerted by the [[buccinator muscle]] of the cheek [[Lateral (anatomy)|laterally]] and the [[orbicularis oris muscle]] [[anterior]]ly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=KL|author2=Agarwal, S |title=Salvation of a severely resorbed mandibular ridge with a neutral zone technique.|journal=Indian Journal of Dental Research|date=Nov–Dec 2011|volume=22|issue=6|pages=883|pmid=22484902|url=http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2011;volume=22;issue=6;spage=883;epage=883;aulast=Gupta|doi=10.4103/0970-9290.94699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marc Geissberger|title=Esthetic Dentistry in Clinical Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013|isbn=9781118694930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSINAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA4-PA57&amp;dq=neutral+zone+dentistry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3yd4Ut7oPJGQhQee8YDQDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=neutral%20zone%20dentistry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, it is the ''potential space'' between the lips and cheeks on one side and the tongue on the other; where the ''forces'' between the two are ''equal''. Other synonyms include: zone of equilibrium, zone of minimal conflict, potential denture space and dead space. It is in this zone that the natural dentition lie, and this is where artificial teeth of complete dentures should be positioned. Complete dentures that are constructed in this way exhibit ''enhanced stability, retention and comfort''.

The neutral zone is an important concept in [[prosthodontics]], because prosthetic teeth generally must conform to the horizontal position determined by the neutral zone. Prostheses which set teeth outside this zone risk problems such as discomfort, cheek or tongue biting, and instability of the denture.

The neutral zone is also important in [[orthodontics]]. Moving teeth outside of this zone means that the muscular forces on the teeth will be out of balance in one direction, and tend to be more likely to relapse to their original position.

== Indications ==
The neutral zone technique is indicated in cases where there has been:
* Extensively resorbed mandibular ridge (minimal bone available to support a denture)
* Patients with neurological conditions 
* Patients who have previously had partial [[glossectomy|glossectomies]], mandibular resection and/or motor nerve damage to the tongue
* Where dental implants are not feasible

== Advantages and Disadvantages ==
Advantages of constructing a denture within the neutral zone include:
* ''Improved stability and retention'' of complete dentures (particularly lower complete dentures)
* Correct positioning of posterior artificial teeth allows for ''sufficient tongue space''
* ''Reduced food trapping''
* ''Improved aesthetics'' due to facial support

Disadvantages include:
* Increased clinical time
* Increased laboratory costs

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3447">The '''Oculocardiac reflex''', also known as '''Aschner phenomenon''', '''Aschner reflex''', or '''Aschner-Dagnini reflex''', is a decrease in [[pulse rate]] associated with traction applied to [[extraocular muscles]] and/or compression of the [[human eyeball|eyeball]]. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the [[trigeminal cranial nerve]] via the [[ciliary ganglion]], and the [[vagus nerve]] of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. Nerve fibres  from the [[Maxillary nerve|maxillary]] and [[Mandibular nerve|mandibular divisions]] of the trigeminal nerve have also been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lang S, Lanigan D, van der Wal M | title = Trigeminocardiac reflexes: maxillary and mandibular variants of the oculocardiac reflex. | journal = Can J Anaesth | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 757–60 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1914059 | doi = 10.1007/BF03008454}}&lt;/ref&gt; These afferents synapse with the [[visceral motor nucleus]] of the vagus nerve, located in the [[reticular formation]] of the brain stem. The efferent portion is carried by the vagus nerve from the [[cardiovascular center]] of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] to the heart, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the [[sinoatrial node]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paton J, Boscan P, Pickering A, Nalivaiko E | title = The yin and yang of cardiac autonomic control: vago-sympathetic interactions revisited. | journal = Brain Res Brain Res Rev | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 555–65 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16269319 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflex is especially sensitive in [[neonates]] and children, particularly during [[Strabismus surgery|strabismus correction surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim H, Kim S, Kim C, Yum M | title = Prediction of the oculocardiac reflex from pre-operative linear and nonlinear heart rate dynamics in children. | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 55 | issue = 9 | pages = 847–52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10947746 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2044.2000.01158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this reflex may also occur with adults.  [[Bradycardia]], [[junctional rhythm]] and [[asystole]], all of which may be life-threatening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith R | title = Death and the oculocardiac reflex. | journal = Can J Anaesth | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 760 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7923532 | doi = 10.1007/BF03015643}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Treatment==

The reflex can be blocked by intravenous injection of an [[anti-muscarinic]] [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]], such as [[atropine]] or [[glycopyrrolate]].  If bradycardia does occur, removal of the stimulus is immediately indicated. This often results in the restoration of normal sinus rhythm of the heart. If not, the use of atropine or glycopyrrolate will usually be successful and permit continuation of the surgical procedure. In extreme cases, such as asystole, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] may be required.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Panacea''' (Greek ''Πανάκεια'', '''Panakeia''') was a [[goddess]] of universal remedy and the daughter of [[Asclepius]] and [[Epione]]. Panacea and her four sisters each performed a facet of [[Apollo]]'s art:&lt;ref name="edelstein"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Asclepius: Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies
|url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0801857694|isbn= 0801857694|pages= 87-89
|authors= Emma J. Edelstein, Ludwig Edelstein |year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Panacea (the goddess of universal health)
* [[Hygieia]] ("Hygieneswe"{{cn|date=July 2018}} the goddess/personification of health, cleanliness, and sanitation)
* [[Iaso]] (the goddess of recuperation from illness)
* [[Aceso]] (the goddess of the healing process)
* [[Aglaea|Aglæa/Ægle]] (the goddess of beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment)

Panacea also had four brothers—[[Podalirius|Podaleirus]], one of the two kings of [[Tricca]], who was skilled in [[diagnostics]], and [[Machaon (mythology)|Machaon]], the other king of Tricca, who was a master [[surgeon]] (these two took part in the [[Trojan War]] until Machaon was killed by [[Penthesilea]], queen of the Amazons); [[Telesphorus (mythology)|Telesphoros]], who devoted his life to serving [[Asclepius]]; and [[Aratus]], her half-brother, who was a Greek [[hero]] and the patron/liberator of [[Sicyon]].  However, portrayals of the family were not consistent; Panacea and her sisters each at times appear as Asclepius' wife instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Healing Dream and Ritual: Ancient Incubation and Modern Psychotherapy | publisher = Daimon Verlag | location = Einsiedeln
|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1700dNEm3-AC |isbn= 3856307273 | page = 34
|author= C. A. Meier|year= 2009 | quote = [...] Asclepius can hardly be thought of without his feminine companions, his wife and daughters. There were Epione (the gentle one), Hygeia, Panacea, Iaso, and others, each of whom was at times wife and at other times daughter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panacea may have been an independent goddess before being absorbed into the Asclepius myth.&lt;ref name="edelstein"/&gt;

Panacea traditionally had a [[poultice]] or [[potion]] with which she healed the sick.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} This brought about the concept of the [[Panacea (medicine) |panacea in medicine]], a substance meant to cure all diseases. The term is also used figuratively as meaning "Something used to solve all problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|panacea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panacea is mentioned at the opening of the [[Hippocratic Oath]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Oath|work= Loeb Classical Library|author= Hippocrates of Cos|url= https://www.loebclassics.com/view/hippocrates_cos-oath/1923/pb_LCL147.299.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ὄμνυμι Ἀπόλλωνα ἰητρὸν καὶ Ἀσκληπιὸν καὶ Ὑγείαν καὶ Πανάκειαν καὶ θεοὺς πάντας τε καὶ πάσας ἵστορας ποιεύμενος ἐπιτελέα ποιήσειν κατὰ δύναμιν καὶ κρίσιν ἐμὴν ὅρκον τόνδε καὶ ξυγγραφὴν τήνδε.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I swear, calling upon Apollo the physician and Asclepius, Hygeia and Panaceia and all the gods and goddesses as witnesses, that I will fulfill this oath and this contract according to my ability and judgment.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A river in [[Thrace]]/[[Moesia]] took its name from the goddess, and is still known in modern Bulgaria as the river [[Zlatna Panega (river)|Zlatna Panega]] ("Golden Panega", from Greek ''panakeia'').

'''Pneumatic fracturing''' is a method that has become very popular in the last ten years used to [[Environmental remediation|remediate]] contaminated sites. The method consists of injecting gas into a contaminated subsurface at a pressure higher than that of the gases that are present. By doing this fractures "spider-web" throughout the subsurface so that pumps may be placed in the ground to suck out the contaminated water through these cracks. Substrates may also be injected into the soil through the cracks to further the remediation of the soil and ground water. The clean-up technique was developed and patented through the research of various professors at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] in 1996 with hopes of cleaning up various [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) [[Superfund]] sites which are some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the country. The patent is held by John R. Schuring, PhD and PE, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]]. This method has been adopted by environmental contractors all over the country since it has been patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = US | number = 5560737 | status = patent | title = Pneumatic fracturing and multicomponent injection enhancement of in situ bioremediation | gdate = 1996-10-01 | fdate = 1995-08-15 | pridate =  | inventor = John R.

'''Prostate cancer screening''' is the [[screening (medicine)|screening]] process used to detect undiagnosed [[prostate cancer]] in those without [[Medical sign|signs]] or [[symptoms]].&lt;ref name=PDQ2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCI"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq | title=Prostate Cancer Screening-Professional Version |website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; When abnormal prostate tissue or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat and cure, but it is unclear if early detection reduces mortality rates.&lt;ref name="NCI" /&gt;

Screening precedes a diagnosis and subsequent treatment. The [[digital rectal examination]] (DRE) is one screening tool during which the prostate is manually assessed through the wall of the rectum. The second screening tool is the measurement of [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) in the [[blood]]. The evidence remains insufficient to determine whether screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or digital rectal exam (DRE) reduces mortality from prostate cancer.&lt;ref name="PDQ2018"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65945/|title=PDQ Cancer Information Summaries|last=PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board|date=2018|publisher=National Cancer Institute (US)|location=Bethesda (MD)|pmid=26389383}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review concluded PSA screening results in "no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality..." The American studies were determined to have a high bias. European studies included in this review were of low bias and one reported "a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality." PSA screening with DRE was not assessed in this review. DRE was not assessed separately.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Guidelines generally recommend that the decisions whether or not to screen be based on [[shared decision-making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostate Cancer Guidelines|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1967731-guidelines|website=Emedicine|access-date=18 February 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves men being informed of the risks and benefits of screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greene KL, Albertsen PC, Babaian RJ, Carter HB, Gann PH, Han M, Kuban DA, Sartor AO, Stanford JL, Zietman A, Carroll P | title = Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S2-S11 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23234625 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2012.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf AM, Wender RC, Etzioni RB, Thompson IM, D'Amico AV, Volk RJ, Brooks DD, Dash C, Guessous I, Andrews K, DeSantis C, Smith RA | title = American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 | journal = Ca | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 70–98 | date = Mar–Apr 2010 | pmid = 20200110 | doi = 10.3322/caac.20066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] recommends screening be discouraged in those who are expected to live less than ten years, while in those with a life expectancy of greater than ten years a decision should be made by the person in question. In general, they conclude that based on recent research, "it is uncertain whether the benefits associated with PSA testing for prostate cancer screening are worth the harms associated with screening and subsequent unnecessary treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Basch E, Oliver TK, Vickers A, Thompson I, Kantoff P, Parnes H, Loblaw DA, Roth B, Williams J, Nam RK | title = Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen testing: American Society of Clinical Oncology Provisional Clinical Opinion | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 24 | pages = 3020–5 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22802323 | pmc = 3776923 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.43.3441 | url = http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2012/07/16/JCO.2012.43.3441.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prostate-specific antigen ==
[[File:PSA KLK3 PDB 2ZCK.png|thumb|Prostate-specific antigen]]
[[Prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) is secreted by the [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] of the [[prostate]] gland and can be detected in a sample of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=American Society of Andrology Handbook | chapter=Chapter 8: What is the prostate and what is its function? | chapterurl = http://www.andrologysociety.com/resources/handbook/ch.8.asp | isbn=1-891276-02-6 | editor = Hellstrom WJG | year=1999 | publisher = American Society of Andrology | location = San Francisco}}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSA is present in small quantities in the [[Blood plasma|serum]] of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of [[prostate cancer]] or other prostate disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Catalona WJ, Richie JP, Ahmann FR, Hudson MA, Scardino PT, Flanigan RC, deKernion JB, Ratliff TL, Kavoussi LR, Dalkin BL | title = Comparison of digital rectal examination and serum prostate specific antigen in the early detection of prostate cancer: results of a multicenter clinical trial of 6,630 men | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 151 | issue = 5 | pages = 1283–90 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 7512659 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(17)35233-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PSA is not a unique indicator of prostate cancer, but may also detect [[prostatitis]] or [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]].&lt;ref name="pmid23708103"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velonas VM, Woo HH, dos Remedios CG, Assinder SJ | title = Current status of biomarkers for prostate cancer | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 11034–60 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23708103 | pmc = 3709717 | doi = 10.3390/ijms140611034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) draft reversed the prior opposition to PSA screening.&lt;ref name=Catalona2018/&gt; The draft recommendations suggest shared decision-making regarding screening in healthy males 55 to 69 years of age.&lt;ref name=Catalona2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Catalona WJ | title = Prostate Cancer Screening | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–214 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29406053 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcna.2017.11.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final recommendation for that age group states screening should only be done in those who wish it.&lt;ref name=Gross2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=David C.|last2=Curry|first2=Susan J.|last3=Owens|first3=Douglas K.|last4=[[Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo|Bibbins-Domingo]]|first4=Kirsten|last5=Caughey|first5=Aaron B.|last6=Davidson|first6=Karina W.|last7=Doubeni|first7=Chyke A.|last8=Ebell|first8=Mark|last9=Epling|first9=John W.|last10=Kemper|first10=Alex R.|last11=Krist|first11=Alex H.|last12=Kubik|first12=Martha|last13=Landefeld|first13=C.

Screening with PSA has been associated with a number of harms including [[over-diagnosis]], increased [[prostate biopsy]] with associated harms, increased anxiety, and unneeded treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Rosalyn W.|last2=Lizama|first2=Sergio|last3=Peairs|first3=Kimberly|last4=Sateia|first4=Heather F.|last5=Choi|first5=Youngjee|title=Screening for prostate cancer|journal=Seminars in Oncology|date=February 2017|volume=44|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1053/j.seminoncol.2017.02.001|pmid=28395763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, up to 25% of men diagnosed in their 70s or even 80s die of prostate cancer, ''if'' they have high-grade (i.e., aggressive) prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu-Yao GL, Albertsen PC, Moore DF, Shih W, Lin Y, DiPaola RS, Barry MJ, Zietman A, O'Leary M, Walker-Corkery E, Yao SL | title = Outcomes of localized prostate cancer following conservative management | journal = JAMA | volume = 302 | issue = 11 | pages = 1202–9 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19755699 | pmc = 2822438 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1348 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some argue against PSA testing for men who are too young, because too many men would have to be screened to find one cancer, and too many men would have treatment for cancer that would not progress. Low-risk prostate cancer does not always require immediate treatment, but may be amenable to active surveillance.&lt;ref name="Cooperberg MR 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooperberg MR, Carroll PR, Klotz L | title = Active surveillance for prostate cancer: progress and promise | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 27 | pages = 3669–76 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21825257 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.9738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A PSA test cannot 'prove' the existence of prostate cancer by itself; varying levels of the antigen can be due to other causes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Digital rectal examination ==
During a digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE), a healthcare provider slides a gloved finger into the [[rectum]] and presses on the prostate, to check its size and to check whether any lumps are present. If the examination suggests anomalies, a PSA test is performed. If an elevated PSA level is found, a follow-up test is then performed.&lt;ref name="NCI" /&gt;

A 2018 review recommended against primary care screening for prostate cancer with DRE due to the lack of evidence of the effectiveness of the practice.&lt;ref name=Naji2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naji|first1=Leen|last2=Randhawa|first2=Harkanwal|last3=Sohani|first3=Zahra|last4=Dennis|first4=Brittany|last5=Lautenbach|first5=Deanna|last6=Kavanagh|first6=Owen|last7=Bawor|first7=Monica|last8=Banfield|first8=Laura|last9=Profetto|first9=Jason|title=Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=The Annals of Family Medicine|date=12 March 2018|volume=16|issue=2|pages=149–154|doi=10.1370/afm.2205|url=http://www.annfammed.org/content/16/2/149.long |pmid=29531107|pmc=5847354}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Follow-up tests ==

=== Biopsy ===
[[Prostate biopsy|Prostate biopsies]] are considered the gold standard in detecting prostate cancer.&lt;ref name="Borghesi_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Infection is a possible risk.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; MRI guided techniques have improved the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Biopsies can be done through the [[Transrectal biopsy|rectum]] or [[Transurethral biopsy|penis]].

=== Ultrasound ===
[[Transrectal ultrasonography]] (TRUS) has the advantage of being fast and minimally invasive, and better than MRI for the evaluation of superficial tumor.&lt;ref name="NCI" /&gt; It also gives details about the layers of the rectal wall, accurate and useful for staging primary rectal cancer. While MRI is better in visualization of locally advanced and stenosing cancers, for staging perirectal lymph nodes, both TRUS and MRI are capable. TRUS has a small field of view, but 3D TRUS can improve the diagnosis of anorectal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim MJ | title = Transrectal ultrasonography of anorectal diseases: advantages and disadvantages | journal = Ultrasonography | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–31 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25492891 | pmc = 4282231 | doi = 10.14366/usg.14051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetic imaging ===
MRI imaging is used when screening suggests a malignancy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarkar S, Das S | title = A Review of Imaging Methods for Prostate Cancer Detection | journal = Biomedical Engineering and Computational Biology | volume = 7 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = 2016-03-02 | pmid = 26966397 | pmc = 4777886 | doi = 10.4137/BECB.S34255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model potentially minimizes unnecessary prostate biopsies while maximizing biopsy yield.{{dubious|date=March 2018}}{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Despite concerns about the cost of MRI scans, compared to the long-term cost burden of the PSA/TRUS biopsy-based standard of care, the imaging model has been found to be cost-effective.{{dubious|date=March 2018}}{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} MRI imaging can be used for patients who have had a previous negative biopsy but their PSA continues to increase.&lt;ref name=TurkbeyChoyke2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turkbey|first1=Baris|last2=Choyke|first2=Peter L.|title=Future Perspectives and Challenges of Prostate MR Imaging|journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America|volume=56|issue=2|year=2018|pages=327–337|issn=0033-8389|doi=10.1016/j.rcl.2017.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus has not been determined as to which of the MRI-targeted biopsy techniques is more useful.&lt;ref name=GigantiMoore2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giganti|first1=Francesco|last2=Moore|first2=Caroline M.|title=A critical comparison of techniques for MRI-targeted biopsy of the prostate|journal=Translational Andrology and Urology|volume=6|issue=3|year=2017|pages=432–443|issn=2223-4683|doi=10.21037/tau.2017.03.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other imaging ===

==Guidelines==
* In 2012 the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommended against prostate cancer screening using PSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Update Summary: Prostate Cancer: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/prostate-cancer-screening|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|access-date=2 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 a draft for new recommendations suggests that screening be individualized for those between the ages of 55 to 69. It notes a small potential decrease in the risk of dying from prostate cancer, but harm from overtreatment.&lt;ref name=USPSTF2018/&gt; In those over the age of 70, PSA based screening is still recommended against.&lt;ref name=USPSTF2018&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Page - USPSTF Draft Prostate Screening Recommendations|url=https://screeningforprostatecancer.org/|website=USPSTF Draft Prostate Screening Recommendations|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[American Cancer Society]] "recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf AM, Wender RC, Etzioni RB, Thompson IM, D'Amico AV, Volk RJ, Brooks DD, Dash C, Guessous I, Andrews K, DeSantis C, Smith RA | title = American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 | journal = Ca | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 70–98 | pmid = 20200110 | doi = 10.3322/caac.20066 | url = http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.3322%2Fcaac.20066 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other guidelines and centers specializing in treating prostate cancer recommend obtaining a PSA in all men at age 45.&lt;ref name=FleshnerCarlsson2016/&gt; This is based on emerging data indicating that an increased baseline PSA can be used to detect future significant disease.&lt;ref name=FleshnerCarlsson2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleshner|first1=Katherine|last2=Carlsson|first2=Sigrid V.|last3=Roobol|first3=Monique J.|title=The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA|journal=Nature Reviews Urology|volume=14|issue=1|year=2016|pages=26–37|issn=1759-4812|doi=10.1038/nrurol.2016.251|pmc=5341610|pmid=27995937}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The American Urological Association said in early 2009 that "The decision to screen is one that a man should make in conjunction with his physician, and should incorporate known prostate cancer risk factors, such as family history of prostate cancer, age, ethnicity/race, and whether or not a man has had a previous negative prostate biopsy. These factors are different for every man and, therefore, the benefits of screening should be considered in the broader perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auanet.org/content/press/press_releases/article.cfm?articleNo=106 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410034622/http://www.auanet.org/content/press/press_releases/article.cfm?articleNo=106 |archivedate=2009-04-10 |df= }} AUA statement March 2009 following publication of U.S. and European large scale screening effectiveness trial results&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUA Patient Guide 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/patient_guides/pc08.pdf|title=Prostate Cancer Patient Guide|author=[[American Urological Association|AUA]]|year=2008|work=AUA Patient Guidelines|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326103155/http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/patient_guides/pc08.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of 2018, the UK [[National Health Service]] did not offer general PSA screening, for similar reasons to those given above.  Individuals over the age of 50 who request it can normally obtain testing covered by the NHS.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostate cancer - PSA testing - NHS Choices|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-prostate/Pages/Prevention.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|language=en|date=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Canadian Urological Association in 2017 suggested screening be offered as a possibility to those who are expected to live more than 10 years, with the final decision based on shared decision making.&lt;ref name="RendonMason2017" /&gt; They recommend a starting age for most people at 50, and age 45 among those at high risk.&lt;ref name="RendonMason2017" /&gt; The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care in 2014 strongly recommended against screening in those under 55 and over 70 years of age.&lt;ref name=CMAJ2014/&gt; They weakly recommended against screening among those 55–69.&lt;ref name=CMAJ2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=N|last2=Connor Gorber|first2=S|last3=Shane|first3=A|last4=Joffres|first4=M|last5=Singh|first5=H|last6=Dickinson|first6=J|last7=Shaw|first7=E|last8=Dunfield|first8=L|last9=Tonelli|first9=M|last10=Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health|first10=Care.|title=Recommendations on screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; journal de l'Association medicale canadienne|date=4 November 2014|volume=186|issue=16|pages=1225–34|doi=10.1503/cmaj.140703|pmid=25349003|pmc=4216256}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some men have [[Germline mutation|germ-line mutations]] associated with prostate cancer development (e.g., [[BRCA1|BRCA]]1, [[BRCA2]], [[HOXB13]]). Screening and its frequency is established after consulting with a geneticist.&lt;ref name="RendonMason2017" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
From population screening to early diagnosis there is a lack of understanding.&lt;ref name=Sadi2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadi|first1=Marcus V.|title=PSA screening for prostate cancer|journal=Revista da Associação Médica Brasileira|volume=63|issue=8|year=2017|pages=722–725|issn=0104-4230|doi=10.1590/1806-9282.63.08.722|pmid=28977112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening for prostate cancer continues to generate debate by clinicians and broader lay audiences. Publications authored by governmental, non-governmental and medical organizations continue the debate and publish recommendations for screening.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilic D, Neuberger MM, Djulbegovic M, Dahm P | title = Screening for prostate cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD004720 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23440794 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd004720.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime but screening may result in the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashley VA, Joseph MB, Kamlesh KY, Shalini SY, Ashutosh KT, Joseph R | title = The Use of Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Screening and Treatment | journal = Reviews in Urology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–234 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29472826 | pmc = 5811879 | doi = 10.3909/riu0772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the death rates from prostate cancer continue to decline, 238,590 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013 while 29,720 died as a result. Death rates from prostate cancer have declined at a steady rate since 1992. Cancers of the prostate, lung and bronchus, and colorectum account for about 50% of all newly diagnosed cancers in men. Prostate cancer alone constitutes 28% cases in men. Screening for prostate cancer varies by state and indicates differences in the use of screening for prostate cancer as well as variations between locales. Out all cases of prostate cancer, African american men have an incidence of 62%. African American men are less likely to receive standard therapy for prostate cancer. This discrepancy may indicate that if they were to receive higher quality cancer treatment their survival rates would be similar to whites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siegel R, Naishadham D, Jemal A | title = Cancer statistics, 2013 | journal = Ca | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–30 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23335087 | doi = 10.3322/caac.21166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostate cancer is also extremely heterogeneous: many, perhaps most, prostate cancers are indolent and would never progress to a clinically meaningful stage if left undiagnosed and untreated during a man's lifetime. On the other hand, a subset are potentially lethal, and screening can identify some of these within a window of opportunity for cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esserman L, Shieh Y, Thompson I | title = Rethinking screening for breast cancer and prostate cancer | journal = JAMA | volume = 302 | issue = 15 | pages = 1685–92 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19843904 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept of PSA screening is advocated by some as a means of detecting ''high-risk'', potentially lethal prostate cancer, with the understanding that lower-risk disease, if discovered, often does not need treatment and may be amenable to active surveillance.&lt;ref name="Cooperberg MR 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll PR, Whitson JM, Cooperberg MR | title = Serum prostate-specific antigen for the early detection of prostate cancer: always, never, or only sometimes? | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–7 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21189396 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.5308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screening for prostate cancer is controversial because of cost and uncertain long-term benefits to patients.&lt;ref name="pmid8971068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins MM, Barry MJ | title = Controversies in prostate cancer screening. Analogies to the early lung cancer screening debate | journal = JAMA | volume = 276 | issue = 24 | pages = 1976–9 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8971068 | doi = 10.1001/jama.276.24.1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horan echos that sentiment in his book.&lt;ref name=Horan&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Horan|title=The Big Scare: The Business of Prostate Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlOUF4MpQ-8C|access-date=18 August 2013|date=August 2009|publisher=STERLINGHOUSE|isbn=978-1-58501-119-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private medical institutes, such as the [[Mayo Clinic]], likewise acknowledge that "organizations vary in their recommendations about who should – and who shouldn't – get a PSA screening test.  They conclude: "Ultimately, whether you should have a PSA test is something you'll have to decide after discussing it with your doctor, considering your risk factors and weighing your personal preferences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prostate-cancer/HQ01273 "Prostate cancer screening: Should you get a PSA test?"] MayoClinic.com, updated March 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in Europe resulted in only a small decline in death rates and concluded that 48 men would need to be treated to save one life. But of the 47 men who were treated, most would be unable to ever again function sexually and would require more frequent trips to the bathroom.&lt;ref name=Horan/&gt; Aggressive marketing of screening tests by drug companies has also generated controversy as has the advocacy of testing by the [[American Urological Association]].&lt;ref name="Horan" /&gt;

One commentator has observed: “[I]t is prudent only to use a single PSA determination as a baseline, with biopsy and cancer treatment reserved for those with significant PSA changes over time, or for those with clinical manifestations mandating immediate therapy..... absolute levels of PSA are rarely meaningful; it is the relative change in PSA levels over time that provides insight, but not definitive proof of a cancerous condition necessitating therapy.“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haythorn MR, Ablin RJ | title = Prostate-specific antigen testing across the spectrum of prostate cancer | journal = [[Biomarkers in Medicine]] | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 515–26 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21861672 | doi = 10.2217/bmm.11.53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Prostate cancer global epidemiology.png|600px|thumb|Global comparisons of prostate cancer screening]]
Screening of PSA began in the 1990s. In the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) initiated in the early 1990s, the researchers concluded that PSA-based screening did reduce the rate of death from prostate cancer but created a high risk of overdiagnosis, i.e., 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent just one death from prostate cancer within 9 years.&lt;ref name="Schröder, 1320"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schröder FH, Hugosson J, Roobol MJ, Tammela TL, Ciatto S, Nelen V, Kwiatkowski M, Lujan M, Lilja H, Zappa M, Denis LJ, Recker F, Berenguer A, Määttänen L, Bangma CH, Aus G, Villers A, Rebillard X, van der Kwast T, Blijenberg BG, Moss SM, de Koning HJ, Auvinen A | title = Screening and prostate-cancer mortality in a randomized European study | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 360 | issue = 13 | pages = 1320–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19297566 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0810084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the European Journal of Cancer (October 2009) documented that prostate cancer screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 37 percent. By utilizing a control group of men from Northern Ireland, where PSA screening is infrequent, the research showed this substantial reduction in prostate cancer deaths when compared to men who were PSA tested as part of the ERSPC study.&lt;ref name="Prostatecancer"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Leeuwen PJ, Connolly D, Gavin A, Roobol MJ, Black A, Bangma CH, Schröder FH | title = Prostate cancer mortality in screen and clinically detected prostate cancer: estimating the screening benefit | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 377–83 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19804966 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.09.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in 2009 found that over a 7 to 10-year period, "screening did not reduce the death rate in men 55 and over."&lt;ref name="Horan" /&gt; Former screening proponents, including some from Stanford University, have come out against routine testing. In February 2010, the [[American Cancer Society]] urged "more caution in using the test." And the [[American College of Preventive Medicine]] concluded that "there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening."&lt;ref name="Horan" /&gt;

A further study, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] Comparison Arm for ProtecT (CAP), as part of the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study, randomized [[Healthcare in the United Kingdom#GP|GP]] practices with 460,000 men aged 50–69 at centers in 9 cities in Britain from 2001–2005 to usual care or prostate cancer screening with PSA (biopsy if PSA ≥ 3).&lt;ref name="ProtecT"&gt;{{cite web |author=ProtecT |date=July 25, 2007 |title=ProtecT Study (Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) |publisher=[[University of Bristol|University of Bristol Dept. of Social Medicine]] |url=http://www.epi.bris.ac.uk/protect |access-date=2007-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028005357/http://www.epi.bris.ac.uk/protect/ |archive-date=2007-10-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;br&gt;

It was developed by [[Robert M. Koch]] in 1963 as an answer to the difficulties of using a [[feed conversion ratio]] to compare individual animals.&lt;ref name="Sainz"&gt;Sainz, Roberto D.; &amp; Paulino, Pedro V.(2004). [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9w93f7ks# Residual Feed Intake]. UC Davis: Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center&lt;/ref&gt; Effective use of RFI data can greatly improve [[beef cattle]] farm profits.&lt;ref name="Rauw2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.M. Herd|editor=Wendy M. Rauw|title=Resource Allocation Theory Applied to Farm Animal Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yiVFxaLP9eYC&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=10 July 2013|year=2009|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-436-1|pages=89–109|chapter=Residual Feed Intake}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is based on regression models developed  for determining efficiency of feed use for weight gain during a  standardized growth trial in growing beef cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connor|first=E. E.|date=2015-03-01|title=Invited review: Improving feed efficiency in dairy production: challenges and possibilities*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/animal/article/invited-review-improving-feed-efficiency-in-dairy-production-challenges-and-possibilities/7DF7969D091B945A64435DAAB79BFB31|journal=animal|volume=9|issue=3|pages=395–408|doi=10.1017/S1751731114002997|issn=1751-7311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inspired by Koch's observations of the differences in how a maintained body weight and an increasing body weight affect the feeding of cattle. His research suggested that feed intake could be broken into two parts:
# The expected feed intake for the animal's level of production.
# The residual portion between the amount of feed the animal is expected to eat, and what the animal actually eats.&lt;ref name="Rauw2009" /&gt;

Through the use of these two items, animals that deviate from the expected feed intake, either by eating more than or less than what's expected of them, can be identified and managed as the farmer sees fit. Because feed intake is [[heritable]], knowing the RFI index of an animal is also useful when breeding.&lt;ref name="Rauw2009" /&gt; By selecting animals with the aim to reduce RFI, farmers can breed animals that eat less but continue at the same rate of production.&lt;ref name="Sainz" /&gt; 

There is no [[phenotype]] link between RFI and the characteristics used to calculate expected feed intake, which allows for the comparison of animals who function at differing production numbers. This has led some authors to believe that RFI is representative of individual differences in the [[metabolic]] processes of the animals. For example, one study shows that the amount of feed a [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] bull requires to maintain a kilogram of body weight is closely related to genetic variation in its RFI. Similarly, in [[Layer_hen#Reared_for_eggs|laying hen]]s, variation in RFI is directly linked to variations in maintenance energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="Rauw2009" /&gt;

"Rick" Fraser''' (born February 13, 1972) is a Canadian politician who is an elected member to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] representing the [[electoral district]] of [[Calgary-South East]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/live-results-alberta-election-2012/article2405211/ Alberta Election 2012: Riding-by-riding results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424134137/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/live-results-alberta-election-2012/article2405211/ |date=2012-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/provincial-election-map/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]] MLA in 2012, Fraser initially joined the rest of the PC caucus in its merger with the [[Wildrose Party]] to form the [[United Conservative Party]] in 2017. He left the caucus on September 21, 2017 to sit as an Independent due to his dissatisfaction with the [[United Conservative Party leadership election, 2017|party's leadership contest]] and the emphasis put by candidates on spending cuts and austerity.&lt;ref&gt;http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/southeast-calgary-mla-rick-fraser-leaves-ucp-caucus-to-sit-as-independent&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser registered his candidacy for the [[Alberta Party leadership election, 2018|leadership]] of the [[Alberta Party]] on December 30, 2017. He officially announced his candidacy on January 9, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/calgary-mla-rick-fraser-alberta-party-1.4478352&lt;/ref&gt; and also joined the Alberta Party caucus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/mla-rick-fraser-joins-alberta-party-launches-bid-to-be-leader/article37544974/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Schisandra chinensis''''' (common name: '''magnolia-vine''', '''Chinese magnolia-vine''', '''schisandra'''),&lt;ref name="grin"/&gt; whose fruit is called '''magnolia berry'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/dining/notable-cookbooks-of-2011.html|title=The Year's Notable Cookbooks|last=Moskin|first=Julia|date=29 November 2011|last2=Fabricant|first2=Florence|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|last3=Wells|first3=Pete|last4=Fox|first4=Nick|access-date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''five-flavor-fruit'''&lt;ref name="grin"/&gt; (from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''wǔ wèi zi''), is a [[deciduous]] woody vine native to forests of Northern China and the Russian Far East. It is hardy in [[USDA plant hardiness zone|USDA Zone 4]]. The plant likes some shade with moist, well-drained soil. The species itself is [[dioecious]], thus flowers on a female plant will only produce fruit when fertilized with pollen from a male plant. However, a hybrid selection titled 'Eastern Prince' has perfect flowers and is self-fertile. Seedlings of 'Eastern Prince' are sometimes sold under the same name, but are typically single-sex plants.

==Growing information==
''Schisandra'' is native to northern and northeastern China ([[Manchuria]]). Cultivation requirements are thought to be similar to those of grapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bayflora.com/magnoliavine.html|title=Magnolia vine|publisher=Bay Flora|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants require conditions of moderate humidity and light, together with a wet, humus-rich soil.  Tens of tons of berries are used annually in Russia in [[Primorsky Krai]] and [[Khabarovsk Krai]] for the commercial manufacture of juices, wines, extracts, and sweets.

==Etymology==
Its Chinese name comes from the fact that its berries possess all five basic [[flavor]]s: salty, sweet, sour, pungent (spicy), and bitter. Sometimes, it is more specifically called ''běi wǔ wèi zi'' (literally "northern five-flavor berry") to distinguish it from another traditionally medicinal [[Schisandraceae|schisandraceous]] plant ''[[Kadsura japonica]]'' that grows only in [[subtropical]] areas. Another species of schisandra berry, ''[[Schisandra sphenanthera]]'', has a similar but different biochemical profile;  the [[Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Pharmacopeia]] distinguishes between ''S. chinensis'' (''běi wǔ wèi zi'') and  ''S. sphenanthera'' (''nan wǔ wèi zi'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TG8-4TJ1HM5-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F13%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1537610333&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5bbf9a7c33301a7c24291dde428ecbce&amp;searchtype=a Difference between Schisandra chinensis and Schisandra sphenanthera]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

Its [[Berry (botany)|berries]] are used in [[traditional medicine]], where it is considered one of the [[Chinese herbology#50 fundamental herbs|50 fundamental herbs]]. Chemical constituents include the [[lignan]]s [[schisandrin]], [[deoxyschisandrin]], [[gomisins]], and [[pregomisin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18849034|year=2009|author1=Lu|first1=Y|title=Analysis of Schisandra chinensis and Schisandra sphenanthera|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=1216|issue=11|pages=1980–90|last2=Chen|first2=D. F.|doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Korean language|Korean]], the berries are known as ''omija'' (hangul – five flavours). The cordial drink made from the berries is called ''[[omija-cha]]'', meaning "''omija'' tea"; see [[Korean tea]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], they are called ''gomishi''. The [[Ainu people]] used this plant, called ''repnihat'', as a remedy for colds and [[Motion sickness|sea-sickness]].&lt;ref name = Ainu&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |year=1893 |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan |publisher=R. Meiklejohn &amp; Co |volume=51 |issue= |pages=198–240 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in ''limonnik'' (''S. chinensis'') in Russia was associated with [[Ethnomedicine|ethnopharmacological]] investigations by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientists on berries and seeds.&lt;ref name=Panossian&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18515024|year=2008|author1=Panossian|first1=A|title=Pharmacology of Schisandra chinensis Bail.: An overview of Russian research and uses in medicine|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=118|issue=2|pages=183–212|last2=Wikman|first2=G|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2008.04.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
In 1998, Russia released a [[postage stamp]] depicting ''S. chinensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantstamps.net/stamps/russia/1998_Wild_Fruits/schisandra_chinensis_s.jpg|title=Russian stamp: ''Schisandra chinensis''|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are it |journal=Simulation in Healthcare : Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare |volume=1 Spec no. |issue= |pages=1–2 |year=2006 |pmid=19088564 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarvardHx&gt;{{cite web |title=History of medical simulation and the development of CMS |url=https://harvardmedsim.org/about-history.php |accessdate=2015-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society formally changed its name in February 2006 to the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) in an attempt to increase appeal to non-physician healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=Riley2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard H. Riley|title=Chapter 38: Society for Simulation in Healthcare by Raemer, Dan IN: Manual of Simulation in Healthcare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oABbAg2sjxYC&amp;pg=PA532|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920585-1|pages=532–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19088577&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raemer D |title=A new name |journal=Simulation in Healthcare : Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=63 |year=2006 |pmid=19088577 |doi= 10.1097/01.sih.0000244449.97799.dc|url=http://journals.lww.com/simulationinhealthcare/Fulltext/2006/00120/A_New_Name.1.aspx |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2006, membership in the organization was just over 1,500 people.&lt;ref name=pmid19088607&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinz E |title=2006 simulation summit |journal=Simulation in Healthcare : Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=33–8 |date=Spring 2007 |pmid=19088607 |doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e31803251cc |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership continued to steadily grow to be over 3,000 people by 2012.&lt;ref name=DTICa560817&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aberle, Kathryn B |title=The 12th Annual International meeting on Simulation Healthcare (IMSH) 2012 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a560817.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual meeting==
The first annual International Meeting on Medical Simulation (IMMS) was held in 1995.&lt;ref name=SSHhx&gt;{{cite web |title=About SSH |url=http://www.ssih.org/About-SSH |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSH has wholly supported the meeting since 2006.&lt;ref name=Riley2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSHhx/&gt; In 2007, the IMMS meeting was renamed to become International Meeting for Simulation in Healthcare (IMSH).&lt;ref name=Riley2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19088577/&gt;

==Simulation in Healthcare==
'''''Simulation in Healthcare''''' is the journal of the SSH. The journal was first published in January 2006 with Dr. David Gaba as the founding Editor in Chief.&lt;ref name=pmid19088564/&gt; The journal is published by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;ref name=pmid19088565&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raemer D |title=A letter from the president of the society for medical simulation |journal=Simulation in Healthcare : Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2006 |pmid=19088565 |doi= |url=http://journals.lww.com/simulationinhealthcare/Fulltext/2006/00010/A_Letter_from_the_President_of_the_Society_for.2.aspx |access-date=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSH was envisioned as an umbrella organization and the journal also serves as the official publication for other groups such as the Australian Society for Simulation in Healthcare.&lt;ref name=Riley2008/&gt;

The journal is indexed by [[National Library of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=EhrenwerthEisenkraft2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jan Ehrenwerth|author2=James B. Eisenkraft|author3=James Michael Berry|title=Anesthesia Equipment, Principles and Applications (Expert Consult: Online and Print),2: Anesthesia Equipment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePQf1wwFfQ4C&amp;pg=PA532|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-323-11237-4|pages=532–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SSH accreditation==
In 2010 the SSH Council for Accreditation of Healthcare Simulation Programs began an accreditation process for simulation centers to show that they are performing at the high standards recommended by the organization. In addition to university or hospital based education programs, the Clinical Simulation Program for the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) became the first medical association to become accredited by the SSH in 2013.&lt;ref name=ACCP2013&gt;{{cite web |title=ACCP First-Ever Medical Association to Receive Society for Simulation in Healthcare Accreditation for Its Clinical Simulation Program |date=2013-10-27 |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/accp-first-ever-medical-association-to-receive-society-for-simulation-in-healthcare-accreditation-for-its-clinical-simulation-program-2013-10-27 |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, there have been fifty-four programs in six countries have passed the accreditation process.&lt;ref name=SSHaccreditation&gt;{{cite web |title=SSH Accreditation of Healthcare Simulation Programs |url=http://www.ssih.org/Accreditation |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSH has also partnered with groups such as the Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE) in conducting these surveys.&lt;ref name=Schaivone2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schaivone, Kathy |year=2011 |title=Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) Accreditation Update |journal=Association of Standardized Patient Educators Newsletter |url=http://aspenews.org/2011/09/26/society-for-simulation-in-healthcare-ssh-accreditation-update/ |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
The need for a “uniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession” was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research.&lt;ref name=pmid20078756&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGaghie WC, Issenberg SB, Petrusa ER, Scalese RJ |title=A critical review of simulation-based medical education research: 2003-2009 |journal=Medical Education |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=50–63 |year=2010 |pmid=20078756 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03547.x |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03547.x |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need.&lt;ref name=StruijkASPE2013&gt;{{cite journal |author=Struijk, Jennie |title=Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE) – an update for ASPE |date=2013-04-11 |journal=Association of Standardized Patient Educators News |url=http://aspenews.org/2013/04/11/certified-healthcare-simulation-educator-chse-an-update-for-aspe/ |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2012 the final programs were in place.

The SSH Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE) program was established to provide “formal professional recognition of your specialized knowledge, skills, abilities and accomplishments in simulation education.”&lt;ref name=sshCHSEpage&gt;{{cite web |title=CHSE Certification |url=http://www.ssih.org/Certification/CHSE |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CHSE had been issued to 600 simulationists in 17 countries by 2015.&lt;ref name=Simonton2015&gt;{{cite web |author=Simonton, H |title=600 Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator Awarded |date=2015-08-31 |url=http://www.ssih.org/News/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1859/600-Certified-Healthcare-Simulation-Educator-Awarded |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]] cited CHSE as a recommended certification in their 2015 NCSBN Simulation Guidelines for Prelicensure Nursing Programs.&lt;ref name="NCSBNsimGuidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander M, Durham CF, Hooper JI, Jeffries PR, Goldman N, Kardong-Edgren S, Kesten KS, Spector N, Tagliareni E, Radtke B, Tillman C |author-link2=Carol Fowler Durham |title=NCSBN Simulation Guidelines for Prelicensure Nursing Programs. |journal=Journal of Nursing Regulation |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=39–42 |year=2015 |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/s2155-8256(15)30783-3|url=http://www.journalofnursingregulation.com/article/S2155-8256%2815%2930783-3/pdf |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CHSE-A (Advanced) certification was designed to further distinguish simulationists as a “simulation expert and leader in the field”.&lt;ref name="sshCHSEApage"&gt;{{cite web |title=CHSE-A Certification |url=http://www.ssih.org/Certification/CHSEA |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSH Certified Healthcare Simulation Operations Specialist (CHSOS) program was established to provide “an inclusive “umbrella” term that embodies many different roles within healthcare simulation operations, including simulation technician, simulation technology specialist, simulation specialist, simulation coordinator, simulation AV specialist, etc."&lt;ref name="sshCHSOSpage"&gt;{{cite web |title=CHSOS Certification |url=http://www.ssih.org/Certification/CHSOS |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supernumerary roots''' is a condition found in [[teeth]] there may be a larger number of roots than expected.  The most common teeth affected are [[human mandible|mandibular (lower)]] [[Canine tooth|canine]]s, [[premolar]]s, and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s, especially [[third molar]]s. Canines and most premolars, except for [[maxillary first premolar|maxillary (upper) first premolar]]s, usually have one root.  [[Maxilla]]ry first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots.  Maxillary molars usually have three roots.  When an extra root is found on any of these teeth, the root is described as a supernumerary root.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = ((Olga A.C.Ibsen)),(( Joan Andersen Phelan ))|title=Oral Pathology for the Dental Hygienist - Pageburst E-Book on Kno6: Oral Pathology for the Dental Hygienist - Pageburst E-Book on Kno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z95AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4557-7511-8|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trimmu Barrage''' is a [[barrage (dam)|barrage]] on the [[River Chenab]] in the [[Jhang District]] of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]]. It is situated downstream of the confluence of the [[River Jhelum]] and [[River Chenab]]. It is situated some 25&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[Jhang]] near the village of [[Atharan Hazari]] where the [[River Jhelum]] flows into the [[River Chenab]].

Trimmu Barrage is used to control water flow into the [[River Chenab]] for irrigation and flood control purposes.

Trimmu Barrage was constructed between 1937 and 1939 by English engineer. Its name was changed later.  Primarily as a flood control mechanism to protect the city of [[Jhang]] from floods. The arched grid iron's bridge section is integrated with several protective bands.

The '''Uganda Program on Cancer and Infectious Diseases''' (UPCID), established in 2004, is a joint program between Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in [[Seattle]] and the [[Uganda Cancer Institute]]. The program works to understand and treat infection-related cancers in the United States and abroad.

The UPCID Clinic and Training Center is located at [[Makerere University]] Medical School on the campus of Mulago Hospital in [[Kampala]], Uganda.

==Leadership collaboration==
The collaboration is co-led by Corey Casper, a physician-scientist at the Hutchinson Center and Jackson Orem, director of the Uganda Cancer Institute.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

==Funding==
In October 2009, the [[United States Agency for International Development]] awarded a US $500,000 grant to the Hutchinson Center to aid in the construction of the first United States cancer clinic and medical-training facility in Africa.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

The '''United States Ambassador to the United Nations''' is the leader of the U.S. delegation, the [[United States Mission to the United Nations|U.S. Mission]] to the [[United Nations]].  The position is more formally known as the "[[Permanent representative to the United Nations|Permanent Representative]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] to the [[United Nations]], with the rank and status of [[Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary]], and Representative of the United States of America in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council of the United Nations]]"; it is also known as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations.

The U.S. Permanent Representative, currently [[Nikki Haley]], is charged with representing the United States on the U.N. Security Council and during almost all plenary meetings of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], except in the rare situation in which a more senior officer of the United States (such as the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] or the [[President of the United States]]) is present. Like all [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States ambassadors]], he or she must be nominated by the U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] and [[advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

Many prominent U.S. politicians and diplomats have held the post, including [[Adlai Stevenson II]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], and [[Madeleine Albright]]. The Ambassador serves at the pleasure of the President, and is therefore appointed by the President. 

[[Nikki Haley]] was nominated for this position by President [[Donald Trump]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/34f36bf13474440babdb7078aee2d19b/ap-sources-trump-taps-gov-nikki-haley-ambassador-un#|title=Trump chooses women for Cabinet: Haley for UN, DeVos for Ed|newspaper=The Big Story|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was confirmed by the Senate. She assumed office upon presenting her credentials to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] on January 27, 2017, but tendered her resignation to President Trump on October 9, 2018, to be effective on December 31.


== Cabinet status ==
[[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], a leading moderate Republican who lost his seat in the [[United States Senate]] to [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[United States Senate elections, 1952|1952 elections]], was appointed ambassador to the United Nations in 1953 by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in gratitude for the defeated senator's role in the new president's defeat of conservative leader [[Robert A. Taft]] for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1952|1952 Republican nomination]] and subsequent service as his campaign manager in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|general election]]; Eisenhower raised the ambassadorship to [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet rank]] in order to give Lodge direct access to him without having to go through the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United States and the End of British Colonial Rule in Africa, 1941–1968|last=Hubbard|first=James P.|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7864-5952-0|location=Jefferson City, NC|pages=172|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ambassadorship continued to hold this status through the Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations but was removed from cabinet rank by [[George H. W. Bush]], who had previously held the position himself. It was restored under the [[Clinton administration]]. It was not a cabinet-level position under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] (from 2001 to 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97661695&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1003|title = U.N.

Retrieved 2017-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former UN Ambassador (and current [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]) [[John R. Bolton]] has publicly opposed the granting of cabinet-level status to the office, stating "One, it overstates the role and importance the U.N. should have in U.S. foreign policy, second, you shouldn't have two secretaries in the same department".

'''Vaccine-induced seropositivity''' or '''VISP''' is the phenomenon wherein a person who has received a [[vaccine]] against a disease would thereafter give a positive or reactive test result for having that disease when tested for it, despite not actually having the disease.  This happens because many vaccines encourage the body to produce [[antibodies]] against a particular disease, and [[blood tests]] often determine whether a person has those antibodies, regardless of whether they came from the infection or just a vaccination.

VISP is especially a concern in [[vaccine trials]] for [[HIV vaccine]] research because people who give a positive result in an [[HIV test]], even if that result is because of a vaccine and not because of an infection, may face [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|discrimination because of HIV infection]].

==HIV==
===Background===
In 1987 in America the first HIV vaccine was tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Trials of HIV Vaccines|url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/prevention/Pages/clinicalStudies.aspx|work=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   HIV vaccines have been tested continually worldwide since then, but thus far, no one has developed any vaccine which reduces a person's risk of contracting HIV if exposed to that virus.

Many HIV tests work not by checking a person's blood for HIV, but rather by determining whether the body's own antibodies against HIV are present in the blood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Most HIV vaccines are designed with the intent to promote the body's own production of antibodies which would combat HIV.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Regardless of whether they are effective at stimulating the production of antibodies which fight HIV, they usually do cause the body to produce antibodies which standard HIV tests recognize as the antibodies which an HIV positive person would produce in response to HIV infection.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A person who is HIV negative, and has received an HIV vaccine, and who then tests as positive in an HIV test is said to be positive because of VISP.

===Significance===
When an HIV-negative person exhibits VISP and gets an HIV-positive result from a test then that person may have difficulty [[blood donation|donating blood]] or negotiating for a [[life insurance]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Braeckel | first1 = E. | last2 = Koutsoukos | first2 = M. | last3 = Bourguignon | first3 = P. | last4 = Clement | first4 = F. D. R. | last5 = McNally | first5 = L. | last6 = Leroux-Roels | first6 = G. | doi = 10.1016/j.jcv.2011.01.003 | title = Vaccine-induced HIV seropositivity: A problem on the rise | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 334–337 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21300566| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1987 and 2003 the number of persons who received experimental HIV vaccinations was about 10,000, and this number was considered small.  The difficulties in determining the difference between antibodies produced by HIV infection and vaccine-induced antibodies were managed by individual vaccine research sites who had special capability to conduct additional laboratory testing on this small pool of vaccine recipients.  However, at this time two new studies, the [[STEP Study]] in the USA and the [[RV 144]] study in Thailand, greatly increased the number of people who received HIV vaccinations by another 4600 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ackers |first1=Marta-Louise |last2=Parekh |first2=Bharat |last3=Evans |first3=Thomas G. |last4=Berman |first4=Phillip |last5=Phillips |first5=Susan |last6=Allen |first6=Mary |year=2003 |title=Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Seropositivity among Uninfected HIV Vaccine Recipients |journal=[[The Journal of Infectious Diseases]] |volume=187 |issue=6 |pages=879–886 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |doi=10.1086/368169 |url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/187/6/879.short |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There came to be an increased need to raise awareness of VISP because more people were exhibiting it.

At the [[XVIII International AIDS Conference, 2010|2010 International AIDS conference]] presenters talked about the need for community healthcare providers to understand that if their patients have been in an HIV vaccine trial then their patients are likely to give a false positive HIV test result.&lt;ref name="2010conference"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/725432 |title=Antibodies Induced by HIV Vaccines May Give False-Positive HIV Test Results |first=Daniel M. |last=Keller |publisher=[[Medscape]] |work=medscape.com |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV VISP in developing countries===
HIV vaccine research happens worldwide to ensure that any vaccine which researchers develop could be used for people worldwide.  In [[developing countries]] with limited access to healthcare, the problems associated with VISP are a special concern.

Researchers from Africa, Asia, North America, and South America have said that getting local government and media support of the research is essential in addition to creating facilities for distinguishing between HIV positive individuals and individuals exhibiting VISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = P. | last2 = Bishaw | first2 = M. | last3 = Chesney | first3 = M.

People who participate in vaccine trials which test HIV vaccines may exhibit VISP for years or for the rest of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A study done on participants in the [[HIV Vaccine Trials Network]] HIV vaccination studies showed that among 2176 HIV negative participants who received a vaccine, 908 (42%) had VISP.  However, the occurrence of VISP varied depending on what kind of vaccine the participants received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=CJ |last1=Cooper |first2=B |last2=Metch |first3=J |last3=Dragavon |first4=RW |last4=Coombs |first5=LR |last5=Baden |date=21 July 2010 |title=Vaccine-induced HIV seropositivity/reactivity in noninfected HIV vaccine recipients. |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]] |volume=304 |issue=3 |pages=275–83 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |doi= 10.1001/jama.2010.926|pmc= 3086635|pmid=20639561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hepatitis B==
When a person gets a [[hepatitis B vaccine]] then the most common test for hepatitis B will show them to be positive.  The usual course of action in this case is to give the person a panel of tests for [[HBsAg]], [[anti-HBc]], and [[anti-HBs]] (hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B core, and anti-hepatitis B surface).  A person who has never been exposed to hepatitis B but has gotten the vaccine will be positive for anti-HBs but negative for the other two tests in the panel.  Other combinations of positive and negative in this test can mean other things, such as acute, chronic, or past infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index3.html#test |title=WHO &amp;#124; Hepatitis B |first= |last= |work=who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}} See the table "HBV serological markers in hepatitis patients"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other conditions==
VISP is not often a practical concern for other diseases because in most cases good vaccines already exist and most people who have access to healthcare receive them.  Also doctors do not routinely test people for recent infections with most diseases as they do for HIV.

Medical literature on VISP for most diseases is not widely available because there is little practical need for doing that research.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The '''World Association for Medical Law''' (WAML) was formally established in 1970. It is a not-for profit organization, and according to its statutes, its purpose is to encourage the study and discussion of problems concerning medical law, forensic and legal medicine and ethics, and their possible solution in ways that are beneficial to humanity and advancement of human rights. 
The aim of the WAML is to promote the study of the consequences in jurisprudence, legislation and ethics of developments in medicine, health care and related sciences.
Members of WAML are both individuals holding an academic degree and interested in the field and both local organizations and institutes dealing with medical law,bioethics and health law from different countries in the world.

== Medical Law==
Medical Law concerns the rights and duties of the health professions and is thus directly linked to professional liability and the field of [[Bioethics]]. [1] 
Some consider medical law a scientific discipline closely related to the advancement of health related technology over the last 60 years.{{Citation needed date=October 2017}} Others link this field mainly to [[malpractice]] claims.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} 
This growing field of academic research is also of very practical nature, as it pertains to real every-day situations in the hospital, in a clinical trial, and in many other health related settings. 
The development of the field of medical law led to the establishment of Courses on medical law in various law schools, dentistry schools, medical schools, nursing schools etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Also, some universities now offer [[LLM]] and even [[Doctor of Juridical Science|JSD]] or [[PhD]] specializing in [[health law and medical law]]. 
At same time, many countries have local organizations and associations of [[medical law]].

== Structure==

''' The Board of Governors''' (BoG) is a body of representatives from various countries. Each member of the BoG represents a different country and is elected at the General Assembly held during each World Congress.

''' The Council of Presidents''' (CoP) brings together leaders of national, regional and international organizations to exchange ideas and discuss issues that may prevail in a particular part of the world and for which others may be able to offer solution.

'''The Executive Committee''' (EC) is leading the association with the President, Vice president, Secretary General and Treasurer

==World Congresses==
Since its creation the WAML held 23 World Congresses for Medical Law, in various countries in the world, in 2107 World Congress was in Baku, Azerbaijan for the Golding Anniversary Meeting[3]. Future World congresses will be held in 2018 in Tel Aviv, Israel and 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.

== International Journal of Medicine and Law==
The journal (in-chief editor:Prof. Roy Beran)  is being published for over 30 years. It has published more than 2,000 articles, written by hundreds of experts from more than 100 countries around the  world. All publications go through a rigorous peer-review process and are handled by an elaborated editorial board.  The journal has been pronounced by the Kennedy Institute of Ethics as a "priority journal".[5]

In 2007, Iranian police launched a "Public security plan and Moralization Campaign". Many Iranian citizens including many women were arrested and questioned for "un-Islamic" behavior. 

In 2007 Zahra Bani Yaghoub was sitting on a park bench with her fiancé when Iranian police arrested the couple.
