The '''108th [[Grey Cup]]''' &lt;ref name=global-shawgreycupdeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaw, CFL announce Grey Cup sponsorship deal|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1988297/shaw-cfl-announce-grey-cup-sponsorship-deal/|accessdate=October 2, 2018|work=Global News|publisher=Shaw Media|date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be played to decide the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) championship for the [[2020 CFL season|2020 season]]. The game will be televised in [[Canada]] nationally on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Réseau des sports|RDS]].

==Date==
As speculated with the [[107th Grey Cup]], the date for this game could come much earlier than in previous years. Currently, the Grey Cup is played on the fourth or fifth Sunday of November, as has been the case since [[2007 CFL season|2007]]. During the CFL's State of the League address on November 24, 2017, League Commissioner [[Randy Ambrosie]] suggested that the league could potentially move the date to the third week of October.&lt;ref name="October"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Ottawa Sun| url=http://ottawasun.com/sports/football/cfl/grey-cup-in-october-tv-deal-with-nfl-cfl-commish-speaks | title=Grey Cup in October? NFL Network TV deal could follow for CFL | date=November 24, 2017 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would easily surpass the previous earliest date of November 16 (occurring in [[85th Grey Cup|1997]] and [[91st Grey Cup|2003]]). Reasons in favour of this were the weather being warmer in October as well as a potential television deal with the American-based [[NFL Network]].&lt;ref name="October"/&gt; The league's current American broadcasting agreement expires after the [[2018 CFL season]] and the season schedule is thought to be worked around this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawasun.com/sports/football/cfl/ottawa-redblacks/q-and-a-with-cfl-commissioner-randy-ambrosie-on-randys-road-trip|first=Tim|last=Baines|title=Q and A with CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie on Randy's Road Trip|work=Sun Media|date=February 2, 2018|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawasun.com/sports/football/cfl/grey-cup-in-october-tv-deal-with-nfl-cfl-commish-speaks|first=Tim|last=Baines|title=Grey Cup in October? NFL Network TV deal could follow for CFL|work=Sun Media|date=November 24, 2017|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons against would be the increased overlap of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] in May and June (since the season would also have to start one month earlier) as well as the CFL's playoffs overlapping [[Major League Baseball]]'s playoffs in October.&lt;ref name="October"/&gt; On November 23, 2018, Commissioner Ambrosie confirmed that the league schedule would start one week earlier, making the date for this year's game November 15, 2020.&lt;ref name="3Down State"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sportsnet State"/&gt;

==Host city==
As of August 2018, three teams were interested in submitting bids as the league met with representatives of those unnamed clubs in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="three bids"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Standard-Freeholder| url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/sports/football/cfl/edmonton-eskimos/cfl-taking-collaborative-approach-to-grey-cup-planning | title=CFL taking collaborative approach to Grey Cup planning | date=August 31, 2018 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the location of the meeting and their previously-stated desire to host, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] were speculated to be one of the teams.&lt;ref name="three bids"/&gt; The previous obstacle of the lawsuit over the construction of [[Tim Hortons Field]] was settled on May 31, 2018, which had prevented the Tiger-Cats from bidding on a Grey Cup game.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Global News| url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4245953/tim-hortons-field-stadium-lawsuit-officially-settled-says-hamilton-mayor/ | title=Tim Horton’s Field stadium lawsuit officially settled, says Hamilton mayor | date=May 31, 2018 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tiger-Cats had previously expressed interest in submitting a bid for the [[107th Grey Cup]] and with litigation cleared, they can move forward with bidding to host their first championship game since the [[84th Grey Cup]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="spec"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Hamilton Spectator| url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/7208036-no-grey-cup-bid-until-stadium-legal-issues-solved/ | title=No Grey Cup bid until stadium legal issues solved | date=March 24, 2017 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first club to openly confirm their plans to bid were the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]], as stated by the club's president and CEO, Craig Reynolds, on October 1, 2018.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Leader Post| url=https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-2020-grey-cup-bid-should-be-a-lock-but-then-what | title=Rob Vanstone: Saskatchewan Roughriders' 2020 Grey Cup bid should be a lock ... but then what? | date=October 1, 2018 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJME"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=CJME| url=https://www.cjme.com/2018/10/01/riders-confirm-plan-to-bid-on-2020-grey-cup | title=Riders confirm plan to bid on 2020 Grey Cup | date=October 1, 2018 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would coincide with the 110th anniversary of the club and would be the fourth time the game would be hosted in Saskatchewan, if successful.&lt;ref name="Riderville"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Riderville| url=https://www.riderville.com/2018/10/02/roughriders-want-stage-another-grey-cup/ | title=The Roughriders want to stage another Grey Cup | date=October 2, 2018 | accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roughriders' new facility, [[Mosaic Stadium]], opened in 2017 and the Roughriders last hosted the Grey Cup in [[101st Grey Cup|2013]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;

On November 4, 2018, it was reported that the [[Montreal Alouettes]] were preparing a bid to see [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] host the 2020 championship game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3downnation.com/2018/11/04/alouettes-to-make-bid-for-2020-grey-cup/|title=Alouettes to make bid for 2020 Grey Cup: report|publisher=3DownNation|date=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alouettes confirmed that they had representatives in Toronto on November 6, 2018 to make their presentation at the league head office to host the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MTLAlouettes/status/1059928412268056576|title=We're in Toronto today to bring the Grey Cup final back to the Olympic Stadium in 2020!|publisher=Montreal Alouettes|date=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was confirmed on November 13, 2018 that the Tiger-Cats were indeed making a bid for the game as team representatives made their presentation to the league head office in Toronto the week prior.&lt;ref name="Ticats confirmed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thespec.com/sports-story/9029887-ticats-one-of-three-in-running-to-host-2020-grey-cup-game/|title=Ticats one of three in running to host 2020 Grey Cup Game|publisher=Hamilton Spectator|date=November 13, 2018|author=Steven Milton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their Grey Cup festival concept included a downtown-centred event at venues like the Hamilton Convention Centre and Art Gallery of Hamilton. The Tiger-Cats' president of business operations, Matt Afinec, confirmed that the club had support from Hamilton's mayor, [[Fred Eisenberger]], and that three bids for the Grey Cup game had been made.&lt;ref name="Ticats confirmed"/&gt;

The CFL's Grey Cup director, Céline Séguin, had previously stated that the league would like to announce hosts sooner. With the [[107th Grey Cup|previous year's game]] being announced 19 months prior, this game could be declared much earlier.&lt;ref name="Séguin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/for-the-cfls-grey-cup-director-the-big-game-is-a-calling/article37086533/|title=For the CFL’s Grey Cup director, the big game is a calling|website=Theglobeandmail.com|date=November 24, 2017|accessdate=October 2, 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the Roughriders' press release, the announcement is expected later in 2018 (at most, 23 months prior).&lt;ref name="Riderville"/&gt;

==Trivia==
As part of an [[April Fools' Day]] joke in 2016, the league had announced that the 2020 Grey Cup would be hosted in a secret [[Arctic]] location on November 29, 2020.&lt;ref name="Arctic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2016/04/01/cfl-announces-2020-grey-cup-northern-grey-cup-ever/|title=CFL Announces 2020 Grey Cup to be Most Northern Grey Cup Ever!|website=cfl.ca|date=April 1, 2016|accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stadium would have been airlifted in by helicopter to seat 50,000 spectators in what would have been the most northern Grey Cup in history.&lt;ref name="Arctic"/&gt;

The '''Birgu polverista explosion''' was the accidental detonation of ammunition in the gunpowder magazine (polverista) of [[Birgu]] in the British [[Malta Protectorate]] on 18 July 1806. The explosion occurred due to negligence while transferring shells from the magazine, and it resulted in the detonation of {{convert|40000|lbs|abbr=on}} of gunpowder. It killed approximately 200 people, including British and Maltese military personnel and Maltese civilians from Birgu. Parts of the [[fortifications of Birgu|city's fortifications]], some naval stores, and many houses were destroyed, and the affected area became known as ''l-Imġarraf'' (Maltese for "the destroyed").

==Background==
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the main gunpowder store in Birgu was located in a [[casemate]] within the city walls, close to the ''Porta Marina''. This was an improvised measure; the casemate was not intended to be used as a gunpowder magazine, but such practice was common at the time. Gunpowder was also stored in casemates at other locations, such as [[Fort St. Angelo]], [[Fort Ricasoli]], and [[fortifications of Mdina|Mdina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2012|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2012|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birgu magazine was located close to civilian housing, and the residents had complained about the dangers before the explosion. Preparations had been made to find alternative sites but nothing had been done; the storerooms that were meant to store gunpowder were being used as barracks or military hospitals.&lt;ref name="maltaramc"/&gt;

The 1806 explosion was not the first time that a gunpowder disaster occurred in Malta. On 12 September 1634, a gunpowder factory in Valletta [[1634 Valletta explosion|blew up]], killing 22 people and causing severe damage to the [[Church of the Jesuits, Valletta|Church of the Jesuits]] and [[Old University Building, Valletta|the nearby college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2012|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1662, gunpowder that was stored in an [[bartizan|echaugette]] on one of Valletta's [[counterguard]]s exploded after being hit by lightning, but there were no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2012|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explosion==
In July 1806, British forces in Malta were preparing ammunition stocks to be sent to Sicily after ammunition there had run low, since it had been used to relieve the defending garrison of [[Gaeta]] which had been [[Siege of Gaeta (1806)|under siege]] by the French. On 18 July, a working party of 13 men commanded by garrison gunner Bdr. Anderson were preparing a consignment of shells from the Birgu magazine,&lt;ref name="maltaramc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explosion Polverista Vittoriosa |url=https://www.maltaramc.com/regsurg/rs1800_1809/rmo1806.html |website=Medical Officers of the Malta Garrison |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222050937/http://maltaramc.com/regsurg/rs1800_1809/rmo1806.html |archivedate=22 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was filled at full capacity with 370 barrels containing {{convert|40000|lbs|abbr=on}} of gunpowder, as well as 1,600 shells and grenades.&lt;ref name="spiteri-42"&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2012|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was using a metal chisel to remove the fuses from live shells, which was contrary to instructions, and this resulted in sparks which caused a massive explosion at 06:15. 

Anderson and the working party were killed immediately, as were three British soldiers of the [[39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot]] and 23 Maltese soldiers of the [[Maltese Provincial Battalions|2nd Provincial Battalion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maltese Provincial Battalions|url=http://maltaramc.com/regmltgar/1stprov.html|publisher=maltaramc.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203152832/http://maltaramc.com/regmltgar/1stprov.html|archivedate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 150&lt;ref name="vittoriosahistorica"/&gt; and 200 civilians from Birgu were also killed, and approximately 100 others were injured by falling debris.&lt;ref name="maltaramc"/&gt; The explosion frightened the inhabitants of Birgu, and it was also heard in the nearby cities of [[Senglea]] and [[Cospicua]], as well as in the surrounding villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bulletin, Volume 57, Issue 225 – Volume 58, Issue 232|date=2006|publisher=Military Historical Society (Great Britain)|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=dDNVAAAAYAAJ|page=147|ref=hv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was located within the city's fortifications, and a section of the walls "went up in the air" and left a large breach.&lt;ref name="bugeja-buhagiar-fiorini-1993"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bugeja|editor1-first=Lino|editor2-last=Buhagiar|editor2-first=Mario|editor3-last=Fiorini|editor3-first=Stanley|title=Birgu: A Maltese Maritime City|volume= 1|date=1993|publisher=Malta University Services|isbn=9789990944006|pages=159–160|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=YI7iAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city gate at the Porta Marina, a small bastion, and part of a curtain wall were all destroyed and were never rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birgu |url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1507.pdf |website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820074930/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1507.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2016 |date=28 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short stretch of stepped curtain wall leading down to Birgu Creek – Birgu |url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1517.pdf |website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819160212/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1517.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2016 |date=28 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Navy Store Houses were also damaged or destroyed during the explosion.&lt;ref name="maltaramc"/&gt; Birgu's cityscape was also altered by the explosion, since a large number of houses were destroyed or damaged by the explosion itself and by the rocks which fell from the bastions.&lt;ref name="bugeja-buhagiar-fiorini-1993"/&gt; Four hundred ninety-three people reported property losses due to the explosion.&lt;ref name="spiteri-42"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Many Maltese people were angered at the loss of lives caused by negligence on behalf of the military. Civil Commissioner [[Alexander Ball]] reported that:&lt;ref name="maltaramc"/&gt;
{{cquote|those Maltese who had already become disaffected with the Government, fanned the embers and fermented great agitation by magnifying the casualties and working upon the weakness and credibility of the lower ranks.|20px}}
Victims and their families were paid partial compensation, and Ball set up a committee overseeing aid distribution. He also urged the government to pay full compensation. This was initially denied, but eventually the poorer classes received a compensation equivalent to two thirds of their property which had been destroyed, while those of the upper classes received half of the value of their property. In 1811, £18,066.5s.10d{{efn|Comparing 19th-century costs and prices with those of the modern period is challenging. £18,066.5s.10d in 1811 could be equivalent to between £1.2 million and £78.4 million in 2016, depending on the price comparison used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Officer|first1=Lawrence H.|last2=Williamson|first2=Samuel H.|title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|website=MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was evenly distributed among those who had claimed damages.&lt;ref name="maltaramc"/&gt; A wine merchant named Woodhouse lost a large amount of wine and the government provided him with extensive storehouses at the former [[Slaves' Prison]] in Valletta as a compensation.&lt;ref name="maltaramc"/&gt;

A street close to where the explosion occurred is now known as ''Triq il-Vittmi tal-Porvlista'' (Maltese for "Polverista Victims Street"). The Vittoriosa Historical and Cultural Society installed a plaque at the St. Lawrence Cemetery on the 200th anniversary of the disaster in 2006, where most of the victims were buried.&lt;ref name="vittoriosahistorica"&gt;{{cite news|title=200th anniversary of the explosion at l-Imgarraf |url=http://www.vittoriosahistorica.org/news-2006-08.html#link_1 |work=Vittoriosa Historical &amp; Cultural Society |date=August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619083317/http://www.vittoriosahistorica.org/news-2006-08.html |archivedate=19 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 4 September 2000, a chartered [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft 200 Super King Air]] departed [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] for a flight to the mining town of [[Leonora, Western Australia|Leonora]], Western Australia. The aircraft crashed near [[Burketown]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] resulting in the deaths of all eight occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/03/23/1016843080716.html|title=The lonely end to a fateful trip|work=The Age|first=Steve|last=Pennells|date=24 March 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113024924/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/03/23/1016843080716.html|archivedate=13 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the flight, the aircraft climbed above its assigned altitude. When [[air traffic control]] (ATC) contacted the pilot, the pilot's speech had become significantly impaired and he was unable to respond to instructions. Three aircraft intercepted the Beechcraft but were unable to make radio contact. The aircraft continued flying on a straight heading for five hours before running out of fuel and crashing {{cvt|65|km|order=flip}} south-east of Burketown.&lt;ref name="peoples"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200009/05/eng20000905_49748.html "Plane Crashes in Australia, All Eight Aboard Dead", ''Peoples Daily'', 5 September 2000.

A subsequent investigation concluded that the pilot and passengers had become incapacitated and had been suffering from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], a lack of oxygen to the body, meaning the pilot would have been unable to operate the aircraft. Towards the end of the flight, the left engine began to be starved of fuel and the aircraft crashed into the ground. The accident report said that, due to extensive damage to the aircraft, investigators were unable to conclude if any of the eight aboard had used the oxygen system. The [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB) final report could not determine what incapacitated the occupants. A number of safety recommendations were made following the accident.&lt;ref name=ATSB29/&gt;

==Background==
The aircraft involved in the accident was a [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft 200 Super King Air]], [[aircraft registration|registration]] VH-SKC, [[serial number]] BB-47, manufactured in 1975. The aircraft had about 19,000 hours of service before the accident.&lt;ref name=ATSB4&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of air passed into the cabin is controlled by [[bleed air]] valves on the engines.&lt;ref name=ATSB6/&gt; The positions of the bleed air valves can be altered by the pilot.&lt;ref name=ATSB7&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the accident report, "The aircraft was not fitted with a high cabin altitude aural warning device, nor was it required to be."&lt;ref name=ATSB6&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was fitted with an [[emergency oxygen system]]&amp;mdash;an [[oxygen tank]] which could supply [[oxygen]] to the crew through two masks located in the cockpit and to passengers through masks which drop from the ceiling of the cabin.&lt;ref name=ATSB8&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accident investigators concluded the aircraft was airworthy at the time the accident occurred,&lt;ref name=ATSB11/&gt; and a pilot who flew the aircraft earlier in the day said the aircraft functioned normally.&lt;ref name=ATSB12&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; "The maintenance release was current and an examination of the aircraft’s maintenance records found no recurring maintenance problems that may have been factors in the accident," the accident report stated.&lt;ref name=ATSB11&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==

Five minutes later, at 1015, it was further cleared to its [[cruising altitude]] of FL250 ({{convert|25000|ft|m}}); with an instruction to be at FL160 by {{convert|36|nmi}} from Perth. The pilot acknowledged this transmission.&lt;ref name=ATSB1/&gt;

Five minutes later, at 1020, as the aircraft climbed through FL156 ({{convert|15600|ft|m}}) it was cleared to [[waypoint]] DEBRA. The pilot again acknowledged. At approximately 1033 the aircraft passed through its cleared level and at FL256 ({{convert|25600|ft|m}}) ATC asked the pilot to confirm his altitude. “Sierra Kilo Charlie–um–standby," the pilot said.&lt;ref name=ATSB1/&gt; This was the final spoken transmission from the aircraft, and its climb continued. According to the accident report, several open-microphone transmissions followed, with the sound of background noise from the engines, a person breathing, "one unintelligible syllable", and "two chime-like tones, similar to those generated by electronic devices."&lt;ref name=ATSB1/&gt; During this time ATC attempted to regain contact with the pilot. "Sierra Kilo Charlie Sierra Kilo Charlie, Melbourne Centre, if receiving this transmission squawk ident" the controller said at 1040.&lt;ref name=ATSB36&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; At 1041, the controller asked again, "Sierra Kilo Charlie, only receiving open mike from you. Would you contact me on one two five decimal two."&lt;ref name=ATSB37&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alice Springs ridge.jpeg|thumb|The aircraft was sighted by the two aircraft in the [[Northern Territory]], northwest of [[Alice Springs]]|alt=An expansive plain with a large mountainous ridge running through it along a curved line]]
The aircraft continued to climb and left radar coverage at 1102, passing FL325 ({{convert|32500|ft|m}}). Thirty-one minutes later, [[Search and rescue#Australia|Australian Search and Rescue]] asked the crew of a business jet to approach the Beechcraft. They reported that it was in level flight at FL343 ({{convert|34300|ft|m}}), and they could see no movement on the flight deck or in the cabin.&lt;ref name=ATSB1/&gt; However, the conditions made it difficult to observe closely.

Two other aircraft which were asked to monitor the Beechcraft intercepted it over the [[Northern Territory]], north-west of [[Alice Springs]]. The pilots reported that it was now in a steady descent, and both aircraft followed it as its [[airspeed]] increased. "Although its external lights were on, nothing could be seen inside the cabin" the accident report stated. "The crews of the chase aircraft attempted to contact the pilot of the Beechcraft by radio but they did not receive a response." At 1510, the aircraft turned left through 90 degrees as it descended through {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. About {{cvt|65|km|order=flip}} south-east of [[Burketown]], Queensland, it hit the ground and broke up.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian 'ghost flight' still a mystery|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2253039.stm|accessdate=8 January 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]|date=12 September 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223105348/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2253039.stm|archivedate=23 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATSB2/&gt; The pilot and seven passengers were killed.&lt;ref name=ATSB2&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The accident was investigated by the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] (ATSB), a federal body responsible for investigating transportation accidents in Australia.&lt;ref name=ATSBv&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; The final accident report was published in March 2001.&lt;ref name=ATSBii&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was unable to make a definitive conclusion as to the cause of the crash.&lt;ref name=ATSBvii&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found all those aboard the aircraft, including the pilot, had likely become incapacitated and begun suffering from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=ATSB26&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident report stated, "After the aircraft climbed above the assigned altitude of FL250, the speech and breathing patterns of the pilot, evidenced during the radio transmissions, displayed changes consistent with hypoxia."&lt;ref name=ATSB29&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators were, however, unable to conclusively dismiss toxic fumes as the cause.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=Inquest fails to solve mystery of 'ghost plane' that flew for six hours|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/inquest-fails-to-solve-mystery-of-ghost-plane-that-flew-for-six-hours-642638.html|accessdate=8 January 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=13 September 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110091522/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/inquest-fails-to-solve-mystery-of-ghost-plane-that-flew-for-six-hours-642638.html|archivedate=10 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The incapacitation of the pilot and passengers was probably due to hypobaric hypoxia because of the high cabin altitude and their not receiving supplemental oxygen" the report said, adding, "The reasons for the pilot and passengers not receiving supplemental oxygen [from the oxygen tank aboard the aircraft] could not be determined."&lt;ref name=ATSB29/&gt;

The ATSB found it likely that the autopilot was engaged and this caused the aircraft to fly on a straight heading; the vertical path of the aircraft indicated climb power had been set before the occupants of the aircraft were incapacitated. "The design of the aircraft systems were such that, with the autopilot engaged, the engines would continue to operate and the aircraft would continue to fly without human input until it was disrupted by other events, such as collision or fuel exhaustion," according to the accident report. It was suggested that, towards the end of the flight, the fuel tank for the left engine was almost empty. "The near exhaustion of fuel in the left wing tanks may have produced at least one, and probably several, momentary losses of left engine power shortly before all power was lost" the report said. "The aircraft yawed and rolled towards the left engine, as was observed shortly before the aircraft collided with the ground."&lt;ref name=ATSB25&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident report said due to the damage to the aircraft upon impact with the ground, investigators were unable to conclude if any of the eight aboard used the oxygen system. However, the report stated "The absence of a distress radio call, or an attempt to descend the aircraft, and the likelihood that the pilot did not don his oxygen mask, suggested that the pilot was unaware that the aircraft was unpressurised or depressurising."&lt;ref name="ATSB26"/&gt; The passengers, the report added, were also likely not wearing their oxygen masks, as there was no noise recorded on the ATC transmissions indicating they were attempting to assist the pilot.&lt;ref name=ATSB25/&gt;

Investigators were not able to determine what caused the depressurisation of the aircraft,&lt;ref name=ATSB29/&gt; but stated likely causes included either an incorrect switch selection due to [[pilot error]] or a mechanical failure in the aircraft pressurisation system.&lt;ref name=ATSB26/&gt; The air traffic control recordings suggested it was unlikely a [[rapid decompression]] had occurred. "During an explosive or rapid depressurisation of a pressurised aircraft, however, the noise, pressure changes, temperature changes and draughts within the cabin would have alerted the occupants that a substantial failure had occurred," the report added.&lt;ref name=ATSB26/&gt; The document listed the two main factors in the accident as,

{{Quotation|1. The aircraft was probably unpressurised for a significant part of its climb and cruise for undetermined reasons.&lt;br/&gt; 
2. The pilot and passengers were incapacitated, probably due to hypobaric hypoxia, because of the high cabin altitude and their not receiving supplemental oxygen.&lt;ref name=ATSB29/&gt;}}

==Aural warning==
In the aftermath of an incident in 1999 in which the pilot of a Beechcraft Super King Air suffered hypoxia, the ATSB published Report 199902928 and recommended an aural warning be fitted on the flight deck of all Australian Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft.&lt;ref name=ATSB27&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/1999/aair/aair199902928.aspx Investigation No. 199902928] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122140812/http://atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/1999/AAIR/aair199902928.aspx |date=22 January 2012 }} Australian Transport Safety Bureau, 7 February 2001.

In the aftermath of the Ghost Flight, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued a Discussion Paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casa.gov.au/newrules/parts/039/download/dp0102cs.pdf Discussion Paper DP 0102 CS - Proposal for Aural Warning to Operate With Cabin Altitude Alert Warning Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805164310/http://casa.gov.au/newrules/parts/039/download/dp0102cs.pdf |date=5 August 2008 }}, CASA, February 2001.

Retrieved on 2012-02-01&lt;/ref&gt; both proposing aural warning in the Beechcraft Super King Air and other pressurised aircraft. The outcome of consultation on the NPRM was that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority did not mandate aural warning of inadequate cabin pressure and this angered the families of some of the victims.&lt;ref name=ABC21503/&gt;  Instead, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority issued a notice to owners of pressurised aircraft registered in Australia recommending installation of an aural warning, but not making it mandatory. The notice said, "The benefit to your pilots and passengers lies in the reduction in risk of an uncommanded depressurisation leading to an incident or fatal accident. The benefit is much greater than the cost of purchase and installation of one of these low-cost systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation safety recommendations and advisory notices|url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/recommendations/2000/r20000288.aspx|publisher=[[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]|accessdate=8 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212161417/http://atsb.gov.au/publications/recommendations/2000/r20000288.aspx|archivedate=12 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coroner's inquest==
The West Australian Coroner, Mr. Alistair Hope, conducted an inquest into the deaths of the eight occupants of the aircraft.  The inquest determined that the deaths were accidental, but was unable to determine the cause of the crash.  The Coroner recommended an aural alarm system for pressurised aircraft, and a low-cost ''black box'' [[Flight data recorder|flight recorder]].&lt;ref name="abc-aus1"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s674866.htm Ian Townsend, "Coroner {{sic|critises}} ATSB following plane crash", ''ABC-PM'',12 September 2002. Retrieved 1 February 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208143632/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s674866.htm |date=8 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coroner was critical of the poor co-ordination between the ATSB, the Queensland Police and the [[Civil Aviation Safety Authority]] (CASA). He also criticised the ATSB for failing to take notes when interviewing witnesses, and for its poor presentation of evidence.&lt;ref name="abc-aus1"/&gt;

==Air traffic control==
When the air traffic controller responsible for the Beechcraft received the open-microphone transmissions, he alerted his supervisor that he was concerned the pilot could be suffering from hypoxia. The controller and his supervisor completed the standard checklist which, at the time, did not include a procedure to follow in the case of incapacitation or hypoxia. In the aftermath of the accident, the checklist was changed to "incorporate procedures to be followed by air traffic controllers, when a controller suspects that a pilot has been affected by hypoxia."&lt;ref name=ATSB12/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATSB13&gt;Australian Transport Safety Bureau 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Turkey relied heavily on [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] for [[economic growth]], with trade above 40% of GNP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13974.html |title=Turkey - Foreign Trade |publisher=Country-data.com |date=1964-12-01 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish government]] and banking systems lacked the financial means to support meaningful economic growth. The government was already running enormous [[budget deficit]]s, and one of the ways it managed to sustain these was by selling huge quantities of high-interest bonds to Turkish banks. Continuing inflation (likely a result of the enormous flow of foreign capital into Turkey) meant that the government could avoid defaulting on the bonds in the short term. As a consequence, Turkish banks came to rely on these [[High-yield debt|high-yield bonds]] as a primary investment.&lt;ref&gt;THE 2000-2001 FINANCIAL CRISIS IN TURKEY by Fatih Özatay and Güven Sak, Central Bank of Turkey and [[Ankara University]].August 2002 (revised)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political instability==
In March 1997 a Coalition was formed between the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]]'s [[Mesut Yılmaz]] and the [[True Path Party]]'s [[Tansu Çiller]]. The plan was for Yilmaz and Cillar to alternate the [[Prime minister|Prime Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;pp.169&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was much public distraction caused by leader of the [[Welfare Party]]  [[Necmettin Erbakan]]'s threats to investigate Cillar for corruption. Meanwhile, Erbakan, who had been excluded from the coalition, did everything he could to rally support for an Islamic NATO, and an Islamic version of [[European Union|the European Union]].

The Motherland Coalition collapsed in part because of Erbakan's widespread public support. Addition tensions wreaked havoc on the government. Yilmaz was forced to resign on June 6, 1996, with the government having lasted for only 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;pp.169&lt;/ref&gt; Erbakan became Prime Minister on June 29 as the head of a Welfare/True Path coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bohlen |first=Celestine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/09/world/islamic-secular-coalition-cabinet-is-approved-in-turkey.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/I/Islam |title=Islamic-Secular Coalition Cabinet Is Approved in Turkey |location=Turkey; |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1996-07-09 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The success of the new Welfare-Path Coalition was viewed with hostility by the military. Erbakan's explicitly Islamist policies resulted in a post modern coup in which the military forced Erbakan to yield power to Demirel who yielded to Yilmaz on June 19, 1997. The political fighting between Yilmaz and Cillar on one side, and Erbakan on the other would continue, making coalitions difficult to create. In addition, corruption was rampant at this time. People were highly disillusioned with their government. This lack of faith and efficacy would cause foreign nations to carefully examine any investment in Turkey.

==Foreign divestment==
The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) team in 1996 warned of an impending [[financial crisis]] because of the deficit, which soon came into being. Turkey's unstable political landscape led many foreign investors to divest from the country.  As [[Investment|foreign investors]] observed the political turmoil and the government's attempts to eliminate the budget deficit,&lt;ref&gt;THE 2000-2001 FINANCIAL CRISIS IN TURKEY by Fatih Özatay and Güven Sak, Central Bank of Turkey and Ankara University.August 2002 (revised)&lt;/ref&gt; they withdrew $70 billion worth of capital from the country in a matter of months. This left a vacuum of capital that Turkish banks were unable to alleviate because the government was no longer able to pay off its bonds. With no capital to speak of, the [[Economy of Turkey|Turkish economy]] slowed dramatically.

==Stabilization efforts==
In November 2000, the IMF provided Turkey with $11.4 billion in loans &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1057382.stm |title=BUSINESS &amp;#124; IMF agrees Turkish loans |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-12-06 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turkey sold many of its state-owned industries in an effort to balance the budget. In the case of [[Turkish Airlines]], advertisements were placed in newspapers to attract offers for a 51% stake in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1193128.stm |title=BUSINESS &amp;#124; Turkish air sell-off delayed |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-28 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 there was massive unemployment, a lack of medicine, tight credit, slow production to fight inflation and increasing taxes. Stabilisation efforts had yet to produce any meaningful effects, and the IMF loan was widely seen as insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;BEHIND THE 2000/2001 TURKISH CRISIS: Stability, Credibility, and Governance, for Whom? by Erinç Yeldan, [[Bilkent University]] Department of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crash==
On February 19, 2001, Prime Minister Ecevit emerged from a meeting with President Sezer saying, "This is a serious crisis."&lt;ref&gt;pp.176&lt;/ref&gt; This underscored financial and political instability and led to further panic in the markets. Stocks plummeted and the [[interest rate]] reached 3,000%. Large quantities of [[Turkish lira]] were exchanged for [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] or euro, causing the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish central bank]] to lose $5 billion of its reserves.

The crash triggered even more economic turmoil. In the first eight months of 2001, 14,875 jobs were lost, the dollar rose to 1,500,000 liras, and [[income inequality]] had risen from its already high level.&lt;ref&gt;pp.178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The crash was emblematic of the political and economic problems that had been wearing on Turkey for years. Confidence in the government had been eroded by corruption and the inability to form lasting coalitions. The [[stock market crash]] revealed Turkey's economic situation to be not only extremely fragile but also entirely dependent on foreign investment. Although not as significant as decreased foreign investment or the massive budget deficit, the crash highlights Turkey's recent political instability.

Critical interpretations look more fundamentally at the effects of the 2001 crisis on Turkish society and its post-1980s turn to neoliberalism. According to one journal article, the 2001 Turkish crisis and state-organised rescue served to preserve, renew, and intensify "the structurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of
finance-led neoliberal capitalism" in ways institutionally specific to Turkish society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marois|first1=Thomas|title=Emerging market bank rescues in an era of finance-led neoliberalism: A comparison of Mexico and Turkey|journal=Review of International Political Economy|date=May 2011|volume=18|issue=2|pages=168–196|doi=10.1080/09692290903475474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, as the widely reported protests sparked off by [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]'s self-immolation in [[Tunisia]] began to have a clear impact on the Tunisian government, a wave of [[self-immolation]]s swept [[Algeria]].  These individual acts of protest mostly took place in front of a government building following an unsuccessful approach to the authorities.  Four self-immolators have died of their burns so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/5671.html |title=Algeria: Third death by self-immolation |publisher=Ennahar Online |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204162256/http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/5671.html |archive-date=2011-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeune Afrique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20110212105526/algerie-pauvrete-tunisie-manifestationquatrieme-deces-par-immolation-en-algerie-a-la-veille-de-la-marche-du-12-fevrier.html |title=Jeune Afrique, 12/01/2011, Quatrième décès par immolation en Algérie, à la veille de la marche du 12 février |publisher=Jeune Afrique |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110215082132/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20110212105526/algerie-pauvrete-tunisie-manifestationquatrieme-deces-par-immolation-en-algerie-a-la-veille-de-la-marche-du-12-fevrier.html| archivedate= 15 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began on 12 January, when 26-year-old Mohamed Aouichia set himself on fire in [[Bordj Menaiel]] in the compound of the ''[[Districts of Algeria|daira]]'' building. He had been sharing a room of 30 square metres with seven other people, including his sister, since 2003; he had repeatedly approached local authorities to get on the social housing list and been rebuffed.&lt;ref name="courrierinternational1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2011/01/21/je-brule-donc-je-suis |title=Courrier International, 21/01/2011, '&amp;#39;Je brûle donc je suis'&amp;#39; |publisher=Courrierinternational.com |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124191523/http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2011/01/21/je-brule-donc-je-suis |archive-date=2011-01-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has so far survived.

On 13 January, [[Mohsen Bouterfif]], a 37-year-old father of two, set himself on fire.  He had gone with about twenty other youths to protest in front of the town hall of [[Boukhadra]] in Tebessa demanding jobs and houses, after the mayor refused to receive them.  According to one testimony, the mayor shouted to them: "If you have courage, do like Bouazizi did, set yourself on fire!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dna-algerie.com/politique/42-interieure/1210-le-maire-a-mohcin-bouterfif-l-si-tu-as-du-courage-fais-comme-bouazizi-immole-toi-par-le-feu-r.html|title= Le maire à Mohcin Bouterfif : " Si tu as du courage, fais comme Bouazizi, immole-toi par le feu "|access-date= 2011-02-17|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110128205205/http://dna-algerie.com/politique/42-interieure/1210-le-maire-a-mohcin-bouterfif-l-si-tu-as-du-courage-fais-comme-bouazizi-immole-toi-par-le-feu-r.html/|archive-date= 2011-01-28|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was reported on 16 January, and about 100 youths protested his death causing the provincial governor to sack the mayor.&lt;ref name="bouterfif_aljaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/20111162363063915.html|title=Algerian dies from self-immolation|access-date=2011-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217081340/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/20111162363063915.html|archive-date=2011-02-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, hospital staff the following day claimed he was still alive, though in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20110117084410/algerie-pauvrete-tunisie-mostaganemvague-de-tentatives-de-suicide-par-le-feu-en-algerie.html |title='&amp;#39;Vague de tentatives de suicide par le feu en Algérie'&amp;#39; |publisher=Jeune Afrique |date=2001-01-17 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040940/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20110117084410/algerie-pauvrete-tunisie-mostaganemvague-de-tentatives-de-suicide-par-le-feu-en-algerie.html |archive-date=2011-01-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Al Jazeera]] described the suicide as "echoing the [[Mohamed Bouazizi#Confiscation of wares and self-immolation|self-immolation]] that triggered the [[2010–2011 Tunisian protests|protests]] that toppled the leader of neighbouring Tunisia."&lt;ref name="bouterfif_aljaz" /&gt;  He finally died on 24 January at a hospital in Annaba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-01-25/content_1642189.html |title=Algeria reports 2nd death of self-immolation |author=Xinhua |date=2011-01-25 |work=[[China Daily]] |accessdate=2011-02-22 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These suicides were followed by dozens more attempted or successful self-immolations across the country, so far without triggering nationwide demonstrations, most of them after the Tunisian dictator [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] fled his country on 14 January; cases included:

After an hour of tense negotiations with an official, he let the children go and tried to set himself on fire; the onlookers managed to stop the fire and took him to hospital.  Reportedly, the immediate provocation was that his family's electricity had been left cut off by [[Sonelgaz]] even after he scraped together the money to pay the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elwatan.com/weekend/7jours/immolation-je-brule-donc-je-suis-21-01-2011-108133_178.php |work=El Watan |date=2011-01-21 |language=French |title=Immolation : Je brûle, donc je suis |access-date=2011-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124022317/http://www.elwatan.com//weekend//7jours//immolation-je-brule-donc-je-suis-21-01-2011-108133_178.php |archive-date=2011-01-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.liberte-algerie.com/edit.php?id=149427&amp;titre=Un%20p%E8re%20de%20famille%20tente%20de%20s%92immoler%20avec%20ses%20deux%20enfants |work=Liberté |date=2011-01-22 |title=Pour se plaindre de ses conditions de vie à M’Sila: Un père de famille tente de s’immoler avec ses deux enfants |language=French }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.elwatan.com/une/un-pere-et-ses-deux-enfants-tentent-de-s-immoler-a-m-sila-20-01-2011-108061_108.php |title=Un père et ses deux enfants tentent de s'immoler à M'sila ! |language=French |work=El Watan |date=2011-01-20 |access-date=2011-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123013239/http://www.elwatan.com/une/un-pere-et-ses-deux-enfants-tentent-de-s-immoler-a-m-sila-20-01-2011-108061_108.php |archive-date=2011-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not officially announced, it was virtually certain that Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan would host the event, but for unknown reasons the city withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&amp;Seq_Code=139981|title=FISU Proposes Seoul, Pyongyang Jointly Host 2021 Summer Universiade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interested Cities===

In March 2015, days after the closing ceremonies of [[2015 Winter Universiade]] FISU has been informed about the intention of [[Bucharest]], capital of [[Romania]] to make a bid for the 2021 Summer Universiade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/news/multisports/romania-will-prepare-a-bidding-dossier-for-the-2021-summer-universiade|title=Romania will prepare a bidding dossier for the 2021 Summer Universiade|work=fisu.net|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Bucharest wins the bidding process this will be the second time which the city will host the Summer Universiade. The first time was in [[1981 Summer Universiade|1981]].

====Cali, Colombia====
In July 2016, FISU has been informed about the intention of the city of [[Santiago de Cali]], [[Colombia]] interested in hosting the 2021 Summer Universiade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisu.net/news/multisports/cali-interested-in-hosting-the-su-in-2021|title=Cali interested in hosting the SU in 2021|work=fisu.net|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Cali wins,this will be the second South American city to host the Summer Universiade the first was [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]] in [[1963 Summer Universiade|1963]], the first since [[1979 Summer Universiade|1979]] to be held in Latin America, and the first since [[1993 Summer Universiade|1993]] to be held in the [[Americas]].

====Seoul, South Korea and Pyongyang, North Korea====
On October 4, 2018, it was announced by the mayor of Seoul that there were joint negotiations between the city, the capital of [[North Korea]], [[Pyongyang]] and FISU, so that both cities could host the Summer Universiade of 2021, the proposal would be that the opening ceremony would be held in Seoul, while the closure would be in Pyongyang. If the talks come to fruition, this will be the third time in history that the Summer Universiade would be held in South Korea, the first time was in [[2003 Summer Universiade|2003]] in [[Daegu]] and the second was in [[2015 Summer Universiade|2015]] in [[Gwangju]].The country also hosted the [[1997 Winter Universiade]],in [[Muju County]] and the [[Jeonju]] city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&amp;Seq_Code=139981|title=FISU Proposes Seoul, Pyongyang Jointly Host 2021 Summer Universiade}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be the first time in history that the two countries will host the Summer Universiade.
This has already happened at the [[2015 Winter Universiade]], when due to the extremely high risk of an environmental disaster, the Spanish city of Granada was unable to host the nordic skiing and biathlon events and they have been transferred to FISU approved to move the Nordic Skiing and Biathlon events to [[Štrbské Pleso]] and [[Osrblie]] in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name=FISUnews062514&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fisu.net/en/Slovak-Republic-Officially-Co-Host-of-2015-Winter-Universiade-3133.html?mbID=5880 | title = Slovak Republic Officially Co-Host of 2015 Winter Universiade | publisher = FISU | date = June 25, 2014 | accessdate = September 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Civil Wars of the Early Caliphates}}
'''ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Ashʿath''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن بن محمد بن الأشعث}}), commonly known as '''Ibn al-Ashʿath''' after his grandfather,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=233}} was a distinguished Arab nobleman and general under the early [[Umayyad Caliphate]], most notable for leading a failed rebellion against the Umayyad viceroy of the east, [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], in 700–703.

The scion of a distinguished family of the [[Kindah|Kindaite]] tribal nobility, he played a minor role in the [[Second Fitna]] (680–692) and then served as governor of [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]]. After the appointment of al-Hajjaj as [[List of Umayyad governors of Iraq|governor of Iraq]] and the eastern provinces of the Caliphate in 694, relations between the haughty and overbearing al-Hajjaj and the Iraqi nobility quickly became strained. Nevertheless, in 699 or 700, al-Hajjaj appointed Ibn al-Ash'ath as commander of a huge Iraqi army, the so-called "Peacock Army", to subdue the troublesome principality of [[Zabulistan]], whose ruler, the ''[[Zunbil|Zunbīl]]'', vigorously resisted Arab expansion. During the campaign, al-Hajjaj's overbearing behaviour caused  Ibn al-Ash'ath and the army to rebel. After patching up an agreement with the ''Zunbīl'', the army started on its march back to Iraq. On the way, a mutiny against al-Hajjaj developed into a full-fledged anti-Umayyad rebellion.

Al-Hajjaj initially retreated before the rebels' superior numbers, but quickly defeated and drove them out of [[Basra]]. Nevertheless, the rebels seized [[Kufa]], where supporters started flocking. The revolt gained widespread support among those who were discontented with the Umayyad regime, especially the religious scholars known as ''qurrāʾ'' ("[[Quran]] readers"). Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] tried to negotiate terms, including the dismissal of al-Hajjaj, but the hardliners among the rebel leadership pressured Ibn al-Ash'ath into rejecting the Caliph's terms. In the subsequent [[Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim]], the rebel army was decisively defeated by al-Hajjaj's Syrian troops. Al-Hajjaj pursued the survivors, who under Ibn al-Ash'ath fled to the east. Most of the rebels were captured by the governor of [[Khurasan]], while Ibn al-Ash'ath himself fled to Zabulistan. His fate is unclear, as some accounts hold that, after long pressure from al-Hajjaj to surrender him, the ''Zunbīl'' executed him, while most sources claim that he committed suicide to avoid being handed over to his enemies.

The suppression of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled the end of the power of the tribal nobility of Iraq, which henceforth came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops. Later revolts, under [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]], also failed, and it was not until the success of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] that the Syrian dominance of Iraq was broken.

== Life ==

=== Origin and early career ===
Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath was a descendant of a noble family from the [[Kindah|Kinda]] tribe in the [[Hadramawt]].{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} His grandfather Ma'dikarib, better known by his nickname "[[al-Ash'ath ibn Qays|al-Ash'ath]]" ("He with the dishevelled hair"), was an important chieftain who submitted to [[Muhammad]], but rebelled during the [[Ridda wars]]. Defeated, he was pardoned and married Caliph [[Abu Bakr]]'s sister. He went on to participate in the crucial battles of the early [[Muslim conquests]], [[Battle of Yarmouk|Yarmouk]] and [[Battle of Qadisiyya|Qadisiyya]], as well as in the [[Battle of Siffin]], where he was instrumental in forcing [[Ali]] to abandon his military advantage and submit to arbitration, and later led the Kindaite quarter in [[Kufa]], where he died in 661.{{sfn|Reckendorf|1960|pp=696–697}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=54, 56, 77–78}}{{sfn|Crone|1980|p=110}} His father [[Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath|Muhammad]] was far less distinguished, serving an unsuccessful tenure as governor of [[Tabaristan]], and becoming involved in the [[Second Fitna]] as a supporter of [[Ibn al-Zubayr]], being killed in 686/7 in the campaign that overthrew [[al-Mukhtar]]. Like his father at Siffin, he is denigrated by pro-[[Alid]] sources for his ambiguous role in the [[Battle of Karbala]] in 680, being held responsible for the arrests of [[Muslim ibn Aqil]] and [[Hani ibn Urwa]].{{sfn|Crone|1980|p=110}}{{sfn|Hawting|1993|pp=400–401}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's mother, Umm Amr, was the daughter of Sa'id ibn Qays al-Hamdani.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} He had four brothers, Ishaq, Qasim, Sabbah, and Isma'il, of whom the first three also fought in the campaigns in Tabaristan.{{sfn|Crone|1980|pp=110–111}}

According to [[al-Tabari]], the young Ibn al-Ash'ath accompanied his father and participated in his political activities: in 680 he revealed the hiding-place of Muslim ibn Aqil to the authorities, and he fought in the campaign against al-Mukhtar in which his father was killed, and reportedly executed (or persuaded [[Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr]] to execute) al-Mukhtar's captured followers in revenge.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} Ibn al-Ash'ath disappears from the record during the next few years, but after Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr was defeated and killed by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] in October 691, he, like other followers of Mu'sab, apparently went over to the Umayyads.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} In early 692, Abd al-Malik's brother [[Bishr ibn Marwan|Bishr]] put him in command of over 5,000 Kufans for a campaign against the [[Kharijites]] threatening [[al-Ahwaz]]. The Kharijites retreated before the far larger caliphal army, led by Khalid ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, and Ibn al-Ash'ath went on to take up the governorship of [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]].{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}}

=== Al-Hajjaj's appointment to Iraq ===
[[File:Caliphate 750.jpg|thumb|280px|alt=Old map of western Eurasia and northern Africa showing the expansion of the Caliphate from Arabia to cover most of the Middle East, with the Byzantine Empire outlined in green|The expansion of the Muslim Caliphate until 750, from [[William R.

In 694, Abd al-Malik appointed the trusted and capable [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] as the new [[List of Umayyad governors of Iraq|governor of Iraq]], a crucial post given the restiveness of the region towards Umayyad rule. In 697, his remit was expanded to cover the entirety of the eastern Caliphate, including [[Khurasan]] and [[Sistan]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=66}}

In 695, al-Hajjaj entrusted Ibn al-Ash'ath with 6,000 horsemen and the campaign against the Kharijite rebels under [[Shabib ibn Yazid ibn Nu'aym al-Shaybani]]. Although not large, this group benefited from Shabib's tactical skill and inflicted a number of defeats on Umayyad forces. Advised by the general al-Jazl Uthman ibn Sa'id, Ibn al-Ash'ath pursued the Kharijites but displayed great caution in order to avoid falling into a trap. As a result, the governor of [[al-Mada'in]], Uthman ibn Qatan, wrote to al-Hajjaj criticizing Ibn al-Ash'ath's leadership. Al-Hajjaj responded by giving command to Uthman, but when the latter attacked Shabib, the Umayyad army suffered a heavy defeat, losing around 900 men and fleeing to Kufa; Uthman himself was killed, while Ibn al-Ash'ath, who lost his horse, managed to escape with the help of a friend and reached Kufa after an eventful journey. There he remained in hiding until al-Hajjaj granted him pardon.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}}

Despite his setback, relations between Ibn al-Ash'ath and al-Hajjaj were friendly initially, and al-Hajjaj's son married one of Ibn al-Ash'ath's sisters.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} Gradually, however, the two men became estranged. The sources attribute this to Ibn al-Ash'ath's overweening pride as one of the foremost of the ''ashrāf'', the tribal nobility, and his aspirations to leadership: [[al-Mas'udi]] records that he adopted the title of ''Nāṣir al-muʾminīn'' ("Helper of the Faithful"), an implicit challenge to the Umayyads, who were implied to be false believers.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} In addition, he claimed to be the ''[[Qahtanite|Qaḥṭānī]]'', a [[Messianism|messianic]] figure in South Arab ([[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yamani]]) tribal tradition who was expected to raise them to domination.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's pretensions irked al-Hajjaj, whose hostile remarks—such as "Look how he walks! How I should like to cut off his head!"—were conveyed to Ibn al-Ash'ath and served to deepen their hostility to outright mutual hatred.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}} According to L. Veccia Vaglieri, however, these reports are more indicative of the Arabic sources' tendency to "explain historical events by incidents relating to persons", rather than the actual relationship between the two men, especially given the fact that Ibn al-Ash'ath faithfully served al-Hajjaj in a number of posts, culminating in his appointment to lead the "Peacock Army".{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=718}} Nevertheless, it is clear that al-Hajjaj quickly became unpopular among the Iraqis in general through a series of measures that, according to [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], "[seem] almost to have goaded the Iraqis into rebellion", such as the introduction of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syrian]] troops—the mainstay of the Umayyad dynasty—into Iraq, the use of Iraqi troops in the arduous and unrewarding campaigns against the Kharijites, and the reduction of the Iraqi troops' pay to a level below that of the Syrian troops.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=67}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=101}}

=== Sistan campaign and rebellion ===
In 698/9, the Umayyad governor of Sistan, [[Ubayd Allah ibn Abi Bakra]], suffered a severe defeat by the semi-independent ruler of [[Zabulistan]], known as the ''[[Zunbil|Zunbīl]]''. The ''Zunbīl'' drew the Arabs deep into his country and cut them off, so that they managed to extricate themselves only with great difficulty and after suffering many losses, particularly among the Kufan contingent.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=67}}{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=715}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=231–232}} In response, al-Hajjaj sent an Iraqi army to the east against the ''Zunbīl''. Whether due to the splendour of its equipment or as an allusion to the "proud and haughty manner of the Kufan soldiers and ''ashrāf'' who composed it" ([[G. R. Hawting]]), this army became known in history as the "Peacock Army". Two different generals were appointed by al-Hajjaj in succession to command it, before he appointed Ibn al-Ash'ath instead.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=67}}{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|pp=715–716}} In view of their bad relations, the sources report, the appointment came as a surprise to many; an uncle of Ibn al-Ash'ath even approached al-Hajjaj and suggested that his nephew might revolt, but al-Hajjaj did not rescind his appointment.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} Al-Tabari suggests that al-Hajjaj relied on the fear he inspired to keep Ibn al-Ash'ath in check; modern scholarship on the other hand holds that the portrayal of the great personal animosity between the two men is likely to be exaggerated.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=718}}

It is unclear whether Ibn al-Ash'ath himself had joined the army from the outset or whether, according to an alternative tradition, he had been sent to [[Kirman]] to punish a local leader who had refused to help the governors of Sistan and [[Sind]].{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} After taking up the leadership of the army, Ibn al-Ash'ath led it to Sistan, where he united the local troops with the "Peacock Army". He rejected a peace offer from the ''Zunbīl'' and—in marked contrast to his predecessor's direct assault—began a systematic campaign to first secure the lowlands surrounding the mountainous heart of the ''Zunbīl''{{'}}s kingdom: slowly and methodically, he captured the villages and fortresses one by one, installing garrisons in them and linking them with messengers. After accomplishing this task, he withdrew to [[Lashkar Gah|Bust]] to spend the winter of 699/700.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} Once al-Hajjaj received Ibn al-Ash'ath's messages informing him of the break in operations, however, he replied in what L. Veccia Vaglieri described as "a series of arrogant and offensive messages ordering him to penetrate into the heart of Zabulistan and there to fight the enemy to the death". Ibn al-Ash'ath called an assembly of the army's leadership, in which he informed them of al-Hajjaj's orders for an immediate advance and his decision to refuse to obey. He then went before the assembled troops and repeated al-Hajjaj's instructions, calling upon them to decide what should be done. The troops clearly resented "the prospect of a long and difficult campaign so far from Iraq" (Hawting), denounced al-Hajjaj, proclaiming him deposed, and swore allegiance to Ibn al-Ash'ath instead.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=67–68}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's brothers, however, as well as the governor of Khurasan, [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra]], refused to join the rebellion.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=234–235}} Ibn al-Ash'ath hastily concluded an agreement with the ''Zunbīl'', whereby if he was victorious in the coming conflict with al-Hajjaj, he would accord the ''Zunbīl'' generous treatment, while if he was defeated, the ''Zunbīl'' would provide refuge.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} With his rear secure, Ibn al-Ash'ath left representatives at Bust and [[Zaranj]], and his army set out on the return journey to Iraq, picking up more soldiers from Kufa and Basra, who were stationed as garrisons, along the way.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=234}} By the time the army reached [[Fars province|Fars]], it had become clear that deposing al-Hajjaj could not be done without deposing Caliph Abd al-Malik as well, and the revolt evolved from a mutiny into a full-blown anti-Umayyad uprising, with the troops renewing their oath to Ibn al-Ash'ath.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=234}}

The reasons for the rebellion have been the source of much discussion and theories among modern scholars. Moving away from the personal relationship between al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath, [[Alfred von Kremer]] suggested that the rebellion was linked with the efforts of the non-Arab converts to Islam (the ''[[mawali|mawālī]]'') to secure equal rights with the Arab Muslims. [[Julius Wellhausen]] rejected this view as the main source of the revolt, seeing it instead as a reaction of the Iraqis in general and the ''ashrāf'' in particular against the Syrian regime of the Umayyads as represented by the overbearing (and notably low-born) al-Hajjaj.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=718}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=243–249}} Other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of the tribal factionalism between the northern Arab and southern Arab ("Yamani") tribal groups prevalent at the time.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=69}} Thus a poem by a certain A'sha Hamdan in celebration of the rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of the rebel troops: al-Hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a "friend of the devil", while Ibn al-Ash'ath is portrayed as the champion of the Yamani Qahtani and [[Banu Hamdan|Hamdani]] tribes against the northern Arab [[Ma'add]]is and [[Thaqafi]]s.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} On the other hand, as Hawting points out, this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to the revolt: if Ibn al-Ash'ath's movement was indeed led largely by Yamanis, this simply reflects the fact that they were the dominant element in Kufa, and while al-Hajjaj himself was a northerner, his main commander was a southerner.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=69}} Wellhausen's analysis, furthermore, ignored the evident religious dimension of the revolt, especially the participation of the fanatical zealots known as ''qurrāʾ'' ("[[Quran]] readers"). While the "religious polemic used by both sides [..] is stereotyped, unspecific and to be found in other contexts", according to Hawting, there do appear to have been specific religious grievances, notably the accusation that the Umayyads were neglecting the ritual prayer. It seems that the revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of the troops, but, at least by the time the army reached Fars, a religious element had emerged, represented by the ''qurrāʾ''. Given the close "interaction of religion and politics in early Muslim society" (Hawting), the religious element quickly became dominant, as seen by the difference between the oath of allegiance (''[[bay'ah|bayʿa]]'') sworn at the beginning of the revolt and that exchanged between the army and Ibn al-Ash'ath at [[Istakhr]] in Fars. While in the first Ibn al-Ash'ath declared as his intention to "depose al-Hajjaj, the enemy of God", in the latter, he exhorted his men to "[defend] the Book of God and the [[Sunnah|Sunna]] of His Prophet, to depose the ''[[imam|imāms]]'' of error, to fight against those who regard [the blood of [[Alids|the Prophet’s kin]]] as licit".{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=718}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=68, 69–70}} Although Ibn al-Ash'ath remained as the head of the uprising, Veccia Vaglieri writes that after this point "one has the impression that [...] the control of the revolt slipped from his hands", or that, as Wellhausen comments, "he was urged on in spite of himself, and even if he would, could not have banished the spirits which he had called up. It was as if an avalanche came rushing down sweeping every thing before it".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=234}}{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=718}}

This interpretation is corroborated by the different rhetoric and actions of Ibn al-Ash'ath and his followers, as reported in the sources: the former was ready and willing to compromise with the Umayyads, and continued to fight only because he had no alternative, while the great mass of his followers, motivated by discontent against the Umayyad regime couched in religious terms, were far more uncompromising and willing to carry on the struggle until death.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|pp=718–719}} Al-Hajjaj himself seems to have been aware of the distinction: in suppressing the revolt, he pardoned the [[Quraysh]], the Syrians, and many of the other Arab clans, but executed tens of thousands among the ''mawālī'' and the [[Zutt]] of the [[Mesopotamian Marshes]], who had sided with the rebels.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=719}}

=== Fight for control of Iraq ===
[[File:Iraq ca. 875.svg|thumb|right|280px|alt=Geophysical map of lower Iraq, with the main settlements and provinces denoted|Map of Iraq ([[Lower Mesopotamia]]) in the early Islamic period]]
Informed of the revolt, al-Hajjaj requested reinforcements from the Caliph, but was unable to stop the advance of the rebel army, which is reported to have numbered 33,000 cavalry and 120,000 infantry. On 24 or 25 January 701, Ibn al-Ash'ath overwhelmed al-Hajjaj's advance guard at [[Tustar]]. At the news of this defeat, al-Hajjaj withdrew to [[Basra]] and then, as he could not possibly hold the city, left it as well for nearby al-Zawiya.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} Ibn al-Ash'ath entered Basra on 13 February 701. Over the next month, a series of skirmishes were fought between the forces of Ibn al-Ash'ath and al-Hajjaj, in which the former generally held the upper hand. Finally, in early March, the two armies met for a pitched battle. Ibn al-Ash'ath initially prevailed, but in the end al-Hajjaj's Syrians, under Sufyan ibn Abrad, carried off a victory. Many rebels fell, especially among the ''qurrāʾ'', forcing Ibn al-Ash'ath to withdraw to Kufa, taking with him the Kufan troops and the élite of the Basran cavalry.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=235–236}} At Kufa, Ibn al-Ash'ath found the citadel occupied by Matar ibn Najiya, an officer from al-Mada'in, and was forced to take it by assault.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=236}}

His lieutenant at Basra, the [[Banu Hashim|Hashimi]] Abd al-Rahman ibn Abbas, tried but was unable to hold the city, as the populace opened the gates in exchange for a pardon after a few days. Abd al-Rahman too withdrew with as many Basrans as would follow him to Kufa, where Ibn al-Ash'ath's forces swelled further with the arrival of large numbers of anti-Umayyad volunteers.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=716}} After taking control of Basra—and executing some 11,000 of its people, despite his pledge of pardon—al-Hajjaj marched on Kufa in April 701. His army was harassed by Ibn al-Ash'ath's cavalry, but reached the environs of the city and set up camp at [[Dayr Qurra]], on the right bank of the [[Euphrates]] so as to secure his lines of communication with Syria. In response Ibn al-Ash'ath left Kufa and with an army reportedly 200,000 strong approached al-Hajjaj's army and set up camp at Dayr al-Jamajim. Both armies fortified their camps by digging trenches and, as before, engaged in skirmishes. Whatever the true numbers of Ibn al-Ash'ath's force, al-Hajjaj was in a difficult position: his army was considerably outnumbered by the rebels, although reinforcements from Syria were constantly arriving, and his position was difficult to resupply with provisions.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|pp=716–717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=236–237}}

In the meantime, Ibn al-Ash'ath's progress had sufficiently alarmed the Umayyad court that they sought a negotiated settlement, despite the contrary advice of al-Hajjaj. Caliph Abd al-Malik sent his brother [[Muhammad ibn Marwan|Muhammad]] and son [[Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik|Abdallah]] as envoys, proposing the dismissal of al-Hajjaj, the appointment of Ibn al-Ash'ath as governor over one of the Iraqi towns, and a raise in the Iraqis' pay so that they received the same amount as the Syrians. Ibn al-Ash'ath was inclined to accept, but the more radical of his followers, especially the ''qurrāʾ'', refused, believing that the offered terms revealed the government's weakness, and pushed for outright victory.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=101}}{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=237}} With the negotiations failing, the two armies continued to skirmish—the sources report that the skirmishing lasted for 100 days with 48 engagements. This lasted until September, when the two armies [[Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim|met in battle]]. Again Ibn al-Ash'ath initially held the upper hand, but the Syrians prevailed in the end: shortly before the sun set, Ibn al-Ash'ath's men broke and scattered. Failing to rally his troops, Ibn al-Ash'ath with a handful of followers fled to Kufa, where he took farewell of his family.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=237–238}} As Hawting comments, the contrast "between the discipline and organisation of the Umayyads and their largely Syrian support and the lack of these qualities among their opponents in spite of, or perhaps rather because of, the more righteous and religious flavour of the opposition" is a recurring pattern in the civil wars of the period.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=68–69}}

Victorious, al-Hajjaj entered Kufa, where he tried and executed many rebels, but also pardoned those who submitted after admitting that through revolt they had become infidels.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=69}} In the meantime, however, one of Ibn al-Ash'ath's supporters, Ubayd Allah ibn Samura, had recaptured Basra, to where Ibn al-Ash'ath now headed; and another, Muhammad ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, had captured al-Mada'in. Al-Hajjaj remained for a month in Kufa, before setting out to meet Ibn al-Ash'ath. The two armies met at Maskin on the river Dujayl. After two weeks of skirmishing, al-Hajjaj delivered the final blow by launching a simultaneous attack on the rebel camp from two sides: while he with the main part of his army attacked from one side, a portion of his army, guided by a shepherd, crossed the marshes and launched itself on the camp from the rear. Caught by surprise, the rebel army was nearly annihilated, with many rebels drowning in the river in their attempt to flee.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=238–239}}

=== Flight east and death ===
Following this renewed defeat, Ibn al-Ash'ath  fled east, towards Sistan, with a few survivors. Al-Hajjaj sent troops under Umara ibn al-Tamim al-Lakhmi to intercept them. Umara caught up with them twice, at Sus and Sabur, but Ibn al-Ash'ath and his men managed to fight through to Kirman and thence to Sistan.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=239}} There he was refused entry into Zaranj by his own agent (''ʿāmil''), and was then arrested by the ''ʿāmil'' of Bust. The ''Zunbīl'' however, true to his word, came to Bust and forced Ibn al-Ash'ath's release, taking him with him to Zabulistan and treating him with much honour.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=239}} There, Ibn al-Ash'ath assumed command of some 60,000 supporters who had assembled there in the meantime. With their support, he seized Zaranj, where he punished the ''ʿāmil''. Faced with the approach of the Umayyad troops under Umara ibn al-Tamim, however, most of Ibn al-Ash'ath's followers urged him to go to Khurasan, where they would be hopefully able to recruit more followers, and sit out the Umayyad attacks until either al-Hajjaj or Caliph Abd al-Malik died and the political situation changed. Ibn al-Ash'ath bowed to their pressure, but after a group of 2,000 men defected, he returned to Zabulistan with those who would follow him there.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=239–240}} Most of the rebels remained in Khurasan, choosing Abd al-Rahman ibn Abbas as their leader. They were soon confronted and defeated by the local governor, [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]]. Yazid released those who belonged to the Yamani tribes related to his own, and sent the rest to al-Hajjaj, who executed most of them.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=240}} In the meantime, Umara quickly effected the surrender of Sistan, by offering lenient terms to the garrisons if they surrendered without struggle.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=240}}

Ibn al-Ash'ath remained safe under the protection of the ''Zunbīl'', but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the ''Zunbīl'', mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the ''Zunbīl'' gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=240–241}} Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the ''Zunbīl'' himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at [[Rukhkhaj]] in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself from the top of the castle (along with his warden) to his death.{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1971|p=717}}

== Aftermath ==
The failure of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt led to the tightening of Umayyad control over Iraq. Al-Hajjaj founded a permanent garrison for the Syrian troops at [[Wasit]], situated between Basra and Kufa, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=102}} This was coupled with a reform of the salary (''ʿaṭāʾ'') system by al-Hajjaj: whereas hitherto the salary had been calculated based on the role of one's ancestors in the early Muslim conquests, it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns. As most of the army was now composed of Syrians, this measure gravely injured the interests of the Iraqis, who regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=102}} In addition, extensive land reclamation and irrigation works were undertaken in lower Iraq (the [[Sawad]]), but this was limited mostly to around Wasit, and the proceeds went to the Umayyads and their clients, not the Iraqi nobility. As a result, the political power of the once mighty Kufan élites was soon broken.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=102–103}}

It was not until 720 that the Iraqis rebelled once again, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, "the last of the old-style Iraqi champions" (Hugh Kennedy), and even then, support was ambivalent, and the revolt was defeated.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=107–108}} Two of Ibn al-Ash'ath's nephews, Muhammad ibn Ishaq and Uthman ibn Ishaq, supported the rebellion, but most remained quiescent and content with their role as local dignitaries. A few held posts in Kufa under the early [[Abbasids]]. Perhaps the most famous of the family's later members is the philosopher [[al-Kindi]].{{sfn|Crone|1980|p=111}} Another uprising, that of [[Zayd ibn Ali]], [[Zaydi Revolt|broke out in 740]], again promising to right injustices (restoration of the ''ʿaṭāʾ'', distribution of the revenue from the Sawad, an end to distant campaigns) and to restore rule according to the Quran and the Sunna. Once more, however, the Kufans deserted it at the critical moment, and it was defeated by the Umayyads.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=111–112}} Discontent with the Umayyad government continued to simmer, and during the [[Abbasid Revolution]], Iraq rose up in support of the rebellion. Kufa overthrew Umayyad rule and welcomed the Abbasid army in October 749, followed immediately by the proclamation of [[as-Saffah]] as the first Abbasid caliph there.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=114–115, 127}}

'''Alberta Fashion Week''' is a [[fashion week|fashion event]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It was started in February, 2009 by David R. Politi in Calgary, Alberta. It is a bi-yearly [[Fashion Week]] featuring local and national, Canadian designers. Its first shows were held between October 4–10, 2009, at the Banke of Nova Scotia, on Stephen Avenue in Calgary. Most of the designers involved were women, showing a mix of [[ready-to-wear]] and [[haute couture]]. To stay competitive with other non-fashion events, and encouraging for young fashion enthusiasts, tickets prices were kept low – under $22 for standing-room.

The next shows take place May 16–21, 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Autoerotic fatalities''' are accidental [[death]]s that occur during [[Autoeroticism|sexual self-stimulation]] when an apparatus, device or prop that is being employed to enhance pleasure causes the death.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; Researchers only apply the term to unintentional deaths resulting from solitary sexual activity, not [[suicide]] or acts with a partner.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sauvageau, A. | year = 2014 | title = Current Reports on Autoerotic Deaths—Five Persistent Myths | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-013-0430-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autoerotic asphyxia]] is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to [[autoerotic asphyxia]]. 5 to 10% are related to [[electrocution]], foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as [[amyl nitrite]], [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], or [[nitrous oxide]], and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects. Male victims are much more likely to use a variety of devices during autoerotic behaviour than female victims.

The subject has been treated in two books, ''Autoerotic Fatalities'' by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and ''Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects'' by Sheleg et al. (2006).

The '''Battle of Cresson''' was a small battle, fought on 1 May 1187 at the springs of Cresson, or 'Ain Gozeh, near [[Nazareth]]. It was a prelude to the decisive defeat of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] at the [[Battle of Hattin]] two months later.

==Background==
The political situation in Jerusalem was tense because of factional rivalries between two branches of the royal house. [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], who had previously been regent for the kingdom, refused to accept [[Guy of Lusignan]] as king, following the death of the child king, [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]] (Guy's stepson) the previous year. [[Gerard of Ridefort]], master of the [[Knights Templar]]; [[Roger de Moulins]], master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]; [[Balian of Ibelin]], [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre]]; and [[Reginald of Sidon|Reginald Grenier]], [[lord of Sidon]], were sent to [[Tiberias]] to negotiate with Raymond and try to bring him back into the Christian fold.

==The battle==
Meanwhile, [[Saladin]] had sent a small force towards Tiberias led by Muzaffar ad-Din [[Gökböri]], seeking revenge for an attack on a Muslim [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] by [[Raynald of Châtillon]]. Raymond III hoped Saladin would ally with him against Guy, and allowed this force to pass through Tiberias on 30 April, although he warned the Christians in Nazareth about the army's presence. Hearing this, Gerard quickly assembled a small army, consisting of the Templar garrisons from [[Qaqun]] and [[Afula|al-Fulah]] and the royal knights stationed at Nazareth, only about 130 knights in total; Balian had stopped along the way at his fief of [[Nablus]] and Reginald was also elsewhere. A second probably larger Ayyubid force, led by Saladin's son Al Afdal, was at Al Qahwani and did not participate in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson and Nicolle, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerard reached Cresson on 1 May. As the ''[[Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi]]'', a chronicle of the [[Third Crusade]], records it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''So Saladin assembled armed forces and marched violently on Palestine. He sent the emir of Edessa, Manafaradin (al-Muzaffar- [[Gökböri]]), on ahead with 7,000 Turks to ravage the Holy Land. Now, when this Manafaradin advanced into the Tiberias region, he happened to encounter the master of the Temple, Gerard de Ridefort, and the master of the Hospital, Roger des Moulins. In the unexpected battle which followed, he put the former to flight and killed the latter.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muslims feigned a retreat, a common tactic which should not have fooled Gerard; nevertheless, he ordered a charge, against Roger's advice, and the [[knight]]s were separated from the foot-soldiers. The Muslims easily repulsed a direct Christian attack, killing both the exhausted knights, and, later, the foot-soldiers. Gerard was wounded, but survived; however, almost all the others were killed. According to the ''Itinerarium'', however, Gerard did not rashly engage the enemy, but was actually caught unaware and was the victim of an attack himself. The ''Itinerarium'' also records the exploits of a certain Templar named Jakelin de Mailly, who, after all his companions had been killed, fought singlehandedly against the throng of Muslims until he too fell.

==Aftermath==
Balian was still a day behind, and had also stopped at [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastea]] to celebrate a [[feast day]]. After reaching the castle of La Fève, where the Templars and Hospitallers had camped, he found that the place was deserted. He sent his squire [[Ernoul]] ahead to learn what had happened, and news of the disastrous battle soon arrived from the few survivors. Raymond heard about the battle as well and met the embassy at Tiberias, and agreed to accompany them back to Jerusalem.

Raymond was finally willing to acknowledge Guy as king, but the damage to the kingdom was severe, and both Gerard and Raynald considered Raymond a traitor. However Guy, knowing that Saladin's army was already forming for a renewed assault on the kingdom, could not afford to let this internecine quarrel continue and welcomed Raymond with open arms.

Saladin gathered a much larger army of 20,000 men, invaded the kingdom in June, and [[Battle of Hattin|defeated Guy at Hattin]] on July 4; by October he [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|captured Jerusalem]] itself.

==The problem of the sources==
The battle is mentioned in a number of contemporary chronicles. These accounts differ considerably, and have never been fully reconciled by historians. Instead historical accounts tend to be dominated by the early interpretations of the [[Latin]] ''De expugnatione Terrae Sanctae libellus''. The aforementioned Latin ''Itinerarium'' was probably compiled in the late 1190s or early 13th century, incorporating material from a member of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s army in the Third Crusade, and some other sources.

The ''Old French Continuation of William of Tyre'' (1230s in its present form) includes an account of the immediate aftermath which is attributed to Balian's squire Ernoul: Ernoul himself was travelling with his lord and was not present for the actual fighting. Gerard of Ridefort's own report of the battle was the source for a short narrative written by [[Pope Urban III]] to [[Baldwin of Exeter]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] chronicle of [[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]] briefly mentions Saladin's expedition but does not refer specifically to Cresson; according to him the advance guard remained in the [[Hawran]] while Saladin was in [[Damascus]].

There is no real secondary literature on this battle, which was a minor prelude to Hattin. However, the classic study on crusader warfare of this period is Smail. A useful additional read is Marshall, which covers the armies of the region shortly after the battle of Hattin.

The '''Brighton Half Marathon''' is an annual [[half marathon]] [[road running]] race.  The race is run primarily along Brighton seafront and passes through famous landmarks such as the [[Royal Pavilion]], [[Brighton Pier]], [[West Pier]] and [[Brighton Marina]].

In 2014 the Brighton Half Marathon was named as one the eight events in the Vitality Run Series alongside the [[Liverpool Half Marathon]], [[Reading Half Marathon]], Oxford Half Marathon, [[Bath Half Marathon]], North London Half Marathon, Hackney Half Marathon and British 10k London Run.

On 31 March 2017 it was announced that the course used for the 2015–2017 races was {{convert|146|m|miles|2}} short of the full distance and that the times of the runners in the three races are likely to be expunged from official records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/31/brighton-half-marathon-146m-short-meaning-thousands-runners/ |title=Forget your PB: Brighton Half Marathon organisers admit course is 146m too short |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 March 2017 |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carnival Memphis''' (formerly known as the '''Memphis Cotton Carnival'''), is a series of parties and festivities staged annually since 1931 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] by the centralized Carnival Memphis Association and its member krewes (similar to that of [[Mardi Gras]]) during the month of June. Carnival salutes various aspects of Memphis and its industries, and is reigned over by the current year's secretly selected King, Queen, and Royal Court of Carnival.

==Royalty==
The Royal Court is made up of young women from Memphis (princesses), mostly around the age of nineteen, typically having completed their first-year of study in college, and their escorts.  Members of the Court not from the city of Memphis are known as "Ladies of the Realm."  Members of the Court sometimes carry special titles such as the "King's Princess," in which she is selected by the King himself to bear this title, as is a "Queen's Princess," a "President's Princess", and princesses representing various social clubs in Memphis, such as the "Princess of the Memphis Country Club" or the various krewes within Carnival.  The male escort of the princess representing the various social clubs normally bears the masculine form of the title as well, making one in this instance be the "Prince of the University Club."  The Queen is a young woman who is at least a few years older than the court, typically being the age one would be having finished two to three years in college. The King is traditionally much older than the court, and is a prominent leader from the current year's saluted industry. "Carnival" is usually held during the first week of June, commencing the Friday after [[Memorial Day]], beginning with the [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]] &amp; [[Sceptre]] Ball and ending with the Grand Carnival Ball. During this time the Grand Krewes of Carnival also hold their own events and parties celebrating their King, Queen and Court, along with the entire revelers of Carnival Memphis.

== Governance and Krewe system ==
Carnival Memphis is put on by the Carnival Memphis Association, which is governed by a [[Board of Directors]], (vacancies are filled by the other members of the Board), a President (elected annually by the Board members), and an Executive Director, who manages the daily aspects of the association.

The Carnival Memphis Association organizes, plans, budgets, and promotes the King, Queen, and Royal Court, as well as many of the events staged during Carnival week.  However, the Grand Krewes (once known as secret societies) also stage their own festivities throughout the year, elect their own royalty, manage their own [[budget]], and have their own membership requirements.  Most of these organizations bear [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] names in accordance to tradition originally set out by the Mystic Memphi, and in conjunction with Memphis being the sister city of ancient [[Memphis, Egypt]].  The twelve Grand Krewes that Carnival Memphis recognizes are the Mystic Society of the Memphi, Osiris, Sphinx, RaMet, Ennead, Phoenix, Aani, Ptolemy, Kemet Jubilee, Ptah, Luxor, Queen Bees. The Secret Order of the Boll Weevils is a support group of Carnival that is not a Grand Krewe.  The Grand Krewes of Memphi, Osiris, RaMet and Sphinx are "old-line" Grand Krewes and were all started in the 1930s as the original secret societies of the Memphis [[Cotton]] Carnival. However, Memphi considers its history traceable to the 1870s as the original promoters of the Memphis Mardi Gras, although it became defunct during the time that span between the last Mardi Gras and its restoration as a Cotton Carnival secret society.  Membership requirements and financial commitments are normally more complex when one wishes to join one of the older krewes, as compared to the newer krewes, that may have little or no membership process.  Memphi and Osiris are all-male organizations, with some exceptions.  Memphi allows their past queens to become members after their reign, following their belief that "once a Queen, always a Queen!."

Each Grand Krewe is independently governed by a Board of Directors, and elects its own executive from within its membership.  The title of the executives differ from krewe to krewe, mostly known as "General Chairman," or "Chairman".  The King and Queen of Carnival Memphis are kept secret until an announcement usually in early February.  A few of the old-line Grand Krewes keep their royalty a secret throughout most, if not all of Carnival.  The Sublime Ouro (the King) of Memphi is not announced until the Wednesday night of Carnival Week to his own krewe members.  The King of Osiris is announced on the last day of Carnival Week.

== History ==

===Mardi Gras era===
In 1872, Memphis as much of the South, was suffering from the devastation of the Civil War and Reconstruction.  The city fathers thought that Memphis needed some show of civic pride that would bring the residents together for a common good and demonstrate to the outside world that the city was alive and well.  They decided on a Mardi Gras celebration to help re-invigorate the spirits of the population.  The city of Memphis celebrated Mardi Gras, and a Carnival season based on the traditional [[Christian]] [[liturgical calendar]] just before the season of [[Lent]], similar to what is still practiced in cities such as [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], [[Mobile, Alabama]], Galveston, Texas, [[Venice, Italy]] and [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]].  This was largely staged by secret societies, or a "krewe" system, but mostly through the efforts of the Mystic Society of the Memphi.  The societies held massive parades, elaborate balls and parties, to celebrate during this festive season. However, Memphis experienced the devastation of a yellow fever epidemic which along with cholera wiped out much of the city's population.  Mardi Gras celebrations in Memphis slowly ceased to exist, and by the late 1890s, the Mystic Memphi and other societies, as well as the Mardi Gras festivals as a whole were no longer an active institution in the city.

===The Memphis Cotton Carnival is born===
During the early twentieth century, great interest developed in creating a citywide event like Carnival, and re-establishing the Mystic Memphi.  As more and more influential Memphians became actively interested, Memphi and the Memphis Cotton Carnival Association were established in the early 1930s.  The efforts were conducted to bring a sense of excitement and life back to the city of Memphis and its people. However, rather than following the Lenten calendar and being held strictly to celebrate Mardi Gras, designers decided that this festival would promote something else, Memphis' primary asset at the time-cotton. During this time, Memphis and the Mid-South region, like the rest of the [[United States]], were in the throes of the [[Great Depression]]. Many were out of work and the region's cotton was selling for pennies a pound. The prosperity of the Mid-South was dependent on cotton and measures had to be taken to increase the use of this precious commodity. At the same time, the Memphis Chamber of Commerce was having trouble raising money to compete with other cities in the South, such as [[Atlanta]] and New Orleans. A. Arthur Halle and a group of businessmen called on Herbert Jennings, a downtown theatre manager for a donation. Jennings agreed to contribute and shared an idea that he believed would help promote business and draw attention to cotton. To help publicize an upcoming movie, Jennings offered local retailers the opportunity to display cotton goods in his theatre and planned to encourage them to use their own store windows to promote cotton clothing. Halle was intrigued by the idea and envisioned a larger citywide promotion and called upon Everett R. Cook, who was President of the [[Memphis Cotton Exchange]] at this time. Cook was invited to come to the theatre to hear the ideas. Those ideas quickly grew into a plan for a grand celebration with a King, Queen and Royal Court that would involve people from all over the Mid-South. The idea was to promote the use and wearing of cotton products which would lead to increased demand and stimulate sales. It worked, as people began to demand more cotton products from socks to ball gowns.

Cook expressed his vision this way: "Carnival is to promote business for everybody and should not be used by any one group. It is for all of the stores and all of the people, for all kinds of professions and businesses, for the city as a whole regardless of the size of the business, the social standing, wealth, prestige, family background or anything else that would tend to make anyone feel that he or she would not be invited to participate in Carnival."

The fanfare and excitement that centered around the Cotton Carnival climaxed throughout the mid-to-late twentieth century.  During this time, the event stretched several weeks during the months of May and June, and had incorporated much more than it had originally set out to do.  The Memphis Cotton Carnival Association had become a very centralized governing body, which along with the participating krewes, was becoming a festival that could not be rivaled anywhere in the South except New Orleans' Mardi Gras (in which it brought in as many numbers).  While the series of street parades in downtown Memphis continued to be held, in addition to the numerous parties at many of the city's most elite social clubs continued, the event started to form a new face of entertainment that dubbed it the "South's Greatest Party" for all to enjoy.  The Carnival and its krewes held on to the traditional aspects of Carnival, but entertained onlookers with such musicians as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], welcoming guests from all over the United States, and from all over the world.  By this time it had truly become the city's most important and celebrated event, participated by Memphians and Mid-Southerners from all [[socioeconomic]] backgrounds.  In addition to the Music Festival, its most intriguing and popular event was the ''Arrival of the Royal Barge''.  This event was very much a "sight to see" in which the King, Queen, and Royal Court, along with the royal pages, guards, and other participants would all ride in on a beautifully decorated [[barge]] on the Mississippi River, docking in downtown Memphis for all onlookers to revel and awe over.  With elaborately designed and well-lit backdrops, along with the night sky being lit up with an array of fireworks, this was truly a wonder for everyone present.  The entire city, it seemed, gathered along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] riverbanks on a spring evening to attend the Royal Barge Landing, walk along the Carnival midway, and watch the Carnival parade. Many national publications and media covered the fanfare, and the Association even crowned a Maid of Cotton to tour the globe and promote cotton fashions.

===Decline===
The assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] left Memphis devastated in many different ways, one aspect being the state of its downtown.  As urban sprawl began to be more and more common, with businesses and residents moving away from the city's inner core, the public events that were once staged by the Cotton Carnival became few and far between.  Parades slowly became a thing of the past, as did the arrival of the Royal Barge.  The city of Memphis municipal government acquired the "float factory" once used to manufacture the elaborately decorated floats, and mainstream Memphians and Mid-Southerners grew less and less interested in staging this event.  Also, other festivals began to form that took the place of Carnival, such as the [[Memphis in May]] International Festival, and its highly anticipated [[Beale Street]] [[Beale Street Music Festival|Music Festival]].

Over the years, however, Carnival's luster began to fade along with the declining role of cotton in the area. The national press gradually lost interest, and the Maid of Cotton Pageant was moved to [[Dallas, Texas]], where it exists today.  For various reasons, the 1980s saw the name of the Cotton Carnival be changed to the Great River Carnival, and because of even less approval changed again to Carnival Memphis.  The organization sited this was done because the community had grown in such tremendous ways, and that the Memphis economy had become more diversified and no longer centered exclusively around cotton.  The king was beginning to be chosen from leaders in other aspects of commerce other than the cotton industry, and was no longer referred to as "King Cotton," but as simply King, or Rex Carnivali.

For years, the Cotton Carnival was, though not officially, for all intents and purposes for whites only. When a Beale Street dentist named Dr. R.Q. Venson took his nephew downtown to see a Carnival parade in 1934, complete with the marching bands and floats (which were for a few years in its existence pulled by black men), and asked him how he liked it. He didn't, his nephew replied, because "all the negroes were horses." Venson enjoined other black Memphians to hold their own separate event. As a result, the Cotton Makers' Fiesta was organized in 1934. The name changed to Cotton Makers' Jubilee and, as a protest to establish dignity and respect for Negro men and women, the first celebration was held the third week of May 1936. The Jubilee enjoyed its most successful years from 1948 to 1958. There were only two occasions in the celebrations past when no activities took place. The first such time was during World War II and the second occasion in 1968 due to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The organization briefly merged with Carnival Memphis in 1982 when it became known as the krewe Kemet Jubilee.

The King was, and still is, an older man who had ties with the industry being saluted that year, while the Queen was, and still is, a young, unmarried woman from one of Memphis' "better" families. That's one tradition, at least, that hasn't changed over the years.

The elitist charge came about from all the supposedly secret activities of the Carnival royalty and especially the various Grand Krewes, whose membership — and parties, especially — were by invitation only. Year after year, many outsiders would read [[The Commercial Appeal]] (Memphis newspaper) stories of fancy-dress balls and dinners and dances held by mysterious-sounding, Egyptian-themed Krewes, and wonder, why they could not attend those parties or have their daughters debut in these certain circles; this sense of separation within the Memphis community led to charges of elitism.

==Carnival Memphis today==
By the later twentieth century Carnival Memphis had the general reputation of having dwindled down to nothing but a series of formal debutante parties at the various private social and country clubs, consisting largely of the city's elite gathering together to promote an event that "was once, but no longer", and it was truly living out its twilight years.  Gone were the parades, the grand parties, the fireworks, the midway, and the hustle and bustle of an entire metropolitan area to promote itself and to gather together to take part in such a great event.

However, as Carnival officials grew more and more aware about certain negative issues surrounding the event and its severely declining reputation, they began actually implementing steps over the years to bring outsiders into their realm. More and more Carnival events are now open to the public. African-American Memphians are beginning to take part, and Carnival had one black Krewe, Cotton Makers' (currently Kemet) Jubilee, from 1982-2007. Also, Carnival has begun selecting local charities and organizing special events just for Carnival krewes, with each charity receiving a monetary donation.

Seventy-four years later, the mission of Carnival remains much the same as it was in 1931-to recognize and promote an industry that has a major economic impact on the Mid-South community, and to promote the City of Memphis as a great place to live and work, and to cause an annual celebration in honor of that industry and the people of the Mid-South.  The general motto of Carnival Memphis is "Convivium Cum Propositione," Latin for "The Party with a Purpose!".  According to Jim Cole, who lived in Memphis from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s and attended numerous Cotton Carnivals, "Elvis Presley was a major headline entertainer during the mid 1950's".

{{Weapons of mass destruction}}

A '''chemical weapon''' ('''CW''') is a specialized [[Ammunition|munition]] that uses chemicals [[chemical engineering|formulated]] to inflict death or harm on humans. According to the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] (OPCW), "the term chemical weapon may also be applied to any toxic chemical or its [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] that can cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation through its chemical action. Munitions or other delivery devices designed to deliver chemical weapons, whether filled or unfilled, are also considered weapons themselves."&lt;ref name="CW"/&gt;

Chemical weapons are classified as [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs), though they are distinct from [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[biological warfare|biological weapon]]s, and [[radiological weapon]]s. All may be used in warfare and are known by the military acronym NBC (for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare). Weapons of mass destruction are distinct from [[conventional weapon]]s, which are primarily effective due to their [[explosion|explosive]], [[kinetic energy|kinetic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] potential. Chemical weapons can be widely dispersed in gas, liquid and solid forms, and may easily afflict others than the intended targets. [[Nerve gas]], [[tear gas]] and [[pepper spray]] are three modern examples of chemical weapons.

Lethal unitary chemical agents and munitions are extremely [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and they constitute a class of hazardous chemical weapons that have been [[stockpile]]d by many nations. Unitary agents are effective on their own and do not require mixing with other agents. The most dangerous of these are [[nerve agent]]s ([[Tabun (nerve agent)|GA]], [[Sarin|GB]], [[Soman|GD]], and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]) and [[vesicant]] (blister) agents, which include formulations of [[sulfur mustard]] such as H, HT, and HD. They all are liquids at normal room temperature, but become gaseous when released. Widely used during the [[First World War]], the effects of so-called [[mustard gas]], [[phosgene gas]] and others caused lung searing, blindness, death and maiming.  

The [[Nazi]] Germans during [[WW-II]] committed [[genocide]] mainly against [[Jews]] but included other targeted populations in the [[Holocaust]], a commercial [[hydrogen cyanide]] [[blood agent]] trade named [[Zyklon B]] discharged in large [[gas chambers]] was the preferred method to efficiently murder their victims in a continuing industrial fashion&lt;ref&gt;Longerich, Peter (2010). Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280436-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, this resulted in the largest death toll to chemical weapons in history.&lt;ref&gt;From Cooperation to Complicity: Degussa in the Third Reich, Peter Hayes, 2004, pp 2, 272, {{ISBN|0-521-78227-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2016}}, [[CS gas]] and [[pepper spray]] remain in common use for policing and riot control; while CS is considered a [[non-lethal weapon]], pepper spray is known for its lethal potential. Under the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (1993), there is a legally binding, worldwide ban on the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons and their precursors. Notwithstanding, large stockpiles of chemical weapons continue to exist, usually justified as a precaution against putative use by an aggressor.

== International law on chemical weapons ==

=== Before the Second World War ===

[[International law]] has prohibited the use of chemical weapons since 1899, under the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]: Article 23 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land adopted by the First Hague Conference "especially" prohibited employing "poison and poisoned arms".&lt;ref name="Auto5R-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto5R-2"/&gt; A separate declaration stated that in any war between signatory powers, the parties would abstain from using projectiles "the object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases".&lt;ref name="Auto5R-3"/&gt;

The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], signed February 6, 1922, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, aimed at banning CW but did not succeed because France rejected it. The subsequent failure to include CW has contributed to the resultant increase in stockpiles.&lt;ref name="ref15"/&gt;

The [[Geneva Protocol]], officially known as the ''Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare'', is an International treaty prohibiting the use of chemical and [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]]s. It was signed at [[Geneva]] June 17, 1925, and entered into force on February 8, 1928. 133 nations are listed as state parties&lt;ref name="AutoBS-1"/&gt; to the treaty. [[Ukraine]] is the newest signatory; acceding August 7, 2003.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-2"/&gt;

This treaty states that chemical and biological weapons are "justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world". And while the treaty prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons, it does not address the production, storage, or transfer of these weapons. Treaties that followed the Geneva Protocol did address those omissions and have been enacted.

=== Modern agreements ===

The 1993 [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC) is the most recent [[arms control]] agreement with the force of [[International law]]. Its full name is the ''Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction''. That agreement outlaws the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. It is administered by the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]]&amp;nbsp;(OPCW), which is an independent organization based in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="ref38"/&gt;

The OPCW administers the terms of the CWC to 192 signatories, which represents 98% of the global population. {{As of|June 2016}}, 66,368 of 72,525 metric tonnes, (92% of CW stockpiles), have been verified as destroyed.&lt;ref name="AutoF5-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBS-3"/&gt; The OPCW has conducted 6,327 inspections at 235 chemical weapon-related sites and 2,255 industrial sites. These inspections have affected the sovereign territory of 86 States Parties since April 1997. Worldwide, 4,732 industrial facilities are subject to inspection under provisions of the CWC.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-3"/&gt;

== Use ==

{{main article|Chemical warfare}}

Chemical warfare (''CW'') involves using the [[toxic properties]] of [[chemical substance]]s as weapons. This type of warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]] and [[biological warfare]], which together make up NBC, the military initialism for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (warfare or weapons). None of these fall under the term [[conventional weapon]]s, which are primarily effective because of their destructive potential. Chemical warfare does not depend upon [[explosion|explosive]] force to achieve an objective. It depends upon the unique properties of the chemical agent [[Weapons engineering|weaponized]].

[[File:Englische Gasbomben.jpg|thumb|left|A British gas bomb that was used during World War I.]]

A lethal agent is designed to injure, incapacitate, or kill an opposing force, or deny unhindered use of a particular area of terrain. [[Defoliant]]s are used to quickly kill vegetation and deny its use for cover and concealment. CW can also be used against agriculture and livestock to promote hunger and starvation. Chemical payloads can be delivered by remote controlled container release, aircraft, or rocket. Protection against chemical weapons includes proper equipment, training, and decontamination measures.

== Countries with stockpiles ==

{{main article|Chemical weapon proliferation}}
{{mergeto|Chemical weapon proliferation|date=August 2018}}

=== CWC states with declared stockpiles ===
&lt;!-- Please list countries in alphabetical order, thank you. --&gt;

Of 190 signatory nations to the CWC, state parties listed below have also declared stockpiles, agreed to monitored disposal, and verification, and in some cases, used CW in conflict. Both military targets and civilian populations have been affected; affected populations were not always damaged collaterally; instead, at times: themselves the target of the attack. {{As of|2017}}, only North Korea and the United States are confirmed to have remaining stockpiles of CW.

==== India ====

India declared its stock of chemical weapons in June 1997. India's declaration came after the entry into force of the CWC that created the [[OPCW]]. India declared a stockpile of 1044 tonnes of sulfur mustard in its possession.&lt;ref name="highbeam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dominicantoday2007"/&gt; On January 14, 1993, India became an original signatory to the CWC. In 2005, among the six nations that declared stockpiles of chemical weapons, India was the only one to meet its deadline for chemical weapons destruction and for inspection of its facilities by the OPCW. By the end of 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons/material stockpile and was granted an extension for destroying the remaining CW until April 2009. It was anticipated that India would achieve 100 percent destruction within that time frame.&lt;ref name="dominicantoday2007"/&gt; On May 14, 2009, India informed the United Nations that it had completely destroyed its stockpile of chemical weapons.&lt;ref name="india"/&gt;

==== Iraq ====
{{Main|Iraqi chemical weapons program}}
[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|An Iranian soldier wearing a [[gas mask]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Iraq massively used chemical weapons during [[Iran–Iraq war]].]]
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which oversees destruction measures, has announced "The government of Iraq has deposited its instrument of accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention with the Secretary General of the United Nations and within 30 days, on 12 February 2009, will become the 186th State Party to the Convention".&lt;ref name="ref39" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBS-5" /&gt; Iraq has also declared stockpiles of CW, and because of their recent accession is the only State Party exempted from the destruction time-line.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-6" /&gt; On September 7, 2011, [[Hoshyar Zebari]] entered the OPCW headquarters, becoming the first Iraqi Foreign Minister to officially visit since the country joined the CWC.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-7" /&gt;

Iraq used [[mustard gas]] in an attack against [[Kurdish people]] on March 16, 1988, [[Halabja chemical attack]].The attack killed between 3,200 and 5,000 people and injured 7,000 to 10,000 more, most of them civilians. On June 28, 1987 in [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]], on two separate attacks against four residential areas, victims were estimated as 10&amp;nbsp;civilians dead and 650&amp;nbsp;civilians injured.&lt;ref name="nti_sardasht_attack" /&gt; Iraq massively used chemical weapons during [[Iran–Iraq war]], and so far, [[Kurdish people]] are the biggest victims of chemical weapons.

==== Japan ====

Japan stored chemical weapons on the territory of [[mainland China]] between 1937 and 1945. The weapons mostly contained a mustard&amp;nbsp;gas-lewisite mixture.&lt;ref name="ref35"/&gt; They are classified as ''abandoned chemical weapons'' under the CWC; their destruction under a joint Japan-China program started in September 2010, in [[Nanjing]] using mobile destruction facilities.&lt;ref name="ref36"/&gt;

==== Libya ====
[[Libya]] used chemical weapons, under [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s regime, in a war with [[Chad]]. In 2003, Gaddafi agreed to accede to the CWC in exchange for "[[rapprochement]]" with western nations. At the time of the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, Libya still controlled approximately 11.25 tons of poisonous mustard gas. Because of destabilization, concerns increased regarding possibilities and likelihood that control of these agents could be lost. With terrorism at the core of concern,&lt;ref name="AutoBS-8"/&gt; international bodies cooperated to ensure Libya is held to its obligations under the treaty.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-9"/&gt; Libya's post-Gaddafi [[National Transitional Council]] is cooperating with the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] regarding the destruction of all legacy chemical weapons in the country.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-10"/&gt; After assessing the chemical stockpiles, the Libyan government will receive a deadline from the OPCW to destroy the CW.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-11"/&gt;

==== Russia ====
[[File:CW stored in Russia.png|thumb|Chemical weapons formerly stored in Russia.]]
[[File:Russian CW stockpiles.gif|thumb|Former Russian CW stockpiles.]]

Russia entered the CWC with the largest declared stockpile of chemical weapons.&lt;ref name="ref32"/&gt; By 2010 the country had destroyed 18,241 [[tonnes]] at destruction facilities located in [[Gorny, Krasnopartizansky District, Saratov Oblast|Gorny]] ([[Saratov Oblast]]) and [[Kambarka]] ([[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]), where operations have finished, and [[Shchuchye, Kurgan Oblast|Shchuchye]] ([[Kurgan Oblast]]), [[Maradykovsky]] ([[Kirov Oblast]]), [[Leonidovka]] ([[Penza Oblast]]) while installations are under construction in [[Pochep]] ([[Bryansk Oblast]]) and [[Kizner]] ([[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]).&lt;ref name="ref33"/&gt; By 2016, Russia destroyed around 94% of its chemical weapons, planning to completely destroy its remaining stockpile by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsrussia.xyz/in-russia-eliminated-about-95-of-toxic-substances/|title=In Russia, eliminated about 95% of toxic substances - NewsRussia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2017 Russia announced the destruction of the last batch of chemical weapons, completing the total destruction of its chemical arsenal, ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://tass.com/politics/967747|title=Putin lauds elimination of last chemical agent from Russian stockpiles as ‘historic event’|publisher=[[TASS]]| date=September 27, 2017| accessdate =September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2018, Russia was alleged to have conducted a [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|chemical attack]] in [[Salisbury|Salisbury, UK]] that left 5 injured including the alleged target of the attack, [[Sergei Skripal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/russia-skripal-scandal-180327143040753.html|title=Russia-Skripal scandal: What we know so far|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]| date=March 27, 2018| accessdate =March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syria ====
{{main article|Syria chemical weapons program}}
Prior to September 2013, Syria was one of the 7 states that were not party to the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. It is, however, party to the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and therefore, prohibited from using chemical weapons in war yet unhindered from the production, storage or transfer of CW.

When questioned about the topic, Syrian officials stated that they feel it is an appropriate deterrent against Israel's undeclared nuclear weapons program which they believe exists. On July 23, 2012, the Syrian government acknowledged, for the first time, that it had chemical weapons.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-12"/&gt;

Independent assessments indicate that Syria could have produced up to a few hundred tons of chemical agent per year. Syria reportedly manufactures the unitary agents: [[Sarin]], [[Tabun (nerve agent)|Tabun]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], and [[mustard gas]].&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity Chemicals"/&gt;

Syrian chemical weapons production facilities have been identified by Western nonproliferation experts at the following 5 sites, plus a suspected weapons base:&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity Sites"/&gt;

* Al Safir ([[Scud]] missile base)
* Cerin
* Hama
* Homs
* Latakia
* Palmyra

In July 2007, [[July 2007 Syrian arms depot explosion|a Syrian arms depot exploded]], killing at least 15 Syrians.  [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], a UK magazine reporting on military and corporate affairs, believed that the explosion happened when Iranian and Syrian military personnel attempted to fit a [[Scud]] missile with a [[mustard gas]] warhead. Syria stated that the blast was accidental and not chemical related.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-13"/&gt;

On July 13, 2012, the Syrian government moved its stockpile to an undisclosed location.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-14"/&gt;

In September 2012, information emerged that the Syrian military had begun testing chemical weapons, and was reinforcing and resupplying a base housing these weapons located east of [[Aleppo]] in August.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBS-16"/&gt;

On March 19, 2013, news emerged from Syria indicating the first use of chemical weapons since the beginning of the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian uprising]].&lt;ref name="AutoBS-17"/&gt;

On August 21, 2013, testimony and photographic evidence emerged from Syria indicating a [[2013 Ghouta attacks|large-scale chemical weapons attack on Ghouta]], a populated urban center.&lt;ref name="Auto5R-9"/&gt;

An agreement was reached September 14, 2013, called the [[Framework For Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons]], leading to the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014.&lt;ref name="Auto5R-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt20130914"/&gt;

On October 14, 2013, Syria officially acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention but there were multiple cases of chemical weapon use in Syria afterwards.

==== United States ====
{{Main article|United States chemical weapons program}}
The United States has destroyed about 90% of the chemical weapons stockpile it declared in 1997; as of 2012 complete destruction was not expected until 2023.&lt;ref name="Complete"&gt;[http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?DocID=003683880 Army Agency Completes Mission to Destroy Chemical Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915082045/http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?DocID=003683880 |date=September 15, 2012 }}, USCMA, January 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. policy on the use of chemical weapons is to reserve the right to retaliate. First use, or [[preemptive war|preemptive]] use, is a violation of stated policy. Only the president of the United States can authorize the first retaliatory use.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt; Official policy now reflects the likelihood of chemical weapons being used as a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] weapon.&lt;ref name="ref9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6"/&gt;

Although Israel has signed the CWC, it has not ratified the treaty and therefore is not officially bound by its tenets.&lt;ref name="ref38"/&gt; The country is believed to have a significant stockpile of chemical weapons, likely the most abundant in the Middle-East, according to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name="AutoA4-2"/&gt; A 1983 CIA report stated that Israel, after "finding itself surrounded by front-line Arab states with budding CW capabilities, became increasingly conscious of its vulnerability to chemical attack ... undertook a program of chemical warfare preparations in both offensive and protective areas ... In late 1982, a probable CW nerve agent production facility and a storage facility were identified at the Dimona Sensitive Storage Area in the Negev Desert. Other CW agent production is believed to exist within a well-developed Israeli chemical industry."&lt;ref name="AutoA4-3"/&gt;

In 1992, [[El Al Flight 1862]] crashed on its way to [[Tel Aviv]] and was found to be carrying 190 liters of [[dimethyl methylphosphonate]], a [[List of Schedule 2 substances (CWC)|CWC schedule 2 chemical]] used in the synthesis of [[sarin]] nerve gas. Israel insisted at the time that the materials were non-toxic. This shipment was coming from a US chemical plant to the IIBR under a [[US Department of Commerce]] license.&lt;ref name="AutoA4-4"/&gt;

In 1993, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment WMD proliferation assessment recorded Israel as a country generally reported as having undeclared offensive chemical warfare capabilities.&lt;ref name="AutoA4-5"/&gt; However, it is unclear whether Israel still keeps its alleged stockpile of chemical weapons.&lt;ref name="AutoA4-2"/&gt;

==== North Korea ====

North Korea is not a signatory of the CWC and has never officially acknowledged the existence of its CW program. Nevertheless, the country is believed to [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction#Biological and chemical weapons|possess a substantial arsenal of chemical weapons]]. It reportedly acquired the technology necessary to produce [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] and [[mustard gas]] as early as the 1950s.&lt;ref name="AutoBS-18"/&gt; In 2009, the [[International Crisis Group]] reported that the consensus expert view was that North Korea had a stockpile of about 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, including [[mustard gas]], [[sarin]] (GB) and other nerve agents including [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]].&lt;ref name="reuters-20090618"/&gt;

== Manner and form ==

[[File:Chemical agent protection.jpg|thumb|A [[Swedish Army]] soldier wearing a chemical agent [[protective suit]] (''C-vätskeskydd'') and [[gas mask|protection mask]] (''skyddsmask 90'').]]

There are three basic configurations in which these agents are stored. The first are self-contained munitions like projectiles, cartridges, mines, and rockets; these can contain propellant and/or explosive components. The next form are aircraft-delivered munitions. This form never has an explosive component.&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; Together they comprise the two forms that have been [[Weapons engineering|weaponized]] and are ready for their intended use. The U.S. stockpile consisted of 39% of these weapon ready munitions. The final of the three forms are raw agent housed in one-ton containers. The remaining 61%&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; of the stockpile was in this form.&lt;ref name="ref10"/&gt; Whereas these chemicals exist in liquid form at normal room temperature,&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt; the sulfur mustards H, and HD freeze in temperatures below {{convert|55|F|C|1}}. Mixing lewisite with distilled mustard lowers the freezing point to {{convert|-13|F|C|1}}.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt;

Higher temperatures are a bigger concern because the possibility of an explosion increases as the temperatures rise. A fire at one of these facilities would endanger the surrounding community as well as the personnel at the installations.&lt;ref name="ref11"/&gt; Perhaps more so for the community having much less access to protective equipment and specialized training.&lt;ref name="ref12"/&gt; The [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] conducted a study to assess capabilities and costs for protecting civilian populations during related emergencies,&lt;ref name="ref13"/&gt; and the effectiveness of expedient, [[Shelter in place|in-place shelters]].&lt;ref name="ref14"/&gt;

== Disposal ==

{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2012}}
{{main article|Destruction of chemical weapons}}
[[File:USChemicalWeaponsStockpiles082808.jpg|thumb|Stockpile/disposal site locations for the United States' chemical weapons and the sites operating status as of August 28, 2008.]]

The stockpiles, which have been maintained for more than 50 years,&lt;ref name="ref15"/&gt; are now considered obsolete.&lt;ref name="ref16"/&gt; [[Public Law 99-145]], contains section 1412, which directs the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]&amp;nbsp;(DOD) to dispose of the stockpiles. This directive fell upon the DOD with joint cooperation from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]&amp;nbsp;(FEMA).&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; The Congressional directive has resulted in the present Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program.

Historically, chemical munitions have been disposed of by land burial, open burning, and ocean dumping (referred to as [[Operation CHASE]]).&lt;ref name="ref17"/&gt; However, in 1969, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]&amp;nbsp;(NRC) recommended that ocean dumping be discontinued. The Army then began a study of disposal technologies, including the assessment of incineration as well as chemical neutralization methods. In 1982, that study culminated in the selection of incineration technology, which is now incorporated into what is known as the ''baseline'' system. Construction of the [[Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System]]&amp;nbsp;(JACADS) began in 1985.

This was to be a full-scale prototype facility using the baseline system. The prototype was a success but there were still many concerns about CONUS operations. To address growing public concern over incineration, Congress, in 1992, directed the Army to evaluate alternative disposal approaches that might be "significantly safer", more cost effective, and which could be completed within the established time frame. The Army was directed to report to Congress on potential alternative technologies by the end of 1993, and to include in that report: "any recommendations that the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] makes ..."&lt;ref name="ref10"/&gt; In June 2007, the disposal program achieved the milestone of reaching 45% destruction of the chemical weapon stockpile.&lt;ref name="ref18"/&gt; The [[United States Army Chemical Materials Agency|Chemical Materials Agency]]&amp;nbsp;(CMA) releases regular updates to the public regarding the status of the disposal program.&lt;ref name="ref19"/&gt; By October 2010, the program had reached 80% destruction status.&lt;ref name="ref40"/&gt;

== Lethality ==

Chemical weapons are said to "make deliberate use of the toxic properties of chemical substances to inflict death".&lt;ref name="ref20"/&gt; At the start of World War II it was widely reported in newspapers that "entire regions of Europe" would be turned into "lifeless wastelands".&lt;ref name="ref21"/&gt; However, chemical weapons were not used to the extent reported by a scaremongering press.

An unintended chemical weapon release occurred at the port of [[Bari]]. A [[Nazi Germany|German]] attack on the evening of December 2, 1943, damaged U.S. vessels in the harbour and the resultant release from their hulls of mustard gas inflicted a total of 628 casualties.&lt;ref name="ref22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref37"/&gt;

[[File:Gas shell (AWM 028467).jpg|thumb|left|An Australian observer who has moved into a gas-affected target area to record results, examines an un-exploded shell.]]

The U.S. Government was highly criticized for exposing American service members to chemical agents while testing the effects of exposure. These tests were often performed without the consent or prior knowledge of the soldiers affected.&lt;ref name="ref24"/&gt; Australian service personnel were also exposed as a result of the "Brook Island trials"&lt;ref name="ref34"/&gt; carried out by the British Government to determine the likely consequences of chemical warfare in tropical conditions; little was known of such possibilities at that time.

Some chemical agents are designed to produce mind-altering changes; rendering the victim unable to perform their assigned mission. These are classified as incapacitating agents, and lethality is not a factor of their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="ref25"/&gt;

== Exposure during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn ==

During Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn, service members who demolished or handled older explosive ordnance may have been exposed to blister agents (mustard agent) or nerve agents (sarin).&lt;ref name="AutoF5-2"/&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', "In all, American troops secretly reported finding roughly 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs, according to interviews with dozens of participants, Iraqi and American officials, and heavily redacted intelligence documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act."&lt;ref name=Chivers&gt;C. J. Chivers. The Secret Casualties of Iraq’s Abandoned Chemical Weapons. The New York Times. October 14, 2014. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/14/world/middleeast/us-casualties-of-iraq-chemical-weapons.html?nlid=64847459&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, over 2,400 nerve-agent rockets were found in summer 2006 at [[Camp Taji]], a former [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] compound. "These weapons were not part of an active arsenal"; "they were remnants from an Iraqi program in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war".&lt;ref name=Chivers/&gt;

The Department of Defense (DOD) wants to identify those who experienced symptoms following exposure to chemical warfare agent. The likelihood of long-term effects from a single exposure is related to the severity of the exposure. The severity of exposure is estimated from the onset of signs and symptoms coupled with how long it took for them to develop. DOD is interested in their symptoms and their current status. DOD wants to be sure that the exposure is documented in their medical record, that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is informed, and that they understand their future health risks. DOD can provide them with information regarding their exposure to share with their health care provider, and recommend follow-up if needed.
While DOD has identified some individuals, they are conducting medical record screenings on units, and reviewing Post Deployment Health Assessment and Reassessment forms to identify other exposed individuals. Because these methods have limitations, individuals are encouraged to self-identify by using the DOD Hotline: 800-497-6261.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Unitary versus binary weapons ==

{{Further information|Binary chemical weapon}}

Binary munitions contain two, unmixed and isolated chemicals that do not react to produce lethal effects until mixed. This usually happens just prior to battlefield use. In contrast, unitary weapons are lethal chemical munitions that produce a toxic result in their existing state.&lt;ref name="ref31"/&gt; The majority of the chemical weapon stockpile is unitary and most of it is stored in one-ton bulk containers.&lt;ref name="ref26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref27"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16210">The '''December 2010 Israeli rabbi letter controversy''' was a scandal that erupted surrounding the appearance of two [[open letter]]s, signed by a number of Israeli rabbis, that were discriminatory towards non-Jews in [[Israel]]. Although the letters sparked considerable outrage, evoking condemnation from prominent Israeli and [[American Jews]] and others, a poll showed that a sizeable portion of Israeli society supported the letters' messages.

== Letters==
=== Rabbis' letter === 
The rabbis' letter was a [[Posek|psak din]] ([[Halakha|religious]] ruling) signed by an estimated 50 [[rabbi]]s, that urged Israeli landowners not to rent apartments to [[Arab]]s, or any other non-Jews.&lt;ref name="Oster Safed rabbi refuses"&gt;{{cite news |date=3 January 2011 |author=Marcy Oster |title=Safed rabbi refuses police summons over anti-Arab letter |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |url=http://www.jta.org/2011/01/03/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/safed-rabbi-refuses-police-summons-over-anti-arab-letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was initiated by the [[chief rabbi]] of [[Safed]], [[Shmuel Eliyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 January 2011 |author=Kobi Nahshoni |title=Druckman: It's a rabbi's duty to voice opinions |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007553,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, 2011, Eliyahu was summoned to an [[Israeli police]] interrogation on suspicion of [[incitement]] to [[racism]], which is a crime in Israel,&lt;ref name="Nahshoni Safed rabbi interrogated"&gt;{{cite news |date=2 January 2011 |author=Kobi Nahshoni |title=Safed rabbi interrogated on incitement charges |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4008037,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he refused to answer the summons.&lt;ref name="Oster Safed rabbi refuses"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 December 2010 |author=Kobi Nahshoni  |title=Safed Rabbi fails to answer investigation summons |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the rabbis who signed the letter were municipal rabbis, state employees in charge of religious services, who receive salaries paid for by the taxpayer. Among the signers were rabbis from [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Ramat HaSharon]], [[Herzliya]], [[Kfar Saba]] and [[Holon]] (suburbs of [[Tel Aviv]]); from [[Jerusalem]]; and from other towns and settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 December 2010 |author=noam |title=50 Israeli Rabbis issue ruling forbidding renting of homes to Arabs |publisher=Promised Land |url=http://www.promisedlandblog.com/?p=3605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll conducted by the Harry S. Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], a narrow plurality of Jewish Israelis were opposed to the rabbis' call not to rent to Arabs: 48 percent opposed the statement, and 44 percent supported it.&lt;ref name=levinson&gt;Levinson, Chaim. (2010-11-19) [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/rabbis-wives-urge-israeli-women-stay-away-from-arab-men-1.333841 "Rabbis' wives urge Israeli women: Stay away from Arab men"] ''[[Haaretz]]''. Retrieved on 2011-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 December 2010 |title=Rebbetzins: Women, stay away from Arab men |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 December 2010 |author=Asaf Shtull-Trauring |title=Report: 44% of Israeli Jews Support Rabbis' Edict Forbidding Rentals to Arabs in Safed |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-44-of-israeli-jews-support-rabbis-edict-forbidding-rentals-to-arabs-in-safed-1.333825 |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebbetzins' letter ===
The second letter was released on December 28, 2010, by the [[Lehava]] organization. It was signed by at least 27 [[rebbetzin]]s (rabbis' wives). It urged young Jewish women to not date Arabs, and to not work at locations where non-Jews might be present.&lt;ref name=levinson/&gt;

==Response==
===Opposition===
==== Politicians and activists ====
* [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], [[Prime Minister of Israel]], and leader of the [[Likud]] party: On December 7, 2010, Netanyahu condemned the letter in a speech before the [[International Bible Contest]] for adults in [[Jerusalem]]. He stated: "How would we feel if we were told not to sell an apartment to Jews? We would protest, and we protest now when it is said of our neighbors"; and: "Such things cannot be said - not about Jews, and not about Arabs. They cannot be said in any democratic country, and especially not in a Jewish and democratic one. The state of Israel rejects these sayings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 December 2010 |author=Barak Ravid |author2=Chaim Levinson |title=Netanyahu Slams Top Rabbis' Call to Forbid Renting Homes to Arabs |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-slams-top-rabbis-call-to-forbid-renting-homes-to-arabs-1.329384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ehud Barak]], [[Deputy leaders of Israel#Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defense Minister]], and leader of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]] party: Barak stated that, "The rabbis' letters is part of a [[Racism|racist]] tidal wave threatening to sweep Israeli society into dark and dangerous zones. The Labor Party under my authority is working to draw all of Israel's citizens together, in the spirit of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]."&lt;ref name="ehud"&gt;{{cite news |date=29 December 2010 |author=Attila Somfalvi  |title=Barak: Rabbis', wives' letters part of racist tidal wave |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4006228,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  [[Reuven Rivlin]], [[Knesset]] [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] (Likud): Rivlin said to ''[[Haaretz]]'' in an interview that, "In my opinion, their statement shames the Jewish people... I see this general statement as an embarrassment to the Jewish people, and another nail in the coffin of Israeli democracy. Let me make this absolutely clear: I believe these people do the most damage to the state of Israel." He continued: "Israel can justify its faith in itself as a [[Jewish state]] only if it wields its democratic powers totally and unreservedly. This moral right will be taken from us if we prove to the world that, when it comes to democracy, we deny anything which does not suit us from a Jewish point of view." He also urged the [[Attorney General of Israel|attorney general]] to determine whether the letter constitutes the crime of [[incitement]].
* [[Avishay Braverman]], [[Minorities Minister of Israel|Minorities Affairs Minister]]: Braverman had called for Eliyahu's ouster as early as November 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 November 2010 |author=Jonah Mandel |title=Braverman calls to oust Safed rabbi for racial incitement |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Braverman-calls-to-oust-Safed-rabbi-for-racial-incitement}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 2010, Braverman threatened to push for his party, [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]], to quit the coalition, stating that, "There is a hatred of foreigners. The nation is turning into [[Iran]] following the rabbis' letter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 December 2010 |author=Attila Somfalvi |title=Minister Braverman threatens to quit, says Israel turning into Iran |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4003205,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemn the letter (which he later did), and take disciplinary action against state-employed signatories of the letter, saying in a statement that "Rabbis who are civil servants have an obligation to the entire public, including [[Israeli Arab|Israel's Arab citizens]]. It is unthinkable that they would use their public status to promote racism and incitement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/israeli-rabbis-ban-rental-sale-to-arabs | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Harriet | last=Sherwood | title=Dozens of Israeli rabbis back call to forbid sale of property to Arabs | date=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious organizations====
* Rabbi [[Aharon Lichtenstein]], dean of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], and a major [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] rabbinical figure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 December 2010 |author=[[Jeffrey Goldberg]] |title=A Bit of Good News on the Don't-Sell-to-the Arabs Controversy |work=[[The Atlantic]] |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/12/a-bit-of-good-news-on-the-dont-sell-to-the-arabs-controversy/67977/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein wrote a lengthy and erudite letter of opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=14 December 2010 |author=Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein  |title=Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein's Response to the Letter Banning Sale of Homes to Gentiles in Israel |publisher=Kol HaRav - Rabbinic Voices |url=http://kolharav.blogspot.com/2010/12/rabbi-aharon-lichtensteins-response-to.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rabbis [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]] and [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]], the leading [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] rabbis in Israel: Eliashiv and Steinman strongly condemned the edict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 December 2010 |author=Yair Ettinger |author2=Tomer Zarchin |title=Leading Rabbi Denounces Colleagues' Edict Against Renting Homes to non-Jews |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/leading-rabbi-denounces-colleagues-edict-against-renting-homes-to-non-jews-1.329769}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* U.S. rabbis: Numerous American rabbis also condemned the letter. An online petition for rabbis posted by the [[New Israel Fund]] on December 10, 2010, had nearly 1000 rabbis as  signatories by December 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=16 December 2010 |author=Naomi Paiss |title=Nearly 1000 of World’s Rabbis Urge Israeli Colleagues to Reject Racist Religious Ruling |publisher=[[New Israel Fund]] |url=http://www.nif.org/news-media/press-releases/press-release-nearly-1000-of-worlds-rabbis-urge-israeli-colleagues-to-reject-racist-religious-ruling/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition stated that "''Am Yisrael'' (The Jewish People) know(s) the sting of [[discrimination]], and we still bear the scars of hatred. When those who represent the official rabbinic leadership of the State of Israel express such positions, we are distressed by this [[Chillul Hashem|Chillul HaShem]] ([[desecration]] of [[Names of God in Judaism|God's name]])....Statements like these do great damage to our efforts to encourage people to love and support Israel. They communicate to our congregants that Israel does not share their values, and they promote feelings of alienation and distancing." Notable American rabbis who signed the petition included [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, executive vice president of the Conservative [[Rabbinical Assembly]]; [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Rabbi [[David Saperstein (rabbi)|David Saperstein]], the director of the [[Religious Action Center]] of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]); and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbis [[Avi Weiss]], the leader of the [[Hebrew Institute of Riverdale]], and Marc Angel. Signatories included members of all major American Jewish denominations. A separate condemnation was issued by the Orthodox [[Rabbinical Council of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 December 2010 |author=Josh Nathan-Kazis |title=U.S. Rabbis Offer Rare Rebuke of Israeli Edict |newspaper=[[The Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/news/133983/us-rabbis-offer-rare-rebuke-of-israeli-edict/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Israeli [[Conservative Judaism|Masorti]] rabbis: Roughly 50 Masorti rabbis signed a counter-letter allowing Jews to rent to non-Jews, while 40 female Israeli [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis representing the [[Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism]] issued a counter-letter proclaiming "professional and social contacts" between Jews and non-Jews to be positive, and that "Jews who are confident in their Jewish identity do not have to fear contact with people from other nations," a statement also supported by the council's 50 male Reform rabbis &lt;ref name="reform"&gt;{{cite news |date=30 December 2010 |author=Marcy Oster |title=Female Israeli Reform rabbis speak out in favor of contact with Arabs |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |url=http://www.jta.org/2010/12/30/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/female-israeli-reform-rabbis-speak-out-in-favor-of-contact-with-arabs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reform rabbis also argued that the rebbetzins' attitude toward Israeli girls was "condescending", portrayed them as "weak", and perpetuated [[male chauvinism]]. Their counter-letter encouraged Israelis not to listen to "hate-mongers and fanatics".&lt;ref name="chauvinism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4006254,00.html|title=Women Reform rabbis: Stop the hatred|publisher=Israel Jewish Scene|first=Kobi|last=Nashoni|accessdate=December 31, 2010|date=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Others ====
* A response letter was directed to the Israeli government by various Israeli academicians and artisans, criticizing the lax approach by the government to racial and religious incitement by rabbis, and calling for the prosecution of the original letter's signatories for incitement to racism. Among the signatories to the response letter were former politician [[Shulamit Aloni]], author [[Yoram Kaniuk]], sculptor [[Dani Karavan]], and politicians [[Zehava Gal-On]] and [[Naomi Hazan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007502,00.html|title = Intellectuals: Firing racist rabbis not enough|date = 2 January 2011|author = Yair Altman|publisher = [[Ynetnews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Holocaust survivor]]s condemned the letter. Noah Flug, the chairman of the International Association of Holocaust Survivors, stated that, "As someone who suffered as a Jew and underwent the [[Holocaust]], I remember the Nazis throwing Jews out of their apartments and city centres in order to create ghettos. I remember how they wrote on benches that no Jews were allowed, and, of course, it was prohibited to sell or rent to Jews. We thought that in our country, this wouldn't happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8233929/Holocaust-survivors-warn-of-stirrings-of-neo-fascism.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=Adrian | last=Blomfield | title=Holocaust survivors warn of stirrings of neo-fascism | date=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public opinion: When a poll was conducted of Jewish Israelis' reaction to the letters denouncing those who rent or sell homes to non-Jews, 48 per cent of Israeli Jews opposed the rabbis' call, while 44 per cent supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 December 2010 |author=Mark Weiss |title=Rabbis' wives call on Jews not to date Arabs |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8229831/Rabbis-wives-call-on-Jews-not-to-date-Arabs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
*Eliyahu was supported by members of the [[Knesset]] [[Ya'akov Katz (politician born 1951)|Ya'akov Katz]] and [[Uri Ariel]] of the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]], who condemned the "summoning to interrogation of the great leaders of Israel", and the "persecution of the [[Torah]] and its rabbis".&lt;ref name="Nahshoni Safed rabbi interrogated"/&gt; National Union MK [[Michael Ben-Ari]] proposed a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] (originally drafted by former MK [[Shmuel Halpert]] of [[Agudat Yisrael]]) that would give rabbis who work for the state [[immunity from prosecution]] from actions and pronouncements in connection with leadership duties or religious pronouncements, similar to the [[parliamentary immunity]] enjoyed by MKs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 December 2010 |author=Gil Ronen |title=Bill Would Grant Rabbis Immunity Regarding Freedom of Speech |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="106462">'''Employment discrimination''' is a form of [[discrimination]] based on [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[national origin]], [[physical disability|physical]] or [[Developmental disability|mental]] [[disability]], [[ageism|age]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[gender identity]] by employers. Earnings differentials or occupational differentiation—where differences in pay come from differences in qualifications or responsibilities—should not be confused with employment discrimination. Discrimination can be intended and involve [[disparate treatment]] of a group or be unintended, yet create [[disparate impact]] for a group.

== Definition ==
In [[neoclassical economics]] theory, labor market discrimination is defined as the different treatment of two equally qualified individuals on account of their [[gender]], [[race (biology)|race]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=R|last2=Ho|first2=B|year=2015|title=Job Acquisition, Retention, and Outcomes for Ethnic Minorities in Urban China|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15387216.2015.1049637|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|volume=56 |issue=1|pages=24–43|via=|doi=10.1080/15387216.2015.1049637}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[religion]], etc. [[Discrimination]] is harmful since it affects the economic outcomes of equally productive workers directly and indirectly through [[feedback]] effects.&lt;ref name=Blau&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blau |first1=Francine D. |last2=Ferber |first2=Marianne A. |last3=Winkler |first3=Anne E. | author-link1 = Francine D. Blau | author-link2 = Marianne Ferber |year=2010 |title=The Economics of Women, Men, and Work |chapter=Differences in Occupations and Earnings: The Role of Labor Market Discrimination |location=Harlow |publisher=Pearson Education |edition=6th international |pages= |isbn=978-0-1370-2436-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darity and Mason [1998] summarize that the standard approach used in identifying employment discrimination is to isolate group [[productivity]] differences ([[education]], work experience). Differences in outcomes (such as earnings, job placement) that cannot be attributed to worker qualifications are attributed to discriminatory treatment.&lt;ref name=Darity&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darity |first=William |first2=Patrick |last2=Mason |year=1998 |title=Evidence on Discrimination in Employment: Codes of Color, Codes of Gender |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=63–90 |doi= 10.1257/jep.12.2.63|jstor=2646962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the non-neoclassical view, discrimination is the main source of inequality in the labor market and is seen in the persistent gender and [[racial wage gap in the United States|racial earnings disparity]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt; Non-neoclassical economists define discrimination more broadly than [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists.]] For example, the feminist economist Deborah Figart [1997] defines labor market discrimination as “a multi-dimensional interaction of economic, social, political, and cultural forces in both the workplace and the family, resulting in different outcomes involving pay, employment, and status”.&lt;ref name=Figart&gt;{{cite journal |last=Figart |first=Deborah |year=1997 |title=Gender as More than a Dummy Variable: Feminist Approaches to Discrimination |journal=Review of Social Economy |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=1–32 |doi=10.1080/00346769700000022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{rp|237}} ! This source does not have a page 237 --&gt; That is, discrimination is not only about measurable outcomes but also about unquantifiable consequences. It is important to note that the process is as important as the outcomes.&lt;ref name=Figart /&gt; Furthermore, gender [[norm (social)|norm]]s are embedded in [[labor markets]] and shape [[employer]] preferences as well worker preferences; therefore, it is not easy to separate discrimination from productivity-related inequality.&lt;ref name=Elson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elson |first1=Diane | author-link1 = Diane Elson |year=1999 |title=Labor markets as gendered institutions: equality, efficiency and empowerment issues |journal=World Development |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=611–627 |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00147-8 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00147-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although labor market inequalities have declined after the U.S. [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the movement towards equality has slowed down after the mid-1970s, especially more in gender terms than racial terms.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundstrom&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sundstrom |first=William A. |year=1994 |title=The Color Line: Racial Norms and Discrimination in Urban Labor Markets, 1910–1950 |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=382–396 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700014534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key issue in the debate on employment discrimination is the persistence of discrimination, namely, why discrimination persists in a capitalist economy.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

== Evidence ==

=== Statistical ===
[[Gender earnings gap]] or the concentration of men and women workers in different occupations or industries in and of itself is not [[evidence]] of discrimination.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt; Therefore, empirical studies seek to identify the extent to which earnings differentials are due to worker qualification differences. Many studies find that qualification differences do not explain more than a portion of the earnings differences. The portion of the earnings gap that cannot be explained by qualifications is then attributed to discrimination. One prominent formal procedure for identifying the explained and unexplained portions of the gender wage differentials or wage gap is the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition procedure.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

Another type of statistical evidence of discrimination is gathered by focusing on [[homogeneous]] groups. This approach has the advantage of studying economic outcomes of groups with very similar qualifications.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

A 2017 study found that minorities receive a lower boost to earnings from legal education than whites and were less likely to practice law. However, it is difficult to determine the extent to which this is the result of racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Race"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=Frank|last2=Simkovic|first2=Michael|title=Are law degrees as valuable to minorities?|journal=International Review of Law &amp; Economics|volume=53|pages=23|doi=10.1016/j.irle.2017.09.004|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3037749|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a well-known longitudinal study, the [[University of Michigan Law School]] (U.S.A.) graduates were surveyed between 1987 and 1993, and later between 1994 and 2000 to measure the changes in the wage gap.&lt;ref name=Noonen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noonen |first=Mary C. |first2=Mary E. |last2=Corcoran |first3=Paul |last3=Courant |year=2005 |title=Pay Differences Among the Highly Trained: Cohort Differences in the Sex Gap in Lawyers’ Earnings |journal=Social Forces |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=853–872 |doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was intentionally chosen to have very similar characteristics. Although the gap in earnings between men and women was very small immediately after graduation, it widened in 15 years to the point that women earned 60 percent of what men earned. Even after factoring in women's choice of working for fewer hours, and worker qualifications and other factors, such as grades in law school and detailed work history data, in 2000 men were ahead of women by 11 percent in their earnings, which might be attributed to discrimination.

Other studies on relatively homogeneous group of college graduates produced a similar unexplained gap, even for the highly educated women, such as [[Harvard Business School|Harvard MBAs]] in the United States. One such study focused on gender wage differences in 1985 between the [[college]] [[graduates]].&lt;ref name=Weinberger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinberger |first=Catherine J. |year=1998 |title=Race and Gender Wage Gaps in the Market for Recent College Graduates |journal=Industrial Relations |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1111/0019-8676.721998035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduates were chosen from the ones who earned their degree one or two years earlier. The researchers took college major, GPA (grade point average) and the educational institution the graduates attended into consideration. Yet, even after these factors were accounted for, there remained a 10-15 percent pay gap based on gender. Another study based on a 1993 survey of all college graduates had similar results for black and white women regarding gender differences in earnings.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Dan A. |first2=Amelia M. |last2=Haviland |first3=Seth G. |last3=Sanders |first4=Lowell J. |last4=Taylor |year=2008 |title=Gender Wage Disparities Among the Highly Educated |journal=[[Journal of Human Resources]] |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=630–659 |doi=10.3368/jhr.43.3.630 |pmc=4470569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both black women and white women made less money compared to white, non-Hispanic men. However, the results of earnings were mixed for [[Hispanic]] and Asian women when their earnings were compared to white, non-Hispanic men. A 2006 study looked at Harvard graduates.&lt;ref name=Goldin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldin |first=Claude |first2=Lawrence F. |last2=Katz |year=2008 |title=Transitions: Career and Family Life Cycles of the Educational Elite |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=363–369 |jstor=29730048 |doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers also controlled for educational performance such as GPA, [[SAT]] scores and college major, as well as time out of work and current [[Job (role)|occupation]]. The results showed 30 percent of the wage gap was unexplained. Therefore, although not all of the unexplained gaps attribute to discrimination, the results of the studies signal gender discrimination, even if these women are highly educated. Human capitalists argue that measurement and data problems contribute to this unexplained gap.&lt;ref name=Noonen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberger /&gt;&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldin /&gt;

One very recent example of employment discrimination is to be seen among female [[Chief Financial Officers]] (CFOs) in the US. Although 62% of accountants and auditors are women, they are only 9% when it comes to the CFO post. According to the research not only are they underrepresented in the profession, but they are also underpaid, 16% less on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/corporate-strategy/corporate-strategy/female-cfos-may-be-best-remedy-against-discrimination/ |title=Female CFOs May Be Best Remedy Against Discrimination |date=5 February 2013 |first=Max |last=Chase |work=CFO Insight |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209181502/http://www.cfo-insight.com/corporate-strategy/corporate-strategy/female-cfos-may-be-best-remedy-against-discrimination/ |archivedate=2013-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From experiments ===
Audit (or matched pairs) studies are done to examine hiring discrimination. In order to examine racial discrimination, the [[Urban Institute]] relied on a matched pairs study.&lt;ref name=Fix&gt;{{cite book |last=Fix |first=Michael |first2=George C. |last2=Galster |first3=Raymond J. |last3=Struck |year=1993 |chapter=An Overview of Auditing for Discrimination |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Fix |editor2-first=Raymond |editor2-last=Struyk |title=Clear and Convincing Evidence: Measurement of Discrimination in America |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Urban Institute Press |isbn=0-87766-599-0 |pages=1–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They studied the employment outcomes for [[Hispanic]], white and black men who were between the ages 19–25 in the early 1990s. The job position was entry-level. Thus, they matched pairs of black and white men and pairs of Hispanic and non-Hispanic men as testers. The testers applied for the advertised openings for the new positions. All of the testers were given fabricated [[resumes]] where all characteristics but their race/ethnicity was nearly identical. In addition, they went through training sessions for the interviews. If both people in the pair were offered the job or if both were rejected, the conclusion was there was no discrimination. However, if one person from the pair was given the job while the other was rejected, then they concluded there was discrimination. The Institute found out that black men were three times more likely to be refused for a job compared to white men; while the Hispanic men were three times more likely to be discriminated.

The Fair Employment Council of Greater [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Inc. did a similar test for women via pairing testers by race.&lt;ref name=Bendick&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bendick |first=Marc Jr. |first2=Charles W. |last2=Jackson |first3=Victor A. |last3=Reinoso |year=1994 |title=Measuring Employment Discrimination through Controlled Experiments |journal=Review of Black Political Economy |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=25–48 |doi=10.1007/BF02895739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the white female testers had higher chances of call back for [[interviews]] and job offers compared to black female testers. The percentage for interviews was by 10 percent more for the white testers. Among those interviewed, 50 percent white women were offered the job, while only 11 percent of black candidates received jobs offers. The white testers were also offered higher pay for the same job in cases where the same job was also offered to the black testers. The pay difference was 15 cents per hour more for the white candidates. Furthermore, black women were "steered" toward lower level jobs, while white women were even given some higher-level positions that were unadvertised.

A matched-pairs study of homogeneous group audit experiment was done in the restaurants in [[Philadelphia]], United States.&lt;ref name=Neumark&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumark |first=David |first2=Roy J. |last2=Blank |first3=Kyle D. |last3=Van Nort |year=1996 |title=Sex Discrimination in Restaurant Hiring: An Audit Study |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=915–942 |doi=10.2307/2946676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo]] candidates handed their resumes to a random worker in the restaurants for the resume to be forwarded to the manager, which removed the effect of first impression on the employer. Also, the resumes were written in a three-level scale based on the qualifications of the pseudo applicants and resumes for each qualification level were delivered in three separate weeks. The results showed that male applicants were favored significantly. Men had higher interview callbacks or job offers. In addition, men did even better in high-pay restaurants compared to low-pay ones. In the low-price restaurants, for each man who received a job offer, the woman was rejected 29 percent of the time. There were no such cases where a man did not get the job offer but a woman did. In the high-priced restaurants, when the man got an offer, the woman was rejected 43 percent of the time. The same pattern that signaled discrimination was observed for the interviews. At the high-priced restaurants, women had 40 percent less chance of being interviewed and 50 percent less chance of receiving the job. Therefore, based on this study, it is correct to conclude discrimination in the same job may lead to gender wage discrimination. Note the high-priced restaurants are more likely to offer higher wages and higher [[tip (gratuity)|tips]] for its workers compared to those with low prices.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

Another experiment is the study of the effect of "blind" [[symphony]] orchestra [[auditions]] by Goldin and Rouse.&lt;ref name=Rouse&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rouse |first=Cecilia |first2=Claude |last2=Goldin |year=2000 |title=Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of ‘Blind’ Auditions on Female Musicians |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=715–741 |doi=10.1257/aer.90.4.715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the gender of the candidate was not known by the election committee because the auditions were done behind a curtain. Thus, only the skills were considered. As a result, the number of women accepted increased after “blind” auditions from less than 5 percent in 1970 to 25 percent in 1996 in the top five [[symphony orchestras]] in the U.S. In other words, a change occurred. This study tests for discrimination directly. The finding implies there was gender discrimination against woman musicians before the adoption of the screen on identity.  However, this discriminatory practice was eliminated after the adoption and only qualifications of the individuals were taken into account.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

Darity and Mason [1998] summarize results of discriminatory behavior observed in other countries on the basis of "correspondence tests".&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt; In this type of tests, the researchers design fabricated resumes that signal the ethnicity of the pseudo applicants via the names on the resumes and send these letters to the employers. However, the qualifications written in the resumes are comparable.  In [[England]], [[Afro-American]], [[Indian people|Indian]] or [[Pakistani]] names were not called back for the interviews but Anglo-Saxons were called.&lt;ref name=Riach&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riach |first=Peter B. |first2=Judith |last2=Rich |year=1991–92 |title=Measuring Discrimination By Direct Experimental Methods Seeking Gunsmoke |journal=[[Journal of Post Keynesian Economics]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=143–150 |jstor=4538285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australian]] audits, [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] names had the same result; Anglo-Saxons were favored.&lt;ref name=Riach /&gt; According to the experiment done in the [[University of Michigan]]’s study,&lt;ref name=Arce&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arce |first=Carlos H. |first2=Eduard |last2=Murguia |first3=W.

=== From court cases ===
Darity and Mason [1998] summarize the court cases on discrimination, in which employers were found guilty and huge awards were rewarded for [[plaintiffs]]. They argue that such cases establish the existence of discrimination.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt; The plaintiffs were women or non-whites (St. Petersburg Times, 1997; Inter Press Service, 1996; The Chicago Tribune, 1997; The New York Times, 1993; the Christian Science Monitor, 1983; Los Angeles Times, 1996). Some examples are the following: In 1997, the allegations for the Publix Super Markets were “gender biases in on the job training, promotion, tenure and layoff policies; wage discrimination; occupational segregation; [[hostile work environment]]” (St. Petersburg Times, 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;77). In 1996, allegations for Texaco were “racially discriminatory hiring, promotion and salary policies” (Inter Press Service, 1996; The Chicago Tribune, 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;77). The six black workers, who were the plaintiffs, gave the taped racist comments of the white corporate officials as evidence (Inter Press Service, 1996; The Chicago Tribune, 1997). In 1983, the General Motors Corporation was sued both for gender and racial discrimination (the Christian Science Monitor, 1983). In 1993, the Shoney International was accused of “racial bias in promotion, tenure, and layoff policies; wage discrimination; hostile work environment (The New York Times, 1993, pp. 77) ”. The victims were granted $105 million (The New York Times, 1993). In 1996, the plaintiffs of the Pitney Bowes, Inc. case were granted $11.1 million (Los Angeles Times, 1996).

== Neoclassical explanations ==
Neoclassical [[Employment|labor]] economists explain the existence and persistence of discrimination based on tastes for discrimination and statistical discrimination theories. While overcrowding model moves away from neoclassical theory, the [[institutional]] models are non-neoclassical.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

=== Tastes for discrimination ===
The [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Gary Becker]] claimed the markets punish the companies that discriminate because it is costly. His argument is as following:&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;Murphy, Robert P. 2010. [https://books.google.com/books?id=50qHcSNVVEMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Economics of Discrimination], Library of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The profitability of the company that discriminates is decreased, and the loss is "directly proportional to how much the employer's decision was based on prejudice, rather than on merit." Indeed, choosing a worker with lower performance (in comparison to salary) causes losses proportional to the difference in performance. Similarly, the customers who discriminate against certain kinds of workers in favor of less effective have to pay more for their services, in the average.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

If a company discriminates, it typically loses profitability and market share to the companies that do not discriminate, unless the state limits free competition protecting the discriminators.&lt;ref name=Discrimination&gt;Discrimination, The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Library of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a counter-argument against Becker's claim. As Becker conceptualized, discrimination is the personal prejudice or a "taste" associated with a specific group, originally formulated to explain employment discrimination based on race. The theory is based on the idea that markets punish the discriminator in the long run as discrimination is costly in the long run for the discriminator. There are three types of discrimination, namely: employer, employee and customer.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundstrom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Gary S. |year=1971 |title=The Economics of Discrimination |edition=2nd |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04115-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first one, the [[employer]] has a taste for discriminating against women and is willing to pay the higher cost of hiring men instead of women. Thus, the non-pecuniary cost brings an additional cost of discrimination in [[dollar]] terms; the full cost of employing women is the wage paid plus this additional cost of discrimination. For the total cost of men and women to be equal, women are paid less than men. In the second type, the male employees have a distaste for working with women employees. Because of the non-pecuniary cost, they must be paid more than women. In the third type, the customers or clients have a distaste for being served by woman employees. Therefore, the [[customers]] are willing to pay higher prices for a good or a service in order not to be served by women. The as-if non-pecuniary cost is associated with purchasing goods or services from women.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt;

Becker's theory states that discrimination cannot exist in the long run because it is costly. However, discrimination seems to persist in the long run&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Reginald. (2010). "Discrimination, Complexity, and the Public/Private Sector Question." Work and Occupations 37(4): 435-475. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0730888410380152 &lt;/ref&gt;; it declined only after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], as it was seen in the economic history.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundstrom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; Regardless, it is argued that Becker's theory holds for occupational segregation. For instance, men are more likely to work as truck drivers, or the female customers are more likely to choose to be served by women lingerie salespersons because of preferences.  However, this segregation cannot explain the wage differentials. In other words, occupational [[Racial segregation|segregation]] is an outcome of group-typing of employment between different groups but consumer discrimination does not cause wage differentials. Thus, customer discrimination theory fails to explain the combination of employment segregation and the wage differentials. However, the data points out the jobs associated with women suffer from lower pay.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

=== Statistical discrimination ===
{{main article|Statistical discrimination (economics)}}

Edmund Phelps [1972] introduced the assumption of [[uncertainty]] in hiring decisions.&lt;ref name=Phelps&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phelps |first=Edmund S. |year=1972 |title=The Statistical Theory of Racism and Sexism |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=659–661 |jstor=1806107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When employers make a hiring decision, although they can scrutinize the qualifications of the applicants, they cannot know for sure which applicant would perform better or would be more stable. Thus, they are more likely to hire the male applicants over the females, if they believe on ''average'' men are more [[productive]] and more stable. This general view affects the decision of the employer about the individual on the basis of information on the group averages.

Blau et al. [2010] point out the harmful consequences of discrimination via feedback effects regardless of the initial cause of [[discrimination]]. The non-neoclassical insight that is not part of the statistical discrimination sheds light onto uncertainty. If a woman is given less firm-specific training and is assigned to lower-paid jobs where the cost of her resigning is low based on the general view of women, then this woman is more likely to quit her job, fulfilling the expectations, thus to reinforce group averages held by employers. However, if the employer invests a lot on her, the chance that she will stay is higher.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

== Non-neoclassical approach ==

=== Overcrowding model ===
This non-neoclassical model was first developed by Bergmann.&lt;ref name=Bergman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergman |first=Barbara R. |year=1974 |title=Occupational Segregation, Wages and Profits When Employers Discriminate by Race or Sex |journal=Eastern Economic Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=103–110 |jstor=40315472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, outcome of the occupational segregation is wage differentials between two genders. The reasons for segregation may be socialization, individual decisions, or labor market discrimination. Wage differentials occur when the job opportunities or [[demand]] for the female-dominated sector is less than the supply of women. According to the evidence, in general female dominated jobs pay less than male dominated jobs. The pay is low because of the high number of women who choose female dominated jobs or they do not have other opportunities.

When there is no discrimination in the market and both female and male workers are equally productive, wages are the same regardless of type of the job, F or M jobs. Assume the [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] wages in job F is higher than that of the M jobs. Intuitively, the workers in the less paying job will transfer to the other sector. This movement ceases only when the wages in two sectors are equal. Therefore, when the market is free of discrimination, wages are the same for different types of jobs, provided that there is sufficient time for adjustment and attractiveness of each job is the same.

When there is [[discrimination]] in the M jobs against women workers, or when women prefer the F jobs, economic outcomes change. When there is a limit of available M jobs, its supply decreases; thus, wages of the M jobs increase. Because women cannot enter to the M jobs or they choose the F jobs, they “crowd” into F jobs. Consequently, higher supply of F jobs decreases its wage rates. Briefly, segregation causes the gender wage differentials regardless of the equal skills.

Another striking point of overcrowding model is productivity. Since women in the F jobs cost less it is [[rational choice theory|rational]] to substitute labor for capital. On the contrary, it is rational to substitute capital for labor in the M jobs. Therefore, overcrowding causes wage differentials and it makes women less productive although they were ''potentially'' equally productive initially.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

The question of why women prefer working in female-dominated sectors is an important one. Some advocate this choice stems from [[inherently]] different talents or preferences; some insist it is due to the differences in socialization and division of labor in the [[household]]; some believe it is because of discrimination in some occupations.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

=== Institutional models ===
Institutional models of discrimination indicate labor markets are not as flexible as it is explained in the competitive models. Rigidities are seen in the institutional arrangements, or in the monopoly power. Race and gender differences overlap with labor market institutions. Women occupy certain jobs as versus men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf |first=M. |last=Pasternak |title=Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications |volume=33 |journal=[[North Carolina Central Law Review|N. C. Cent. L. Rev.]] |year=2011 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, institutional models do not explain discrimination but describe how labor markets work to disadvantage women and blacks. Thus, institutional models do not subscribe to the neoclassical definition of discrimination.&lt;ref name=Piore&gt;{{cite book |last=Piore |first=Michael J. |chapter=The Dual Labor Market: Theory and Implications |title=Problems in Political Economy: an Urban Perspective |editor-first=David M. |editor-last=Gordon |year=1971 |location=Lexington |publisher=Heath |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The internal labor market ====
The firms hire workers outside or use internal [[workforce]] based on worker progress, which plays a role in climbing the [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] ladder. Big firms usually put the workers into groups in order to have similarity within the groups. When employers think certain groups have different characteristics related to their productivity, statistical discrimination may occur. Consequently, workers might be segregated based on [[gender]] and race.&lt;ref name=Doeringer&gt;{{cite book |last=Doeringer |first=Peter B. |first2=Micheal J. |last2=Piore |year=1971 |title=Internal Labor Markets and Manpower Analysis |location=Lexington |publisher=Heath |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Primary and secondary jobs ====
Peter Doeringer and Michael Piore [1971] established the dual labor market model.&lt;ref name=Doeringer /&gt; In this model, primary jobs are the ones with high firm-specific skills, high wages, good promotion opportunities and long-term attachment. On the contrary, secondary jobs are the ones with less skill requirement, lower wages, less promotion opportunities and higher labor turnover. The dual labor market model combined with the gender discrimination suggests that men dominate the primary jobs and that women are over-represented in the secondary jobs.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

The difference between primary and secondary jobs also creates productivity differences, such as different level of on-the-job [[training]]. Moreover, women have lower incentives for stability since benefits of secondary jobs are less.&lt;ref name=Doeringer /&gt;

Moreover, lack of informal networking from male colleagues, visualizing women in the female dominated jobs and lack of encouragement do affect the economic outcomes for women. They are subject to unintentional institutional discrimination, which alters their productivity, promotion, and earnings negatively.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

The under-representation of women in top-level management might be explained by the “pipeline” [[argument]] which states that women are newcomers and it takes time to move toward the upper levels. The other argument is about barriers that prevent women from advance positions. However, some of these barriers are non-discriminatory. Work and family conflicts is an example of why there are fewer females in the top corporate positions.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

Yet, both the pipeline and work-family [[conflict (process)|conflict]] together cannot explain the very low representation of women in the corporations. Discrimination and subtle barriers still count as a factor for preventing women from exploring opportunities. Moreover, it was found out that when the chairman or CEO of the corporation was a woman, the number of women working in the high level positions and their earnings increased around 10-20 percent. The effect of female under-representation on earnings is seen in the 1500 S&amp;P firms studied. The findings indicate women executives earn 45 percent less than male executives based on the 2.5 percent of executives in the sample. Some of the gap is due to seniority, yet mostly it was because of the under-representation of women in [[CEO]], chair or president positions and the fact that women managed smaller companies.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

Non-neoclassical economists point out subtle barriers play a huge role in women's disadvantage. These barriers are difficult to document and to remove. For instance, women are left out of male's network. Moreover, the general perception is men are better at managing others, which is seen in the Catalyst's Fortune 1000 survey. The 40 percent of women executives said that they believed man had difficulty when they were managed by women. A separate study found out majority believed in “women, more than men, manifest leadership styles associated with effective performance as leaders,… more people prefer male than female bosses”.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt; In another study in the U.S. about origins of gender division of labor, people were asked these two questions “When jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women?” and “On the whole, men make better political leaders than women do?”  Some answers indicated discriminatory act.&lt;ref name=Alesina&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alesina |first=A. |last2=Giuliano |first2=P. |last3=Nunn |first3=N. |year=2013 |title=On the Origins of Gender Roles: Women and the Plough |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=469–530 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjt005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of the neoclassical approach ==
Neoclassical economics ignores logical explanations of how self-fulfilling prophecy by the employers affect the motivation and psychology of women and minority groups and thus it alters the decision making of individuals regarding human capital.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt; This is the [[feedback]] explanation that correlates with the drop in [[human capital]] investment (such as more schooling or training) attainment by women and minorities.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

Moreover, power and social relationships link discrimination to sexism and racism, which is ignored in the neoclassical theory. Furthermore, along with the classical and Marxist theory of competition, racial-gender structure of the job is related to the bargaining power and thus wage differential. Therefore, [[discrimination]] persists since racial and gender characteristics shape who gets the higher paying jobs, both within and between occupations. In short, the power relationships are embedded in the labor market, which are neglected in the neoclassical approach.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodgers&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodgers |first=Janine |first2=Jill |last2=Rubery |year=2003 |title=The Minimum Wage as a Tool to Combat Discrimination and Promote Equality |journal=International Labour Review |volume=142 |issue=4 |pages=543–556 |doi=10.1111/j.1564-913X.2003.tb00543.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, critics have argued that the neoclassical [[measurement]] of discrimination is flawed.&lt;ref name=Figart /&gt; As Figart [1997] points out, conventional methods do not put gender or race into the heart of the analysis and they measure discrimination as the unexplained residual. As a result, we are not informed about the causes and nature of discrimination. She argues that gender and race should not be marginal to the analysis but at the center and suggests a more dynamic analysis for discrimination. Figart argues gender is more than a dummy variable since gender is fundamental to the economy. Moreover, the segmentation in the labor market, institutional variables and non-market factors affect wage differentials and women dominate low-paid occupations. Again, none of these is because of productivity differentials nor are they the outcome of [[voluntary action|voluntary]] choices. Figart also indicates how women's jobs are associated with unskilled work. For that reason, men don't like association of “their” jobs with women or femininity, skills are engendered.&lt;ref name=Figart /&gt;

Although empirical evidence is a tool to use to prove discrimination, it is important to pay attention to the biases involved in using this tool. The biases might cause under or over-estimation of labor market discrimination. There is lack of information on some individual qualifications which indeed affect their potential productivity. The factors such as motivation or work effort, which affects incomes, are difficult to be scaled. Moreover, information regarding the type of college degree may not be available. In short, all the job qualification related factors are not included to study gender wage gap.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

An example for [[underestimation]] is the feedback effect of labor market discrimination. That is, women may choose to invest less in human capital such as pursuing a college degree based on the current wage gap, which is also a result of discrimination against women. Another reason may be the childbearing responsibilities of women standing as a negative impact on women's careers since some women may choose to withdraw from the labor market with their own will. By doing so, they give up opportunities, such as the firm-specific training that would have potentially helped with their job promotion or reduction in the wage gap. An example of over-estimation of gender discrimination is men might have been more motivated at work. Therefore, it is wrong to equate unexplained wage gap with discrimination, although most of the gap is a result of discrimination, but ''not all''.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;
 
Furthermore, empirical evidence can also be twisted to show that discrimination does not exist or it is so trivial that it can be ignored. This was seen in the results and interpretation of the results of Armed Forces Qualifying Test, (AFQT). Neal and Johnson [1996] claimed the economic differences in the black and white labor markets were due to the "pre-market factors," not to discrimination.&lt;ref name=Neal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neal |first=Derek A. |first2=William R. |last2=Johnson |year=1996 |title=The Role of Premarket Factors in Black-White Wage Differences |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=104 |issue=5 |pages=869–895 |jstor=2138945 |doi=10.1086/262045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darity and Mason's [1998] study of the same case disagrees with the findings of Neal and Johnson's [1996]. They take into account factors such as age family background, school quality and [[psychology]] into consideration to make the adjustments.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

== Theoretical bases of discrimination relating to employment ==
There are legal and structural theories forming the basis of employment discrimination.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Goldman, Barry M., et al. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barry_Goldman3/publication/240249086_Employment_Discrimination_in_Organizations_Antecedents_and_Consequences/links/53e28f220cf275a5fdd9f33d/Employment-Discrimination-in-Organizations-Antecedents-and-Consequences.pdf Employment discrimination in organizations: Antecedents and consequences]." ''Journal of Management'' 32.6 (2006): 786-830.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal Theories ===
The pinnacle of anti-employment discrimination law is [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. In this section, two theories are laid out: disparate treatment and disparate impact.

[[Disparate treatment]] is what most people commonly think of discrimination- intentional. Under this theory, the employee must belong to a [[protected class]], apply and be qualified for a job where the employer was seeking applicants, and get rejected from the job. The job position must then still be open post-rejection for a discrimination case to be made.

In many cases, the courts found it difficult to prove intentional discrimination, thus the [[disparate impact]] legal theory was added. It covers the more complicated side of discrimination where "some work criterion was fair in form but discriminatory in practice". Employees must prove that the employment practices used by an employer causes disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; To help with cases, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] established a four-fifths rule where federal enforcement agencies takes a "selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths" as evidence for disparate impact.&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP). 1978. 29 C. F. R. section 1607.4D.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural Theories ===
In a concept called "[[Tokenism|token]] dynamics", there are three noticeable occurrences in discrimination: "visibility that leads to performance pressures, contrast effects that lead to social isolation of the token, and role encapsulation or stereotyping of the token". In the first occurrence, the token is noticeable because of his or her race, age, sex, or physical disability which is different from the majority of workers. This visibility directs more attention to the token and he or she is subjected to more pressure from superiors when compared to other employees. Not only is this token scrutinized more, but there is an unspoken expectation that his or her performance is a representation of all members of his or her group. A common example is a solo female engineer. Her work is examined under a more judgmental gaze than her male coworkers because of her minority status. If she were to underperform, her failures speak on behalf of all female engineers; thus their ability to be seen as successful engineers is threatened. In the second occurrence of contrast, differences between tokens and the majority are emphasized which isolates the token group and increases unity among the majority. Going along with the previous example, male engineers "may start to identify themselves as men, instead of simply as engineers, once a token woman engineer shows up. Moreover, they may notice characteristics they may have in common that the token lacks, such as experience in the military or team sports". The third occurrence, stereotyping, is its own theory discussed below.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Behavioral scientists classify [[Stereotype|stereotyping]] into prescriptive and descriptive. "Prescriptive stereotypes specify how men and women, ''should'' behave, whereas descriptive stereotypes specify how men and women, ''do'' behave". In the field of employment, descriptive stereotyping is more applicable and occurs more often. One common example is when superiors assume a woman will be upset if criticized, so they might not provide the accurate feedback the woman needs to improve. This then hinders her chances of promotion, especially when superiors have given men, who they believe will "take it like a man", the information they need to improve their performance.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This kind of stereotyping can also affect what jobs employers give to their male and female applicants. Men and women are frequently "matched" with jobs that are themselves stereotyped according to the different characteristics and duties associated with the job. The most significant example is the top position of CEO or manager which has been associated with male traits for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Schein, V. E., Mueller, R., Lituchy, T., &amp; Liu, J. 1996. Think manager-Think male: A global phenomenon? ''Journal of Organizational Behavior,'' 17(1): 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences of discrimination ==
Employment discrimination can have individual, group, and organizational consequences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Goldman, Barry M., et al. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barry_Goldman3/publication/240249086_Employment_Discrimination_in_Organizations_Antecedents_and_Consequences/links/53e28f220cf275a5fdd9f33d/Employment-Discrimination-in-Organizations-Antecedents-and-Consequences.pdf Employment discrimination in organizations: Antecedents and consequences]." ''Journal of Management'' 32.6 (2006): 786-830.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual ===
Perceived discrimination in the workplace has been found to have negative effects on an individual's body and mind- mainly blood pressure, heart disease, psychological distress, and self-reported health. In a study from 1977 to 1982, women who perceived they were experiencing discrimination were 50% more likely to have a physical limitation in 1989 compared to those who did not perceive discriminatory experiences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Noh, S., Beiser, M., Kaspar, V., Hou, F, &amp; Rummens, J. 1999. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Feng_Hou2/publication/12787627_Perceived_Racial_Discrimination_Depression_and_Coping_A_Study_of_Southeast_Asian_Refugees_in_Canada/links/5705367408ae44d70ee30d74/Perceived-Racial-Discrimination-Depression-and-Coping-A-Study-of-Southeast-Asian-Refugees-in-Canada.pdf Perceived racial discrimination, depression, and coping:A study of Southeast Asian refugees in Canada]. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior,'' 40(3): 193-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two common ways of reacting to discrimination: emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping. In the former, individuals protect their self-esteem by attributing any discrepancies in hiring or promotion to discrimination instead of reflecting on their own potential shortcomings. In the latter, individuals attempt to change aspects of themselves that caused them to be discriminated against to prevent themselves from future discrimination. Some common examples are obese people losing weight or mentally ill people seeking therapy. This approach can only be sought out when the point of discrimination is not unchangeable like race or age.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Crocker, J., &amp; Major, B. 1989. [https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/week6/Crocker.Major1989.pdf Social stigma and self-esteem: The self-protective properties of stigma]. ''Psychological Review,'' 96(4): 608-630.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group ===
Unlike the individual level, discrimination at the group level can induce feelings of fear and mistrust within the group discriminated which often results in inhibited performance. The effects are most commonly seen with age, disability, and race and ethnicity.

Age discrimination is prevalent because companies have to consider how long older works will stay and the costs of their health insurance accordingly. When companies let these insecurities affect their treatment of older workers- hostile work environment, demotions, lower employment rates-, these older workers who perceive this discrimination are 59% more likely to leave their current job.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Johnson, R. W., &amp; Neumark, D. 1997. [http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6708231.pdf Age discrimination, job separations, and employment status of older workers: Evidence from self-reports]. ''Journal of Human Resources,'' 32(4): 779-811.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there are currently anti-discrimination laws on disability, namely the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], discrimination against weight is still prevalent. What makes the issue complicated is the fact that obesity only counts as a disability when someone is "morbidly obese" (100% over their ideal body weight) or obese (20% over their ideal body weight) as a result of psychological conditions. Considering that only 0.5% of people in the United States are morbidly obese, 99.5% of obese individuals have the burden to prove their excess weight comes from psychological causes if they are to be protected from anti-discrimination law.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Roehling, M. V. 1999. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1999.tb00186.x Weight-based discrimination in employment: Psychological and legal aspects]. ''Personnel'' ''Psychology,'' 52(4): 969-1016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another body of people that face widespread group discrimination are racial minorities, mainly Blacks and Hispanics. They are rated as less favorable than White applicants and this kind of prejudice makes them "suffer from increased role ambiguity, role conflict, and work tension, as well as decreased organizational commitment and job satisfaction".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Sanchez, J. I., &amp; Brock, P. 1996.

=== Organizational ===
Companies hurt from their own discriminatory practices on a legal, economic, and [[reputational risk]] basis. In 2005 alone, 146,000 charges of discrimination were filed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Discrimination litigation can be very expensive when taking into account the time spent in court and the outcome of the ruling where the possibility of settlement money comes in to play as well as "hiring, promotion, backpay, or reinstatement" for the prosecutor.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Neumark, D. 2003. [http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~dneumark/Neumark%20CEP%202003.pdf Age discrimination legislations in the United States]. ''Contemporary Economic Policy,'' 21: 297-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Public cases of discrimination, regardless of being taken to court, has a negative effect on a company's reputation which typically decreases sales.

Another viewpoint on discrimination affecting profit is that companies may not be using their employees they discriminate to the best of their ability. Some see these employees as an "untapped niche"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (a small, specialist field or group that has not been used to its full potential) especially since diversity management is positively correlated with corporate financial performance.&lt;ref&gt;Orlitzy, F. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Rynes, S. L. 2003. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/edf6/e716313300a0690cd73508c8931a97bad9ec.pdf Corporate social and financial performance: A meta-analysis]. ''Organizational Studies,'' 24(3): 403-441.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Government’s efforts to combat discrimination ==

=== Why the government should intervene to address discrimination ===
Blau et al. [2010] sum up the argument for [[government intervention]] to address discrimination. First, discrimination prevents equity or fairness, when an equally qualified person does not receive equal treatment as another on account of race or gender. Second, discrimination results in inefficient allocation of [[resources]] because workers are not hired, promoted or rewarded based on their [[skills]] or [[productivity]].&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

Becker claimed discrimination in the labor market is costly to employers. His theory is based on the assumption that in order to survive in the existence of competitive markets, employers cannot discriminate in the long run. Strongly believing in the perfect functioning of markets without government or trade union intervention, it was claimed that employer discrimination declines in the long run without political intervention. On the contrary, intervention of human capital investment and regulation of racial interactions make it worse for the disadvantaged groups. Moreover, it was claimed discrimination could only persist due to the "taste" for discrimination and lower education level of blacks explained the labor-market [[discrimination]].&lt;ref name=Sundstrom /&gt;&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt;

However, based on the empirical study, either human capital theory or Becker's tastes theory does not fully explain racial occupational segregation. That is seen with the increase in black work force in the South as an effect of [[Civil Rights]] laws in the 1960s. Therefore, human-capital and "taste-for-discrimination" are not sufficient explanations and government intervention is effective. Becker's claim about employers would not discriminate as it is costly in the competitive markets is weakened by the evidence from real life facts. Sundstrom [1994] points out, it was also costly to violate the social [[norm (social)|norms]] since customers could stop buying the employer's goods or services; or the workers could quit working or drop their work effort. Moreover, even if the workers or the customers did not participate in such behaviors, the employer would not take the risk of experimenting by going against the social norms. This was seen from the [[historical]] data that compares the economic outcomes for the white and black races.&lt;ref name=Sundstrom /&gt;

=== Looking at the position of women in World War II U.S. history ===
Women worked in the U.S. industrial sector during the [[World War II]]. However, after the war most women quit jobs and returned home for domestic production or traditional jobs. The departure of women from industrial jobs is argued to represent a case of discrimination.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kossoudji |first=Sherrie A. |first2=Laura |last2=Dresser |year=1992 |title=Working Class Rosies: Women Industrial Workers During World War II |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=431–446 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700010846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply theory claims [[voluntary action|voluntary]] movement because women worked due to extraordinary situation and they chose to quit. Their involvement was based on patriotic feelings and their exit depended on personal [[preferences]] and it was a response to [[feminist]] ideology. On the contrary, demand theory claims working class women changed occupations due to high industrial wages.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji /&gt; Tobias and Anderson [1974] present the counter argument for supply theory.&lt;ref name=Tobias&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tobias |first=Sheila |first2=Lisa |last2=Anderson |year=1974 |title=What Really Happened to Rosie the Riveter? Demobilization and the Female Labor Force, 1944–47 |journal=MSS Modular Publications |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there were both housewives and working class women, who had been working prior to the war in different occupations. According to Women's Bureau's interviews, majority of women who had been working wanted to continue to work after the war. Despite their will, they were laid off more than men. Most of them possibly had to choose lower-paying jobs.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji /&gt;

The exit pattern shows their quit was not voluntarily. There were pressures women faced, such as change in position to janitorial job, more or new responsibilities at work, and additional or changed shifts that would not fit their schedules, which were all known by the management. Women lay-off rates were higher than men. Briefly, women were treated unequally postwar period at the job market although productivity of women was equal to that of men and women's wage cost was lower.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji /&gt;

Supply and demand theories do not provide sufficient explanation regarding women's absence in industrial firms after the war. It is wrong to associate patriotism with the war-time women workers since some housewives quit their jobs at early periods of the war when the country needed their help the most. Some of the housewives were forced to quit as the second highest lay-off rate belonged to them. If their only concern was the well-being of their country at the war time, less persistence to exit would have been observed.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji /&gt;

The demand theory partially holds as there were women who worked pre-war time for occupational and wage mobility opportunities. However, these experienced women workers voluntarily quit working more than housewives did. The reason is work-experienced women had many opportunities. However, women with fewer options of where to work, such as African-Americans, older married women, housewives and the ones working in lowest paying jobs, wanted to keep their jobs as long as possible. Thus, their leave was involuntarily.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji /&gt;

Although women's [[job performance]] at least as good as men's,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} instead of trying to equalize pays, women's wages were kept below than men's.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Women had higher lay-off rates but also they were not rehired despite the boom in the [[auto industry]]. Some argue this was due to the lack of a civil rights movement protecting the rights of women as it did for black men. This explanation is unsatisfactory since it does not explain anti-women worker behavior of the management or lack of protection from unions. Kossoudji et al. [1992] believe it was due to the need for two separate wage and benefits packages for men and women. Women had [[child care]] responsibilities such as day care arrangements and maternity leave.&lt;ref name=Kossoudji /&gt;

=== U.S. anti-discrimination laws ===
See [[Employment discrimination law in the United States]].

Before the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] in the U.S., employment discrimination was legal and widely practiced. The newspaper ads for various jobs indicated racial and [[gender discrimination]] explicitly and implicitly. These behaviors were all built on the assumption that women and blacks were inferior.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt; At the turn of the 21st century, discrimination is still practiced but to a lesser degree and less overtly. The progress on the evident discrimination problem is visible. However, the effect of past is persistent on the economic outcomes, such as historical wage settings that influence current wages. Women are not only under-represented in the high-rank and high-paid jobs, but they are also over-represented in the secondary and lower-paid jobs. The interviews, personal law, wage data and confidential employment records with salaries along with other evidence show gender segregation and its effects on the labor market.&lt;ref name=Figart /&gt;

Although there is some inevitable [[occupational segregation]] based people's preferences, discrimination does exist.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt; Moreover, persistence of discrimination remains even after government intervention. There is a decline in the wage gap due to three reasons: male wages decreased and women's wages increased; secondly, the human capital gap between the two genders and experience gap have been closing; thirdly, legal pressures decreased discrimination but there is still inequality in the national economy of the U.S.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;

The correlation of Civil Rights Act and decrease in discrimination suggests the Act served its purpose. Therefore, it is correct to say leaving discrimination to diminish to the competitive markets is wrong, as Becker had claimed.&lt;ref name=Darity /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundstrom /&gt; In 1961, Kennedy issued an executive order calling for a presidential commission on the status of women. In 1963, [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]], which required the employers to pay the wages to men and women for the same work qualifications, was passed. In 1964, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act with the exception ''bona fide'' occupational qualifications ([[Bona fide occupational qualifications|BFOQ]]) was accepted while the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) responsible to check whether the Equal Pay Act and [[Title VII]] were followed. The Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was first written to forbid employment discrimination. Initially it prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion and national origin. However, inclusion of the sex accepted last minute. The Title VII addresses both the disparate impact and disparate treatment. In 1965, [[Executive Order 11246]] was passed and in 1967, it was changed to include sex, which prohibited employment discrimination by all employers with federal contracts and subcontracts. In addition, it makes sure affirmative action takes place. In 1986, sexual harassment was accepted as illegal with [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]’s decision. In 1998, the largest sexual harassment settlement was negotiated with $34 million to be paid to female workers of Mitsubishi.

As a result of these government policies occupational segregation decreased. The gender wage gap started to get smaller after the 1980s, most likely due to indirect feedback effects which took time, but an immediate increase in the earnings of blacks was observed in 1964. However, the laws still do not control discrimination fully in terms of hiring, promotion and training programs etc.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundstrom /&gt;

==== Affirmative action ====
Executive Order 11246, which is enforced by the [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance]], is an attempt to eliminate the gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged groups on account of gender and race. It requires contractors to observe their employment patterns. If there is under-representation of women and minorities, “goals and timetables” are created to employ more of the disadvantaged groups on account of gender and race. The pros and cons of affirmative action have been discussed. Some believe discrimination does not exist at all or even it does, prohibiting it is enough, and affirmative action is not needed. Some agree that some affirmative action is needed but they have considerations regarding the use of goals and timetables as they might be too strict. Some think strong [[affirmative action]] is needed but they are worried if there would be really sincere effort to hire the qualified individuals from the vulnerable groups.&lt;ref name=Blau /&gt;

==== Minimum wage ====
Rodgers et al. [2003] state minimum wage can be used as a tool to combat discrimination, as well and to promote [[Gender equality|equality]].&lt;ref name=Rodgers /&gt; Since discrimination is embedded in the labor market and affects its functioning, and discrimination creates a basis for labor market segregation and for occupational segregation, labor markets institutions and policies can be used to reduce the inequalities. Minimum wage is one of these policies that could be used.&lt;ref name=Rodgers /&gt;

The minimum wage has benefits because it alters the external market wage for women, provides a mechanism for regular increases in the wages and arranges social security. It affects women in the informal sector, which is highly dominated by women partly as an outcome of discrimination, by being a reference point.&lt;ref name=Rodgers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carr |first=Marilyn |first2=Martha Alter |last2=Chen |year=2002 |title=Globalization and the Informal Economy: How Globe Trade and Investment Impact on the Working Poor? |work=ILO working paper |url=http://ilo.ch/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_122053.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;OECD. 2009. "Is Informal Normal? Towards More and Better Jobs in Developing Countries" ''Development Centre Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, disadvantages include: first, the wage might be very low when skills and sector aren’t taken into consideration, secondly, adjustment may take time, thirdly, enforcement may not be feasible and finally when there are [[public spending]] cuts, the real value of the wage may decline due to [[social security]].&lt;ref name=Rodgers /&gt;

Others have argued that minimum wage simply shifts wage discrimination to employment discrimination. The logic is that if market wages are lower for minorities, then employers have an economic incentive to prefer hiring equally qualified minority candidates, whereas if all workers must be paid the same amount then employers will instead discriminate by not hiring minorities. Minimum wage laws could be responsible for the very high unemployment rate of black teenagers compared to white teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=1977 |title=Minimum Wage Escalation |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |location=Stanford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workforce development ===
{{main|Workforce development}}

One approach that mitigates discrimination by emphasizing skills is workforce development programs. Federally funded job training caters to the unemployed and minority groups by focusing on providing opportunities for them including those who have been discriminated against. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] has several employment training programs and resources targeted to support dislocated workers, Native Americans, people with disabilities, seniors, veterans, at risk youth, and other minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topics|title=United States Department of Labor Topics|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Labor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Employer efforts to balance representation==
Employers should evaluate their workplace environment, structure, and activities to ensure that discrimination is minimized. Through organizing heterogenous work groups, interdependence, recognizing the influence of salience, creating formalized evaluation systems, and taking accountability of actions, companies can improve current discriminatory practices that may be occurring.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Reskin, Barbara F. “[http://facultyhiring.uoregon.edu/files/2011/05/The-proximate-causes-of-employment-discrimination-28y5tsa.pdf The Proximate Causes of Employment Discrimination].” Contemporary Sociology, vol. 29, no. 2, 2000, pp. 319–328. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2654387.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heterogeneity in Work Groups ===
To promote unity throughout the workplace environment and discourage exclusion and isolation of certain minorities, work groups should rarely ever be created based on [[Ascriptive inequality|ascriptive characteristics]]. This way, employees are well integrated regardless of their race, sex, ethnicity, or age.

=== Interdependence ===
Working together in these heterogenous groups will reduce bias among those who are stereotyping by "encouraging them to notice counter-stereotypic information and form more individuated and accurate impressions". Collaboration among coworkers with different ascriptive characteristics works to break stereotyping and let members evaluate their coworkers on a more personal level and make more accurate judgments based on experience, not stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Salience ===
Though most do not realize it, people are highly susceptible to stereotyping after focusing on a stereotyped category. For example, "men who were primed with stereotypic statements about women were more likely to ask a female job applicant 'sexist' questions and exhibit sexualized behavior (and it took them longer than nonprimed men to recognize non sexist words).&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, Susan T. 1998. "Stereotyping, Prejudice and Discrimination." Pp. 357-411 in Handbook of Social Psychology, edited by D. T. Gilbert, S. T. Fiske, and G. Lindzey. New York: McCrawSHill.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a comment about pregnancy, a sex discrimination lawsuit, or diversity immediately before a committee evaluates a female job candidate is likely to exacerbate sex stereotyping in the evaluation." Employers can learn from this by making an effort to not bring up a minority-related comment before evaluating an employee in that group.

=== Formalized Evaluation systems ===
The more informal and unstructured employee observations and evaluations are, the more vulnerable superiors will be to bias. With a formalized evaluation system that includes objective, reliable, specific, and timely performance data, employers can put their best foot forward in managing a fair, non-discriminatory workplace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Accountability ===
As with any problem, being accountable for one's actions greatly reduces the behavior associated with that problem. "Accountability not only reduces the expression of biases, it also reduces bias in non-conscious cognitive processes, such as the encoding of information".&lt;ref&gt;Tetlock, Phillip E. 1992. "[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260108602877 The Impact of Accountability on Judgment and Choice: Toward a Social Contingency Model]." Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 25: 331-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Some employers have made efforts to reduce the impact of unconscious or unintentional systematic bias.&lt;ref&gt;Chohan, U.W. (2016). [https://theconversation.com/skin-deep-should-australia-consider-name-blind-resumes-55503 Skin deep: should Australia consider name-blind resumes?]. The Conversation: Business and Economics. Accessed 13 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a study found a substantial increase in hiring equity, some musical organizations have adopted the [[blind audition]]; in other fields like software engineering, communications, and design, this has taken the form of an anonymized response to an job application or interview challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/05/28/410264592/blind-auditions-could-give-employers-a-better-hiring-sense|title=Blind Auditions Could Give Employers A Better Hiring Sense|website=npr.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of job listings has been scrutinized; some phrases or wording are believed to resonate with particular demographics, or stereotypes about particular demographics, and lead to some women and minorities not applying because they can less easily visualized themselves in the position.  Examples cited include "rockstar" (which may imply a male) and nurturing vs. dominant language.  For example: "Superior ability to satisfy customers and manage company’s association with them" vs. "Sensitive to clients' needs, can develop warm client relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/2016/03/23/world/rockstar-and-other-words-not-use-job-postings|title='Rockstar' and other words not to use in job postings|website=marketplace.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiremorewomenintech.com/|title=Hire More Women In Tech|website=Hire More Women In Tech|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers concerned about gender and ethnic representation have adopted practices such as measuring demographics over time, setting diversity goals, intentionally recruiting in places beyond those familiar to existing staff, targeting additional recruiting to forums and social circles which are rich in female and minority candidates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/recruitment/preparation.cfm|title=Preparation|website=www.aps.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/recruitment/recruit.cfm|title=Pre-Hire Connections &amp; Recruiting|website=www.aps.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinterest]] has made its statistics and goals public, while increasing efforts at mentorship, identifying minority candidates early, recruiting more minority interns, and adopting a "[[Rooney Rule]]" where at least one minority or female candidate must be interviewed for each leadership position, even if they are not in the end hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/pinterest-reveals-diversity-hiring-goals-for-2016/|title=Pinterest reveals diversity hiring goals for 2016 - ZDNet|first=Rachel|last=King|website=zdnet.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics have found that women typically earn lower salaries than men for the same work, and some of this is due to differences in negotiations - either women do not ask for more money, or their requests are not granted at the same rate as men.  The resulting differences can be compounded if future employers use previous salary as a benchmark for the next negotiation.  To solve both of these problems, some companies have simply banned salary negotiations and use some other method (such as industry average) to peg the salary for a particular role.  Others have made salary information for all employees public within the company, which allows any disparities between employees in the same roles to be detected and corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/23/401468571/some-companies-fight-pay-gap-by-eliminating-salary-negotiations|title=Some Companies Fight Pay Gap By Eliminating Salary Negotiations|website=npr.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested greater representation of women in the economic modeling of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2017/380|title=Female Labor Supply and Why Women Need to Be Included in Economic Models - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protected categories ==
Laws often prohibit discrimination on the basis of:&lt;ref name="Protected areas and grounds under the Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act; Discrimination by Type; Types of discrimination"&gt;Protected areas and grounds under the Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act; Discrimination by Type; Types of discrimination&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have laws prohibiting employment discrimination including:
* [[Employment equity (Canada)|Employment discrimination law in Canada]]
* [[Employment discrimination law in the United States]]
* [[Employment discrimination law in the United Kingdom]]
* [[Employment discrimination law in the European Union]]

Sometimes these are part of broader [[anti-discrimination law]]s which cover housing or other issues.

== By region ==

During the past decade, hiring discrimination was measured by means of the golden standard&lt;ref&gt;Pager, D. (2007) [http://ann.sagepub.com/content/609/1/104.abstract The use of field experiments for studies of employment discrimination: contributions, critiques, and directions for the future.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich, J. (2014) [http://ftp.iza.org/dp8584.pdf What Do Field Experiments of Discrimination in Markets Tell Us? A Meta Analysis of Studies Conducted since 2000] IZA Discussion Paper Series, 8584.&lt;/ref&gt; to measure unequal treatment in the labour market, i.e. correspondence experiments. Within these experiments, fictitious job applications that only differ in one characteristic, are sent to real vacancies. By monitoring the subsequent call-back from employers, unequal treatment based on this characteristic can be measured and can be given a causal interpretation.

==== Ethnicity ====

Pervasive levels of ethnic labour market discrimination are found in Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the UK.&lt;ref name="ilr.sagepub.com"&gt;Baert, S., Cockx, B., Gheyle, N., Vandamme, C.

==== Disability ====

In 2014, a large correspondence experiment was conducted in Belgium. Two applications of graduates, identical except that one revealed a disability (blindness, deafness or autism), were both sent out to 768 vacancies for which the disabled candidates could be expected to be as productive as their non-disabled counterparts, based on the vacancy information. In addition, the researcher randomly disclosed the entitlement to a substantial wage subsidy in the applications of the disabled candidates. Disabled candidates had a 48% lower chance to receive a positive reaction from the employer side compared with the non-disabled candidates. Potentially due to the fear of the red tape, disclosing a wage subsidy did not affect the employment opportunities of disabled candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S.

==== Gender and sexual orientation ====

While overall no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender is found, unequal treatment is still measured in particular situations, for instance when candidates apply for positions at a higher functional level in Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country. Revealing a lesbian sexual orientation (by means of mentioning an engagement in a rainbow organisation or by mentioning one's partner name) lowers employment opportunities in Cyprus and Greece but has, overall, no negative effect in Sweden and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Drydakis, N.

==== Age ====

Pervasive levels of age discrimination are found in Belgium, England, France, Spain and Sweden. Job candidates revealing older age are found to get 39% (in Belgium) to 72% (in France) less job interview invitations compared to equal candidates revealing a younger name. Discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M.

Research&lt;ref name="Metropolis British Columbia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mbc.metropolis.net/assets/uploads/files/wp/2011/WP11-13.pdf |title=Why do some employers prefer to interview Matthew, but not Samir? New evidence from Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver | publisher=Metropolis British Columbia | format=PDF | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in 2010 by [[University of Toronto]] researchers [[Philip Oreopoulos]] and Diane Dechief has found that resumes featuring English-sounding names sent to Canadian employers were more than 35% more likely to receive an interview call-back as compared to resumes featuring [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Indian people|Indian]] or [[Greeks|Greek]]-sounding names. The study, supported by Metropolis BC., a federally funded diversity-research agency, was conducted to investigate why recent immigrants are struggling much more in the Canadian job markets than immigrants in the 1970s.  In order to test this hypothesis, dozens of identical resumes, with only the name of the applicant changed, was sent to employers in [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Montreal]].  Of the three cities surveyed, Metro Vancouver employers, both large and small, were the least swayed by the ethnicity of an applicants' name.  Resumes submitted to employers here were just 20% more likely to get a callback than those with Chinese or Indian names. Through interviews with Canadian employers, the researchers found that name-based discrimination on application forms were a result of time-pressed employers being concerned that individuals with foreign backgrounds would have inadequate English-language and social skills for the Canadian marketplace.&lt;ref name="Metropolis British Columbia"/&gt;

=====Disability=====
In 2006, just over one-half (51%) of persons with disabilities were employed, compared to three in four persons without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Statistics Canada"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?objId=89-628-X&amp;objType=2&amp;lang=en&amp;limit=1 |title=The 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey: Disability in Canada (89-628-X) |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=29 January 2010 |website=Statistics Canada |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment rates are lower (under 40%) for persons with developmental and communication disabilities, whereas employment rates are closer to average for persons with a hearing impairment or for those who have problems with pain, mobility, and agility.&lt;ref name="Statistics Canada"/&gt;

Data from [[Statistics Canada]]'s Participation and Activity Limitation Survey&lt;ref name="Statistics Canada"/&gt; (PALS) show that, in 2006, one in four unemployed persons with a disability and one in eight persons with a disability who are not in the workforce believe that, in the past five years, they've been refused a job because of their disability.  One in twelve employed persons with a disability also reported that they experienced discrimination, with the proportion of discrimination "increasing with the severity of activity limitations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianlabour.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/Toward-Inclusion-of-People-with-Disabilities-EN.pdf |title=Toward Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Workplace |date=December 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913203919/http://www.canadianlabour.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/Toward-Inclusion-of-People-with-Disabilities-EN.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gender and sexual orientation=====
According to 2011 [[Statistics Canada]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=106738&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=98&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the gender wage gap in Ontario is 26% for full-time, full-year workers.  For every $1.00 earned by a male worker, a female worker earns 74 cents.  In 1987, when the [[Equal pay for equal work#Canada|Pay Equity Act]] was passed, the gender wage gap was 36%. It is estimated that as much as 10 to 15% of the gender wage gap is due to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca/en/about/pubs/genderwage/wagegap.php |title=Gender Wage Gap |publisher=Pay Equity Commission of Ontario |accessdate=17 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228123555/http://www.payequity.gov.on.ca/en/about/pubs/genderwage/wagegap.php |archivedate=28 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
=====Ethnicity=====
By means of their seminal correspondence experiment, Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, showed that applications from job candidates with white-sounding names got 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with African-American-sounding names in the United States at the start of this millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2004) [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/0002828042002561 Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?

Annual Review of Sociology 34:181-209.&lt;/ref&gt; "Black men spend significantly more time searching for work"; and even when they are working, they have less stable employment, diminishing their work experience".&lt;ref&gt;Tomaskovic-Devey D, Thomas M, Johnson K. 2005. Race and the accumulation of humancapital across the career: a theoretical model and fixed-effects application. ''Am. J. Sociol.'' 111:58–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination goes beyond the hiring process. "Controlling for parental background, education, work experience, tenure, and training, white men earn roughly 15% more than comparable blacks."&lt;ref&gt;Cancio AS, Evans TD, Maume DJ. 1996. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096391 Reconsidering the declining significance of race: racial differences in early career wages]. ''American Sociological Review.'' 61:541–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each race, darker complexion is also discriminated against. Multiple studies have found that lighter skin blacks "tend to have superior incomes and life chances". "Chicanos with lighter skin color and more european features had higher socioeconomic status" and "black Hispanics suffer close to ten times the proportionate income loss due to differential treatment of given characteristics than white Hispanics".&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Darity, William A., and Patrick L. Mason. "Evidence on discrimination in employment: Codes of color, codes of gender." ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 12.2 (1998): 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sex =====
''Main Article: [[Occupational sexism|Occupational Sexism]] and [[Motherhood penalty|Motherhood Penalty]].''

Women have had a long history of discrimination in the workplace. Feminist theory points to the concept of a [[family wage]]- a rate substantial enough to support a man and his family- as the explanation to why women's labor is cheap, claiming it preserves "male dominance and women's dependence in the family".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Blankenship, Kim M. “Bringing Gender and Race in: U.S. Employment Discrimination Policy.” Gender and Society, vol. 7, no. 2, 1993, pp. 204–226. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/189578.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been legislation such as the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] that combat gender discrimination, the implications of the act are limited. "As an amendment to the Fair Labor Standard Act, it exempted employers in agriculture, hotels, motels, restaurants, and laundries, as well as professional, managerial, and administrative personnel, outside salesworkers, and private household workers". Because high concentrations of women work in these fields (34.8% of employed women of color and 5.1% of white women as private household workers, 21.6% and 13.8% working in service jobs, 9.3% and 3.7% as agricultural workers, and 8.1% and 17.2% as administrative workers), "nearly 45% of all employed women, then, appear to have been exempt from the Equal Pay Act".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The hourly wage rate for women is 65% of that of men, and annual earnings of full-time employed women is 71% of that of men. Among the male wage distribution, the average woman lies at the 33rd percentile.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Francine D., M. Ferber, and A. Winkler, ''The Economics of Women, Men, and Work'', third edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within women, another level of discrimination takes place among mothers. Historically, this inequality stems from the belief that mothers are less productive at work. Visibly pregnant women are often judged as less committed to their jobs, less dependable, and more emotional compared to women who aren't visibly pregnant.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Shelley J. Correll, Stephen Benard, and In Paik, “Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty?” American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 112 No. 5 (2007), 1297-1338.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 1998 showed that the wage rates of women without children were 81.3% of men's pay, but 73.4% of men's pay for women with children.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, Jane, ‘‘[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257%2Fjep.12.1.137 Understanding the ‘Family Gap’ in Pay for Women with Children],’’ ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Winter 1998, ''13'':1, 137– 56.&lt;/ref&gt; An audit study in 2007 found that, childless women receive 2.1 times as many callbacks than equally qualified mothers. Though it doesn't receive as much attention as the gender gap, motherhood is a significant quality that is discriminated against. In fact, the pay gap between mothers and non-mothers is larger than the pay gap between men and women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
=====Gender and sexual orientation=====
The [[UCLA School of Law#Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy|Williams Institute]], a national think tank at [[UCLA School of Law]], released a 2011 report&lt;ref name="The Williams Institute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Sears-Mallory-Discrimination-July-20111.pdf |title=Documented Evidence of Employment Discrimination &amp; Its Effects on LGBT People | publisher=The Williams Institute | format=PDF | accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has identified sexual orientation and gender identification discrimination in the workplace.  According to the report, between 15-43% of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender workers have experienced being fired, denied promotions, or harassed due to their sexual orientation or gender identification.&lt;ref name="The Williams Institute"/&gt; Additionally, only 20 states in the United States of America prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace. Wisconsin and New Hampshire prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation but not gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/map/non-discrimination-laws-state-state-information-map|title=Non-Discrimination Laws: State by State Information - Map|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 4, 2017 Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] announced that the [[United States Department of Justice]] will no longer provide employment protection to [[transgender]] individuals under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], reversing the position of former Attorney General [[Eric Holder]], during the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glasser|first1=Nathaniel M.|last2=Rhodes|first2=Kate B.|title=Attorney General Reverses Obama-Era Protection of Transgender Employees|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/attorney-general-reverses-obama-era-protection-transgender-employees|accessdate=15 October 2017|work=The [[National Law Review]]|publisher=Epstein Becker &amp; Green, P.C.|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Age=====
Most age discrimination occurs among the older workers when employers hold negative stereotypes about them. Though evidence on declines in productivity is inconsistent, "other evidence points to declines in acuteness of vision or hearing, ease of memorization, computational speed, etc.". Another factor employers take into consideration is the higher cost of health or life insurance for older workers.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;Neumark, D. 2003.

Of those 1500 individuals who responded to AARP's 2013 Staying Ahead of the Curve survey, almost 64% of those over 45–74 said they have seen or have experienced age discrimination in the workplace. Of those, 92% say it was somewhat or very common in their workplace.&lt;ref name="AARP" /&gt; "In 1963 the unemployment rate for men over age 55 was a full percentage point higher (4.5 percent) than for men aged 35-54 (3.5%)." Average durations of unemployment are higher for older workers as well- 21 weeks for men over age 45 as opposed to 14 weeks for men under 45.&lt;ref name=":143"&gt;Neumark, D. 2003.

== Definition ==
[[Fake news website]]s deliberately publish [[hoaxes]], [[propaganda]], and [[disinformation]] to drive [[web traffic]] inflamed by [[social media]].&lt;ref name="russiadominates"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/06/how-russia-dominates-your-twitter-feed-to-promote-lies-and-trump-too.html|title=Trolls for Trump - How Russia Dominates Your Twitter Feed to Promote Lies (And, Trump, Too)|author1=Weisburd, Andrew|date=August 6, 2016|accessdate=November 24, 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|author2=Watts, Clint|author2-link=Clint Watts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snopesfieldguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/|title=Snopes' Field Guide to Fake News Sites and Hoax Purveyors - Snopes.com's updated guide to the internet's clickbaiting, news-faking, social media exploiting dark side.|last=LaCapria|first=Kim|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="divideeurope"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/divide-europe-european-lawmakers-warn-of-russian-propaganda/a-36016836|title='Divide Europe': European lawmakers warn of Russian propaganda|author=Lewis Sanders IV|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=November 24, 2016|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites are distinguished from [[news satire]] as fake news articles are usually fabricated to deliberately mislead readers, either for profit or more ambiguous reasons, such as disinformation campaigns.&lt;ref name="snopesfieldguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tavernise" /&gt;  Many sites originate in or are promoted by Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/06/how-russia-dominates-your-twitter-feed-to-promote-lies-and-trump-too|title=How Russia Dominates Your Twitter Feed to Promote Lies (And, Trump, Too)|last=Weisburd|first=Clint Watts{{!}}Andrew|date=2016-08-06|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-real-paranoia-inducing-purpose-of-russian-hacks|title=The Real Paranoia-Inducing Purpose of Russian Hacks|last=Chen|first=Adrian|date=2016-07-27|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonia,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/facebook-clickbait-political-news-sites-us-election-trump|title=How Facebook powers money machines for obscure political 'news' sites|last=Tynan|first=Dan|date=2016-08-24|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-users-crowdsource-fake-news-document-2016-11|title=Fed up with fake news, Facebook users are solving the problem with a simple list|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romania,&lt;ref name="Inc.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/ending-fed-trump-facebook.html|title=The Bizarre Truth Behind the Biggest Pro-Trump Facebook Hoaxes|date=2016-11-22|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs|title=We Tracked Down A Fake-News Creator In The Suburbs.

''The New York Times'' noted in a December 2016 article that fake news had previously maintained a presence on the Internet and within [[tabloid journalism]] in years prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. election]].&lt;ref name="tavernise"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/us/fake-news-partisan-republican-democrat.html|title=As Fake News Spreads Lies, More Readers Shrug at the Truth|last=Tavernise|first=Sabrina|date=December 7, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 9, 2016|page=A1|quote=Narrowly defined, 'fake news' means a made-up story with an intention to deceive, often geared toward getting clicks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the election between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]], fake news had not impacted the election process to such a high degree.&lt;ref name="tavernise" /&gt; Subsequent to that election, the issue of fake news turned into a political weapon between supporters of Clinton and Trump; due to these back-and-forth complaints, the definition of fake news as used for such argumentation became vaguer.&lt;ref name="tavernise" /&gt;

== Methods ==
Fake news websites use a variety of methods to fool their readers into believing their content, either by attempting to persuade the readers that they are legitimate or by distracting readers with incredible news. {{multiple image

=== Clickbait ===
Fake news websites often have article titles that are incredulous, prompting the user to click on it and read more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-fake-election-news-more-popular-than-real-news-buzzfeed-investigation/|title=Probe reveals stunning stats about fake election headlines on Facebook|last=|first=|date=November 17, 2016|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-04-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of enticing readers to view content on their website often leads to exaggerated or even fake titles. When linked to from other sites, usually social media, having an extraordinary story title played a large part in tricking users who cannot tell if the article is real or not. This became especially relevant in the 2016 election. Additionally, out-of-context or [[manipulated image]]s can cause readers to incorrectly assume an article's legitimacy, often due to their inflammatory image choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/baby-boon/|title=FACT CHECK: Is This a Photograph of a 12-Week Fetus?|last=Mikkelson|first=David|date=10 November 2013|work=Snopes|access-date=2018-04-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/how-to-spot-fake-news/|title=How to Spot Fake News - FactCheck.org|date=2016-11-18|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impersonation ===
Another method of gaining readers is impersonating a legitimate news organization. This can come in two forms, either by copying a popular news organization's website formatting and pretending to be a lesser known publication or by completely copying an existing website down to its name and authors.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Exact copies can trick viewers into believing the website is an official organization such as the Bloomberg.ma,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/business/dealbook/twitter-shares-jump-after-fake-bloomberg-report.html|title=Twitter Shares Jump After Faked Bloomberg Report|last=Merced|first=Michael J. de la|date=2015-07-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-18|last2=Goldstein|first2=Matthew|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/14/fake-twitter-bloomberg-report/|title=Fake Bloomberg News Report Drives Twitter Stock Up 8%|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cnn-trending.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/fake-news-site-uses-professor-stephen-hawking-to-sell-get-ri|title=Fake News Site Uses Stephen Hawking To Sell Get-Rich-Quick Scheme|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/business/business-news/faking-it-unravelling-fake-news-12468676|title=Faking it: Unravelling a fake news story involving Stephen Hawking|last=Scialom|first=Mike|date=2017-01-19|work=cambridgenews|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typosquatting ===
Many popular fake news websites attempted to impersonate legitimate U.S. news publication by using a method known as [[Typosquatting]], where fake websites get as close as possible to the original URL, only differing by a letter or two. A clear example is ABCnews.com.co. Typosquatting relies on readers not actually checking the address they typed or clicked on, since often these websites target common misspellings, slight misphrasings and abuse of [[top-level domain]]s by used .com.co as opposed to .com. This also gets many viewers from social media who believe they are going to an actual news publication's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/12/01/hackers-use-typo-squatting-lure-unwary-url-hijacking/94683460/|title=Hackers use typosquatting to dupe the unwary with fake news, sites|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webtitan.com/blog/fake-news-typosquatting-and-cybersecurity-risks/|title=Crackdown on Fake News Shines Light on Typosquatting and Cybersecurity Risks - WebTitan|date=2016-12-28|work=WebTitan|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obscurity ===
Since the authors of these websites are not actual reporters, many fake news sites either pretend to have the identity of a reporter or simply do not include an 'About Us' page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/websites-fake-credentials-people-hired-24136909|title=Video: Websites Fake Credentials to Help People Get Hired|last=News|first=ABC|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These websites almost never have any other publications that reference them or information about themselves on tertiary sources like Wikipedia. When these sites get publicized by actual organizations, it gives them a bit of legitimacy, which helps them get viewers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Fake news campaigns ==
Fake news campaigns are when multiple fake news websites are published with similar topics in hopes of convincing a broader audience, either by quantity or by reference.

=== 2016 election cycle ===
Fake news websites played a large part in the online news community during the election, reinforced by extreme exposure on Facebook and Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/dec/13/2016-lie-year-fake-news/|title=PolitiFact's 2016 Lie of the Year: Fake news|work=PolitiFact|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 115 pro-Trump fake stories were shared on Facebook a total of 30 million times, and 41 pro-Clinton fake stories shared a total of 7.6 million times.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allcott|first=Hunt|last2=Gentzkow|first2=Matthew|date=Spring 2017|title=Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=31|issue=2|pages=211–236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two main reasons for creating fake news, economical and ideological.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The teenagers in Veles, for example, produced stories favoring both Trump and Clinton that earned them tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/|title=Inside the Macedonian Fake-News Complex|last=Subramanian|first=Samanth|date=2017-02-07|website=wired.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fake news providers seek to advance candidates they favor. The Romanian man who ran ''endingthefed.com'', for example, claims that he started the site mainly to help Donald Trump’s campaign.&lt;ref name="Inc.com"/&gt;

==== Social media ====
Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] of the [[University of Oxford]] found that about one half of all news on [[Twitter]] directed at [[Michigan]] prior to the election was junk or fake.

== Notable examples of fake news websites ==
Many of these websites are categorized as fake news because they have a satirical take on the news, but ultimately fail to convince their readers that their content is actually fake.

=== RealTrueNews ===
Marco Chacon created the fake news site ''RealTrueNews'' to show his [[alt-right]] friends their alleged gullibility.&lt;ref name="chacon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/28/the-man-who-duped-trumpkins-fox-news.html|title=This 'Conservative News Site' Trended on Facebook, Showed Up on Fox News—and Duped the World|last=Collins|first=Ben|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=November 27, 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chacon2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/21/i-ve-been-making-viral-fake-news-for-the-last-six-months-it-s-way-too-easy-to-dupe-the-right-on-the-internet.html|title=I’ve Been Making Viral Fake News for the Last Six Months.

A study conducted by the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]] from January 2015 revealed difficulties that middle, high school, and college students experienced in differentiating between advertisements and news articles, or identifying where information originated.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-researchers-find-students-have-trouble-judging-credibility-information-online|title=Stanford researchers find students have trouble judging the credibility of information online {{!}} Stanford Graduate School of Education|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One concern noted by researchers of the study is that democracy is at risk of devolving due to the ways in which falsehoods about civic issues can quickly spread with a growing ease of access. In one assessment, high school students were asked to evaluate two Facebook posts mentioning [[Donald Trump]]'s candidacy for president; one was from an actual [[Fox News]] account and the other was from a fake account.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over 30 percent of students stated that the fake account was more reliable because of its graphic elements and only a quarter recognized the significance of the blue checkmark on [[Twitter]] and Facebook, which indicates that an account was marked as legitimate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Educational ===
Elementary school teachers have decided to challenge results from the Stanford study by showing children the importance of not being deceived by what is fake. Fifth grade teacher Scott Bedley in California created his own version of "[[Simon Says]]", in which students are given three minutes to read an article and decide whether a news story is true or false.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/02/16/514364210/5-ways-teachers-are-fighting-fake-news|title=5 Ways Teachers Are Fighting Fake News|accessdate=2017-04-14|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who think it's false are told to stand up while those who think it's true remain in their seats.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bedley worked with another teacher in Kansas, Todd Flory, to devise a "fake news challenge" via [[Skype]] whereby Flory's class picked two real articles and wrote a fake one, to be presented to Bedly's class in California.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Teachers are promoting these learning techniques with the hope that such strategies and skills will stay with their students' for the rest of their adolescent and adult lives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/3/29/15042692/fake-news-education-election|title=I taught my 5th-graders how to spot fake news.

Andreas Schleicher, the lead of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, announced in 2017 that his organization was initiating "global competencies” tests will be taken by 15-year-olds around the world alongside the OECD’s current reading, maths and science assessments, which are conducted every three years. This will test how well students can discern fake news outside of their sociopolitical bubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/18/teach-schoolchildren-spot-fake-news-says-oecd|title=Teach schoolchildren how to spot fake news, says OECD|last=Siddique|first=Haroon|date=2017-03-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Coogan, editor in chief of education startup Newsela, has partnered with the American Press Institute to help combat fake news consumption in addition to its regular literacy boosting skill classes. She believes its is now the teacher's responsibility to help teach their students about which media to believe since it is near impossible for a parent to monitor every source that a child will read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/newsela-teaches-kids-how-to-spot-fake-news-2017-1|title=This education startup is teaching kids how to spot fake news|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/education-startup-teaching-kids-spot-204000413.html|title=This education startup is teaching kids how to spot fake news|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Facebook ====
{{See also|Criticism of Facebook}}
After receiving heavy criticism for not stopping the extreme number of fake news articles on its platform, [[Facebook]] announced in December 2016 that it would begin to flag fake news. If enough users flagged a story, the story would be sent to a 3rd party organization to check its veracity. If it failed, it would lose news feed priority as well as have "disputed by 3rd party fact-checkers" as a caption. Facebook is also attempting to reduce their financial incentives in an attempt to decrease the amount of fake news. The fact checking organizations involved are [[ABC News]], [[Associated Press]], [[FactCheck.org]], [[PolitiFact]] and [[Snopes.com|Snopes]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/facebook-flag-fake-news-fact-check|title=Facebook to begin flagging fake news in response to mounting criticism|last=Jamieson|first=Amber|last2=Solon|first2=Olivia|date=2016-12-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2016/12/facebooks-fake-news-initiative/|title=Facebook's 'Fake News' Initiative - FactCheck.org|date=2016-12-22|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/16/13637310/facebook-fake-news-explained|title=Facebook's fake news problem, explained|work=Vox|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Facebook has admitted that it 'fell short' in stopping outside meddling in the U.S. presidential election. This admission comes after increased scrutiny from lawmakers in a broader backlash against Silicon Valley as well as a Senate hearing for social media company executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/22/facebook-admits-it-sometimes-harms-democracy/|title=Facebook admits social media sometimes harms democracy|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=2018-01-22|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-17|last2=Fung|first2=Brian|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the election, many fact-checking websites teamed up with Facebook in order to check on the veracity of linked articles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many of these organization have also posted lists of fake news websites and guides on how to identify them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/|title=PolitiFact's guide to fake news websites|work=PunditFact|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

Members of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee]] traveled to Ukraine and Poland in March 2016 and heard from officials in both countries on Russian operations to influence their affairs.&lt;ref name="angusking"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/12/01/sen-king-russian-involvement-in-u-s-election-an-arrow-aimed-at-the-heart-of-democracy/|title=Angus King: Russian involvement in U.S. election 'an arrow aimed at the heart of democracy’|last=Miller|first=Kevin|date=December 1, 2016|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator [[Angus King]] told the ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'' that tactics used by Russia during the 2016 U.S. election were analogous to those used against other countries.&lt;ref name="angusking" /&gt; King recalled the legislators were informed by officials from both Ukraine and Poland about Russian tactics of "planting fake news stories" during elections.&lt;ref name="angusking" /&gt; On November 20, 2016, King joined a letter in which seven members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee asked President Obama to publicize more information from the intelligence community on Russia's role in the U.S. election.&lt;ref name="angusking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kingamong"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/30/angus-king-among-senators-asking-president-to-declassify-information-about-russia-and-election/|title=Angus King among senators asking president to declassify information about Russia and election|date=November 20, 2016|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with CNN, Senator King warned against ignoring the problem, saying it was a bipartisan issue.&lt;ref name="hackingdeclassified"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/02/politics/democrats-russian-hacking-intelligence/|title=Democrats want Russian hacking intelligence declassified|author1=Jim Sciutto|date=December 3, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016|publisher=[[CNN]]|author2=Manu Raju}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the FTC as part of a campaign to crackdown on bogus health claims charged over $1.6 million to Beony International and owner Mario Milanovic, and Beony International employee Cody Adams.

The [[United States Department of State]] planned to use a unit called the Counter-Disinformation Team, formed with the intention of combating [[disinformation]] from the [[Russian government]], and that it was disbanded in September 2015 after department heads missed the scope of propaganda before the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. election]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/how-us-eu-failings-allowed-kremlin-propaganda-fake-news-spread-through-west-1593071|title=How US and EU failings allowed Kremlin propaganda and fake news to spread through the West|last=Porter|first=Tom|date=2016-11-28|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/obama-fails-to-fight-putins-propaganda-machine/|title=Obama Fails to Fight Putin’s Propaganda Machine|date=2015-11-05|work=Observer|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. State Department put eight months into developing the unit before scrapping it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It would have been a reboot of the [[Active Measures Working Group]] set up by [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|President Reagan.]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/11/the-kremlin-didnt-sink-hillary-obama-did/|title=The Kremlin Didn’t Sink Hillary—Obama Did|date=2016-11-26|work=Observer|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Counter-Disinformation Team was set up under the [[Bureau of International Information Programs]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Work began in 2014, with the intention to combat propaganda from Russian sources such as ''[[Russia Today]][[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|.]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;'' [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence]] officials explained to former [[National Security Agency]] analyst and [[counterintelligence]] officer John R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">A '''Grand illumination''' is an outdoor [[ceremony]] involving the simultaneous activation of lights. The most common form of the ceremony involves turning on [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]].

One of the older of such community events began at [[Colonial Williamsburg]], the restored Historic District of the former [[Virginia]] capital city of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in 1935. It is held there each year on the Sunday of the first full weekend in December. (That is, if December begins on a Sunday, the event is held the following Sunday.) Williamsburg's Grand Illumination, which also involves fireworks, is based loosely on the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia|colonial]] (and [[England|English]]) tradition of placing lighted [[candle]]s in the windows of homes and public buildings to celebrate a special event. The winning of a war and the birthday of the reigning [[monarch]] are examples of such national events. Many candles appeared in darkened windows in New York after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].      

In recent times, in many cities much larger than Williamsburg, such as [[Richmond, Virginia]], multiple [[skyscraper]]s and other buildings are decorated with long mostly vertical strings of lights of a common theme, and are activated simultaneously in "Grand Illumination" ceremonies. Some communities, such as [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], have Grand Illumination [[parade]]s. In [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], a similar event is called the "Grand Illumination On The River."  In [[Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts]], on [[Martha's Vineyard]], Grand Illumination is one of the most significant events each summer, immediately preceded by a Community Sing. In the [[United Kingdom]], the "Grand Illumination" ceremony is generally referred to as "Turning On The Lights", and occurs in virtually all towns and cities throughout the country.

'''Heritage Days''' is a three-day [[arts]], [[crafts]], and [[entertainment]] [[street festival]] held in downtown [[Rogersville, Tennessee]] during the second, full [[Workweek|weekend]] of October each year.  Organized around a harvest and history theme, the festival began in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;"Heritage Days," Rogersville Heritage Association: Rogersville, Tennessee. http://www.rogersvilleheritage.org/RHA/details.asp?ID=2.

==Early history==
[[Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins County]] Heritage Days began in October 1978 when a small crowd gathered despite a downpour on the [[Courthouse]] [[town square|Square]] in downtown Rogersville to help raise funds for the nascent Rogersville Heritage Association.

The organization, whose purpose is to "preserve, protect, promote, and celebrate heritage of [[Rogersville, Tennessee]]," envisioned an annual event to commemorate the historic town and to emulate the nineteenth century harvest festivals that Rogersville had seen after the [[American Civil War]].

==The Festival Today==
Since its beginnings, Heritage Days has grown to an annual estimated crowd of almost 40,000 persons, more than six times the population of Rogersville.  

The event is still sponsored by the Rogersville Heritage Association, and it still gathers artisans, craftsmen and women, and entertainers to perpetuate the mountain arts and way of life that have slowly vanished from the hills of [[East Tennessee]].

The [[Southeast Tourism Society]], a regional promoter of tourism and excellence in tourism programming, recognized Heritage Days as a "Top Twenty Event in the Southeast for October".  The festival has been a multiple winner at Tennessee Festivals and Events.
In 2014 Oliver Pelle performed on Main Street for Heritage Days.

'''Innishannon Steam and Vintage Rally''' is held between [[Crossbarry]] and [[Innishannon]] (Irish: Inis Eonáin), a village on the main [[Cork (city)|Cork]]–[[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] road (N71) in [[County Cork]], Province of [[Munster]], [[Ireland]]. The show takes place in a 38-acre site.

== History ==

The rally has been running successfully since June 1998 and was awarded charitable status in 1999. All proceeds from the event go to the [[Irish Cancer Society]]. The rally takes place every June Bank Holiday weekend in Innishannon, Cork. The founding of the event was led by well known steam preservationist Tim Nagle of Kinsale.

Over the years the event has gained significant support. In the first year IR£5000 was handed over to the Irish Cancer Society. The second year saw IR£13,500 was donated; in 2000 the amount more than doubled to IR£27,500. Unfortunately due to the [[foot-and-mouth disease]] outbreak in 2001 no rally was held, but in 2002 €35,500 went to the Irish Cancer Society. In 2003 the event raised €60,000, and in 2005 €65,000.

Over the past 14 years, the rally has raised over €970,000 for the ICS.  The rally has broken the €1 million mark in 2012.

The Innishannon Steam and Vintage replaced the nearby Upton Steam Rally started in 1967/68 by Ned Foley of Youghal (Steam Roller Engine), Thos (Thomas) Scanlan of Ballyhooley (Overtime Tractor x2) and Brendan O Connell of Ballincollig (Army Truck) to fund / support Upton Brothers of Charity, the rally  which ceased in 1997, due to insurance concerns and costs.

== Objectives ==

This rally was originally created to promote heritage machinery of all classes at work and to provide a suitable venue for vintage enthusiasts to display their machines, as well as allowing the general public to view rare agricultural and mechanical treasures from the past. The exhibits include huge tractors, threshers, unique cars, motorbikes, oil and steam engines as well as experiencing a working forge. There is also a pet's corner, always popular with children, a cake sale, numerous stands and stalls with art and craft displays, a dog show, sheep dog trials, road rolling, stone crushing, line dancing and a non-stop disco. This is a fun-day out for collectors, enthusiasts and visitors alike with car parking and camping facilities set up in the village. Innishannon itself dates back to the sixth century and is surrounded by an ancient woodland and castle ruins.

The rally seeks to promote steam vintage and other items of heritage and also provide a venue suitable to the enthusiast to show items of yesteryear. It also allows the public to view such rare treasures. It also seeks raise funds for a needy and deserving cause, The Irish Cancer Society.

'''John Frederick Hartranft''' (December 16, 1830 – October 17, 1889) was the [[United States]] military officer who read the death warrant to the individuals who were executed on July 7, 1865 for conspiring to assassinate American President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Previously having achieved the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of the Union Army during the [[American Civil War]], he had also been awarded the U.S. [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].&lt;ref name="Eicher"/&gt;

Post-war, he served as the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|17th Governor]] of [[Pennsylvania]] from 1873 to 1879. 

==Early life and career==
Hartranft was born in Fagleysville, a village in [[New Hanover Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown]], the son of ethnic German Americans Mary Lydia (Bucher) and Samuel Engle Hartranft.&lt;ref name="Eicher"&gt;Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J. ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford University Press, 2001, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hartranft had some local schooling in Norristown, where his family moved when he was a boy. He attended Marshall College in [[Mercersburg, Pennsylvania|Mercersburg]]—a forerunner of [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. He moved to New York, where he completed his degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1853 from [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]].

He briefly worked for two railroads in eastern Pennsylvania before returning home to [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]] to assist his father in the real estate and stage line businesses. In 1854, the young man was appointed [[sheriff|deputy sheriff]] of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]]. That same year, he married Sallie Douglas Sebring. They had six children, but three died in infancy.

Hartranft was active in the Norristown fire company and the local [[Freemasonry|Freemason lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;Huskey, Stan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NWoVBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 Remembering ''Norristown: Stories from the Banks of the Schuylkill River.''] Charleston, SC: History Press, 2009, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; After "reading the law" as an apprentice with an established firm, Hartranft was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]] in 1860. He entered the Pennsylvania [[Militia]], being promoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

==Civil War==
In April 1861, Hartranft raised a Montgomery County [[regiment]] of 90-day volunteers in Norristown, serving as [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 4th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. When their term of enlistment was up, the regiment returned to Pennsylvania, although it was the eve of the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], and firing had already begun. Hartranft was humiliated by his men's decision to go home.

He stayed to fight with the [[United States Army|Army]] on July 21, 1861. This act earned him the [[Medal of Honor]] on August 21, 1886, for volunteering his services to fellow Pennsylvanian Col. [[William B. Franklin]]. His citation reads: "Voluntarily served as an aide and participated in the battle after expiration of his term of service, distinguishing himself in rallying several regiments which had been thrown into confusion."&lt;ref name="Eicher"/&gt;

Hartranft raised a three-year regiment, the [[51st Pennsylvania Infantry]], and became its colonel. They first served on the [[North Carolina]] coast in the [[Ambrose E. Burnside|Burnside Expedition]]. Hartranft led them in battle at [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]] and [[Battle of New Berne|New Bern]]. In July 1862, Hartranft's men proceeded to [[Newport News, Virginia]], to become part of Burnside's [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], with whom they fought in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and at [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]]. They also fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]], where Hartranft led the famous charge across [[Burnside's Bridge]], suffering 120 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcivilwarmuseum.org/Portals/0/PDF%27s/Hartranft2.pdf John F. Hartranft: Pennsylvania General and Governor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319204404/http://www.nationalcivilwarmuseum.org/Portals/0/PDF%27s/Hartranft2.pdf |date=2016-03-19 }}, ''The [[National Civil War Museum]]''&lt;/ref&gt; They also participated in the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. The 51st Pennsylvania was transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], where Hartranft saw action at the battles of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], [[Battle of Campbell's Station|Campbell's Station]], and [[Siege of Knoxville|Knoxville]]; in the latter two actions, he served as commander of the 2nd Division of the IX Corps while still a colonel.&lt;ref name="Sauers"&gt;Sauers, Richard A. John Frederick Hartranft. ''Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History.'' Heidler, David S., and Heidler, Jeanne T., eds. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000, pp. 941-942.&lt;/ref&gt;

He commanded the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, of the IX Corps in the 1864 [[Overland Campaign]], participating in the fighting at [[Battle of the Wilderness|the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]]. He was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] as of May 12, 1864. He continued in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]. His brigade distinguished itself in the [[Battle of Peebles' Farm]].

When the IX Corps was reorganized, Hartranft was given command of a new 3rd Division, consisting of newly raised Pennsylvania regiments. Hartranft was [[Brevet (military)|brevet]]ted [[Major general (United States)|major general]] by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] for defeating [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s last offensive at the [[Battle of Fort Stedman]]. He brought his untested division from its reserve position and counterattacked to recover the captured fort.&lt;ref name="Sauers"/&gt;

==Imprisonment, trial and execution of the Lincoln assassination conspirators==
In the aftermath of the assassination of United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]], Hartranft was appointed both commanding officer of the [[Old Capitol Prison]] in Washington, D.C. and as a special [[provost marshal]] during the trial of those accused in the [[Lincoln assassination]]: [[George Atzerodt]], [[David Herold]], [[Lewis Paine]] (also known as Lewis Powell), and [[Mary Surratt]], who would become the first woman to be executed by the U.S. government. The trial lasted from May 9, 1865 until the conviction of the Atzerodt, Herold, Paine, and Surratt in late June. At 1:15 p.m. on July 7, 1865, Hartranft led the four to the gallows in what is now called [[Fort Lesley McNair]]. When asked if the convicted had any final statements, the spiritual advisors of Atzerodt and Payne stated that both men wished to thank Hartranft and the officers and soldiers serving under him for the kindness they displayed during their incarceration. Following prayers for each of the prisoners, "Gen. Hartranft read the order of the War Department, embracing the President's Executive Order, for the execution," according to ''The New York Times''. The prisoners were then simultaneously executed by hanging at 1:25 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/08/archives/end-of-the-assassins-execution-of-mrs-surratt-payne-herrold-and.html End of the Assassins; Execution of Mrs. Surratt, Payne, Herrold and Atzeroth [sic&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;....]" New York, New York: ''The New York Times'', July 8, 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.loc.gov/item/2018667116/ Washington, D.C.

Hartranft reading the death warrant to the conspirators on the scaffold]" (photograph of Hartranft with Atzerodt, Herold, Paine, and Surratt with accompanying background information from the USLOC). Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, retrieved online September 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war life and political career==
Following the war Hartranft switched party allegiances and became a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He was appointed to serve in former general [[John W. Geary]]'s Pennsylvania administration as Auditor General from 1867 to 1873.

Hartranft was elected as governor in 1872. He was a strong advocate of education, municipal reform, regulation of banking, improved industry and commerce, and the reorganization of the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. He supported [[suffrage]] for African Americans, fought the corrupt [[Simon Cameron]] political machine, and championed the rights of the workingman.

[[File:JFHartranft.jpg|thumb|230px|John F. Hartranft after the American Civil War]]
During his administration, the revision of the Commonwealth's constitution was completed and ratified as the Constitution of 1873. It prohibited special and local legislation; and increased the terms for state legislators: House terms were increased to two years instead of one, and Senate terms to four years from three.

He was the 5th commander-in-chief of the Union veterans' organization, the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], serving from 1875 to 1877.  He was also a member of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].

The [[United States]] celebrated its centennial as a nation in 1876. Hartranft saw that Pennsylvania led the way in the celebration that was centered in [[Philadelphia]]'s Fairmount Park.

At the [[Republican National Convention]] in June 1876, he was a contender for the presidential nomination, but [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of [[Ohio]] was eventually selected. He had served with Hartranft during the Civil War in the same army corps.

During his second term, [[depression (economics)|economic depression]], low wages in industry and [[unemployment]], following the industrial boom of the early 1870s, resulted in national labor unrest and strikes culminating in the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. Serious [[civil disturbance]]s included riots associated with the railroad and general strikes of 1877 in several industrial cities: including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Reading and Scranton.{{efn|See also [[Pittsburgh railway riots]], [[Scranton General Strike]], [[Reading Railroad massacre]], and [[1877 Shamokin uprising]]}} There were other incidents with the [[Molly Maguires]] in the [[anthracite coal]] regions. Hartranft called out the state militia and then [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] troops to maintain order. In [[Philadelphia]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], fires were set and extensive railroad facilities and equipment burned, especially in Pittsburgh. Eleven people died along the [[Schuylkill River]] &lt;!-- in which city? --&gt;before Federal troops restored the peace. Hartranft later proposed recognition of [[labor union]]s and arbitration of claims.

Concerned with the governor's precedent in calling out the militia to battle civilians in Pittsburgh, the [[District Attorney]] of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] tried to force Hartranft to appear before a [[grand jury]] to explain his rationale. The courts backed Hartranft when he refused to appear. Their ruling became known as the "Hartranft Decision."

Hartranft returned to his home in Montgomery County in 1879, where he accepted the position of US [[Postmaster]]. He was subsequently appointed as Port Collector for Philadelphia (1881-1885).&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky. [http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00476.html Hartranft, John Frederick]. ''American National Biography Online'', February 2000. Retrieved December 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also reappointed to command the [[Pennsylvania National Guard]], which he had helped develop.

On August 26, 1886 Hartranft was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.

John Hartranft died in Norristown and was buried in [[Montgomery Cemetery (West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania)|Montgomery Cemetery]] in [[West Norriton Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], near [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]]. The Pennsylvania National Guard later provided an [[obelisk]] for his grave.

He was succeeded as commander of the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|Pennsylvania National Guard Division]] by [[George R. Snowden]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel T. Wiley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=khQVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA233 ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Delaware County, Pennsylvania''], 1894, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soldier Field]] is a stadium that opened in 1924. It has primarily served as the home field of the [[Chicago Bears]] professional football club for over four decades, but it also hosted numerous other events in its more than 90 years of existence (and was not made the home to the Chicago Bears until 1971, as prior to [[1971 NFL season|that season]] the Bears played at [[Wrigley Field]]). The Bears' intent was originally to move from Wrigley Field to [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]'s [[Dyche Stadium]], but that move was blocked by [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]] as well as the [[Big Ten Conference]], so they later took the City of Chicago up on their offer to move into Soldier Field where they have since played. Soldier Field has hosted a great variety and quantity of events since it opened.&lt;ref name="stadiumanditscity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Liam T.A.

===1924===
*September 5 was the first day of the first dedicatory event at Soldier Field. It was an athletic meet with policemen as participants, and was a fundraiser for the Chicago Police Benevolent Association, which provided support for police widows and officers disabled in the line of action. The meet's official opening ceremony on the second day featured 1,200 police officers parading through the stadium, fireworks, and music by two police bands, among other entertainment. The contests in the event included a [[chariot race]] and a game of "motorcycle polo". The opening ceremony was attended by 45,000 spectators. Events raising funds for Chicago's Policemen and Firemen Benevolent funds were a mainstay at Soldier Field until 1971.&lt;ref name=stadiumanditscity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Police Games to Open New Chicago Stadium| newspaper = Chicago Daily Tribune|date =September 5, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Chicago Police Field Day|newspaper =Sullivan's Englewood Times|location =Chicago|date =August 8, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =1,200 March to Dedicate Stadium|newspaper =Chicago American|date =September 6, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Eckersall|first =Walter|title =Traffic Cop Wins First Police Event|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune| date =September 6, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On September 10, there was yet another dedicatory event at Soldier Field. This one was the "Pageant of Music and Light", and was followed less than two weeks later by another ceremony.&lt;ref name=stadiumanditscity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =South Side Business Men to Attend Song Fest in New Stadium|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|location =Chicago|publisher =Chicago Trbiune|date =September 10, 1924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Citation|South Park Commissioners, memorandum (unlabeled) on the "first free use" of the stadium, n.d.

*On September 27, Soldier Field hosted a ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''-sponsored women's track meet featuring more than 500 Chicago-area participants. In addition to traditional [[track and field]] events, the competitions also included such events as a [[Basketball (ball)|basketball]] distance throw.&lt;ref name=stadiumanditscity/&gt;
*On October 4, the stadium hosted its first football game, a match between [[Louisville Male High School]] and Chicago's [[Austin Community Academy High School]]. Louisville's team won 26–0.&lt;ref name=stadiumanditscity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 2, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Oak Park Trims Austin 13–0 to Dedicate Stadium|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|date =September 28, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Austin Again Loses to Louisville High|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|date =October 5, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Austin Preps Meet Kentucky Team Saturday|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|date =October 2, 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 9, a "Chicago Day" event, marking the anniversary of the [[Great Chicago Fire]], was attended by a crowd of 60,000. The event contained the formal dedication and official opening of Grant Park Municipal Stadium. The event included military troops partaking in a mock battle, equine performances by riders from the [[14th Cavalry Regiment|14th Cavalry]]'s Troop A, and a semi re-enactment of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] with firemen (including ten who actually had fought the Great Fire) fighting the fire using Fire King No. 1 (Chicago's first pump engine). In the re-enactment, a cow knocked over a lantern (according to lore), a replica of the [[Catherine O'Leary|O'Leary]] barn was burned down, and firemen used modern equipment to fight a fire in a mock-up of a three-story building.

*On November 11, [[St. Viator College|Viator College]] of [[Bourbonnais, Illinois]] and [[Loras College|Columbia College]] of [[Dubuque, Iowa]] played in the 1924 Midwest Catholic League championship. The game benefited an [[American Legion]] fund for disabled veterans. The game ended 0–0. Due to poor weather conditions the attendance was only 2,000.

Northwestern's [[Ralph Baker (halfback)|Ralph "Moon" Baker]]  (a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]) would later say that this game, during which he kicked two [[field goal]]s (one 34 and the other 36 yards) against the [[1924 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1924 Notre Dame team]] that featured the "[[Four Horsemen (American football)|Four Horsemen]]", was his greatest thrill.

There were two shows a day, airplane fights in the afternoon, searchlights and antiaircraft-mimicking fireworks in the evening. The highlight of the day shows was a radio-dispatched arrangement of warplanes flying over the stadium. Audience members could hear the air-to-ground radio communication via the stadium's state-of-the-art loudspeaker system, and watch the planes respond to the ground command and perform stunts. 25,000 attended the first afternoon show, among them [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Charles G. Dawes]]. The temperature was 92 degrees. The show reenacted the [[Battle of the Argonne]] utilizing, among other things, a smoke screen and four tanks. In the first night show's reenactment an infantryman was injured when he was trampled by horses, and prior to that show a policeman partaking in a Roman-style horse race was thrown from his horse and also injured.  For the final day wind kept the planes grounded, and the crowd was small due to chilly temperature that peaked near 40 degrees.

Much like Rodgers, Lowden was also a big-name at the time. A former Illinois Congressman and Governor, Lowden had declined the Vice-Presidential nomination at the [[1924 Republican National Convention]],&lt;ref name=Images/&gt; a position which was taken by fellow-Illinoisan [[Charles G. Dawes]] (who ultimately would go on to win the 1924 election as [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s running mate). The event at Soldier Field began with decorated war veterans escorting [[Gold Star Mothers Club|Gold Star Mothers]] to their seats, and a salute fired by field artillery. The [[Flag of the United States]] was then raised, followed with a large banner baring the words 'Soldier Field' that had been carried into the stadium by the Gold Star Mothers. This was followed with a parade led by an Army general. The parade featured sailors from the nearby [[Great Lakes Naval Station]], [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] units, and various veterans groups (including the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]). Following the procession of the parade, Rodgers spoke about his attempted non-stop flight. Other speakers included South Park Board-member, and future-[[Mayor of Chicago|mayor]], [[Edward J.

*November 27 over 110,000 spectators attended the 1926 [[Army-Navy Game]]. It would decide the national championship, as Navy entered undefeated and Army had lost only to Notre Dame.

*1926 marked the first year that a football game benefiting causes related to the Chicago [[Sisters of Mercy]] (amongst them the order's Catholic high schools and [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center|Mercy Hospital]]). These games were held annually until the 1951. Most often it featured a matchup of two Catholic League schools (commonly [[St. Rita of Cascia High School|Saint Rita]] and [[Leo Catholic High School|Leo]]). Some years the game included professional or college teams. The game usually attracted between 20,000 and 30,000 spectators. It was started by Sister Mary Ricardo, who decided a football game would be a good annual fundraiser after a meeting with [[Chris O'Brien (American football)|Chris O'Brien]]. O'Brien suggested that a game against the [[Kansas City Blues/Cowboys|Kansas City Cowboys]] could be moved from [[Comiskey Park]] to Soldier Field.&lt;ref name=stadiumanditscity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Rites Monday for Nun Who Set Up Forum|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|date =July 11, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Marquette and St. Louis Renew 30 Year Rivalry|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|date =October 9, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Grid Teams to Play Sunday for High School Benefit|newspaper =Chicago Daily Tribune|page=24|date =November 21, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=100 Extra Tickets for Game on Sale|newspaper=[[Chicago American]]|date=November 27, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Paul T.|title=City Turns Out to Welcome Army and Navy|newspaper=[[Chicago American]]|date=November 27, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here Is Official Army-Navy Game Program for Today|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=November 27, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fry|first=Kenneth D.|title=Army and navy Locked in Great Annual Battle|newspaper=[[Chicago American]]|date=November 27, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Don |title=News Bits of the Game the Army Played to a 21-21 Draw|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=November 28, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coolidge Drops Work to Listen in on Grid Tilt|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|agency=Chicago Tribune Press Service|date=November 28, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fur Wrapped Society Joins Football Crowd|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=November 28, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crusinberry|first=James |title=Players Glad Foe Was Held to a Tie Score|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=November 28, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*July 23 52,095 saw the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] play the Chicago All-Stars in what would be the final [[Chicago College All-Star Game]].

The star quarterback for the College All-Stars was Steeler draft pick [[Mike Kruczek]], out of [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. Late in the third quarter, with the Steelers leading 24–0, high winds prompted all-star coach [[Ara Parseghian]] to call time out.  Fans began pouring out onto the field and sliding on the turf.  With the rain getting harder, the officials ordered both teams to their locker rooms. All attempts to clear the field failed; the fans even tore down the goalposts. However, by this time the rain had become so heavy as to make the field unplayable even if order had been restored.  Finally, at 11:01 pm NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] and the ''Tribune'' announced that the game had been called. The news was greeted with jeers, and numerous brawls broke out on the flooded field before order was finally restored. [[Joe Washington]] of [[1975 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] was selected MVP of this final College All-Star game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QvwjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jH4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6729%2C1574307 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |last=Shepard |first=Terry |title=Rain and fans do in players |date=July 24, 1976 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1KtVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3uADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6480%2C5825113|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press|title=Rampaging fans, rain shorten all-star game |date=July 24, 1976|page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago Tribune Charities had every intention of staging a 1977 game.

*November 23 [[Jerry Markbreit]] began what would be a 23-season career as an NFL referee (during which he would become one of the league's most recognizable referees) when he refereed a game between the Chicago Bears and the [[Green Bay Packers]]. In the second quarter of the game, Bears quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] was intercepted, and as he watched the proceedings downfield, Packers defensive end [[Charles Martin (football player)|Charles Martin]] picked up McMahon and bodyslammed him shoulder-first into the [[AstroTurf]]. Martin remained hovered over an injured McMahon on one knee and taunted him until Bears offensive tackle [[Jimbo Covert]] barreled full-speed into Martin. Despite strenuous protests from Packers coach [[Forrest Gregg]], Markbreit ejected Martin, Markbreit's first ejection as an NFL official.  When describing the penalty, Markbreit stated that Martin "stuffed" McMahon into the ground. Martin was suspended for two games by NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], the longest suspension for an on-field incident until [[Tennessee Titans]] defensive tackle [[Albert Haynesworth]] was suspended five games by commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for stomping on the face of [[Dallas Cowboys]] center [[Andre Gurode]] during an October 1, 2006 game  During the game, Martin wore a "hit list" towel with the numbers of several Bears listed, including those of McMahon, running back [[Walter Payton]], wide receiver [[Willie Gault]], and center [[Jay Hilgenberg]].  The call was largely credited by the media and NFL executives in helping Markbreit land the assignment as the referee of [[Super Bowl XXI]] two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= | url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/TEN/9700907 | title=Titans' Haynesworth gets five-game suspension | publisher=NFL.com | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2006-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013112235/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/TEN/9700907 |archivedate = 2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was a great atmosphere and an unbelievable experience", Notre Dame defenseman Sam Calabrese said.  The game featured stellar play from both goaltenders, including Notre Dame's Steven Summerhays, who stopped 22 of 33 shots fired his way on the day.  Mario Lucia got the scoring started for the Fighting Irish when he whipped a one-timer past RedHawks net-minder Ryan McKay at 12:42 in the second period. Notre Dame added to its lead early in the third period when Jeff Costello banged in a rebound of Anders Lee shot to give the Irish a two-goal advantage.  Miami cut the Irish's lead in half a little over a minute later thanks to a goal by Kevin Morris, but Summerhays and the Notre Dame defense stood tall and fought off the late charge.  Wisconsin 3, Minnesota 2 – Wisconsin used three second-period goals to build a lead and withstood a third-period surge to defeat Minnesota, 3-2, at Soldier Field. John Rumpel recorded 36 saves, with 15 of those stops coming in the opening 20 minutes.  "His performance in the first period allowed us to get our feet out and underneath us", Badgers coach Mike Eaves said. "Then we rode an explosive period in terms of goal scoring for us." The Badgers scored all three of their goals in a remarkable 3 minutes and 19 seconds in the second period as Kevin Schulze, Brendan Woods and Sean Little all found the back of the net.  Minnesota mounted a furious rally in the closing period, scoring twice, but Rumpel came up with his biggest save of the day when he turned away the Golden Gophers' final shot at the buzzer to preserve the win.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.ngin.com/attachments/document/0060/1042/Minn_WI_2013.pdf |title=Hockey Game Box Score (Final) #2 Minnesota vs #18 Wisconsin (Feb 17, 2013 at Chicago) |website=assets.ngin.com/ |access-date=November 3, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.ngin.com/attachments/document/0060/1032/Miami_Notre_Dame_Box_2013.pdf |title=Hockey Game Box Score (Final) #12 Notre Dame vs #3 Miami (Feb 17, 2013 at Chicago, Ill.) |website=assets.ngin.com |access-date=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 edition of the Hockey City Classic featured a match between [[Miami RedHawks men's ice hockey|Miami of Ohio]] and [[Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey|Western Michigan]], followed by a match between the [[Big Ten]]'s [[Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey|Michigan]] and [[Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey|Michigan State]].

*July 3–5, 2015 the [[Grateful Dead]] performed a series of three reunion concerts at Soldier Field celebrating the band's 50th anniversary. This was a portion of a concert series entitled "[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead]]", which were their first concerts since their July 1995 concert at Soldier Field. The three concerts at Soldier Field were originally to be their only concerts, but due to overwhelming ticket demand the series was expanded to include two dates at [[Levi's Stadium]] in [[Santa Clara, California]] (in the [[San Francisco Bay area]]) performed the weekend prior to the Soldier Field concerts. The band at the concerts consisted of the surviving Grateful Dead members [[Bob Weir]], [[Phil Lesh]], [[Bill Kreutzmann]] and [[Mickey Hart]], who had no performed together since [[The Dead (band)|the Dead]]'s 2009 tour,  who were joined by [[Trey Anastasio]], [[Bruce Hornsby]] and [[Jeff Chimenti]]. The concerts at Soldier Field were also broadcast with a live [[Simulcasting|simulcast]] seen by hundreds of thousands on [[pay-per-view]] [[cable television]], (for free) on [[YouTube]], on large screens at multiple concert venues in the United States, in movie theaters, as well as in various [[pay per view]] services. Satellite radio service [[Sirius]] played the concerts, with a slight delay, on their Grateful Dead channel. The pay-per-view set a new record for a music event with more than 400,000 subscriptions, surpassing a 1999 simulcast by the [[Backstreet Boys]] which drew 160,000 subscriptions. The concerts at Soldier Field were documented by director [[Martin Scorsese]] for a film. Recordings from the concert will be released as a live album on November 20, 2015.  There will be three different versions of the recording. Each concert was attended by over 70,000 (more than 210,000 overall). The first date drew 70,764, setting a new record for attendance at Soldier Field post-renovation, a record that was surpassed the next night when 70,844 attended the second concert.

This is a list of missing [[aircraft]] that disappeared in flight for reasons that have never been definitely determined. According to ''Annex 13'' of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], an aircraft is considered to be missing "when the official search has been terminated and the [[Debris|wreckage]] has not been located".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emsa.europa.eu/retro/Docs/marine_casualties/annex_13.pdf|title=International Standards And Recommended Practices. Annex 13 To the Convention on International Civil Aviation|work=EMSA|page=10|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list does not include every [[aviator]], or air passenger that has ever gone missing (See: [[:Category:Missing aviators]] and [[:Category:Missing air passengers]] for extended lists on that matter).

'''Madonna: Tears of a Clown''' is a show by American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], first held at the [[Forum Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] on March 10, 2016. The singer had not included Australia during her previous five concert tours, until the [[Rebel Heart Tour]] (2015–2016), so she created the show for her Australian fans since they had waited so long for her to perform there. Madonna explained that the idea behind Tears of a Clown was to combine music and storytelling, being influenced by clowns. Tickets for the first show were made available to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and were non-transferable, with the person's name printed on them.

The first show of Tears of a Clown started four hours late, with the delay being caused by Madonna rehearsing. It consisted of Madonna singing acoustic versions of her songs while dressed as a clown, interspersed with the singer telling jokes and anecdotes. Tears of a Clown received positive reviews from critics who appreciated the stripped down, confessional nature of the singer's performance and the choice of the songs and the comedy. Madonna refuted reports of her being drunk on stage, calling them false and sexist. She revived the show on December 2, 2016, performing at Miami's Faena Forum as a benefit gala, to auction memorabilia and raise money for her [[Raising Malawi]] charitable foundation. Tickets were expensive, and the auctioned items included Madonna's tour dress and wedding photographs, as well as paintings that she owned.

Madonna had last toured in Australia in 1993 with [[The Girlie Show World Tour]], her fourth concert tour. The country was skipped for the next five tours until the singer released her thirteenth studio album, ''[[Rebel Heart (Madonna album)|Rebel Heart]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/madonna-to-tour-australia-for-the-first-time-in-23-years-20150302-13t5s5.html|title=Madonna to tour Australia for the first time in 23 years|date=March 1, 2015|accessdate=March 2, 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote the album, Madonna announced the [[Rebel Heart Tour]], and confirmed that she would be coming to Australia with the concert, as well as visit New Zealand for the first time.&lt;ref name="bbannounce"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6487508/madonna-to-launch-rebel-heart-world-tour-in-august|title=Madonna To Launch 'Rebel Heart' World Tour in August|last=Waddell|first=Ray|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=March 2, 2015|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before arriving in Australia, Madonna announced an extra show on March 10, 2016, at Melbourne's [[Forum Theatre]]. The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had waited for her to perform there for the last 23 years.&lt;ref name="tears"/&gt; During her promotional appearance at ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a "kind of closet comedian" and did a skit on the show; she added, "I always do extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity."&lt;ref name="count"/&gt; During the show, the singer explained her decision to do Tears of a Clown:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I've had this idea in my head for this show Tears of a Clown which is a combination of music and storytelling. Because at the end of the day I do think of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, {{sic}} so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.&lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{cite web|first=Cameron |last=Adams |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/tours/review-madonna-is-late-loose-and-ultra-personal-at-her-fanonly-tears-of-a-clown-show-in-melbourne/news-story/9e7544d51ef1b27e248171cdbdf0c51b |title=Emotional Mads opens up about son |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=March 10, 2016 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tickets were made available to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and winners with details announced at Madonna.com and through concert promoter [[Telstra]]'s promotional webpage.&lt;ref name="tears"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6898205/madonna-intimate-music-art-comedy-club-show-australia |title=Madonna Announces Intimate Music, Art and Comedy Club Show for Australian Fans |last1=Brandle |first1=Lars|date=March 3, 2016 |work=Billboard |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to newspaper reports, the tickets were non-transferable, and had the person's name printed on them. However, all of them were in the [[Seating assignment|general admission]] category at Forum Theatre, which holds a maximum capacity of 1,500. With the production design and addition of catwalk, the space allocated became smaller than that.&lt;ref name="rehearse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/madonna-has-started-rehearsing-her-music-and-stand-up-comedy-show-tears-of-a-clown-in-melbourne/news-story/d1a530df8eadfcbe4c41918fb7340a27 |title=Madonna in Australia on Rebel Heart tour: Tears of a Clown rehearsals under way |publisher=News.com.au |date=March 9, 2016 |last=Adams |first=Cameron |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the show ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that fans started queuing up in front of the venue, while Madonna rehearsed inside, as well as at [[Melbourne Park Multi-Purpose Venue|Hisense Arena]].&lt;ref name="count"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rehearse"/&gt; Images and songs rehearsed were leaked to fan website Drownedmadonna.com, along with Madonna's manager [[Guy Oseary]] uploading pictures on [[Instagram]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:Madonna - Tears of a clown (26013429350).jpg|thumb|200px|Madonna began the show by entering the stage on a tricycle and dressed as a clown.]]
On the day of the show, the doors at Forum Theatre were supposed to open at 8:30pm, but since Madonna rehearsed well into the night, the show started later at midnight. The show started with Madonna appearing onstage, in a clown's costume consisting of a billowing dress, pink and yellow stalkings, riding a tricycle and circled round it.&lt;ref name="wait"/&gt; She finally reached the front of the stage and fell down from the cycle. After conversing with the audience and throwing candy at them. Madonna started singing [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s "[[Send in the Clowns]]", written originally for the 1973 musical, ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', with images from [[Charlie Chaplin]] films displayed on the backdrop. She continued with "[[Drowned World/Substitute for Love]]" while standing in the center. Three songs followed with Madonna joining the band and sitting down with her guitar, including "X-Static Process", a cover of [[Elliott Smith]]'s "Between the Bars", "Nobody's Perfect" and "Easy Ride". All the songs had displays showing circus themed videos; following this Madonna started singing the song "Intervention", while displaying an image of her son Rocco; the singer referred to her custody battle with ex-husband [[Guy Ritchie]] about Rocco.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;

Other acoustic versions of songs followed, including "I'm So Stupid", "Paradise (Not for Me)", "[[Joan of Arc (Madonna song)|Joan of Arc]]" and "[[Don't Tell Me (Madonna song)|Don't Tell Me]]". Before performing the next song, "Mer Girl", Madonna explained that once she was at her father's house and she visited the place where her mother was buried; the place, overgrown with weed, became an inspiration behind the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35783922|title=Madonna clowns around and sheds tears for Rocco at Melbourne show|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=April 4, 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Madonna sang an acoustic version of "[[Borderline (Madonna song)|Borderline]]" followed by "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]". The encore was an acoustic version of "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" featuring Madonna playing the [[ukulele]] accompanied by her band and her dancers dressed as clowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/inside-madonnas-intimate-tears-of-a-clown-show-in-melbourne/858982|title=Inside Madonna's intimate 'Tears of a Clown' show in Melbourne|last=S.

==Critical response==
[[File:Madonna - Tears of a clown (26193856572).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Madonna playing the ukulele while performing "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", the show's final song.]]
Cameron Adams from [[News.com.au]] wrote: "[Madonna] poured much of her sadness into her intimate two-hour Tears of a Clown show, peppering emotional renditions of her hits with cheeky jokes and banter."&lt;ref name="wait"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/tours/madonna-tears-of-a-clown-intimate-concert-for-fans-at-the-forum-in-melbourne/news-story/c42664cdd548419736bc51b3e062e525 |title=Madonna at Forum in Melbourne for Tears of a Clown Show |publisher=News.com.au |last=Adams |first=Cameron |date=March 9, 2016 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another article reviewing the show, Adams noted that Tears of a Clown was "the sort of thing you never thought you'd see a superstar do". He complimented Madonna's jokes, chatting about her life in-between songs, for being "raw and vulnerable" and confessed that it was "fascinating&amp;nbsp;— and difficult&amp;nbsp;— to watch. We're not used to Madonna on stage doing anything less than a fully rehearsed, slick stage show." Concluding the review, Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna's touring direction into the future.&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt; Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'' Nick Levine noticed that the singer "tested out her stand-up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense."&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick |last=Levine |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/madonna-plays-gig-dressed-as-a-clown-and-rides-a-child-s-tricycle-for-tears-of-a-clown-show-a6923206.html |title=Madonna plays gig dressed as a clown and rides a child’s tricycle for 'Tears of a Clown' show |work=[[The Independent]] |date=March 10, 2016 |accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie Cuthbertson from ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' gave a positive review of the show, saying "For the queen of self-control, it was an open, at times even vulnerable insight into her persona. She seemed relaxed, drinking Cosmopolitans as she spoke at length between songs." Cuthbertson also commended the choice of Forum Theatre as a venue believing it to be "inspired, and her crew lit up the grand old dame in a way that showcased all her delicate charms in a way I can't recall any other act having ever done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Debbie |last=Cuthbertson |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/madonnas-intimate-melbourne-show-tears-of-a-clown-a-unique-confessional-20160311-gng3fr.html |title=Madonna's intimate Melbourne show Tears of A Clown a unique confessional |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lachlan Kanoniuk, music critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'', noted the "bawdy" jokes and anecdotes shared onstage by Madonna. He went on to describe the show as "a weird mix of old vaudevillian-style, M15+, smut humour and bad wordplay; some jokes about clowns, sex jokes that were really quite bad but she had such great comedic delivery". Kanoniuk also compared the show to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[Piano &amp; A Microphone Tour]], and complimented her singing during "Between the Bars", describing it as "no costume changes, no highly synchronised dance moves, just Madonna playing an acoustic guitar and baring her soul on stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/11/madonna-clowns-around-at-melbourne-show-after-three-hour-delay|title=Madonna Clowns Around at Melbourne Show After Three Hour Delay|first=Lachlan |last=Kanoniuk|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Gibb from ''[[The Times]]'' found Madonna's performance during "Intervention" as an intimate and "naked" moment for the singer due to the legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/celebrity/article4710837.ece |title=Tears of a clown as Madonna sobs for son |work=[[The Times]] |last=Gibb |first=Francis |date=March 10, 2016 |accessdate=March 13, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Lisi from ''[[PopMatters]]'' observed that unlike the Rebel Heart Tour, Madonna had "something to say" with Tears of a Clown show. However he was confused whether Madonna was being vulnerable as a clown or it was a case of the singer "[[Internet troll|trolling us]]". Citing the instance of singing "Intervention" for Rocco, Lisi explained that "Of course she loves her son, but maybe this was less about her pain and more about the press’ exploitation of her pain. As the show got more intimate with each song and personal anecdote, a disturbing thought crept into my mind: what if it was meant to be a joke?" Lisi concluded that the show had the ability "represent a transitional point in [Madonna's] career", although the purpose was still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/is-madonna-tears-of-a-clown-a-laughing-matter/|title=Is 'Madonna Tears of a Clown' a Laughing Matter?|last=Lisi|first=Jon|date=May 3, 2016|accessdate=May 26, 2016|work=[[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the show ended, several media outlets reported that Madonna may have been drunk during the performance; however, Madonna blasted these reports, by responding: "Thanks for supporting me. Too bad people don't know the art of acting and playing a character. I could never do any of my shows high or drunk. And yes underlying all of this is sexism and mysongony {{sic}} which proves that not only do we not get equal pay but we are still treated like heretics if we step out of line and think outside the box! Sexism is alive and kicking but i am #livingforlove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mic.com/articles/137938/madonna-calls-backlash-for-her-tears-of-a-clown-performance-in-australia-sexist|title=Madonna Calls Backlash for Her 'Tears of a Clown' Performance in Australia Sexist|last=Leung|first=Andrew|date=March 15, 2016|accessdate=March 17, 2016|publisher=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successive show==
In October 2016, Madonna announced plans of collaborating with [[Art Basel]] to revive the Tears of a Clown show, at a benefit gala on December 2, 2016 at [[Miami Beach]]'s Faena Forum. The location was developed by Argentine hotelier and real estate developer, [[Alan Faena]], and the show would coincide with the opening of the Forum.&lt;ref name=artbasel/&gt; The concert was held along with an accompanying art auction and dinner, to benefit Madonna's [[Raising Malawi]] foundation to support their projects like Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi, as well as art and education initiatives for impoverished children in the country. Madonna herself auctioned some of her art collection, as well as never-before-seen pictures from her marriage to actor [[Sean Penn]], photographed by [[Herb Ritts]].&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt; Tickets were highly priced, at general admission of $5,000 with VIP meet-and-greet packages coming at $150,000.&lt;ref name=artbasel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article117046648.html|title=For $5,000, you can see Madonna dressed as a clown. Oh yes, she'll sing|last=Herrera|first=Chabeli|date=November 25, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2016|work=[[Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also auctioned the flapper dress from Rebel Heart Tour, [[model (person)|modelled]] by singer [[Ariana Grande]] during the show. Penn was present in the audience and bid on several items, and at one point handcuffed Madonna and crawled through her legs for generating a higher bid.&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt;

Madonna was aided by her son David Banda, who was adopted by the singer from Malawi; Banda introduced Madonna and told the audience who bought the tickets about how "lucky" he was. The Tears of a Clown show was over an hour long, with Madonna giving her opinions on the [[2016 United States Presidential Election]], panning President elect [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt; One of the new songs included in the set list was [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]"&amp;nbsp;(2004), which Madonna sang slowly, as images of Trump were displayed in video backdrops. The singer also spoke about the turmoils of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]], and then sang "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]" (2003).&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt; Other songs performed included "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" (1989), "[[Beautiful Stranger]]" (1999) and "Don't Tell Me" (2000). During "Holiday", one fan got the chance to hold Madonna's microphone as she played the ukulele and sang, as well as another fan donating $150,000 in exchange for kissing the singer.&lt;ref name=extra&gt;{{cite news|url=http://extratv.com/2016/12/02/madonna-clowns-around-at-miami-fundraiser-zings-president-elect-trump/|title=Madonna Offers to Remarry Sean Penn at Miami Fundraiser, Zings President-elect Trump|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016|work=[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Madonna raised about US$7.3&amp;nbsp;million from her own items. The [[Associated Press]] reported that "[the] night was punctuated by [Madonna's] sardonic humor, corny clown jokes, controversial political statements and heartfelt moments about how much the hospital project means to her."&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/03/madonna-raises-75m-for-malawi-slams-trump-in-miami-show.html|title=Madonna raises $7.5M for Malawi, slams Trump in Miami show|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016|publisher=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Air Race Museum''' (NARM) was a short-lived (1993-1994) [[aviation museum]] featuring the Golden Age of [[Air racing|Racing]] and the [[Reno Air Races]], located in [[Sparks, Nevada|Sparks]], [[Nevada]]. Aircraft exhibited included an original, non-flying replica of [[Hughes H-1 Racer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fancy These Flights? |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/153309923/ |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |date=August 26, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft displayed==
* 1944 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]G;
* 1910 [[Curtiss Model D|Curtiss pusher]];
* 1913 [[Deperdussin]] replica;
* 1925 [[Curtiss R3C-2]] replica;
* 1926 [[Macchi M.39]] replica;
* 1931 [[Supermarine S.6B]] replica;
* 1936 [[Rider R-4]] #70 Schoenfeldt "Firecracker", winner, 1938 Greve Race in Cleveland;
* 1938 [[Rider R-6]] "Eightball" flown in Oakland and Cleveland, 1938-1939;

* 1948 [[Miss Cosmic Wind]] #6 raced and owned by Bill Stead, Founder of Reno Air Races; 
* [[Formula-1 Racer Stinger]] #21 owned and flown by Astronaut Deke Slayton.

Artifacts on display included a pair of leather gloves left behind by [[Charles Lindbergh]] in 1927 when he flew into [[Blanchard Field]], Reno's Original Airport.

The [[National Automobile Museum]] would rotate vintage vehicles through to complement antique [[hot air balloon]] display.

NARM Visitors were beneficiaries of exchange programs with a number of Museums including the [[National Air and Space Museum]].

The museum included an Aviation Art Gallery, Gift Shop and "Fuselage Theater" built with commercial airliner interior for screening of movies.

Many of the air racers and the Bf 109G were on loan from the Air Museum in [[Chino, California|Chino]], [[California]]. The Bf 109G was last seen, a few years ago, in the [[Planes of Fame]] satellite museum near the Grand Canyon at Valle Airport in [[Williams, Arizona|Valle-Williams]], [[Arizona]], along with a letter from General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s son informing NARM that Jimmy had become ill and was unable to attend NARM's Grand Opening.

As of May 10, 2008 many of the other racers and replicas are in a hangar at the Main Planes of Fame Museum in Chino.  Ed Maloney, President of the Air Museum, says the air racers will soon be featured in an air racing display. The non-flying replica of the Hughes H-1 Racer is currently in storage.

Opened in May 1993, NARM closed in February, 1994.  Over 20,000 visitors came through in less than a year of operation.  A learning center including Flight School for Kids at Risk and any other children who wanted to learn more about flying was under development at time of closure.

The Planes of Fame Museum briefly reopened NARM in September, 1994, before removing all contents of NARM which have been relocated to Chino and Valle-Williams.

'''October Revolution Day''' (officially '''Day of the Great October Socialist Revolution''', {{lang-ru|День Великой Октябрьской социалистической революции}}) was a [[public holidays in the Soviet Union|public holiday]] in the [[Soviet Union]], officially observed on [[November 7]] from 1927 to 1990.&lt;ref name="rians"&gt;{{cite news |title=День Октябрьской революции 1917 года |url=https://ria.ru/spravka/20171107/1507990701.html |accessdate=26 October 2018 |work=РИА Новости |date=7 November 2017 |language=ru |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111115316/https://ria.ru/spravka/20171107/1507990701.html |archive-date=2017-11-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Soviet families, it was a holiday tradition to partake in a shared morning meal, and to watch the October Revolution Parade broadcast on television.&lt;ref name="rians"/&gt;

A holiday canon was established during the Stalinist period, and included a workers' demonstration, the appearance of leaders on the podium of the [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Mausoleum]], and, finally, the military parade on [[Red Square]], which was held unfailingly every year, most famously in [[1941 October Revolution Parade|1941]], as the Axis forces were advancing on Moscow.&lt;ref name="rian08"/&gt;

October Revolution Day, which had been the main holiday of the year during the Stalinist period, gradually lost importance in the 1970s,  falling behind the [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] and [[Novy God|New Year]] celebrations.&lt;ref name="rian08"/&gt;

==Post-Soviet observance==
In [[Kyrgyzstan]], the holiday was observed until 2017, when it was replaced by the 'Days of Ancestral History and Memory' on November 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Президент Киргизии постановил отмечать 7-8 ноября Дни истории и памяти предков |url=https://www.interfax.ru/world/584663 |accessdate=26 October 2018 |work=Interfax.ru |date=26 October 2017 |language=ru-RU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601162819/http://www.interfax.ru/world/584663 |archive-date=2018-06-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, October Revolution Day remains an official holiday in [[Belarus]], though the original significance has faded and it is simply regarded as a day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Минчане о 7 ноября: «Это праздник, но какой - не помню» |url=https://www.kp.by/daily/26603/3619348/ |accessdate=26 October 2018 |work=Комсомольской правды |date=6 November 2016 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the unrecognized [[Transnistrian]] Republic, the day is officially a public holiday, but it is regarded by locals as devoid of its original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= |title=7 ноября в Приднестровье по-пролетарски празднуют лишь коммунисты |url=https://www.dw.com/ru/7-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8F-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8C%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%88%D1%8C-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B/a-4867744 |accessdate=26 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=7 November 2009 |language=ru |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522140645/http://www.dw.com/ru/7-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8F-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8C%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%82-%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%88%D1%8C-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B/a-4867744 |archive-date=2017-05-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, the holiday was repurposed several times. In 1995, President [[Yeltsin]] reestablished a November 7 holiday to commemorate the [[Battle of Moscow (1612)|liberation of Moscow]] from the Polish army in 1612.&lt;ref name="rian08"&gt;{{cite news |title=7 ноября: пять праздников одного дня.

The Network has three main initiatives:
* Free To Choose Media, which produces television programs and videos making classical liberal economic and political ideas accessible to a popular audience
* izzit.org,which produces media for children, sometimes adapting public television broadcasts for a school audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=One Eye To Protecting The Brand |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-508414_ITM |work=Entertainment Marketing Letter |publisher= |date=1 Aug 1999 |accessdate=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Right Whines |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28311411_ITM  |work=The Nation  |publisher= |date=2 Oct 2000  |accessdate=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/media/feature/2000/02/25/stossel/index.html Prime-time propagandist, Is ABC's John Stossel a reporter or a right-wing apparatchik?

Chitester Fund.]] --&gt;

The Palmer R. Chitester Fund ( Free To Choose Network) was founded by Bob Chitester, using start-up money provided by a number of charitable sources and named in honor of his father.  At the time, Bob Chitester was the general manager of two public broadcasters in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]: the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] channel [[WQLN (TV)|WQLN-TV]] and the [[National Public Radio|NPR]] station [[WQLN-FM]].

== History ==
The origins of the foundation lay in PBS's broadcast of ''The Age of Uncertainty'' (1975), a 13-part [[BBC]] series produced by liberal economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]].&lt;ref name="heartland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heartland.org/policybot/results.html?artId=20187 |title=Personal Reflections on Milton Friedman - by Bob Chitester - News Releases |publisher=Heartland.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chairman of the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] was a classical liberal economist, [[W. Allen Wallis]], who had met Chitester in 1975 when he participated in a symposium on "Technology and Society" arranged by Chitester in Erie and learned that Chitester shared his classical liberal economic views.&lt;ref name="heartland1"/&gt;  Wallis and Chitester both believed that PBS should produce a classical liberal response to ''The Age of Uncertainty''.  Wallis therefore introduced Chitester to his old friend [[Milton Friedman]] in early 1977 (shortly after Friedman won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]).&lt;ref name="heartland1"/&gt;  As a result, Chitester raised the necessary funding and Executive Produced a 10-part PBS series entitled ''[[Free to Choose]]'', which first aired in early 1980.  Friedman also co-authored a book with his wife [[Rose Friedman]] that was based on the television series.  This book spent 5 weeks at the top of the [[List of New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers|''New York Times'' Non-Fiction Best Sellers List]] in 1980.

It was in the context of producing the ''Free to Choose'' series that Chitester first organized Amagin, Inc., which became the Palmer R. Chitester Fund, which became Free To Choose Network. Under the trademark Free To Choose Media it continues to produce media describing classical liberal economic ideas to a mass audience.  Beginning in 1999, the Palmer R. Chitester Fund, was licensed by [[ABC News]] to distribute [[John Stossel]] TV specials under the brand "Stossel in the Classroom". The license was cancelled in 2004.

Free To Choose Media has produced a number of programs for public TV including: a biography of Milton Friedman, entitled ''The Power of Choice -'' ''The Ultimate Resource'' (named after the 1981 book ''[[The Ultimate Resource]]'' by [[Julian Lincoln Simon]]) -''Turmoil and Triumph'' a biography of George Shultz - ''The Power of the Poor,'' hosted by Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto - ''India Rising'', hosted by Swedish scholar Johan Norberg - ''The Real Adam Smith, hosted by Johan Norberg.'' 

The organization currently known as izzit.org was initially called In the Classroom Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freetochoosemedia.org/production/ultimate_resource/press/production_team_bios.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724173057/http://www.freetochoosemedia.org/production/ultimate_resource/press/production_team_bios.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Izzit.org provides teachers with materials on current events and other topics for in-classroom use. Izzit.org has used celebrities (e.g. [[Drew Carey]]) in some of its productions.

The Idea Channel no longer markets the documentaries produced by Free To Choose Media. Much of the Palmer R. Chitester Fund archival footage now appears on YouTube.

The '''Romanian occupation''' of [[Pokuttya]] took place in early 1919, when, as a result of [[Polish–Romanian Alliance|alliances]] concluded between [[Romania]] and [[Poland]], the former entered the southeastern corner of the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] ruled province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. During the [[interwar period]], Romania was Poland's main ally in [[Eastern Europe]] (''see [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]]''). Both nations were bound by several treaties and history of this alliance dates back to the end of World War I and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. However, to actively cooperate, governments in [[Bucharest]] and [[Warsaw]] emphasized the necessity of a shared border. Discussions about the border started in Paris some time at the beginning of 1919 and continued during the following months.
[[File:Cmt 1919.jpg|thumb|185px|Stamp of the Romanian military authorities for an occupied territory of Ukraine, 1919]]
The proposal for occupation was first advanced by the Romanian government of [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] on May 8, 1919. Brătianu suggested this as a means to separate both [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]] from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influences, thus consolidating the position of both [[Greater Romania]] and the [[Second Polish Republic]], as well as help the Poles get in touch with their Romanian ally.

The proposal was accepted by the Polish leader, Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] and on May 24, 1919, the [[Romanian Army]] 7. Infantry Division, led by General [[Iacob Zadik]], entered Pokuttya. After three days, the Romanians met the Poles in the area of [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalusz]]. As [[Polish Army]] was involved in other conflicts (chiefly with the Soviets), the Romanians stayed in Pokuttya until late August 1919. Their units were stationed in such towns as [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], and [[Kolomyia]]. In late summer of 1919 Polish troops entered Pokuttya (''see [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]'') and the Romanians withdrew to their country.

Also, the mutual cooperation resulted in Romanian permit for the free passage of the [[4th Rifle Division (Poland)|4th Riflemen Division]] (under General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]). This unit was kept in Romanian province of [[Bukovina]] for political purposes, and on June 17, 1919 the Romanians allowed it to enter Poland.

[[File:Samyak 2002.jpg|thumb|Samyak 2002 at Bhuikhel]]
{{Buddhism}}
'''Samyak''' ([[Devanagari]]: सम्यक) is an almsgiving Buddhist festival celebrated in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] in [[Nepal]]. During the ceremony which is held on a large open ground, hundreds of images of [[Dīpankara Buddha]] are assembled, and gifts of different types of food are made to the deities and the Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T. |title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf |accessdate=7 February 2013 |newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies |date=January 1996}} Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Samyak is the most spectacular [[Newar Buddhism|Newar Buddhist]] celebration. It is observed at different intervals in the three cities of the valley -- every 12 years in [[Kathmandu]], every five years in [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur]] and annually in [[Bhaktapur]]. The first documented Samyak festival in Kathmandu took place in 1015 AD (135 [[Nepal Era]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Rourke |first=Mary-Jo |editor-first=Darasha |editor-last=Newami |title=The Samyak Festival of Kathmandu |publisher=Dharma Ratna Shakya |date=1993|chapter=The Samyak Festival of Kathmandu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival brings together a wide cross-section of [[Newar]] society, including priests, artisans, traders, musicians and farmers. Each group has a defined role designed to highlight social harmony. The ceremony celebrates the practice of giving to the Buddhas and monks in the Newar Buddhist tradition. The Samyak festival in Kathmandu is held at [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] and the field of [[Bhuikhel]] at the foot of [[Swayambhu]] hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Todd Thornton |authorlink= |title= Popular Buddhist Texts from Nepal: Narratives and Rituals of Newar Buddhism |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?id=pC_XoZsvBuIC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=samyak+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2uj7UeXdOs2krQfIrIHgCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=samyak%20nepal&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2000 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day One==

On the first day, large images of Dipankar Buddha are brought out of sacred courtyards and private homes and displayed at Durbar Square in a row to receive offerings from devotees. 

==Day Two==

On the second day, the statues are carried in procession to [[Bhuikhel]] and assembled on the field. Priests receive alms consisting of different kinds of sacred foods in a ceremony held in the presence of the king.

The offerings are made by members of the [[Uray (caste group)|Uray]] caste group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= van den Hoek |first= Bert |title= Gender and Caste in the Perfect Buddhist Gift the Samyak Mahadana in Kathmandu, Nepal |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:CpCdBJpQoo4J:www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_12.pdf+samyak+hoek&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=np&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgtPkaxuQpgv6rH251CXWy3q9BDSzdSDLz5XnmIlw5GYwI6s_se5u-e_ffqh4EU2fFWj0dwdhU14K3t6JhoihZQBE139PkyrK21rWPRE5q6fm30FLb2uIEsv77dBd83eUMUJRRc&amp;sig=AHIEtbTNtnbSPRoL7hSTpz9q3pNRE0qHhQ |accessdate=8 February 2013 |newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies |date=January 1996}} Page 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Each subgroup performs a task that has been assigned by tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Lewis| first =Todd T.| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://college.holycross.edu/faculty/tlewis/PDFs/Buddhist_Merchants_in_Kathmandu.pdf| title =Buddhist Merchants in Kathmandu: The Asan Twah Market and Uray Social Organization | work = Contested Hierarchies | publisher = Oxford: Clarendon Press | date=1995 | accessdate = 8 February 2013}} Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular Samyak ceremony is held at intervals of 12 years. However, a special one can be called between the scheduled occurrences by a sponsor. The most recent one took place in 2005. 

In Lalitpur, the Samyak festival is held at [[Nagbahal]]. The latest one occurred in 2012.

In Bhaktapur, Samyak is celebrated annually on the feast day of Ghyah Chāku Sanlhu ([[Maghe Sankranti]]) which usually falls on January 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 January 2014|title=Kanhay Khwopay Samyak |trans-title=Samyak in Bhaktapur tomorrow |language=Newari|newspaper=Sandhya Times |location=Kathmandu |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">'''Skimming''' refers to the illegal transfer of funds from casinos to outside personnel without official documentation. Skimmed money is usually transferred in cash to [[tax evasion|evade taxes]] and to fund [[organized crime]] anonymously. The quantities of money skimmed are usually small portions of the casino's total profit so as not to arouse suspicion from regulators or law enforcement.

"In May of 1963...the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] turned over to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] a two-volume document called "The Skimming Report," which detailed the illegal siphoning off of [[gambling]] profits by [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s to avoid [[taxes]]."&lt;ref name="Navasky"&gt;Victor Navasky, ''Kennedy Justice'', (Lincoln: iUniverse.com, Inc., 2000), p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The report documented how pre-tax profits from casinos were being routed to various organized crime syndicates across the nation. No one could be prosecuted as the FBI obtained its information by illegally [[wiretap|bugging]] casino money rooms. The money rooms are where the cash from the betting floor is counted and recorded on the casino's books.

Skimming by diverting pre-tax profits is just one of many possible methods.  In casinos the patron is betting against the house, so the house has an incentive to fix the games (cards, roulette, slots, etc.). In pari-mutuels (horse and dog track, [[jai alai]]) the house instead gets a fixed percentage of the total amount bet, so is theoretically less likely to fix the games. However, pari-mutuels use sophisticated computer systems to handle customer bets and a major scandal involving [[Autotote]], a major supplier of these systems, has been exposed.&lt;ref name="Autotote"&gt;[[2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal]], 2002 Breeders' Cup betting scandal&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of skimming, such as arranging for particular employees of organized crime to be allowed to win in rigged games, were sometimes used.

'''''Sons of Liberty''''' is an American television [[miniseries]] dramatizing the early [[American Revolution]] events in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the start of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and the negotiations of the [[Second Continental Congress]] which resulted in the drafting and signing of the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Directed by [[Kari Skogland]], the three-part miniseries premiered on [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]] on January 25, 2015. The series' theme music was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]].&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |date=November 4, 2014 |title=History Sets Date for ''Sons of Liberty'' Miniseries — Watch the First Teaser |url=http://tvline.com/2014/11/04/history-sons-of-liberty-miniseries-premiere-date-promo/ |publisher=[[TVLine]] |access-date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The miniseries centers primarily on the years (1765-1776) prior to start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and focuses on historical figures and pivotal events between the (then) [[Thirteen Colonies|British Colonies]] and the mother country of [[Great Britain]] to whom then [[British America]] owed its allegiance, particularly the events that led to resistance to the crown and creation of the [[Sons of Liberty]], a group that coalesced to resist &amp; disrupt  attempts by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] and crown to tax and govern the colonies.

The actions of the Sons of Liberty were the first beginnings of what would eventually become the American or [[Continental Army]]. These take place mostly in and around [[Boston]] &amp; the then [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colony of Massachusetts]].

Various American Revolutionary figures such as [[Samuel Adams]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Hancock]], [[Paul Revere]], [[George Washington]] and British General [[Thomas Gage]] are central characters in various episodes.

Additionally, creation of the [[Continental Congress|Colonial Congress]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the eventual outbreak of the Revolutionary War are depicted.

 |ShortSummary =Still a group of colonies living under British oppression in 1765, local gangs fight each other over turf in the streets of Boston, much less thinking of starting a revolution. When tax collector and pub owner Sam Adams doesn't pay his own taxes, the Crown puts out a warrant for his arrest, leading to the destruction of Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson's mansion. Wealthy businessman, John Hancock, and Adams, establish a black-market smuggling operation and boycott all goods from [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] shops, identifying them with a "T" painted on their storefronts. But an altercation between a loyalist and a Colonist mob lead to a young boy's murder. Then, in 1770, after a conflict escalates with the Redcoats turn into a [[Boston Massacre|massacre]], the wheels are put in motion to start a resistance against British tyranny.

By 2011, there was speculation that after his NASCAR career was over, Robby Gordon would bring back the concept of stadium off-road racing that [[Mickey Thompson]] had invented.&lt;ref name="Mickey Thompson Fast Life"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arneson|first=Erik|title=Mickey Thompson: The Fast Life and Tragic Death of a Racing Legend|year=2001|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=1616730129|page=274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPl4smar1HAC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=%22robby+gordon%22+1989+Mteg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rJxIu1a04d&amp;sig=yIgGAmI9875YbJuWHOf2cO-bmmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xZrUbKlLIfVyAGo7oCIAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22robby%20gordon%22%201989%20Mteg&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon announced the formation of the Stadium Super Trucks (SST) in 2012, modeling the series after Thompson's [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group|MTEG]] stadium series;&lt;ref name="About SST"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SST|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/about/|publisher=Stadium Super Trucks|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; early in his career, Gordon had won the 1989 MTEG championship as a 20-year-old.&lt;ref name="Mickey Thompson Fast Life" /&gt; The Stadium Super Trucks held an exhibition race at [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] after the conclusion of the World Championship races on September 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Jon|url=http://sxsnews.com/index.php/2012/08/stadium-super-trucks-debut-this-weekend-in-crandon/|title=Stadium SUPER Trucks Debut this Weekend in Crandon|publisher=Side x Side Industry News|date=August 31, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stadium Super Trucks began with a twelve-race season in [[2013 Stadium Super Trucks season|2013]].&lt;ref name="Race Dezert ARCA" /&gt; The series held their first official race at the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] on April 6, 2013.&lt;ref name="First Race"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Stadium Super Trucks |url= |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |series=Stadium Super Trucks |credits= |network=NBC |station=[[WGBA]] |location=[[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] |date=April 14, 2013 |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2013 Official Schedule"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Official Schedule|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/tour/|publisher=Stadium Super Trucks|accessdate=April 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124159/http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/tour/|archivedate=October 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race was won by [[Rob MacCachren]],&lt;ref name="First Race" /&gt; [[Justin Matney]] finished second, and Gordon passed the flipped-over truck of [[P.

On December 11, 2013, Gordon announced that the series will be among the events held at the [[X Games Austin 2014|X Games Austin]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/rally-moto-x/article/10121804/robby-gordon-stadium-super-trucks-series-added-x-games-austin|title=Super Trucks event added to X Games Austin|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2014, the series was rebranded as the "Speed Energy Formula Off-Road Presented By Traxxas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/rebranded/|title=SST Trucks To Race In Rebranded SPEED Energy Formula Off-Road Presented By Traxxas|work=Stadium Super Trucks|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' X Games final was held at [[Circuit of the Americas]] on June 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/sst-to-join-x-games-austin-in-2014/|title=SST TO JOIN X GAMES AUSTIN IN 2014|work=Stadium Super Trucks|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apdaly Lopez]] won the gold medal; [[Sheldon Creed]] and Gordon earned silver and bronze, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/events/2014/austin/results/400549635/stadium-super-trucks|title=STADIUM SUPER TRUCKS - FINAL|work=[[X Games]]|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, sponsorship marketing company [[Elevation Group]] purchased a 40 percent stake in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Nate|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/motorsports/2014/09/23/robby-gordon-stadium-super-truck-series-elevation-group-nascar-indycar/16096297/|title=Robby Gordon's stadium truck series adds owners|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=September 23, 2014|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the series entered a partnership with [[all-terrain vehicle]] manufacturer [[Arctic Cat]], which led to the creation of the Arctic Cat Stadium Side-by-Side (SXS) Racing Series as a support series to the SST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150825005535/en/Arctic-Cat-Partners-Robby-Gordon%E2%80%99s-SST-Series|title=Arctic Cat Partners with Robby Gordon’s SST Series|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014 and into 2015, the series expanded outside the United States and Canada, starting with the [[2014 Race of Champions]] in [[Barbados]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiZinno|first=Tony|url=http://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2014/12/04/robby-gordons-stadium-super-trucks-come-to-roc/|title=Robby Gordon’s Stadium SUPER TRUCKS come to RoC|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of driver [[Craig Dontas]] and former [[Adelaide 500]] general manager Nathan Cayzer, Formula Off-Road expanded into Australia for the 2015 season.&lt;ref name="Rights deal signed for Super Trucks in Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/05/06/rights-deal-signed-super-trucks-australia/|title=Rights deal signed for Super Trucks in Australia|work=[[Speedcafe]]|date=May 6, 2018|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the trucks were invited to the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/stadium-super-trucks-reach-another-milestone-with-a-prestigious-invitation-to-englands-goodwood-festival-of-speed-june-25-28/|title=Stadium Super Trucks Reach Another Milestone With A Prestigious Invitation to England’s Goodwood Festival of Speed June 25–28|work=Speed Energy Formula Off-Road|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=May 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527210217/http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/ssts/stadium-super-trucks-reach-another-milestone-with-a-prestigious-invitation-to-englands-goodwood-festival-of-speed-june-25-28/|archivedate=May 27, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formula Off-Road returned to stadiums in December 2017 with the inaugural Stadium Super Trucks World Championship Finals in California's [[Lake Elsinore Diamond]] baseball park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/stadium-super-trucks-world-championship-finals-set-for-december-15-16-at-lake-elsinore-diamond-stadium/|title=Stadium SUPER Trucks World Championship Finals Set For December 15 &amp; 16 At Lake Elsinore Diamond Stadium|work=Speed Energy Formula Off-Road|date=October 6, 2017|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not compete for the weekend, [[Paul Morris (racing driver)|Paul Morris]] clinched the 2017 championship with [[Jerret Brooks]] driving his No. 67 truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nguyen|first=Justin|url=http://overtakemotorsport.com/2017/12/17/sst-race-rock-world-championship-recap/|title=SST: Race &amp; Rock World Championship Recap|publisher=Overtake Motorsport|date=December 17, 2017|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Gordon formed a three-year partnership with [[Boost Mobile]] to keep the series in Australia beyond the 2019. As part of the agreement, the series' Australian operations were handled by Cayzer and Morris' [[Paul Morris Motorsport]].&lt;ref name="Rights deal signed for Super Trucks in Australia" /&gt; However, in September, the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] (CAMS) revoked their licence over safety concerns, a decision particularly spurned by an incident in the May race at [[Barbagallo Raceway]] in which [[Matt Nolan (racing driver)|Matt Nolan]]'s truck's wheel came off during a wreck and hit a spectator bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Tom|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/09/20/cams-suspends-super-trucks-on-safety-grounds/|title=CAMS suspends Super Trucks on safety grounds|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=September 20, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, CAMS slug it out in court" /&gt;

A court hearing overseen by the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] took place a month later. The series' defense, led by [[Queen's Counsel]] [[barrister]] Stewart Anderson, said new wheels would be built with forged [[billet aluminium]] that makes them heavier and less likely to detach than the current cast alloy. Retired Supercar driver [[Larry Perkins]] also gave his support after inspecting them earlier in the year, comparing the trucks' safety to the Supercars. Anderson further stated CAMS and SST had formed an agreement in February in which the former expressed satisfaction at the series, yet CAMS made the decision to suspend the series in May and did not inform SST officials until July, which Gordon stated was a breach of contract.&lt;ref name="Gordon, CAMS slug it out in court"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Geoffrey|url=https://www.motoring.com.au/motorsport-robby-gordon-cams-slug-it-out-in-court-115026/|title=MOTORSPORT: Robby Gordon, CAMS slug it out in court|publisher=Motoring.com.au|date=October 5, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, judge [[John Digby (judge)|John Digby]] ruled in favor of CAMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Tom|last2=Herrero|first2=Dan|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/10/11/court-upholds-super-trucks-suspension/|title=Court upholds Super Trucks suspension|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=October 11, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the ruling, the series aligned with the [[Australian Auto Sport Alliance]]'s [[Australian Motor Racing Series]] (AMRS) to remain in the country. The AASA, which is not affiliated with CAMS, and the [[NSW Sport and Recreation]] approved Formula Off-Road for competition in AMRS events following a risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coch|first=Matt|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/10/23/sydney-motorsport-park-confident-of-sst-safety2/|title=Sydney Motorsport Park confident of SST safety|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=October 22, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trucks' first race weekend under the AMRS banner took place nine days later at the [[Sydney Motorsport Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coch|first1=Matt|last2=Herrero|first2=Dan|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/10/17/stadium-super-trucks-to-race-in-sydney-next-week/|title=Stadium Super Trucks to race in Sydney next week|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=October 17, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To close out the 2018 season, the series organized the Robby Gordon Off-Road World Championships at [[Glen Helen Regional Park|Glen Helen Raceway]] from November 30 to December 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ochsner|first=Shaun|url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/news/1809-massive-payout-for-inaugural-robby-gordon-off-road-championships-at-glen-helen/|title=Massive Payout for Inaugural Robby Gordon Off-Road Championships at Glen Helen|publisher=''[[Four Wheeler]]''|date=September 4, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series typically featured racers who have competed in off-road events; in the inaugural race, off-road racers included Robby Gordon, [[Championship Off-Road Racing]] driver [[Rob MacCachren]], [[TORC: The Off Road Championship|TORC]] driver [[Sheldon Creed]] and motocross rider [[Jeff Ward (motorsports)|Jeff Ward]]. The 2013 season also featured drivers from other disciplines, like [[Arie Luyendyk Jr.]] and [[Paul Tracy]] (IndyCar), [[Nick Baumgartner]] (Olympic [[Snowboard cross|snowboarding]]) and [[Traxxas]] owner [[Mike Jenkins (racing driver)|Mike Jenkins]].&lt;ref name="First Race" /&gt; Other drivers who have competed in the series include Moto X biker [[Jeremy Stenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/video/12969533/x-games-austin-preview-jeremy-stenberg|title=X Games Austin preview -- Jeremy Stenberg|work=[[X Games]]|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four-time [[AMA Supercross Championship]] winner [[Ryan Villopoto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actionsportsconnection.com/4x-supercross-champion-ryan-villopoto-make-stadium-super-trucks-debut-sst-race-rock-world-championship/|title=4x SuperCross Champion Ryan Villopoto to make Stadium SUPER Trucks Debut at SST Race &amp; Rock World Championship|work=Action Sports Connection|date=December 13, 2017|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its inaugural season, the series raced predominantly in stadiums filled with dirt like the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], while also running on [[street circuit]]s as a supporting event for the IndyCar Series. Eventually, the series focused almost exclusively on street courses. "Before you know it, we're doing 10 street races instead of stadiums and dirt races, which brings it to a completely different fan audience," Gordon stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Matt|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/autoracing/grand-prix-of-st-petersburg-life-after-nascar-leads-robby-gordon-to/2316279|title=Grand Prix of St. Petersburg: Life after NASCAR leads Robby Gordon to Stadium Super Trucks series|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the street courses, aluminum ramps are placed on the track;&lt;ref name="Traxxas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://traxxas.com/racing/news/Stadium-Super-Trucks-are-coming-city-near-YOU|title=Stadium Super Trucks are coming to a city near YOU!|work=[[Traxxas]]|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ramps are 17 feet, 6 inches long and 2'8" high, and trucks enter them at speeds of {{convert|70|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="ATX Marks the Spot"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.statesman.com/xgames/xgames-supertruck.php|title=ATX Marks the Spot: X Games Stadium Super Trucks|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Gordon ended his NASCAR career, believing the top teams had a large advantage over the smaller teams due to the amount of money spent.

Over the following months, all scientists who tried to duplicate her results failed, and suspicion arose that Obokata's results were due to error or [[Scientific misconduct|fraud]].  An investigation by her employer, [[RIKEN]], was launched.  On 1 April 2014, RIKEN concluded that Obokata had falsified data to obtain her results.&lt;ref name=falsified&gt;{{cite news|title=Obokata falsified data in STAP papers: probe|date=1 April 2014|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/01/national/obokata-falsified-data-in-stap-papers-probe/|work=The Japan Times|first=Masaaki|last=Kameda|first2=Tomoko|last2=Otake|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2014, Obokata agreed to retract the papers.&lt;ref name=retract&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan researcher agrees to withdraw disputed stem cell paper|author=Elaine Lies|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/04/us-japan-stemcells-researcher-idUSKBN0EF0SO20140604|newspaper=Reuters|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2014, [[Yoshiki Sasai]]—Obokata's supervisor at RIKEN and one of the coauthors on the STAP cell papers—was found dead at a RIKEN facility after an apparent suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name=Suicide&gt;{{cite news|title=STAP paper co-author Sasai commits suicide|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/05/national/embattled-stap-study-co-author-dies-after-apparent-suicide-bid/|accessdate=5 August 2014|work=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STAP would have been a radically simpler method of stem cell generation than previously researched methods as it requires neither [[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer|nuclear transfer]] nor the introduction of [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|transcription factors]].&lt;ref name="STAP Nature Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obokata|first=Haruko|title=Stimulus-triggered fate conversion of somatic cells into pluripotency|journal=Nature|date=2014-01-30|volume=505|issue=7485|pages=641–647|doi=10.1038/nature12968|pmid=24476887|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7485/abs/nature12968.html|accessdate=7 March 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Haruko Obokata]] claimed that STAP cells were produced by exposing [[PTPRC|CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Murinae|murine]] spleen cells to certain stresses including an acidic medium with a [[pH]] of 5.7 for half an hour.&lt;ref name="STAP Nature Paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aaacccid2014&gt;{{cite web | last = NHS Choices| authorlink = National Health Service (England) | title = Breakthrough in stem cell creation using acid bath - What did the research involve?| quote = They put them in a weak acid solution (pH 5.7) for 30 minutes at 37°C, and then put them into petri dishes and grew them at normal pH.| publisher = nhs.co.uk | date = 2014-01-30 | url = http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/01January/Pages/Breakthrough-in-stem-cell-creation-using-acid-bath.aspx| accessdate = 2014-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this treatment, the cells were verified to be pluripotent by observing increasing levels of [[Oct-4]] (a [[transcription factor]] expressed in embryonic stem cells) over the following week using an Oct4-[[green fluorescent protein|GFP]] [[transgene]].&lt;ref name="STAP Nature Paper" /&gt;&lt;ref name='newsci'&gt;{{cite news | first = Helen | last = Thomson | title = Stem cell power unleashed after 30 minute dip in acid | date = 2014-01-29 | url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129542.500-stem-cell-power-unleashed-after-30-minute-dip-in-acid.html | work = New Scientist | accessdate = 2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average only 25% of cells survived the acid treatment, but over 50% of those that survived converted to Oct4-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; pluripotent cells.&lt;ref name='STAP Nature Paper' /&gt; The researchers also claimed that treatment with bacterial toxins or physical stress were conducive to the acquisition of pluripotent markers.&lt;ref name=natnews /&gt; STAP cells injected into mouse embryos grew into a variety of tissues and organs found throughout the body. According to the researchers, the [[Chimera (genetics)|chimaeric]] mice "[appeared] to be healthy, fertile, and normal" after one-to-two years of observation.&lt;ref name='guard' /&gt; Additionally, these mice produced healthy offspring, thereby demonstrating germline transmission which is "a strict criterion for pluripotency as well as genetic and epigenetic normality."&lt;ref name="STAP Nature Paper" /&gt;

STAP cells were supposedly able to differentiate into [[placenta]]l cells, meaning they would be [[totipotency|more potent]] than [[embryonic stem cell]]s or [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPS).&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt; It was not clear why ordinary cells do not convert into stem cells when subjected to similar stimuli under ordinary conditions, such as acidity in the body; Obokata et al. suggested that ''[[in vivo]]'' inhibitory mechanisms may block conversion to pluripotency.&lt;ref name="STAP Nature Paper" /&gt;  Research is underway to generate stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cells using human tissue: in February 2014, Charles Vacanti and Koji Kojima ([[Harvard University|Harvard]] researchers originally involved in the discovery and publication of STAP) claimed to have preliminary results of STAP cells generated from human [[fibroblast]]s, but concomitantly cautioned that these preliminary results require further analysis and validation.&lt;ref name="STAP Human Tissue NS Article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Helen|title=Extraordinary stem cell method tested in human tissue|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25004-extraordinary-stem-cell-method-tested-in-human-tissue.html#.UxnFXvmwLMp|work=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 2000s, [[Charles Vacanti]] and Martin Vacanti conducted studies that led them to the idea that stem cells - [[spore-like cells]] - could be spontaneously recovered from ordinary tissues that are stressed via mechanical injury or increased acidity.&lt;ref name=Vacanti20140209&gt;{{cite web | last = Connor | first = Steve | title = Exclusive: The miracle cure - scientists turn human skin into stem cells | quote = | publisher = independent.co.uk | date = 2014-02-09 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/exclusive-the-miracle-cure--scientists-turn-human-skin-into-stem-cells-9117102.html| accessdate = 2014-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique for producing STAP cells was subsequently studied by Obokata at the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] (BWH), while she was studying as a post doc under Charles Vacanti, and then at the [[RIKEN]] Center for Developmental Biology in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Kerry | last = Grens |title=New Method for Reprogramming Cells |date=29 January 2014 |publisher=The Scientist |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/39025/title/New-Method-for-Reprogramming-Cells/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=STAP cell pioneer nearly gave up on her research |date=30 January 2014 |publisher=The Asahi Shimbun |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201401300073 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140130205546/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/AJ201401300073 |archivedate=30 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, while working at [[Harvard Medical School]], she verified at the request of Charles Vacanti that some of the cultured cells she was working with shrank to the size of stem cells after being mechanically injured in a [[capillary tube]].&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt;&lt;ref name='guard' /&gt; She went on as directed, to test the effects of various stimuli on cells. After modifying the technique, Obokata was able to show that [[white blood cells]] from newborn mice could be transformed into cells that behaved much like stem cells. She repeated the experiment with other cell types including brain, skin, and muscle cells with the same result.&lt;ref name='guard' /&gt;

Initially Obokata's findings were met with skepticism, even among her coworkers. "Everyone said it was an artefact&amp;nbsp;– there were some really hard days", she recalled.&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt; The manuscript describing the work was rejected multiple times before its eventual publication as an article (together  with a shorter jointly-written "letter") within the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name='guard'&gt;{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | title = Simple way to make stem cells in half an hour hailed as major discovery | date = 2014-01-29 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/29/make-stem-cells-major-discovery-acid-technique | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experiments, first turning a mouse embryo green by fluorescently tagging STAP cells, then videotaping the transformation of T-cells into pluripotent cells, finally convinced skeptics that the results were real.&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt;

===Investigation into disputed claims===
In the months after the two ''Nature'' papers &lt;ref name='guard'/&gt; were released, all scientists who tried to duplicate Obokata's results failed and suspicion arose that her results were due to error or fraud.  An investigation into alleged irregularities was launched by RIKEN on 15 February 2014.  The allegations questioned the use of seemingly duplicated images in the papers, and reported failure to reproduce her results in other prominent stem-cell laboratories.  ''Nature'' also announced that they were investigating. Several stem-cell scientists defended Obokata or reserved their opinion while the investigation was ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cyranoski | first1 = David | title = Acid-bath stem-cell study under investigation | date = 17 February 2014 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2014.14738 | url = http://www.nature.com/news/acid-bath-stem-cell-study-under-investigation-1.14738 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | accessdate = 20 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To address the problem of reproducibility in other laboratories, Obokata published some technical 'tips' on the protocols on 5 March while promising that the detailed procedure would be published in due course.&lt;ref&gt;Haruko Obokata, Yoshiki Sasai and Hitoshi Niwa (March 2014). [http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/3013 Essential technical tips for STAP cell conversion culture from somatic cells]. Nature Protocols Discussion Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March, Teruhiko Wakayama, one of Obokata's coauthors, urged all the researchers involved to withdraw the articles, citing many "questionable points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prof. wants STAP findings withdrawn|url=http://www.the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001109178|newspaper=The Yomiuri Shimbun|date=11 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317012922/http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001109178|archivedate=17 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles Vacanti said he opposed their retraction and posted a "revised protocol" for creating STAP cells on his own website, which was taken down after he resigned his BWH post.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A Vacanti (2014)[https://web.archive.org/web/20151009073931/https://research.bwhanesthesia.org/research-groups/cterm/stap-cell-protocol PROTOCOL FOR GENERATING STAP CELLS FROM MATURE SOMATIC CELLS]. Center for Tissue Engineering &amp; Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March, RIKEN released an interim report of the investigation. Out of the six items being investigated, the committee concluded that there was inappropriate handling of data on two items, but did not judge the mishandling as research misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/press/2014/20140314_1/|title=Interim report on the investigation of the Obokata et al. articles|author=Press Release|publisher=RIKEN|date=14 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 April, RIKEN concluded that Obokata had engaged in "research misconduct", falsifying data on two occasions.  The co-authors were cleared of misconduct, but bore "grave responsibility" for not verifying the data themselves.  RIKEN also announced that an internal group had been established to verify whether the ‘stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency’ is reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/press/2014/20140401_2/|title=Report on STAP Cell Research Paper Investigation|author=Press Release|publisher=RIKEN|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Obokata maintained her innocence and said she would appeal the decision.&lt;ref name="falsified" /&gt;  On 4 June 2014, Obokata agreed to retract both the article and the "letter".&lt;ref name="retract"/&gt; The article was officially retracted on 2 July 2014. An article analyzing the controversy concluded that while issues of image manipulation, duplication and plagiarism were potentially detectable, the reviewers could not have concluded that the article was the product of academic misconduct prior to acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cyranoski|first1=David|title=Research integrity: Cell-induced stress|url=http://www.nature.com/news/research-integrity-cell-induced-stress-1.15507|website=Nature|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the controversy, observers, journalists, and former members of RIKEN have stated that the organization is riddled with unprofessional and inadequate scientific rigor and consistency, and that this is reflective of serious issues with scientific research in Japan in general.&lt;ref&gt;Otake, Tomoko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/20/national/stapgate-shows-japan-must-get-back-to-basics-in-science/#.U1WkzMKRVZI ‘STAPgate’ shows Japan must get back to basics in science]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/05/national/media-national/ongoing-obokata-story-seeks-scandal/#.U7qcsY2KB9A Ongoing Obokata story seeks out scandal]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 July 2014, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

RIKEN commissioned a team of scientists to attempt to verify Obokata's original results and asked Obokata to participate in the effort.  On 5 August 2014, Obokata's supervisor and co-author of the original paper, [[Yoshiki Sasai]], was discovered dead by apparent suicide by hanging in a building at the RIKEN facility in Kobe, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/05/national/embattled-stap-study-co-author-dies-after-apparent-suicide-bid/#.U-IWe40cR9A STAP paper co-author Sasai commits suicide]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 6 August 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2015, the RIKEN scientists reported that Obokata's STAP cells came from embryonic stem cell contamination,&lt;ref name="KonnoKasukawa2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konno|first1=Daijiro|last2=Kasukawa|first2=Takeya|last3=Hashimoto|first3=Kosuke|last4=Itoh|first4=Takehiko|last5=Suetsugu|first5=Taeko|last6=Miura|first6=Ikuo|last7=Wakana|first7=Shigeharu|last8=Carninci|first8=Piero|last9=Matsuzaki|first9=Fumio|title=STAP cells are derived from ES cells|journal=Nature|volume=525|issue=7570|year=2015|pages=E4–E5|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature15366|pmid=26399834}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on the same day, research groups who had attempted to reproduce the STAP protocol jointly reported that they had found it irreproducible.&lt;ref name="De Los AngelesFerrari2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Los Angeles|first1=Alejandro|last2=Ferrari|first2=Francesco|last3=Fujiwara|first3=Yuko|last4=Mathieu|first4=Ronald|last5=Lee|first5=Soohyun|last6=Lee|first6=Semin|last7=Tu|first7=Ho-Chou|last8=Ross|first8=Samantha|last9=Chou|first9=Stephanie|last10=Nguyen|first10=Minh|last11=Wu|first11=Zhaoting|last12=Theunissen|first12=Thorold W.|last13=Powell|first13=Benjamin E.|last14=Imsoonthornruksa|first14=Sumeth|last15=Chen|first15=Jiekai|last16=Borkent|first16=Marti|last17=Krupalnik|first17=Vladislav|last18=Lujan|first18=Ernesto|last19=Wernig|first19=Marius|last20=Hanna|first20=Jacob H.|last21=Hochedlinger|first21=Konrad|last22=Pei|first22=Duanqing|last23=Jaenisch|first23=Rudolf|last24=Deng|first24=Hongkui|last25=Orkin|first25=Stuart H.|last26=Park|first26=Peter J.|last27=Daley|first27=George Q.|title=Failure to replicate the STAP cell phenomenon|journal=Nature|volume=525|issue=7570|year=2015|pages=E6–E9|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature15513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=STAP revisited|journal=Nature|volume=525|issue=7570|year=2015|pages=426–426|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/525426a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
If the findings had proven to be valid, stimulus-triggered pluripotency cells could have been generated more easily and efficiently than by existing iPS techniques.&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt; And adapted to human tissue, the technique could have led to cheap and simple procedures to create patient-specific stem cells. Stem-cell researcher Dusko Ilic of [[King's College London]] called STAP cells "a major scientific discovery that will be opening a new era in stem-cell biology".&lt;ref name='guard' /&gt; [[Shinya Yamanaka]], a pioneer of iPS research, called the findings "important to understand nuclear reprogramming&amp;nbsp;... [and] a new approach to generate iPS-like cells".&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt;  The idea that STAP cells can form placental tissue meant they could have made cloning considerably easier by bypassing the need for a donor egg and ''in vitro'' cultivation.&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt;

One previous way of creating stem cells has been via genetic manipulation of adult cells into iPS cells. Progress on iPS-based therapies has been slow due to regulatory hurdles surrounding genetic manipulation.&lt;ref name='guard' /&gt; Additionally, iPS techniques have an observed efficiency of around 1%, significantly lower than the claimed efficiency of STAP.&lt;ref name='natnews' /&gt;

A '''tea dance''', also called a '''''thé dansant''''' (French for "dancing tea"), was historically a [[dance (event)|dance]] held on a summer or autumn afternoon or early evening, from 4 to 7 p.m. In the English countryside, a [[garden party]] sometimes preceded the dance.&lt;ref name="Partygiving"&gt;''Party-giving on Every Scale'', London, n.d. (1880) "Afternoon Dances".&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26f}} The function evolved from the concept of the [[afternoon tea]], and J. Pettigrew traces its origin to the [[French colonial empires|French colonization]] of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Pettigrew"&gt;[http://www.teamuse.com/article_010702.html Pettigrew, J., 2001. "Waltz Around a Tea Table," ''TeaMuse''], [online]. July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books on [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] etiquette, such as ''Party-giving on Every Scale'' (London, n.d. [1880]), included detailed instructions for hosting such gatherings. By 1880, it was noted that "[a]fternoon dances are seldom given in London, but are a popular form of entertainment in the suburbs, in garrison-towns, watering-places, etc."&lt;ref name="Partygiving"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Tea dances were given by [[Royal Navy]] officers aboard ships at various naval stations, the expenses shared by the captain and officers, as they were shared by colonels and officers at barrack dances in [[Officers' mess|mess room]]s ashore.&lt;ref name="Partygiving"/&gt;{{rp|27–28}}

The usual refreshments in 1880 were [[tea]] and [[coffee]], ices, [[champagne]]-cup and [[claret]]-cup, fruit, sandwiches, cake and [[cookie|biscuits]].&lt;ref name="Partygiving"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Even after the introduction of the [[phonograph]], the expected feature was a live [[orchestra]] – often referred to as a [[palm court]] orchestra – or a small band playing light classical music. The types of dances performed during tea dances included [[waltzes]], [[tango (dance)|tango]]s and, by the late 1920s, the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].&lt;ref name="Pettigrew"/&gt;

The expenses of a seated supper, wine, and candles associated with a [[ball (dance)|ball]] were obviated by the tea dance. A stiff waxed canvas dancing cloth strained over the drawing-room carpet was considered sufficient, rather than taking up the carpet and waxing the floor in preparation for dancing.&lt;ref name="Partygiving"/&gt;{{rp|26f, 29}} The dining room served as the tea-room, with the dining-tables arranged at one end as a [[buffet]]. For the older generation, a tea dance was a reception akin to an "at home". Floral decorations were modest.

==World records==
Four World Record Tea Dances have been held in the early 21st century.   In [[Glasgow]] in December 2008, some 408 dancers gained the record during the city's  Winterfest celebrations.  The programme of music for the event was provided by the Scottish swing dance band That Swing Sensation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingsensation.co.uk|title=Glasgow Wedding Swing Big Band - Live  Swing Dance Music around Scotland|work=swingsensation.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with dance hosts the Fly Right Dance Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyrightdanceco.com|title=Fly Right Dance Co, performing &amp; teaching vintage dance in Scotland|work=Fly Right Dance Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record was set in 2005 by a total of 195 couples, who danced in London's [[Trafalgar Square]].

Subsequently, the [[Royal Opera House]] in London held a World Record attempt on 8 July 2010 in Trafalgar Square, with the unofficial total being 507 dancers.

Hot on the heels of the London event, Glasgow's [[George Square]] was the venue for the current official record, set on 12 September 2010, with 4,000 dancers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/4000/largest-tea-dance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l5HlCa2Z-8|title=Guinness World Record Tea Dance Award for Glasgow|date=13 September 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Tea dances are a common cultural reference in early 20th-century British and American fiction as a staple of genteel society, where people normally attend these receptions while visiting resort towns, especially coastal ones such as [[Brighton]], [[the Hamptons]], [[Provincetown]], or [[Ogunquit]]. The 1925 hit [[Broadway musical]], ''[[No, No, Nanette]],'' features a tea dance as the occasion for the plot's climax: the main characters travel to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] (the same musical also features the famous song "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]," which is sung prior to this scene).

In the United States, since the late 20th century, the term has been broadened to refer to any casual afternoon dance event. During an afternoon dance in 1981, the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse|Hyatt Regency walkway]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 200.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">The '''Teatro delle Quattro Fontane''' ('''Theatre of the Four Fountains''') is an [[opera house]] in [[Rome]], Italy, designed (in part) by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and built in 1632 by the [[Barberini]] family.&lt;ref&gt;''Music and Spectacle in Baroque Rome: Barberini Patronage Under Urban VIII'' by Frederick Hammond&lt;/ref&gt;  It was located in ''Via delle Quattro Fontane'', near the [[Piazza Barberini]] and the [[Quattro Fontane]] or ''Four Fountains''.

==History==

The theatre opened in [[1632 in music|1632]] with the [[opera]], ''Sant' Alessio'' (''Saint Alexis''; first performed in 1631), composed by [[Stefano Landi]] to a [[libretto]] by [[Giulio Rospigliosi]], a protégé of the Barberini [[Pope Urban VIII]], later himself elected [[Pope Clement IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoasm.org/VIIF/VIIFBalletOpera.html HOASM: Opera and Ballet]&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre could seat 3000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.jrank.org/pages/4854/opera-houses.html Great Opera Houses, History of Opera, Architecture 91:, The Opera House, Theatre Crafts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre closed temporarily in 1642 at the height of the Barberini [[Wars of Castro]] with the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] [[Duke of Parma|Dukes of Parma]] which became incredibly expensive for the family and the [[Holy See]]. The theatre had not yet reopened before when its patrons, the three Barberini nephews of Pope Urban ([[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]], [[Antonio Barberini]] (Antonio the Younger), and [[Taddeo Barberini]]), were sent into exile by the newly elected [[Pope Innocent X]].

Finally in 1653, after more than 10 years with its doors closed, Taddeo's son [[Maffeo Barberini (1631-1685)|Maffeo Barberini]] returned to [[Rome]] and married [[Olimpia Giustiniani]]; finally reconciling the Barberini with the papacy. As the new [[Palestrina|Prince of Palestrina]] he reopened the theatre and recommenced performances.

In 1632, the theatre was rebuilt and was particularly active during the late 1940s, after [[World War II]].

The building was converted into a modern [[Movie theater|cinema]] in the 1960s and now houses the ''Multisala Barberini'' (''Multiplex Barberini'') which shows a full range of modern [[film]]s.

"'''The Puerto Rican Day'''" is the 176th episode of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]''. It aired on May 7, 1998, and was the 20th episode of the [[Seinfeld (season 9)|ninth and final season]]. It was the show's second-highest-rated episode of all time, with 38.8 million viewers, only behind the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]]. The episode aired one week before the [[The Clip Show|two-part clip show]] and the two-part series finale aired. Because of controversy surrounding a scene in which [[Cosmo Kramer]] accidentally burns and then stomps on the [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]], NBC was forced to apologize and had it banned from airing on the network again. Also, it was not initially part of the syndicated package. In the summer of 2002, the episode started to appear with the flag-burning sequence intact. 

This episode of ''Seinfeld'' has more writer credits (ten) than any other episode. As co-creator [[Larry David]] was returning to write the finale, this was the final episode for the active "after Larry David" writing staff and thus was a group effort.

"The Puerto Rican Day" was a rare late-series return to a "plot about nothing" style, filmed in [[Real time (media)|real-time]], more commonly seen in early seasons (such as "[[The Chinese Restaurant]]").

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=February 2017}}
The gang are heading back to [[Manhattan]] after leaving a [[New York Mets|Mets]] game early in order to beat the traffic, but run into trouble with a driver in a maroon [[Volkswagen Golf]]. In the car, [[George Costanza|George]] boasts about the clever comment ("That's gotta hurt!") he recently made during a pivotal moment in a new film about the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' [[Hindenburg disaster|disaster]] titled ''Blimp''.

As they approach [[Fifth Avenue]], traffic is blocked by the annual [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]]. They almost find a way out, headed the wrong way down a one-way side street, but are blocked by their nemesis in the maroon Golf, whose driver refuses to let them cross over.

[[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] gets out of the car, worried about not being able to arrive home for her Sunday night "weekend wind-down" routine, which includes watching ''[[60 Minutes]]''. She starts walking only to find the traffic move again. She gets into a taxi (where she is oddly irritated by the sight of a dog with its ear flipped inside out), only to find the traffic immediately stop. Then, she leaves the taxi, only to find the traffic immediately moving again. She jumps back into the taxi.

George also leaves the car when he sees that the film ''Blimp'' is playing in a nearby theater, and he wants to repeat his funny comment for a new audience. But his attempt to be funny is undermined by a man with a [[laser pointer]]. When George makes the comment, nobody laughs because they are instead laughing at the laser. George berates the man, who then promptly shines the laser upon him.

Jerry and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] are finally allowed to take their shortcut when Jerry is forced to make an apologetic wave to the maroon Golf driver. As they pass by the Golf, Jerry calls the driver a "jackass", only to find himself blocked by oncoming traffic, including the taxi Elaine is in. The maroon Golf driver laughs and won't let him back up again.

A frustrated George then returns to the car, only to find the red dot of the laser pointer appearing all over parts of his body. A panicked George can't see the man holding the laser and worries he will go blind if it touches his eye.

Seeking an alternative way home, Elaine tries to find a way out by walking underneath the viewing stands. In a send up of ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', Elaine becomes the leader of a group of similarly distressed people trying to find their way out. She ultimately, however, leads them to a dead end where they have to scream for help to the people above.

Kramer, meanwhile, becomes desperate for a restroom and spots an apartment for sale across the street. To gain access to its restroom, he poses as H.E. Pennypacker, a wealthy industrialist, philanthropist, and bicyclist interested in the property. While there he sees the Mets game (they had left early) on the apartment's television. He excitedly tells Jerry, who also leaves the car and enters the apartment to watch, posing under his alias Kel Varnsen.

George thinks he spots the laser guy and plans a sneak attack, grabbing and breaking what he thinks is the laser pointer only to discover it is a pen. Back outside, Kramer accidentally sets the Puerto Rican flag on fire with a sparkler ("Dios mio!") and a mob of people, led by [[Bob and Cedric]] (in their third and final appearance), attacks him. He runs back into the apartment.

George also enters the apartment, as Art Vandelay, to wash the ink from his hands. Jerry then realizes that all three of them are in the apartment and nobody is watching the car. They look out the window to find it getting attacked by the angry mob. George then tells Jerry that the Mets lost, with Jerry sarcastically quipping "I love a parade!"

Later that night, when the parade's finally over, Jerry, George and Kramer see the car having been, somehow, stuck into a stairwell. Elaine arrives, her clothes and hair filthy with food. Then the maroon Golf driver passes by and calls Jerry a "jackass". Defeated, the gang starts walking home and Jerry says "remember where we parked", making reference to the season three episode "[[The Parking Garage]]". While they're shown walking from behind, it is seen that George (unbeknownst to him) still has the laser dot on his lower backside.

"The Puerto Rican Day" was criticized not only for the flag-burning incident, but also for the negative portrayal of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]], such as the scene where an angry mob of parade-goers damages Jerry's car, and Kramer later utters, "It's like this every day in [[Puerto Rico]].

{{Nowrap|The '''Théâtre de la Ville'''}} (meaning the City Theatre) is one of the two [[theatre]]s built in the 19th century by [[Baron Haussmann]] at [[Place du Châtelet]], [[Paris]], the other being the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]]. It is located at 2, place du Châtelet in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]].

Included among its many previous names are '''Théâtre Lyrique''', '''Théâtre des Nations''', and '''Théâtre [[Sarah Bernhardt|Sarah-Bernhardt]]'''.

==Early history==
===Théâtre Lyrique===
The theatre, which until the fall of [[Napoleon III]] in 1870 was officially known as the Théâtre Lyrique Impérial, was designed by the [[architect]] [[Gabriel Davioud]] for [[Baron Haussmann]] between 1860 and 1862 for the opera company more commonly known simply as the [[Théâtre Lyrique]]. That company's earlier theatre, the [[Théâtre Historique]] on the [[Boulevard du Temple]], where it had performed since 1851, was slated for demolition as part of [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 1981, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; During the company's initial period on the Place du Châtelet, it was under the direction of [[Léon Carvalho]] and gave the premieres of Bizet's ''[[Les pêcheurs de perles]]'' (1863), Berlioz's ''[[Les Troyens à Carthage]]'' (1863), Gounod's ''[[Mireille (opera)|Mireille]]'' (1864), Bizet's ''[[La jolie fille de Perth]]'' (1867), and Gounod's ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' (1867). Carvalho also presented the first performance of Verdi's revised and expanded version of ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (in French) in 1865.&lt;ref name=WalshCarvalho&gt;Walsh 1981, pp. 149–239, 316–321.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Pasdeloup]] took over as director in 1868 and gave the first Paris performances of Wagner's ''[[Rienzi]]'' in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 1981, pp. 241–267, 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; The Théâtre Lyrique on the Place du Châtelet was nearly completely destroyed by fire on 21 May 1871 during the recapturing of Paris by the forces of the [[Adolphe Thiers]] at the end of [[Paris Commune]], and the Théâtre Lyrique opera company went bankrupt not long after.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 1981, pp. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Théâtre Historique and Théâtre des Nations===
The theatre was rebuilt in 1874 on the same plans and was at first called the Théâtre Lyrique-Dramatique,&lt;ref name=Almanach1874/&gt; but was soon renamed to Théâtre Historique, which it retained until 1879, when it became Théâtre des Nations.&lt;ref name=EarlyNames&gt;Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38 p. 38] (Théâtre Lyrique-Dramatique), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32] (Théâtre Historique), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43] (Théâtre des Nations).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FrWp&gt;Based on the corresponding article in the French [[:fr:Wikipédia|Wikipédia]] ([http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Théâtre_de_la_Ville&amp;oldid=79700031 version 12 juin 2012 à 11:13]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Maurel]] produced a season of Italian opera at the Théâtre des Nations in 1884. It included on 1 February 1884 the first Paris performance of Massenet's ''[[Hérodiade]]'', in the Italian version entitled ''Erodiade''. The cast included [[Devriès family#Fidès Devriès|Fidès Devriès]] as Salomé, Guglielmina Tremelli as Hérodiade, [[Jean de Reszke]] as Jean, Maurel as Hérode, [[Édouard de Reszke]] as Phanuel, and Giuseppe Villani as Vitellius. In the tenth and final performance of ''Erodiade'' on 13 March three De Reszkes could be heard, as [[Josephine de Reszke|Josephine]] sang Salomé.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine 1994, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opéra-Comique===
In 1887 the [[Opéra-Comique]] moved into the theatre after its previous home, the second Salle Favart, had been destroyed by fire. The name Théâtre Lyrique was restored, and the Opéra-Comique continued to perform in the theatre until 1898, when it returned to the newly built, third Salle Favart. During the company's sojourn on the Place du Châtelet, it presented several operas by Massenet, including the premieres of ''[[Esclarmonde]]'' (1889) and ''[[Sapho (Massenet)|Sapho]]'' (1897), as well as the first Paris performances of ''[[Werther]]'' (6 January 1893) and ''[[La Navarraise]]'' (3 October 1895).&lt;ref name=Simeone&gt;Simeone 2000, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wild &amp; Charlton 2003, pp. 97, 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==

=== Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt ===
[[File:Sarahbernhardt1.jpg|thumb|upright|Sarah Bernhardt as Hamlet (1899)]]

In 1899 the theatre was renamed Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt after the renowned actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]], who produced there from 1899 for nearly two decades. She opened with a revival of one of her great roles, Victorien Sardou's ''[[La Tosca]]''. Other productions included a revival of [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''La Samaritaine'' and the premiere of his ''L'Aiglon'' in which she played Napoleon's son (the [[Duke of Reichstadt]]). Another well known breeches part was the title role of [[Marcel Schwob]]'s adaptation of ''[[Hamlet]]''. After her death in 1923 the theatre continued under her son Maurice for several years. After his death in 1928 the theatre kept the name Sarah Bernhardt until the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation of France]] by the Germans in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; when the name was changed to Théâtre de la Cité because of Bernhardt's [[Jew]]ish ancestry.&lt;ref name=FrWp/&gt;

Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]] presented several premieres at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt, including Stravinsky's ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (12 June 1928) and the revised ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (21 May 1929; with choreography by [[Serge Lifar]]), and two ballets by [[Prokoviev]], ''Le pas d'acier'' (27 May 1927) and ''[[Le Fils prodigue]]'' (21 May 1929).&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Program of the Ballets Russes for 21 May 1929: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8415192g/f18.image.r=.langEN ''Renard''] and [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8415192g/f19.image.r=.langEN ''Le Fils prodigue''] at [[Gallica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Théâtre de la Ville===
The theatre first acquired the name Théâtre de la Ville in 1968.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; Since the late 1970s the institution, under the direction of [[Jean Mercure]] (1968–1985) then of [[Gérard Violette]] (1985–2008), has been internationally recognised for its [[contemporary dance]] productions and has showcased major choreographers such as [[Pina Bausch]], [[Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker]], [[Jan Fabre]], [[Sankai Juku]], [[Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui]], [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Carolyn Carlson (artist)|Carolyn Carlson]].

'''Vasanthotsavam''' is an annual Seva celebrated in [[Tirumala]] to celebrate the arrival of spring season. 

Vasantotsavam is the combination of 2 words - "Vasantha" (Spring season in Sanskrit) and "Utsavam" (festival in Sanskrit). The festival is celebrated on the three days of ''tryodasi'', ''chaturdasi'' and ''pournami'' in the month of [[Chaitra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_perdes.htm#vas|title=TTD Annual Sevas - Vasanthotsavam|publisher=TTD official website|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gregorian calendar]], the festival occurs between the end of March through mid-April.

==History &amp; start==
The start of the festival celebration in Tirumala is recorded during the period of Achyutaraya ([[Saka]] 1460). The festival was started with the fund of 3000 narpanam contributed by Periya Solai, the son of the [[accountant]] in the temple.&lt;ref name="TTD book"&gt;{{cite book|last=N|first=Ramesan|title=The Tirumala Temple|year=1981|publisher=[[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|TTD]]|location=[[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Function==

The festival starts with ''ankurarpanam'' (sowing the nine kind of seeds) ceremony conducted on the day of [[Uttarabhadra]] star in [[Hindu calendar]] month of [[phalguna]].&lt;ref name="TTD book"/&gt; One day before the start of the Vasanthotsavam festival, ''punya vachanam'' (purificatory rites), ''vaasthu santhi'' (worship of deity and lord of nature and their elements and natural forces as well as lord and deity of directions and environment) and ''samprokshanam'' rituals are performed by the temple priests(sacred consecration).&lt;ref name="Hindu2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/12/stories/2006041210620300.htm|title=Vasanthotsavam begins|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=2006-04-12|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to these rituals are not open to public.

''Abhishekam'' - specifically called ''Snapana Thirumanjanam'' (Holy bathing), is performed to the ''utsava murthy'' and his consorts on all the three days in the Vasanthotsavam hall outside the temple premises. On the third day, abhishekam is performed to the idols of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman along with Krishna and Rukmini.Procession of the consecrated idols are taken in a procession in the evening on all the three days. 

The Vasanthotsavam hall was demolished as part of the revamping of the temple surroundings in 2006 and since then the Vaibhavotsava Mandapam situated in front of the main temple is used for the festival.&lt;ref name="Hindu2006"/&gt;

==Pilgrim participation==
Vasonthotsavam is a ''arjitha seva'' - paid service where pilgrims pay to view the ceremony. Each ticket costs [[Indian rupee|Rs]] 300 ([[USD|$]]7) and allows 1 person. Apart from entry to the abhishekam hall, the ticket holder receives one [[silk]] ''angavastram'' for men, a blouse piece for the women, 2 [[dosas]], 1 [[vada (food)|vadas]] and temple ''annaprasadams'' (rice based blessed food).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_per.htm|title=Annual Sevas|publisher=Tirumala official website|accessdate=2008-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514214720/http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_per.htm|archive-date=2007-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Voice Piece for Soprano''''' is a 1961 vocal composition by the Japanese artist and musician [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The score for the piece consists of the word '[[Scream (sound)|scream]]' with three options for screaming given to the performer; to scream 'against the wind', 'against the wall' and 'against the sky'.&lt;ref name="Barrett2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=G Douglas Barrett|title=After Sound: Toward a Critical Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4HNDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|date=11 August 2016|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-5013-0809-3|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist G Douglas Barrett in his 2016 book ''After Sound: Toward a Critical Music'' described the repetition of the word 'against' in the score for ''Vocal Piece for Soprano'' as redoubling "the screams singularly confrontational, antagonistic, and contrarian quality".&lt;ref name="Barrett2016"/&gt;

==History==
The piece was part of Ono's 2015 retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Ono performed the piece herself several times during the duration of the exhibition, and visitors were encouraged via an "instruction piece" to scream into an amplified microphone. The sound of visitors screaming could be heard throughout the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the museum for he duration of the exhibition from July to November, with the screams being heard as high as the museum's fifth floor.&lt;ref name="VernallisHerzog2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol Vernallis|author2=Amy Herzog|author3=John Richardson|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sound and Image in Digital Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXQRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=August 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-025817-7|pages=159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Porter "Bill" Lawrence''' (January 13, 1930{{spaced ndash}}December 2, 2005), was a decorated [[United States Navy]] [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] and [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] who served as Superintendent of the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] from 1978 to 1981.

Lawrence was a noted pilot, the first Naval Aviator to fly twice the speed of sound in a naval aircraft, and one of the final candidates for the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] space program.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/04/AR2005120401221.html?nav=rss_nation/special |title=William P. Lawrence Dies; Navy Admiral |author=William Bernstein |date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]], Lawrence was shot down while on a combat mission and spent six years as a [[prisoner of war]], from 1967 to 1973. During this time, he became noted for his resistance to his captors.

==Early life and education==
Lawrence's parents and grandparents were from [[Tennessee]]. His father [[Fatty Lawrence|Robert Landy "Fatty" Lawrence]] (1903–1976) attended [[Vanderbilt University]], where he was a noted student-athlete who graduated in 1924. He was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and attended local schools. Lawrence distinguished himself as a student athlete at Nashville's West High School, and in 1947 turned down a scholarship for [[Yale University]] to attend the [[United States Naval Academy]].&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/13/local/me-lawrence13 |title=William Lawrence, 75; Held as POW for 6 Years During Vietnam War |author=Bradley Olson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naval career==
Lawrence stood out as a varsity athlete in three sports at the Naval Academy: football, basketball, and baseball.  During his time at the Academy, he held several high-ranking midshipman offices, including Commander of the Brigade of Midshipmen, President of the Class of 1951, while also graduating 8th academically out of a class of 725.  His other major accomplishments included helping to establish the honor concept governing midshipman's conduct.  He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1951. Ensign Lawrence continued on at the Naval Academy as Aide to the Commandant of Midshipmen until September 1951, when he reported to flight training.

Lawrence received his "[[Wings of Gold]]" as a Naval Aviator in 1952 and became a test pilot.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; After completing advanced flight training, All Weather Flight School, and Jet Training, then-Lieutenant Lawrence served as an [[F2H Banshee]] pilot with [[VF-193]] at [[NAS Moffett Field]] from March 1953 to October 1955. During this time, he deployed to Korea aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Oriskany|CVA-34}} from March to April 1953. He attended the [[U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]] at the [[Naval Air Test Center]], [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]], where he received the Outstanding Student Award with the Test Pilot School Class 16. When the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) established the manned spaceflight program, Lawrence became part of [[Project Mercury]] and made it to the final round of candidates. He was released from the program only because of a small heart murmur discovered during flight training.

In 1967, then-[[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Lawrence was serving as [[commanding officer]] of [[VFA-143|Fighter Squadron 143]] (VF-143), aboard the [[aircraft]] carrier {{USS|Constellation|CV-64}}.  On 28 June 1967, Lawrence and his [[radar intercept officer]], [[Lieutenant, junior grade]] James W. Bailey, were flying an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4B Phantom II]] aircraft, Bureau Number 152242, while leading an anti-aircraft suppression section during a raid northwest of [[Nam Dinh]], [[North Vietnam]].  Their aircraft was struck by an 85&amp;nbsp;mm round while rolling in on target.  Despite failing hydraulics, Lawrence and Bailey released their bombs, but part of the aircraft{{'}}s tail section separated while attempting to pull out of a dive.  Both officers were forced to eject, were captured, and were held as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at the [[Hỏa Lò Prison]] – which the prisoners nicknamed the "[[Hanoi]] [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton]]" – until 1973, during which time they suffered repeated torture and beatings.  Along with fellow prisoner, Naval Aviator and Commander (later [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]) [[James Stockdale]], Lawrence became noted for his resistance to his captors. Additionally, he memorized every POW by name and rank while in captivity. He developed a code by tapping on the prison walls to communicate with other prisoners. Bailey was released on 18 February 1973 and Lawrence on 4 March 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Air Losses, Chris Hobson, Midland Publishing, Hinckley, UK, c2001, p. 106, {{ISBN|1-85780-115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another fellow inmate was future presidential candidate and Senator [[John McCain]], who was also a Navy commander and Naval Aviator at the time. In Lawrence's obituary in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Senator McCain stated, "He's probably the greatest man I've ever known in my life," and that it was the former's "...constant, steadfast, inspirational, yet very rational leadership that guided many of us through some very difficult times."&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; He was among the 591 Americans released as part of "Operation Homecoming."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Lawrence tells of his POW's experience in Al Santoli's "Everything We Had".&lt;ref&gt;Al Santoli: Everything We Had (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

After promotion to rear admiral in July 1974, Lawrence served as Commander, Light Attack Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet at [[Naval Air Station Lemoore]], California. Subsequently, he served as the Director, Aviation Programs Division and Assistant Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air Warfare) in the Pentagon. He was promoted to vice admiral on August 1, 1980. Lawrence assumed command of the [[U.S. Third Fleet]] in [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, in September 1981. In 1983, he won the Hawaii Armed Forces singles tennis championship in the seniors division (over 45).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ddg110/Pages/ourShip.aspx#.VQmQvuEWik0&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Lawrence served as Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy from August 1978 to August 1981. The Naval Academy was opened to women starting with the Class of 1980 (inducted July 1976). His daughter [[Wendy Lawrence]] was part of the Class of 1981, the second USNA class to include female graduates.

He retired in 1986.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

===Author of Tennessee State poem===
While a prisoner of war, Lawrence mentally composed poetry to help keep up his spirits.  During a 60-day period of solitary confinement, he composed, by memory, the poem "Oh Tennessee, My Tennessee," in honor of his native state. In 1973, the Tennessee State Legislature adopted the poem as Tennessee's official state poem.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee: State Poem|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/statepoems/tennessee.html|work=Web Guides|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Oh Tennessee, My Tennessee&lt;br/&gt;What Love and Pride I Feel for Thee.&lt;br/&gt;You Proud Ole State, the Volunteer,&lt;br/&gt;Your Proud Traditions I Hold Dear.

:I Revere Your Heroes&lt;br/&gt;Who Bravely Fought our Country's Foes.&lt;br/&gt;Renowned Statesmen, so Wise and Strong,&lt;br/&gt;Who Served our Country Well and Long.

:I Thrill at Thought of Mountains Grand;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling Green Hills and Fertile Farm Land;&lt;br/&gt;Earth Rich with Stone, Mineral and Ore;&lt;br/&gt;Forests Dense and Wild Flowers Galore;

:Powerful Rivers that Bring us Light;&lt;br/&gt;Deep Lakes with Fish and Fowl in Flight;&lt;br/&gt;Thriving Cities and Industries;&lt;br/&gt;Fine Schools and Universities;&lt;br/&gt;Strong Folks of Pioneer Descent,&lt;br/&gt;Simple, Honest, and Reverent.

:Beauty and Hospitality&lt;br/&gt;Are the Hallmarks of Tennessee.

:And O'er the World as I May Roam,&lt;br/&gt;No Place Exceeds my Boyhood Home.&lt;br/&gt;And Oh How Much I Long to See&lt;br/&gt;My Native Land, My Tennessee.
