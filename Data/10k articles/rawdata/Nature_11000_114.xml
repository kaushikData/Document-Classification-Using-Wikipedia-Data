[[File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']]
The '''10th edition of ''Systema Naturae''''' is a book written by Swedish naturalist [[Carolus Linnaeus]] and published in two volumes in 1758 and 1759, which marks the starting point of [[zoological nomenclature]]. In it, Linnaeus introduced [[binomial nomenclature]] for [[animal]]s, something he had already done for plants in his 1753 publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.

==Starting point==
Before 1758, most biological catalogues had used polynomial names for the taxa included, including earlier editions of ''Systema Naturae''. The first work to consistently apply binomial nomenclature across the animal kingdom was the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae''. The [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] therefore chose 1 January 1758 as the "starting point" for zoological nomenclature, and asserted that the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'' was to be treated as if published on that date.&lt;ref name="Art3"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=3&amp;nfv=true |chapter=Article 3 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature |edition=4th |isbn=0-85301-006-4 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names published before that date are unavailable, even if they would otherwise satisfy the rules. The only work which takes [[Principle of Priority|priority]] over the 10th edition is [[Carl Alexander Clerck]]'s ''{{lang|sv|[[Svenska Spindlar]]}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Aranei Suecici}}'', which was published in 1757, but is also to be treated as if published on January 1, 1758.&lt;ref name="Art3"/&gt;

==Revisions==

{{main article|Linnaean taxonomy}}
During Linnaeus' lifetime, ''Systema Naturae'' was under continuous revision. Progress was incorporated into new and ever-expanding editions; for example, in his 1st edition (1735), [[Cetacean|whale]]s and [[manatee]]s were originally classified as species of [[fish]] (as was thought to be the case then), but in the 10th edition they were moved into the [[mammal]] class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/animal/1_1.html |title=''Systema Naturae'' - an epoch-making book |work=Linné on line |publisher=[[Uppsala University|Uppsala Universitet]] |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
The Animal Kingdom (as described by Linnaeus): ''Animals enjoy sensation by means of a living organization, animated by a medullary substance; perception by nerves; and motion by the exertion of the will. They have members for the different purposes of life; organs for their different senses; and faculties (or powers) for the application of their different perceptions. They all originate from an egg. Their external and internal structure; their comparative anatomy, habits, instincts, and various relations to each other, are detailed in authors who prosessedly treat on their subjects.''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="General1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]], translated by [[William Turton]] |year=1806 |title=Volume 1 |series=A general system of nature: through the three grand kingdoms of animals, vegetables, and minerals, systematically divided into their several classes, orders, genera, species, and varieties |publisher=Lackington, Allen, and Co |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3QZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list has been broken down into the original six classes Linnaeus described for animals; '''Mammalia''', '''Aves''', '''Amphibia''', '''Pisces''', '''Insecta''', &amp; '''Vermes'''. These classes were ultimately created by studying the internal anatomy, as seen in his key:&lt;ref name="General1"/&gt;
*Heart with 2 auricles, 2 ventricles. Warm, red blood
**Viviparous: [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]
**Oviparous: [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]
*Heart with 1 auricle, 1 ventricle. Cold, red blood
**Lungs voluntary: [[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]
**External gills: [[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]
*Heart with 1 auricle, 0 ventricles. Cold, pus-like blood
**Have antennae: [[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]
**Have tentacles: [[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]

By current standards Pisces and Vermes are informal groupings, Insecta also contained [[arachnid]]s and [[crustacean]]s, and one order of Amphibia comprised [[shark]]s, [[lamprey]]s, and [[sturgeon]]s.

===Mammalia===
{{main article|Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae}}
[[File:Barbary Macaque.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Barbary macaque]] was included in the 10th edition as ''Simia sylvanus''.]]
Linnaeus described [[mammal]]s as: ''Animals that suckle their young by means of lactiferous teats. In external and internal structure they resemble man: most of them are quadrupeds; and with man, their natural enemy, inhabit the surface of the Earth. The largest, though fewest in number, inhabit the ocean.''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="General1"/&gt;

Linnaeus divided the mammals based upon the number, situation, and structure of their teeth, into the following orders and genera:

*'''Primates''': ''[[Homo]]'' ([[human]]s), ''Simia'' ([[monkey]]s &amp; [[ape]]s), ''Lemur'' ([[lemur]]s &amp; [[colugo]]s) &amp; ''Vespertilio'' ([[bat]]s)

*'''Pecora''': ''Camelus'' ([[camel]]s), ''Moschus'' ([[musk deer]]), ''Cervus'' ([[deer]] &amp; [[giraffe]]s), ''Capra'' ([[goat]]s &amp; [[antelope]]), ''Ovis'' ([[sheep]]) &amp; ''Bos'' ([[cattle]])
*'''Belluae''': ''Equus'' ([[horse]]s) &amp; ''Hippopotamus'' ([[hippopotamus]]es)
*'''Cete''': ''Monodon'' ([[narwhal]]s), ''Balaena'' ([[rorqual]]s), ''Physeter'' ([[sperm whale]]s) &amp; ''Delphinus'' ([[dolphin]]s &amp; [[porpoise]]s)

{{main article|Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae}}
[[File:Snowy Owl Barrow Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowy owl]] was included in the 10th edition as ''Strix scandiaca''.]]
Linnaeus described [[bird]]s as: ''A beautiful and cheerful portion of created nature consisting of animals having a body covered with feathers and down; protracted and naked jaws (the beak), two wings formed for flight, and two feet. They are areal, vocal, swift and light, and destitute of external ears, lips, teeth, scrotum, womb, bladder, epiglottis, corpus callosum and its arch, and diaphragm.''&lt;ref name="General1"/&gt;

Linnaeus divided the birds based upon the characters of the bill and feet, into the following 6 orders and 63 genera:

*'''Accipitres''': ''Vultur'' ([[vulture]]s &amp; [[condor]]s), ''Falco'' ([[falcon]]s, [[eagle]]s, &amp; kin), ''Strix'' ([[owl]]s) &amp; ''Lanius'' ([[Lanius|shrikes]])

{{main article|Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae}}
[[File:European Common Frog Rana temporaria.jpg|thumb|right|The [[common frog]] was included in the 10th edition as ''Rana temporaria''.]]
Linnaeus described his "Amphibia" (comprising [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s) as: ''Animals that are distinguished by a body cold and generally naked; stern and expressive countenance; harsh voice; mostly lurid color; filthy odor; a few are furnished with a horrid poison; all have cartilaginous bones, slow circulation, exquisite sight and hearing, large pulmonary vessels, lobate liver, oblong thick stomach, and cystic, hepatic, and pancreatic ducts: they are deficient in diaphragm, do not transpire (sweat), can live a long time without food, are tenacious of life, and have the power of reproducing parts which have been destroyed or lost; some undergo a metamorphosis; some cast (shed) their skin; some appear to live promiscuously on land or in the water, and some are torpid during the winter.''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="General1"/&gt;

Linnaeus divided the amphibians based upon the limb structures and the way they breathed, into the following orders and genera:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kenneth Kitchell, Jr. &amp; Harold A.

Linnaeus described [[fish]] as: ''Always inhabiting the waters; are swift in their motion and voracious in their appetites. They breathe by means of gills, which are generally united by a bony arch; swim by means of radiate fins, and are mostly covered over with cartilaginous scales. Besides they parts they have in common with other animals, they are furnished with a nictitant membrane, and most of them with a swim-bladder, by the contraction or dilatation of which, they can raise or sink themselves in their element at pleasure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="General1"/&gt;

Linnaeus divided the fishes based upon the position of the ventral and pectoral fins, into the following orders and genera:&lt;ref name="General1"/&gt;

*'''Apodes''': ''Muraena'' ([[eel]]s), ''Gymnotus'' ([[Gymnotus|electric knifefishes]]), ''Trichiurus'' ([[cutlassfish]]es), ''Anarhichas'' ([[wolffish]]es), ''Ammodytes'' ([[Sand lance|sand eels]]), ''Stromateus'' ([[Stromateidae|butterfishes]]) &amp; ''Xiphias'' ([[swordfish]]es)

Linnaeus described his "Vermes" as: ''Animals of slow motion, soft substance, able to increase their bulk and restore parts which have been destroyed, extremely tenacious of life, and the inhabitants of moist places. Many of them are without a distinct head, and most of them without feet. They are principally distinguished by their tentacles (or feelers). By the Ancients they were not improperly called imperfect animals, as being destitute of ears, nose, head, eyes and legs; and are therefore totally distinct from Insects.''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="GeneralSystem4"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]], translated by [[William Turton]] |year=1806 |title=Volume 4: Worms |series=A general system of nature: through the three grand kingdoms of animals, vegetables, and minerals, systematically divided into their several classes, orders, genera, species, and varieties |publisher=Lackington, Allen, and Co |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to repeating the species he had previously listed in his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753), and those published in the intervening period, Linnaeus described several hundred new plant species. The species from ''Species Plantarum'' were numbered sequentially, while the new species were labelled with letters.&lt;ref name="Baum"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bernard R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3360">[[File:Dakhla magic1.png|alt=|thumb|The desert in [[Dakhla, Western Sahara]]]]
The '''Atlantic coastal desert''' is the westernmost [[ecoregion]] in the [[Sahara Desert]] of [[North Africa]]. It occupies a narrow strip along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, where the more frequent [[Fog desert|fog]] and [[haze]] generated offshore by the cool [[Canary Current]] provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of [[lichen]]s, [[succulent plant|succulents]], and shrubs.

==Bioregion==
It covers {{convert|39,900|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauritania]]. It is bounded on the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the east by the [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]], on the north by the [[Mediterranean Acacia-Argania dry woodlands]], and on the south by the [[Sahelian Acacia savanna]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1304 |title=Atlantic coastal desert |publisher=WWF |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Climate==
The cool ocean current gives an even higher [[atmospheric stability]] in the desert, by cooling air at the base. This increase in atmospheric stability serves to further reduce the amount of rainfall. Therefore, the climate is extremely dry with some 30 mm of annual precipitation in [[Dakhla, Western Sahara]] and 40 mm of annual precipitation in [[Nouadhibou]], Mauritania and several years may pass without any rainfall at all. The climate is also very sunny year-round with around 3,200 hours of annual bright sunshine, though far less sunny than in other parts of the desert of North Africa due to fog and haze. Air in the Atlantic coastal desert is rather moist and the [[relative humidity]] is generally over 60 % while farther in the interior, it quickly lowers to 30 % or less. Temperatures are also much more moderated in this coastal desert and are relatively warm to truly hot in all seasons. Averages daily temperature is 20 °C (68 °F) in Dakhla. Maximum average high temperatures are 27 °C (80.6 °F) while minimum average low temperatures are 13 °C (55.4 °F) in Dakhla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/34046/ |title=Climate: Dakhla |publisher=Climate.data.org |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
This bioregion is fairly rich in [[Endemism|endemic]] plants but has no endemic fauna. The flora consists of a variety of [[lichen]]s, [[succulent plant|succulents]] and drought-resistant shrubs. The [[Mediterranean monk seal]] (''Monachus monachus'') is found here and the broad bays are important over-wintering grounds for large numbers of Palearctic wading birds. [[Greater flamingo]]es (''Phoenicopterus roseus'') and many other waterbirds congregate on the wetlands during their [[Bird migration|migrations]]. Mammals found here include the [[Dorcas gazelle]] (''Gazella dorcas''), [[golden jackal]] (''Canis aureus''), [[fennec fox]] (''Fennecus zerda''), [[Rüppell's fox]] (''Vulpes rueppelli''), [[sand cat]] (''Felis margarita''), [[honey badger]] (''Mellivora capensis'') and [[striped hyena]] (''Hyaena hyaena'').&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5765">A '''booster''' was a [[motor-generator]] (MG) set used for [[voltage regulation]] in [[direct current]] (DC) electrical power circuits. The development of [[alternating current]] and [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices has rendered it obsolete. Boosters were made in various configurations to suit different applications.

==Line booster==

In the days of direct current [[Mains electricity|mains]], [[voltage drop]] along the line was a problem so line boosters were used to correct it.  Suppose that the mains [[voltage]] was 110 V.  Houses near the [[power station]] would receive 110 [[volt]]s but those remote from the power station might receive only 100 V so a line booster would be inserted at an appropriate point to "boost" the voltage.  It consisted of a motor, connected in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] with the mains, driving a generator, in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] with the mains.  The motor ran at the depleted mains voltage of 100 V and the generator added another 10 V to restore the voltage to 110 V.  This was an inefficient system and was made obsolete by the development of alternating current mains, which allowed for high-voltage distribution and voltage regulation by [[transformer]]s.

==Milking booster==

Again in the days of direct current mains, [[power station]]s often had large [[Lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] for [[Load balancing (electrical power)|load balancing]].  These supplemented the steam-powered generators during peak periods and were re-charged off-peak.  Sometimes one cell in the battery would become "sick" (faulty, reduced capacity) and a "milking booster" would be used to give it an additional charge and restore it to health.  The milking booster was so-called because it "milked" the healthy cells in the battery to give an extra charge to the faulty one.  The motor side of the booster was connected across the whole battery but the generator side was connected only across the faulty cell.  During discharge periods the booster supplemented the output of the faulty cell.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, T. C., ''Electric Accumulator Manual'', George Newnes Ltd, London, 1948, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reversible booster==

Before solid-state technology became available, reversible boosters were sometimes used for speed control in DC [[electric locomotive]]s.  To avoid confusion, it should be explained that it is the electrical output of the booster that is reversible, not the direction of rotation.

The motor of the MG set was connected in parallel with the supply, usually at 600 volts, and was mechanically coupled, via a shaft with a heavy [[flywheel]], to the generator.  The generator was connected in series with the supply and the [[traction motor]]s, and its output could be varied between +600 volts, through zero, to -600 volts by adjusting [[switch]]es and [[resistor]]s in the field circuit.  This allowed the generator voltage to either oppose, or supplement, the line voltage.  The net output voltage could therefore be varied smoothly between zero and 1,200 volts as follows:

* Generator producing maximum opposing voltage, net output zero volts
* Generator producing zero volts, net output 600 volts
* Generator producing maximum supplementary voltage, net output 1,200 volts

To match the 1,200 volt output, the locomotive would have three 400 volt traction motors connected in series.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, B. K., ''Electric Trains and Locomotives'', Leonard Hill Ltd, London, 1954, pp 35–38&lt;/ref&gt; Later locomotives had two 600 volt motors in series.

When the locomotive was working at full power, half the energy came through the MG set and the other half came directly from the supply.  This meant that the power rating of the MG set needed to be only half the rating of the traction motors.  Thus there was a saving in weight and cost compared to the [[Harry Ward Leonard|Ward Leonard]] system, in which the MG set had to be equal in power rating to the traction motors.

If the power supply to the locomotive was interrupted (e.g. because of a gap in the [[third rail]] at a junction) the flywheel would power the MG set for a short period to bridge the gap.  During this period, the motor of the MG set would temporarily run as a generator.  It was this system that was used in the design of British Rail classes [[British Rail Class 70 (electric)|70]], [[British Rail Class 71|71]] and [[British Rail Class 74|74]] ([[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] does not utilise booster equipment).

==Metadyne==

Some types of London Underground stock (e.g. [[London Underground O Stock]]) were fitted with [[Metadyne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, B. K., ''Electric Trains and Locomotives'', Leonard Hill Ltd, London, 1954, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; These were four-brush electrical machines which differed from the reversible boosters described above.

==Television receivers==
When [[cathode ray tube]]s were the standard for television receivers, after many years of service the tube would lose brightness, due to low electron emission in the electron gun assembly of each tube.  A small "booster" transformer could be added to a set experiencing such symptoms; it would raise the voltage applied to the filament slightly, which would increase emission and restore brightness.  Sometimes this step would extend the life of the expensive CRT by years, making it more economical than a replacement. &lt;ref&gt; R.R. Gulati,''Monochrome And Colour Television'', New Age International, 2006 {{ISBN|8122417760}}, page 582  &lt;/ref&gt;

Iddings|Iddings, Joseph Paxson]], 1913, ''Igneous rocks: composition, texture and classification'', v. 2, pp. 94-96&lt;/ref&gt; Comendite occurs in the mountains Tibrogargan, Coonowrin, Tunbubudla, Coochin, Saddleback, Tibberoowuccum and Ngungun in the [[Glass House Mountains]], South East Queensland, Australia.  The blue colour is caused by very small crystals of [[riebeckite]] or [[arfvedsonite]].&lt;ref&gt;Rocks and landscapes of the Sunshine Coast by Warwick Willmott, Brisbane: Geological Society of Australia Queensland Division, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Comendite also occurs in [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] and other areas of [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name=Iddings/&gt;
The 1903 eruption of [[Baekdu Mountain|Changbaishan]] volcano in north-east China erupted comendite [[pumice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/changbaishan.html Changbaishan volcano, China - facts and information]. Retrieved 2013-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comendite derives its name from the area of Le Commende on [[San Pietro Island]] in Italy, where the rock type is found.&lt;ref&gt;Cioni, R. and Funedda, A., (2005) ''Structural geology of crystal-rich, silicic lava flows: A case study from San Pietro Island (Sardinia, Italy)'' in Manga, M. and Ventura, G.

The '''Court of the Lions '''({{lang-es|Patio de los Leones}}; {{lang-ar|بهو السباع}})  is the main courtyard of the [[Nasrid dynasty]] Palace of the Lions,{{explain|date=May 2018}} in the heart of the [[Alhambra]], the [[Moorish]] citadel formed by a complex of palaces, gardens and [[Fortification|forts]] in [[Granada]], [[Spain]]. It was commissioned by the Nasrid sultan [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed V]] of the [[Emirate of Granada]] in [[Al-Andalus]]. Its construction started in the second period of his reign, between 1362 and 1391 AD. The site is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;ref name="Unesco World Heritage List Spain-Gallery View." &gt;http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;id_site=314&amp;gallery=1&amp;&amp;index=13&lt;/ref&gt; and minted in Spain's [[€2 commemorative coins#2011 coinage|2011 limited edition of 2 € Commemorative Coins.]]

==Background and architectural influences==
The Palace of the Lions, as well as the rest of the other new rooms built under [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada|Muhammad V]],&lt;ref&gt;John Stothoff Badeau, John Richard Hayes, ''The Genius of Arab Civilization: Source of Renaissance'', 1983, MIT Press, 260 pages  {{ISBN|0-262-58063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; like the [[Mechouar|Mexuar]] or ''Cuarto Dorado'', represented the beginning of a new style, an exuberant mixture of [[Moorish]] and [[Christian]] influences that has been called Nasrid style. During the period that Muhammad V was ousted as sultan of Granada by his stepbrother, Abu-l Walid Ismail, he discovered in exile a host of new aesthetic influences that were not in the language of his predecessors, not even in his own first contributions to the enrichment of the Nasrid palaces of the Alhambra. In [[Fes]] he saw the [[Almoravid]] mosque of [[Qarawiyyin]], built by Andalusian architects. The splendor of the decorations, specially the profuse use of the [[muqarnas]] that had once decorated the palaces and mosques of Al-Ándalus, stunned the ex-sultan, as did the ruins of the Roman city of [[Volubilis]], where he could directly examine the classical orders, Roman ornamentation and, above all, the disposition of the Roman [[impluvium]]; the Roman ruins at Volubilis were particularly well preserved since they had been abandoned for a period of time in the [[Middle Ages]] and later re-used as a [[necropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906|title=Volubilis|last=Map|first=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith|website=The Megalithic Portal|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Muhammad became an ally of his personal friend, the Christian king [[Pedro I of Castile]], who helped him to regain the throne and defeat the usurpers. Meanwhile, he was also astonished with the construction of the palace of Pedro I, the [[Alcázar of Seville]], built in [[Mudéjar]] style by architects from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Seville]] and [[Granada]]. The influence of this Mudéjar style of King Pedro in the future Palace of the Lions was going to be decisive, especially the structure and disposition of the Qubba rooms along two axis of the 'Patio de las Doncellas' ("Courtyard of the Maidens").

==Description==

The Courtyard of the Lions is an oblong courtyard, 35 m  in length and 20 m in width, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the courtyard at each extremity, with filigree walls and light domed roof, elaborately ornamented. The square is paved with coloured tiles, and the colonnade with white marble; while the walls are covered 1.5 m up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed, with a view to artistic effect; and the general form of the piers, arches and pillars is most graceful.  They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; above each arch there is a large square of arabesques; and over the pillars is another square of filigree work.  In the center of the courtyard is the celebrated Fountain of Lions, a magnificent alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble.  At present, the fountain is under restoration in an effort to preserve its integrity.

==Meaning of the structure==
The structure of the courtyard, has, as it has been said, a direct influence of the Sevillian Patio de las Doncellas, but its meaning and origins trace their roots to early [[Islamic garden]]ing, the courtyard divided in four parts, each one of them symbolizing one of the four parts of the world. Each part is irrigated by a water channel that symbolize the four rivers of [[Paradise]]. This courtyard is, therefore, an architectural materialization of Paradise, where the gardens, the water, and the columns form a conceptual and physical unity. The slender column forest have been said to represent the palm trees of an oasis in the desert, deeply related with Paradise in the Nasrid imagination. In the poem of [[Ibn Zamrak]] on the basin of the fountain, a further meaning is stated clearly: "The fountain is the Sultan, which smothers with his graces all his subjects and lands, as the water wets the gardens."

Nowadays the flower garden has been substituted by a dry garden of pebbles, in order not to affect the foundation of the palace with the watering. In Nasrid times, the floor of the quartered planting beds was slightly lower than the general level, and the visual effect was like a tapestry of flowers, as the top of the plants were cut to the same level of the courtyard, and these were carefully chosen to cover a host of color nuances.

==Lion Fountain==
Some research suggests that the 11th century lions of the '''Lion Fountain''' came from the house of the Jewish vizier [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah#Joseph ibn Naghrela|Yusuf ibn Nagrela]] (d. 1066). It is not known if they were made before his death, and at the time, he was accused of wanting to build a bigger palace than the king's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=/alhambra/alhambras_guide/the_lion_palace official site]&lt;/ref&gt; They are large for sculptures of animals in [[Islamic art]], but as in other sites of [[al-Andalus]] such as the earlier [[Medina Azahara]] near [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]], there are multiple animals. The [[Pisa Griffin]] is even larger.

There is an almost exact description of the original fountain, written by the poet [[Solomon ibn Gabirol|Ibn Gabirol]] in the 11th century.  They represent the 12 tribes of Israel, two of them have a triangle on the forehead, indicating the two extant tribes ''Judá'' and ''Leví''. The Lions were removed in 2007 for restoration on the premises while the fountain was restored ''in situ''. The lions were put back in place in July 2012 after reconstruction of the traditional water flow system of the Court of the Lions.

===Excerpt of Ibn Zamrak's poem on the basin===
The poet and minister [[Ibn Zamrak]] wrote a poem to describe the beauty of the courtyard. It is carved around the rim of the basin:&lt;ref&gt;Ed. by José Miguel Puerta Vílchez, ''Reading the Alhambra: A Visual Guide to the Alhambra Through its Inscriptions'', trans. by Jon Trout ([no place]: The Alhambra and Generalife Trust and EDILUX s.l., 2010), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Verse translation|

Such a translucent basin, sculpted pearl!
Argentic ripples are added on it by the quiet dew
And its liquid silver goes over the daisies, melted, and even purer.
Hard and soft are so close, that it would be hard to distinguish
liquid and solid, marble and water. Which one is running?
Don't you see how water overflows the borders
and the warned drains are here against it?
They are like the lover who in vain
tries to hide his tears from his beloved.

The '''Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies''' was a review group formed by the [[Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence of the United States]] in light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures of 2013]].  In December 2013, the five-member group produced a public report.  

==Formation==
On August 12, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] issued a Presidential Memorandum instructing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, to form a "Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies".  Obama instructed that "The Review Group will assess whether, in light of advancements in communications technologies, the United States employs its technical collection capabilities in a manner that optimally protects our national security and advances our foreign policy while appropriately accounting for other policy considerations, such as the risk of unauthorized disclosure and our need to maintain the public trust."

The memorandum called for an interim report within 60 days of establishment and a final report by December 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/909-dni-clapper-announces-review-group-on-intelligence-and-communications-technologies |title=DNI Clapper Announces Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies |publisher=Dni.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The group included former counter-terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke]], former Acting [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[Michael Morell]], [[University of Chicago]] Law professor [[Geoffrey Stone]], former administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [[Cass Sunstein]] and former Chief Counselor for Privacy in the Office of Management and Budget [[Peter Swire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/intelligence-community/review-group |title=Review Group |publisher=Dni.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harding288"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|authorlink=Luke Harding|title=[[The Snowden Files|The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man]]|date=2014|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780804173520|oclc=870337274|page=288|quote=The panel's chair was Michael Morrell, Obama's former deputy CIA director; two other members included Richard Clarke, a former counter-terrorism co-ordinator under Clinton and George W Bush, and Peter Swire, Clinton's privacy director. The panel enjoyed the lugubrious name, 'Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
The 300-page report, entitled "Liberty and Security in a Changing World", was  released on December 12, 2013. It contained over 40 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Geoffrey R. |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116269/barack-obamas-nsa-speech-heres-how-i-grade-his-reforms |title=Barack Obama's NSA Speech: Here's How I Grade His Reforms |publisher=New Republic |date=2014-01-18 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] released a statement criticizing the report, saying "we’re disappointed that the recommendations suggest a path to continue untargeted spying. Mass surveillance is still heinous, even if private company servers are holding the data instead of government data centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/eff-statement-presidents-review-groups-nsa-report |title=EFF Statement on President's Review Group's NSA Report &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NSA_report.pdf |title=A Critique of the Recoommendations by the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communication Technologies |publisher=Centerforsecuritypolicy.org |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes [[Diversitas]], [[IGBP]], [[WCRP]] and IHDP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.essp.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present era, global environmental changes are both accelerating and changing Earth's systems into a state with no analogue in previous history. The Earth System is the unified set of physical, chemical, biological and social components, processes and interactions that together determine the state and dynamics of planet Earth, including its biota and its human occupants.

[[Earth system science]] is the study of the Earth system, with an emphasis on observing, understanding and predicting global environmental changes involving interactions between land, atmosphere, water, ice, [[biosphere]], societies, technologies and economies.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Electra''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|l|ɛ|k|t|r|ə}}; {{Lang-el|Ἠλέκτρα}}, ''Ēlektra'' "amber") was the [[Oceanid]] daughter of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]''
[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+337 337&amp;ndash;370]; ''Homeric Hymn'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002.perseus-eng1:1-39 2.5], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002.perseus-eng1:398-448 2.418&amp;ndash;423]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]],[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.2 1.2.2].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hesiod]], she was the wife of [[Thaumas]], and by him, the mother of [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], the messenger of the gods, and the [[Harpies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+240 265&amp;ndash;269], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+767 780&amp;ndash;381]; also [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.6 1.2.6]; [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vczTNMWLGdoC&amp;pg=PA96 Preface].&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of Electra's Harpy daughters vary. Hesiod and [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] name them: [[Aello]] and [[Ocypete]]. [[Virgil]], names [[Celaeno]] as one of the Harpies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:3.192-3.257 3 211&amp;ndash;212]; [[Servius]], On [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+3.212 3.212].&lt;/ref&gt; However while [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' Preface has the Harpies, Celaeno, Ocypete, and Podarce, as daughters of Thaumas and Electra, at ''Fabuale'' 14.18, the Harpies are said to be named Aellopous, Celaeno, and Ocypete, and are the daughters of Thaumas and Ozomene.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vczTNMWLGdoC&amp;pg=PA102 14.18].&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 4th-early 5th century poet [[Nonnus]] gives Electra and Thaumas two children,  Iris, and the river [[Hydaspes (mythology)|Hydaspes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca02nonnuoft#page/318/mode/2up 26.358&amp;ndash;362].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[File:From top of Nalubaale Power Station.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nalubaale Power Station]], 2007.]]

Poor maintenance during the politically unstable 1980s resulted in a drop in production at the Owen Falls Dam (now [[Nalubaale Power Station]]), at the mouth of the White Nile, from 635.5 million kilowatt-hours in 1986 to 609.9 million kilowatt-hours in 1987, with six of ten generators broken by the end of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uganda Energy During the 1980's | last=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=1989| url=http://countrystudies.us/uganda/48.htm|publisher=Countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 200 megawatt [[Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station]], built adjacent to the Nalubaale Power Station, raised total production capacity to 380 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=14 May 2015 |last=UEGCL |url=http://www.uegcl.com/kiira-Power.html |title=Profile of Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station |publisher=[[Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited]] (UEGCL) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523012001/http://www.uegcl.com/kiira-Power.html |archivedate=23 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and 2012, the 250 megawatt [[Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station]] was constructed as a public-private project, at a cost of approximately US$862 million. The consortium that owns the station includes the [[Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development]], Sithe Global Power LLC (a subsidiary of the [[Blackstone Group]]), and the [[government of Uganda]]. [[Bujagali Energy Limited]] is a special-vehicle company created to run the power station on behalf of the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=14 May 2015|url=https://www.blackstone.com/news-views/press-releases/details/ugandan-president-museveni-and-aga-khan-inaugurate-bujagali-hydropower-plant|title=Ugandan President Museveni And Aga Khan Inaugurate Bujagali Hydropower Plant|date=8 October 2012|

Also in 2013, work on the 600 megawatt [[Karuma Power Station]] commenced at a budgeted cost of about US$2 billion, including US$250 million to build the high-voltage transmission lines to evacuate the generated power. Completion is planned for late 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliament Okays US$1.435 Billion Loan for Karuma|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Parliament-okays-billion-loan-Karuma/-/688334/2665216/-/66g2uj/-/index.html|

{{asof|May 2015}}, about six operational mini-hydropower plants are connected to the national electricity grid, supplying about 65 megawatts. These include [[Nyagak Power Station|Nyagak I]] (3.5 megawatts), [[Kabalega Hydroelectric Power Station|Kabalega]] (9 megawatts), [[Kanungu Power Station|Kanungu]] (6.6 megawatts), [[Bugoye Power Station|Bugoye]] (13 megawatts), [[Mubuku I Power Station|Mubuku I]] (5 megawatts), [[Mubuku III Power Station|Mubuku III]] (10 megawatts), and [[Mpanga Power Station|Mpanga]] (18 megawatts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Thermal power==
Two [[heavy fuel oil]] thermal power stations exist in the country.

[[Namanve Power Station]] is a 50 megawatt plant owned by Jacobsen Electricity Company (Uganda) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of [http://www.jel.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52%3A50-mva-power-station-in-uganda&amp;catid=1%3Asiste-nytt&amp;lang=en Jacobsen Elektro], an independent  [[Norway|Norwegian]] power production company. The plant cost US$92 million (€66 million) to build in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/658314|title=Namanve Plant Reduces Load-Shedding|newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala)|date=6 November 2008|first=Sylvia|last=Juuko|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914160503/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/658314|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tororo Thermal Power Station|Tororo Power Station]] is an 89 megawatt heavy fuel-oil powered plant owned by Electro-Maxx Limited, a Ugandan company and a subsidiary of the Simba Group of Companies, owned by Ugandan industrialist [[Patrick Bitature]]. This plant is licensed to sell up to 50 megawatts to the national electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=5 September 2017| url=http://mediacentre.go.ug/press-release/ministry-energy-and-mineral-development-celebrating-annual-manifesto-week-12th-19th |title=Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development Celebrating the Annual Manifest Week, From 12th to 19th May 2017 | publisher=Uganda Media Centre |author=[[Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (Uganda)|Minenamd]] | location=Kampala| date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Namanve and Tororo are used as stand-by power sources to avoid load-shedding when hydropower generation fails to meet demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=22 January 2014|publisher=Uganda Radio Network| url=http://ugandaradionetwork.com/a/story.php?s=60289| accessdate=15 May 2015|title=Heavy Fuel Electricity Could Return In 2014 As Demand Hits 12 Percent|first=Mark Keith| last=Muhumuza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five sugar manufacturers in Uganda have total cogeneration capacity of about 110 megawatts, of which about 50 percent is available for sale to the national grid. The cogeneration power plants and their generation capacities include [[Kakira Power Station]] (52 megawatts), [[Kinyara Power Station]] (40 megawatts), [[Lugazi Power Station]] (14 megawatts), [[Kaliro Power Station]] (12 megawatts) and [[Mayuge Thermal Power Station]] (1.6 megawatts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=24 July 2015 | url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/East-Africa-an-emerging-renewable-energy-hub-/-/2558/2806036/-/item/3/-/y5h3frz/-/index.html | title=Kenya Joins Big Investors In Renewable Energy As East Africa Plays Catch-Up | last=Special Correspondent | location=Nairobi | newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]] | accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=15 May 2015 | date=30 May 2014 | last=ERA | url=http://www.era.or.ug/index.php/2013-10-23-18-03-21/2013-10-23-18-12-48/notices/324-application-for-a-license-for-the-establishment-of-a-11-9mw-bagasse-co-generation-power-plant-in-kaliro-district | title=Application for A License for The Establishment of A 11.9MW Bagasse Co-Generation Power Plant In Kaliro District | publisher=[[Electricity Regulatory Authority]] (ERA) | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811121527/http://www.era.or.ug/index.php/2013-10-23-18-03-21/2013-10-23-18-12-48/notices/324-application-for-a-license-for-the-establishment-of-a-11-9mw-bagasse-co-generation-power-plant-in-kaliro-district | archivedate=11 August 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil and natural gas ==
Uganda is highly vulnerable to oil price shocks as it imports almost all of its {{convert|18180|oilbbl/d}} of oil (2013 figure). The oil comes through the [[Kenya]]n port of [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ug.html|title=The World Factbook: Uganda - Energy: Petroleum Products|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=15 May 2015| last=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of Kenya, Uganda, and [[Rwanda]] are jointly developing the [[Kenya–Uganda–Rwanda Petroleum Products Pipeline]] to carry refined petroleum products from Mombasa through [[Nairobi]] to [[Eldoret]], all in Kenya. From Eldoret, the pipeline will continue through [[Malaba, Uganda|Malaba]] to [[Kampala]] in Uganda, continuing on to [[Kigali]] in Rwanda. The feasibility study for the Eldoret to Kampala pipeline extension was awarded to an international firm in 1997. The study was completed in 1998 and the report submitted the following year. The separate feasibility study for the Kampala to Kigali extension was awarded to the [[East African Community]] in September 2011. The governments of Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda accepted the findings of the studies. The construction contract was initially awarded, in 2007, to Tamoil, a company owned by the [[Government of Libya]]. That contract was voided in 2012 after the company failed to implement the project. {{asof|April 2014}}, fourteen companies had submitted bids to construct the pipeline extension from Kenya to Rwanda. Construction is expected to begin in 2014, with a 32-month construction timeframe. Commissioning is expected in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya-Uganda Oil Pipeline, Kenya|url=http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/kenya-uganda-oil-pipeline/|publisher=Hydrocarbons-technology.com (HCTC)| accessdate=15 May 2015|date=2012 | last=HCTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hoima District in Uganda.svg|thumb|[[Hoima District]] (in red), located along [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], has been the site of the petroleum finds.]]

In 2006, Uganda confirmed the existence of commercially viable petroleum reserves in the [[Western Rift Valley]] around [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]. In June 2006, [[Hardman Resources]] of Australia discovered [[tar sands|oil sands]] at [[Waranga]] 1, Waranga 2, and [[Mputa]]. President [[Yoweri Museveni]] announced that he expected production of {{convert|6000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/21834 | title=Uganda Becomes Oil Producer | last=Afrol | date=9 October 2006 | accessdate=15 May 2015 | publisher=[[afrol|Afrol.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Heritage Oil, one of several companies prospecting around Lake Albert, raised its estimate for the Kingfisher well (block 3A) in [[Hoima District]], [[Bunyoro sub-region]], stating that they thought it was bigger than {{convert|600|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude. Heritage's partner, [[London]]-based [[Tullow Oil]], which had bought [[Hardman Resources]], was more guarded, but stated their confidence that the Albertine Basin as a whole contained over one billion barrels. The Kingfisher-1 well flowed {{convert|13893|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of 30-32 [[API gravity|API]] oil.&lt;ref name=" More oil, gas found"&gt;[http://www.busiweek.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3720&amp;Itemid=9 " More oil, gas found"] by Edris Kisambira, ''[[East African Business Week]]'', 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

This news came on the heels of Tullow's 11 July 2007 report that the [[Nzizi]] 2 appraisal well confirmed the presence of {{convert|14|Mcuft|m3}} per day of [[natural gas]]. Heritage in a report to its partners talked of Ugandan reserves of {{convert|2.4|Goilbbl|m3}} worth $7 billion as the "most exciting new play in sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade."&lt;ref name=" More oil, gas found"/&gt; However, development will require a {{convert|750|mi|km}} pipeline to the coast, which will need $80 oil to justify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa's Potential To Sate World's Oil Demand Dims|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2015  |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122461947159855391 |last=Fritsch | first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Uganda and the neighboring [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) have been tense since the discovery of oil, as both countries seek to clarify the border delineation on the lake in their favor, in particular the ownership of small [[Rukwanzi Island]]. Ugandan foreign minister [[Sam Kutesa]] made an emergency visit to [[Kinshasa]] in an attempt to smooth tensions.&lt;ref name="Talks"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=15 May 2015| date=23 August 2007|title=Congo And Uganda: Do You Want To Share Or To Fight? - The Question Posed By The Oil Find In Lake Albert| url=http://www.economist.com/node/9687573 | last=From Print Edition|publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, noting that the DRC has assigned exploration blocks on its side of the border, proposed that the situation should sort itself amicably: Uganda needs a stable and secure border in order to attract foreign investment developing the oil reserves, while the cost of transporting the oil to the DRC's sole port at [[Matadi]] is so prohibitive that the Congolese government is nearly obliged to seek pipeline access through Uganda.&lt;ref name="Talks"/&gt;

After an initial period of disagreement between the [[Government of Uganda]] and the petroleum exploration companies, the two sides agreed in April 2013 to simultaneously build a crude oil pipeline to the [[Kenya]]n coast ([[Uganda–Kenya Crude Oil Pipeline]]) and an oil refinery in Uganda ([[Uganda Oil Refinery]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

In February 2015, the Ugandan government selected the consortium led by Russia's RT Global Resources as the winning bidder, to construct the refinery. The government was expected to begin in-depth negotiations with the winning bidder for a binding agreement to construct the refinery. The negotiations were expected to last about 60 days. If the parties failed to agree on terms, the government planned to negotiate with the losing bidder, the consortium led by SK Energy of South Korea, to construct the refinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uganda Picks Russia's RT Global Resources To Build Refinery |accessdate=15 May 2015 |date=17 February 2015|last=Biryabarema |first=Elias |

'''Energy policy''' is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques. Energy is a core component of modern economies. A functioning economy requires not only labor and capital but also energy, for manufacturing processes, transportation, communication, agriculture, and more. 

==Background==
Concerning the term of energy policy, the importance of implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes should be accentuated.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research is ongoing, the "human dimensions" of [[energy use]] are of increasing interest to business, utilities, and policymakers. Using the [[social sciences]] to gain insights into energy [[consumer behavior]] can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based [[climate and energy]] options. This could facilitate more [[efficient energy use]], [[renewable energy commercialization]], and [[carbon emission]] reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Armstrong, Catherine Wolfram, Robert Gross, Nathan S. Lewis, and [[M.V. Ramana]] et al., "The Frontiers of Energy", ''Nature Energy'', Vol 1, 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to energy is also critical for basic social needs, such as lighting, heating, cooking, and health care. As a result, the price of energy has a direct effect on jobs, economic productivity and business competitiveness, and the cost of goods and services.

==National energy policy==

===Measures used to produce an energy policy===
A national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that country's laws, treaties and agency directives. The energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures:

* statement of national policy regarding [[energy planning]], energy generation, transmission and usage
* [[legislation]] on commercial energy activities (trading, transport, storage, etc.)
* legislation affecting [[Efficient energy use|energy use]], such as [[Minimum Efficiency Performance Standards|efficiency standards]], [[emission standard]]s
* instructions for state-owned energy sector assets and organizations
* active participation in, co-ordination of and incentives for mineral [[fuel]]s exploration (see [[geological survey]]) and other energy-related [[research and development policy command ]]
* [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] related to energy products and services (taxes, exemptions, subsidies ...
* [[energy security]] and international policy measures such as:
** international energy sector treaties and alliances,
** general international trade agreements,
** special relations with energy-rich countries, including military presence and/or domination.

Frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch (see: [[energy crisis]]). Current energy policies also address environmental issues (see: [[climate change]]), particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments state explicit energy policy, but, declared or not, each government practices some type of energy policy. Economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool (see: [[economic model]], [[Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems|POLES]]).

===Factors within an energy policy===

There are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy, regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy.  The chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are:

* What is the extent of energy self-sufficiency for this nation
* Where future energy sources will derive
* How future energy will be consumed (e.g. among sectors)
* What fraction of the population will be acceptable to endure [[energy poverty]]
* What are the goals for future [[energy intensity]], ratio of energy consumed to [[GDP]]
* What is the reliability standard for distribution reliability
* What environmental externalities are acceptable and are forecast
* What form of "portable energy" is forecast (e.g. sources of fuel for motor vehicles)
* How will energy efficient hardware (e.g. hybrid vehicles, household appliances) be encouraged
* How can the national policy drive province, state and municipal functions
* What specific mechanisms (e.g. taxes, incentives, manufacturing standards) are in place to implement the total policy
* What future consequences there will be for national security and foreign policy&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Michael S. 2013. ''Energy Policy Analysis: A Conceptual Framework''. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State, province or municipal energy policy==

Even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in [[plural]]. Influential entities, such as [[municipality|municipal]] or regional governments and energy industries, will each exercise  policy. Policy measures available to these entities are lesser in [[sovereignty]], but may be equally important to national measures.  In fact, there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level, such as monitoring [[energy conservation]] practices in the process of building construction, which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal [[building code]]s (although can appear [[wiktionary:basic|basic]] federal legislation).

==Americas==

===Brazil===

{{Main article|Energy policy of Brazil}}

[[Brazil]] is the 10th largest [[energy]] consumer in the world and the largest in [[South America]]. At the same time, it is an important [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] producer in the region and the world's second largest [[ethanol fuel]] producer. The governmental agencies responsible for energy policy are the [[Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil)|Ministry of Mines and Energy]] (MME), the [[National Council for Energy Policy]] (CNPE, in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] acronym), the [[National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Brazil)|National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels]] (ANP) and the [[Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency|National Agency of Electricity]] (ANEEL).&lt;ref name=weo1&gt;[[International Energy Agency|IEA]].

===Canada===

{{Main article|Energy policy of Canada}}

=== United States  ===
Currently, the major issues in U.S. energy policy revolve around the rapidly growing production of domestic and other North American energy resources. The U.S. drive toward energy independence and less reliance on oil and coal is fraught with partisan conflict because these issues revolve around how best to balance both competing values, such as environmental protection and economic growth, and the demands of rival organized interests, such as those of the fossil fuel industry and of the newer renewable energy businesses. {{Main article|Energy policy of the United States}}

==Europe==

===European Union===
{{Main article|Energy policy of the European Union}}

Although the [[European Union]] has legislated, set targets, and negotiated internationally in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], the concept of introducing a mandatory common European Union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on October 27, 2005 in [[London]]. Following this the first policy proposals, ''Energy for a Changing World'', were published by the [[European Commission]], on January 10, 2007. The most well known energy policy objectives in the EU are 20/20/20 objectives, binding for all EU Member States. The EU is planning to increase the share of renewable energy in its final energy use to 20%, reduce greenhouse gases by 20% and increase energy efficiency by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Obrecht|first1=Matevz|last2=Denac|first2=Matjaz|title=A sustainable energy policy for Slovenia : considering the potential of renewables and investment costs|journal=Journal of renewable and sustainable energy|date=2013|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jrse/5/3/10.1063/1.4811283 | doi = 10.1063/1.4811283|pages=032301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{main article|Energiewende in Germany}}

In September 2010, the German government adopted a set of ambitious goals to transform their national energy system and to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95% by 2050 (relative to 1990).&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|Energy policy of the United Kingdom}}

The [[energy policy of the United Kingdom]] has achieved success in reducing [[energy intensity]] (but still really high), reducing energy poverty, and maintaining energy supply reliability to date.{{when|date=September 2016}}  The United Kingdom has an ambitious goal to reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]] for future years, but it is unclear whether the programs in place are sufficient to achieve this objective (the way to be so efficient as France is still hard).  Regarding energy self sufficiency, the United Kingdom policy does not address this issue, other than to concede historic [[energy self sufficiency]] is currently ceasing to exist (due to the decline of the [[North Sea oil]] production).  With regard to transport, the United Kingdom historically has a good policy record encouraging [[public transport]] links with cities, despite encountering problems with high speed trains, which have the potential to reduce dramatically domestic and short-haul European flights. The policy does not, however, significantly encourage [[hybrid vehicle]] use or [[ethanol fuel]] use, options which represent viable short term means to moderate rising transport fuel consumption.  Regarding [[renewable energy]], the United Kingdom has goals for [[wind energy|wind]] and [[tidal energy]].  The White Paper on Energy, 2007, set the target that 20% of the UK's energy must come from renewable sources by 2020.

===The Soviet Union and Russia===
{{Main article|Energy policy of the Soviet Union|Energy policy of Russia}}
The [[Soviet Union]] was the largest energy provider in the world until the late 1980s. [[Russia]], one of the world's [[energy superpower]]s, is rich in natural energy resources, the world’s leading net energy exporter, and a major supplier to the [[European Union]]. The main document defining the [[energy policy of Russia]] is the Energy Strategy, which initially set out policy for the period up to 2020, later was reviewed, amended and prolonged up to 2030. While Russia has also signed and ratified the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Numerous scholars note that Russia uses its energy exports as a foreign policy instrument towards other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Baran, Z. (2007). EU Energy Security: Time to End Russian Leverage.The Washington Quarterly, 30(4), 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Robert Orttung and Indra Overland (2011) ‘A Limited Toolbox: Explaining the Constraints on Russia’s Foreign Energy Policy’, Journal of Eurasian Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 74-85.

==Asia==

===China===
{{Main article|Energy policy of China}}

===India===
{{Main article|Energy policy of India}}

The energy policy of [[India]] is characterized by trades between four major drivers:
* Rapidly growing economy, with a need for dependable and reliable supply of electricity, gas, and petroleum products;
* Increasing household incomes, with a need for affordable and adequate supply of electricity, and clean cooking fuels;
* Limited domestic reserves of [[fossil fuel]]s, and the need to import a vast fraction of the gas, crude oil, and petroleum product requirements, and recently the need to import coal as well; and
* Indoor, urban and regional environmental impacts, necessitating the need for the adoption of cleaner fuels and cleaner technologies.

In recent years, these challenges have led to a major set of continuing reforms, restructuring and a focus on [[energy conservation]].

===Thailand===

{{Main article|Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)}}

The [[Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)|energy policy of Thailand]] is characterized by 1) increasing energy consumption efficiency, 2) increasing domestic energy production, 3) increasing the private sector's role in the energy sector, 4) increasing the role of market mechanisms in setting energy prices.  These policies have been consistent since the 1990s, despite various changes in governments.  The pace and form of industry liberalization and privatization has been highly controversial.

===Bangladesh===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Bangladesh}}
The first National Energy Policy (NEP) of Bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral resources to ensure proper exploration, production, distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones, consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis.[1] With rapid change of global as well as domestic situation, the policy was updated in 2004. The updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment, to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020.[2]

==Oceania==

===Australia===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Australia}}

Australia's energy policy features a combination of [[coal]] power stations and [[hydro electricity]] plants. The Australian government has decided not to build [[nuclear power]] plants, although it is one of the world's largest producers of uranium.

Heat waves are periods of abnormally high temperatures and [[heat index]]. Definitions of a heatwave vary because of the variation of temperatures in different geographic locations.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Extreme Weather|last=Mogil|first=H Michael|publisher=[[Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57912-743-5|location=New York|pages=210–211}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-08-08--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive heat is often accompanied by high levels of [[humidity]], but can also be catastrophically dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat: A Major Killer|url=http://nws.noaa.gov/os/heat/index.shtml|author=NOAA NWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because heat waves are not visible as other forms of severe weather are, like hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, they are one of the less known forms of extreme weather.&lt;ref name="heat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/heat/index.html|title=Heat Wave Awareness Project|publisher=[[National Center for Atmospheric Research]]|author1=Casey Thornbrugh |author2=Asher Ghertner |author3=Shannon McNeeley |author4=Olga Wilhelmi |author5=Robert Harriss |year=2007|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe heat weather can damage populations and crops due to potential [[dehydration]] or [[hyperthermia]], [[heat cramps]], [[heat expansion]] and [[heat stroke]]. Dried soils are more susceptible to erosion, decreasing lands available for [[agriculture]]. Outbreaks of wildfires can increase in frequency as dry vegetation has increased likeliness of igniting. The [[evaporation]] of bodies of water can be devastating to marine populations, decreasing the size of the habitats available as well as the amount of nutrition present within the waters. Livestock and other animal populations may decline as well.

During excessive heat plants shut their leaf pores ([[stomata]]), a protective mechanism to conserve water but also curtails plants' absorption capabilities. This leaves more pollution and ozone in the air, which leads to a higher mortality in the population. It has been estimated that extra pollution during the hot summer 2006 in the UK, cost 460 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2013/research/heat-ozone/|title=It's not just the heat – it's the ozone: Study highlights hidden dangers|publisher=[[University of York]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European heat waves from summer 2003 are estimated to have caused 30,000 excess deaths, due to heat stress and air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=551|title=Vulnerable populations: Lessons learnt from the summer 2003 heat waves in europe|publisher=Eurosurveillance|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 U.S cities have registered new record high temperatures. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R|date=2005|title=Climate Change and Human Health|url=|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 353| issue =  14|pages=1433–1436|via=|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079}}&lt;/ref&gt;The [[1936 North American heat wave|worst heatwave]] in the USA occurred in 1936 and killed more than 5000 people directly.

===Cold waves===
[[File:Lst neo 20131203-20131210.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Cold wave in continental North America from Dec-03 to Dec-10, 2013. Red color means above mean temperature; blue represents below normal temperature.]]
{{Main article|Cold wave}}
&lt;!--Please review MAIN article prior to editing this section - this article is specific to SEVERE WEATHER--&gt;
A cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the [[National Weather Service|U.S. National Weather Service]], a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cold-wave1|title=Cold Wave|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|author=Glossary of Meteorology|accessdate=2009-08-18|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110247/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cold-wave1|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold waves generally are capable of occurring any geological location and are formed by large cool air masses that accumulate over certain regions, caused by movements of air streams.&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;

A cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater [[Food energy|caloric]] intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach necessary food and water, and die of [[hypothermia]] or starvation. Cold waves often necessitate the purchase of [[fodder]] for livestock at considerable cost to farmers.&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt; Human populations can be inflicted with [[frostbite]]s when exposed for extended periods of time to cold and may result in the loss of limbs or damage to internal organs.

Extreme winter cold often causes poorly [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] water [[pipeline transport|pipes]] to freeze. Even some poorly protected indoor [[plumbing]] may rupture as frozen water expands within them, causing property damage. Fires, paradoxically, become more hazardous during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making [[firefighting]] more difficult.&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;

Cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth. This results in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be [[harvest]]ed economically. Such cold waves have caused [[famine]]s. Cold waves can also cause soil particles to harden and freeze, making it harder for plants and vegetation to grow within these areas. One extreme was the so-called [[Year Without a Summer]] of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after [[volcanic eruption]]s reduced incoming sunlight.

=== Heat stress ===
In the [[PNAS]], Steven C. Sherwood and Matthew Huber state that humans and other mammals cannot tolerate a [[wet-bulb temperature]] of over 35&amp;nbsp;°C for extended periods, and that this "would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7&amp;nbsp;°C ... With 11–12&amp;nbsp;°C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12&amp;nbsp;°C are possible from fossil fuel burning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Hurricane modeling has produced similar results, finding that hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions, are more intense than under present-day conditions. [[Thomas Knutson]] and Robert E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14878">'''Geomagnetically induced currents''' ('''GIC'''), affecting the normal operation of long [[electrical conductor]] systems, are a manifestation at ground level of [[space weather]]. During space weather events, electric currents in the [[magnetosphere]] and [[ionosphere]] experience large variations, which manifest also in the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. These variations [[electric induction|induce]] currents (GIC) in conductors operated on the surface of Earth. [[Electric power transmission|Electric transmission grids]] and buried [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] are common examples of such conductor systems. GIC can cause problems, such as increased [[corrosion]] of pipeline [[steel]] and damaged high-voltage power [[transformer]]s. GIC are one possible consequence of [[geomagnetic storms]], which may also affect [[Geophysical survey|geophysical exploration surveys]] and [[Oil well|oil]] and gas drilling operations.

==Background==
The Earth's magnetic field varies over a wide range of timescales. The longer-term variations, typically occurring over decades to millennia, are predominantly the result of dynamo action in the Earth's core. Geomagnetic variations on timescales of seconds to years also occur, due to dynamic processes in the [[ionosphere]], [[magnetosphere]] and [[heliosphere]]. These changes are ultimately tied to variations associated with the [[solar cycle|solar activity (or sunspot) cycle]] and are manifestations of space weather.

The fact that the geomagnetic field does respond to solar conditions can be useful, for example, in investigating Earth structure using [[magnetotellurics]], but it also creates a hazard. This geomagnetic hazard is primarily a risk to technology under the Earth's protective atmospheric blanket.&lt;ref&gt;For recent reviews see, ''e.g.'', Lanzerotti, 2001; Pirjola et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk to infrastructure==
[[Image:GIC generation.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The basic principle for the generation of GIC: variations of the ionospheric currents (I(t)) generate an electric field (E(t)) driving GIC. Shown are also real GIC recordings from the Finnish natural gas pipeline.]]

A time-varying magnetic field external to the Earth induces [[telluric current]]s—electric currents in the conducting ground. These currents create a secondary (internal) magnetic field. As a consequence of [[Faraday's law of induction]], an electric field at the surface of the Earth is induced associated with time variations of the magnetic field. The surface electric field causes electrical currents, known as geomagnetically induced currents (GIC), to flow in any conducting structure, for example, a power or pipeline grid grounded in the Earth. This electric field, measured in V/km, acts as a voltage source across networks.

Examples of conducting networks are electrical power transmission grids, oil and gas pipelines, non-fiber optic undersea communication cables, non-fiber optic telephone and telegraph networks and railways. GIC are often described as being quasi [[direct current]] (DC), although the variation frequency of GIC is governed by the time variation of the electric field. For GIC to be a hazard to technology, the current has to be of a magnitude and occurrence frequency that makes the equipment susceptible to either immediate or cumulative damage. The size of the GIC in any network is governed by the electrical properties and the topology of the network. The largest magnetospheric-ionospheric current variations, resulting in the largest external magnetic field variations, occur during geomagnetic storms and it is then that the largest GIC occur. Significant variation periods are typically from seconds to about an hour, so the induction process involves the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[lithosphere]]. Since the largest magnetic field variations are observed at higher magnetic latitudes, GIC have been regularly measured in Canadian, Finnish and Scandinavian power grids and pipelines since the 1970s. GIC of tens to hundreds of [[ampere]]s have been recorded. GIC have also been recorded  at mid-latitudes during major storms. There may even be a risk to low latitude areas, especially during a storm commencing suddenly because of the high, short-period rate of change of the field that occurs on the day side of the Earth.

GIC were first observed on the emerging [[electric telegraph]] network in 1847–8 during [[Solar cycle 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=[[Imperial College Press]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological change and the growth of conducting networks have made the significance of GIC greater in modern society. The technical considerations for undersea cables, telephone and telegraph networks and railways are similar. Fewer problems have been reported in the open literature, about these systems. This suggests that the hazard is less today, or that there are reliable methods of equipment protection.

==In power grids==
Modern [[Electric power transmission|electric power transmission systems]] consist of generating plants inter-connected by electrical circuits that operate at fixed transmission voltages controlled at substations. The grid voltages employed are largely dependent on the path length between these substations and 200-700 kV system voltages are common. There is a trend towards higher voltages and lower line resistances to reduce transmission losses over longer and longer path lengths. Low line resistances produce a situation favourable to the flow of GIC. [[Transformer|Power transformers]] have a magnetic circuit that is disrupted by the quasi-DC GIC: the field produced by the GIC offsets the operating point of the magnetic circuit and the transformer may go into half-cycle [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. This produces [[harmonics]] to the AC waveform, localised heating and leads to high [[reactive power]] demands, inefficient power transmission and possible mis-operation of protective measures. Balancing the network in such situations requires significant additional reactive power capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Erinmez et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The magnitude of GIC that will cause significant problems to transformers varies with transformer type. Modern industry practice is to specify GIC tolerance levels on new transformers.

On 13 March 1989, [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|a severe geomagnetic storm]] caused the collapse of the [[Hydro-Québec power grid]] in a matter of seconds as equipment [[protective relay]]s tripped in a cascading sequence of events.&lt;ref&gt;Bolduc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Six million people were left without power for nine hours, with significant economic loss. Since 1989, power companies in North America, the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, and elsewhere have invested in evaluating the GIC risk and in developing mitigation strategies.

GIC risk can, to some extent, be reduced by capacitor blocking systems, maintenance schedule changes, additional on-demand generating capacity, and ultimately, load shedding. These options are expensive and sometimes impractical. The continued growth of high voltage power networks results in higher risk. This is partly due to the increase in the interconnectedness at higher voltages, connections in terms of power transmission to grids in the auroral zone, and grids operating closer to capacity than in the past.

To understand the flow of GIC in power grids and to advise on GIC risk, analysis of the quasi-DC properties of the grid is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Lehtinen and Pirjola, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  This must be coupled with a geophysical model of the Earth that provides the driving surface electric field, determined by combining time-varying ionospheric source fields and a conductivity model of the Earth. Such analyses have been performed for North America, the UK and in Northern Europe. The complexity of power grids, the source ionospheric current systems and the 3D ground conductivity make an accurate analysis difficult.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomson et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  By being able to analyze major storms and their consequences we can build a picture of the weak spots in a transmission system and run hypothetical event scenarios.

Grid management is also aided by space weather forecasts of major geomagnetic storms. This allows for mitigation strategies to be implemented. Solar observations provide a one- to three-day warning of an Earthbound [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME), depending on CME speed. Following this, detection of the [[solar wind]] shock that precedes the CME in the solar wind, by spacecraft at the {{L1}} [[Lagrangian point]], gives a definite 20 to 60 minutes warning of a geomagnetic storm (again depending on local solar wind speed). It takes approximately two to three days after a CME launches from the Sun for a geomagnetic storm to reach Earth and to affect the Earth‘s geomagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;(NERC, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==GIC hazard in pipelines==
[[Image:GIC cathodic protec.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Schematic illustration of the cathodic protection system used to protect pipeline from corrosion.]]

Major pipeline networks exist at all latitudes and many systems are on a continental scale. Pipeline networks are constructed from steel to contain high-pressure liquid or gas and have corrosion resistant coatings. Weathering and other damage to the pipeline coating can result in the steel being exposed to moist air or to the ground, causing localised corrosion problems. [[Cathodic protection]] is used to minimise corrosion by maintaining the steel at a negative potential with respect to the ground. The operating potential is determined from the electro-chemical properties of the soil and Earth in the vicinity of the pipeline. The GIC hazard to pipelines is that GIC cause swings in the pipe-to-soil potential, increasing the rate of corrosion during major geomagnetic storms (Gummow, 2002). GIC risk is not a risk of catastrophic failure, but a reduced service life of the pipeline.

Pipeline networks are modeled in a similar manner to power grids, for example through distributed source transmission line models that provide the pipe-to-soil potential at any point along the pipe (Boteler, 1997; Pulkkinen et al., 2001). These models need to consider complicated pipeline topologies, including bends and branches, as well as electrical insulators (or flanges) that electrically isolate different sections. From a detailed knowledge of the pipeline response to GIC, pipeline engineers can understand the behaviour of the cathodic protection system even during a geomagnetic storm, when pipeline surveying and maintenance may be suspended.

'''Girish Sant''' was a noted energy analyst held in high esteem as an energy policy commentator from India. He co-founded the non-governmental organisation Prayas in Pune, India. His analytical inputs helped shape India's energy policy over the decades of the 1990s and 2000s. He was considered an effective team builder and mentored several energy researchers and activists.

== Formative years==
Girish spent his childhood in [[Thane]], and joined [[IIT Bombay|IIT Mumbai]] in 1982 for BTech in [[Chemical engineering]]. After completing BTech in 1986, he also completed Masters in Energy Systems in 1988 from IIT.

Girish's years in [[IIT Bombay|IIT Mumbai]] brought out his leadership, team building and [[mountaineering]] skills. He was an accomplished mountaineer and rock climber, and made important [[rock climbing]] ascents with fellow mountaineers including the first ever climb of the [[Harishchandragad#Konkan Kada (Konkan cliff)|Konkan Kada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girish Sant|url=http://ajayshahblog.blogspot.in/2012/02/girish-sant.html|publisher=Ajay Shah|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member of the IIT Mountaineering Club and also the Institute Mountaineering Secretary during 1985–86.

During his stay at IIT, particularly during his Masters study, Girish started thinking about full-time work in a field of direct social relevance along with friends – Ajit Gaunekar and Aniruddha Ketkar. He started interacting with Subodh Wagle, then research fellow at Center for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas, with whom he explored [[appropriate technologies]], rural society and related developmental paradigms.&lt;ref name="smriti"&gt;{{cite book|title=Girish Sant-Always Two Steps Ahead|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/images/stories/Pub_Pictures/Event/Girish%20Sant%20-%20Always%20Two%20Steps%20Ahead.pdf|publisher=Prayas|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entry to the energy sector==
By 1988, when Girish completed Masters in [[Electric power system|energy systems]], he developed a clear idea that he wanted to work for the betterment of society and not for personal prosperity, using his professional skills on issues related to energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Girish Sant|url=http://www.epw.in/commentary/girish-sant.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XLVII|issue=10|date=10 March 2012|author=Prayas Energy Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relocated to Pune and initially worked as a lecturer in an engineering college, undertook sporadic energy audit and industrial consultancy projects and then worked at [[Systems Research Institute (India)|Systems Research Institute]]. This was a period of exploration along with other like-minded friends – Shripad Dharmadhikary, Sanjeevani and Vinay Kulkarni – that brought him closer to people's movements, particularly the [[Narmada Bachao Andolan|NBA]].

During this period he came across the Development Focused End Use Oriented (DEFENDUS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Paradigm|first=Amulya|last=Reddy|url=http://www.amulya-reddy.org.in/Publ_421_E_EP.htm|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; approach to power sector planning developed by Prof. Amulya Kumar N. Reddy. Subsequent interactions with Prof. Reddy shaped his thinking and work in the energy sector in the early period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Critique of DEFENDUS|url=http://www.epw.in/discussion/critique-defendus.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XXVII|issue=41|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shripad Dharmadhikari |date=10 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Girish started working with Shantanu Dixit who continued to be his colleague for the rest of his life. Analytical motivation from DEFENDUS, along with the support of friends and a scholarship from [[Ashok Gadgil|Dr. Ashok Gadgil]], led to his first major work on development of a least cost plan for Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Least-Cost Power Planning: Case Study of Maharashtra State|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/89-least-cost-power-planning-case-study-of-maharashtra-state.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the least cost plan, its dissemination to various quarters and subsequent responses from power sector actors and activists contributed to his understanding of the energy sector and the broader political economy and institutional dynamics of the sector in India.

This was also the time of reforms for the power sector in India, which witnessed entry of projects such as [[Dabhol Power Station|Dabhol Power Company]] built by [[Enron]]. Girish, Subodh and Shantanu were able to see the long term implications of such projects and reforms for the Indian power sector and economy at large. Realising the need to de-mystify such complex projects and to highlight their implications for people of the state and the country, they worked relentlessly to unravel the complex [[power purchase agreement]] of Enron and communicate the devastating impact of the project to activists and the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=The Enron Controversy: Techno-Economic Analysis and Policy Implications|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/91-the-enron-controversy-techno-economic-analysis-and-policy-implications.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |author3=Subodh Wagle |date=September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dabhol Project PPA-Structure and Techno-Economic Implications|url=http://www.epw.in/special-articles/dabhol-project-ppa-structure-and-techno-economic-implications.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XXX|issue=24|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |author3=Subodh Wagle |date=17 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Power Purchase Agreement|title=Power Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXNADUzQL_8C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4|first=Abhay|last=Mehta|publisher=Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early experiences shaped his vision for the power sector as well as his strategic and substantive approach to work in the energy sector.

== Formation of prayas, institution building and approach to policy analysis==
[[File:Girish Sant 2002.jpg|thumb|Girish Sant at New Rajendra Nagar in New Delhi, January 2002]]

In 1994, his work in the energy sector evolved into the formation of Prayas, Initiatives in Health, Energy, Learning and Parenthood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Girish|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/about-girish.html|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Sanjeevani and Vinay Kulkarni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational History|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/health/index.php/home/about-us/organizational-history.html|publisher=Prayas, Health Group|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girish believed in and ensured teamwork and democratic working of the group. Under his leadership, the [[Prayas (Energy Group)|Energy Group within Prayas (PEG)]], which started with three people, expanded to a team of over 15 researchers from a variety of backgrounds. Girish had the ability to connect with a wide range of professionals, which attracted senior researchers as well as young engineers to join Prayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/prayas-energy-group/people.html|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girish was particular about encouraging intellectual and substantive growth of colleagues, and supported new initiatives in the form of Resources and Livelihoods group of Prayas as well as academic interests of young researchers. Girish paid meticulous attention to the internal processes within Prayas and ensured that proper procedures were followed. Many peers and friends of Girish consider his institution building abilities as important a contribution and achievement as his substantive work in the energy sector.&lt;ref name="tributes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tributes|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/tributes.html|publisher=Prayas, Energy Group|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girish assisted the likes of Sucheta Dalal, then a columnist in the Times of India, in understanding the controversial [[Dabhol Power Company|Dabhol power project]] and the [[Enron scandal|Enron India scam]] that they unearthed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girish Sant memorial lecture 2015|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=Prayas (Energy group)|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Girish emphasised the need to be agile and to undertake strategic interventions in the sector. High quality and in-depth analysis, comprehensive approach, and prioritising interests of disadvantaged sections became the hallmark of his work and he successfully cultivated these principles across PEG. He believed that improving governance in infrastructure sectors like energy has the dual advantage of improving lives of the poor as well as saving public money that can then be spent on other services such as education. He successfully motivated and actively supported many young researchers to take up the task of policy advocacy in the energy sector based on public interest analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=मी-आम्ही-आमचॅ काम अजुन चालतॊचि वाट...|journal=Mauj|language=Marathi|first=Girish|last=Sant|date=November 2004|publisher=Mauj Prakashan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=E. A. S. Sarma|title=Economic Development and Energy Planning-The Myths and the Realities|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRy6ns2uzSo|medium=Public Lecture|publisher=Girish Sant Memorial Committee|location=Pune, India|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of several accomplishments and achieving an important stature in the energy sector in India, Girish remained humble and self-effacing, as is reflected in many of the tributes on his memorial webpage and in the Smriti Grantha (or Collection of Memoirs). He was mild mannered and soft-spoken, even when trying to convince someone holding a contrary opinion. This quality endeared him to many in the sector resulting in increased impact.&lt;ref name="smriti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tributes" /&gt;

== Interventions in the electricity sector==
Girish was known in the energy sector for his use of high quality analysis to expose inadequacies of conventional planning and projects that result out of such a process. Under his guidance, PEG undertook techno-economic analysis of three large [[hydro-electric]] projects, Sardar Sarovar and Maheshwar in India and Bujagali in Uganda. The group analysed Sardar Sarovar and Maheshwar projects and highlighted inefficiencies therein, proposing several techno-economically feasible and socially desirable alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Towards an Efficient and Low Cost Power Sector|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/100.html|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |publisher=Prayas|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station]] brought out inflated capital costs and one-sided nature of the power purchase agreement and led to renegotiation of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=The Bujagali Power Purchase Agreement – an Independent Review|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/115.html|publisher=Prayas|date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rethinking Bujagali|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/rethinking-bujagali-3338|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave of independent power producers in the 1990s was followed by State Electricity Board (SEB) reforms supported by the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], starting from Orissa in 1996. Under these reforms unbundling the SEB into generation, transmission and distribution companies, setting up a regulatory commission and gradually privatising the distribution was presented as the solution to all problems in power sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Report on Infrastructural Development|chapter=Power|url=http://indiaimage.nic.in/pmcouncils/reports/infra/ichap3.htm|publisher=Prime Minister's Council on Trade and Industry|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEG was the first to prepare a public interest critique of the Orissa model of reforms in 1998 and the role of Multi-lateral Development Banks, arguing that democratising governance is the key to addressing the power sector crisis, rather than focusing only on infusing capital or changing ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=WB-Orissa Model of Power Sector Reform-Cure Worse Than Disease|url=http://www.epw.in/commentary/wb-orissa-model-power-sector-reform-cure-worse-disease.html|publisher=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XXXIII|issue=17|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |author3=Subodh Wagle |date=25 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Power Sector Restructuring: Challenges, Lessons, and Suggestions|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/97.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |author3=Subodh Wagle |date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Accountability: The Real Crisis in the Power Sector Left Unaddressed|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/98.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |author3=Subodh Wagle |date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Regaining Rationality through Democratisation: A Critical Review of Multilateral Development Banks’ (MDBs’) Power Sector Activities in India|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/103.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Shantanu Dixit |author3=Subodh Wagle |date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEG realised that the fight against unjust, inefficient projects needs to be started at the macro-level planning stage itself. Experience of disseminating least cost plan and struggle against Enron project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Godbole Committee on Enron Project|url=http://www.epw.in/special-articles/godbole-committee-enron-project.html|publisher=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XXXVI|issue=23|author=Prayas Energy Group|date=9 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the influence of political economy on decision making and underscored the need for improving governance through enhanced transparency, accountability and participation (TAP) in the energy sector decision making. These insights have since guided the group's work in the energy sector and led to the group undertaking early interventions in improving the newly emerging independent regulatory commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Regulation: Case Study of Power Sector Privatisation in India|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/96.html|author=Prayas|series=World Bank-NGO Consultation on Privatization|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girish provided strategic guidance on the initial idea of bringing together a transnational network of civil society groups, called the Electricity Governance Initiative, that would work together to advance the principles of transparent, inclusive and accountable governance of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Girish Sant|url=http://electricitygovernance.wri.org/news/2012/02/remembering-girish-sant|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girish was keen that analysis is followed by actual interventions aimed at pro-people changes. Accordingly, PEG actively engaged with several state as well as central regulatory commissions, with the aim of making [[Regulatory Processes|regulatory process]] more transparent, accountable, participatory and helped serve the public interest more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter|subject=Second Tariff Revision Proposal by MSEB|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/110.html|last=Prayas|first=Energy Group|recipient=MERC|date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to enactment of Electricity Act 2003, PEG was actively involved in giving inputs to national policies such as National Electricity Policy, Tariff Policy and Competitive Bidding Guidelines. This analysis of the Indian power sector and its role in the regulatory process was acknowledged by many in the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Preface|title=Governing Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4-GRtXOTrcC&amp;pg=PP21&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3|author=S L Rao|publisher=TERI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work beyond the electricity sector==
[[File:Girish Sant 2011.png|thumb|Girish Sant at a UN Climate Change Workshop, 2011]]Since 2006, Girish focused more on macro issues of resource availability, utilisation, and growing importance of global climate debate on India's energy policy. In 2009, he co-authored a report, 'An Overview of India's Energy Trends', highlighting important differences in energy production and [[Energy consumption|consumption]] trends of India, US, European Union and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=An overview of Indian Energy Trends: Low Carbon Growth and Development Challenges|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/74-an-overview-of-indian-energy-trends-low-carbon-growth-and-development-challenges.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Girish Sant |author2=Narasimha Rao |author3=Sudhir Chella Rajan |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this work, he was invited to make presentations at high level meetings at [[COP15]] at [[Copenhagen]] and at [[The Center for Clean Air Policy]], Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Pre-Copenhagen Interview at the Center for Clean Air Policy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e6VPqBzjOY|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was India's representative at a UN workshop on non-Annex 1 [[Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action|NAMA]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/110403_AWG_Bangkok/templ/play.php?id_kongresssession=3466&amp;theme=unfccc |title=United Nations Climate Change Conference Pre-sessional Workshops |location=[[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] |date=3–8 April 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203034912/http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/110403_AWG_Bangkok/templ/play.php?id_kongresssession=3466&amp;theme=unfccc |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he was one of India's representatives in the [[BASIC countries|BASIC]] Expert Group (an informal energy expert group formed by BASIC governments) that worked towards developing greater understanding of energy use in BASIC countries and for evolving common approach to climate negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Equitable Access to Sustainable Development-Contribution to the body of scientific knowledge|url=http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/Basic_Experts_Paper.pdf|publisher=BASIC expert group|year=2011|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Interview with Girish in the context of Durban Climate Change Conference|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYxLKwSrHBk|date=2011|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these efforts and analysis contributed to strengthening India's position in the global discourse on climate change and energy, and also helped shape the domestic policy discourse.

On the domestic front, while welcoming the investment in renewable energy (RE), Girish suggested measures to improve effectiveness and equity in RE expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Need to Realign India's National Solar Mission|url=http://www.epw.in/special-articles/need-realign-indias-national-solar-mission.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XLV|issue=12|author1=Ranjit Deshmukh |author2=Girish Sant |author3=Ashwin Gambhir |date=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=India's Solar Mission: Procurement and Auctions|url=http://www.epw.in/commentary/indias-solar-mission-procurement-and-auctions.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=XLVI|issue=28|author1=Ashwin Gambhir |author2=Girish Sant |author3=Ranjit Deshmukh |date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in making a case for setting up a National Wind Energy Mission, which is scheduled to begin in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First National Wind Energy Mission to begin by mid-2014|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-08/news/45991703_1_wind-sector-generation-based-incentive-wind-power|agency=Times of India|date=8 January 2014|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Search for innovative solutions to vexed problems was another characteristic of Girish. This search led to a unique and novel concept for improving efficiency of commonly used domestic appliances. Though Girish and several other researchers had pointed out that energy efficiency of commonly used domestic appliances is very poor and using most efficient appliances instead of these inefficient appliances will lead to savings of thousands of MWs, a workable large scale solution to achieve this transformation was elusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Strategic Actions for Rapid Implementation of Energy Efficiency|url=http://prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/156.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Daljit Singh |author2=Girish Sant |date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girish, along with colleagues at Prayas, developed a concept called 'Super-Efficient Equipment Program – SEEP' under which nominal incentives are provided to appliance manufacturers to bring super-efficient equipment into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Development of Super Efficient Equipment Programme ( SEEP ) for Fans|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/175-development-of-super-efficient-equipment-programme-seep-for-fans.html|publisher=Prayas|author1=Daljit Singh |author2=Girish Sant |author3=Aditya Chunekar |author4=Adwait Pednekar |author5=Shantanu Dixit |date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully convinced [[Government of India]] and [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] officials of the benefits of implementing such a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=12th Plan to focus on energy conservation|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/article2400309.ece|agency=The Hindu Business Line|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this program, which will be launched in 2014{{update inline|date=December 2015}} as part of the [[12th Five Year Plan (Government of India)|12th Five Year Plan]], it is expected that over five million 'super-efficient' fans, which consume half the electricity of normal fans, will be sold in the market. This approach is also being adopted at the global level under the auspices of the [[Clean Energy Ministerial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SEEP Guidebook|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/publications/item/241-seep-guidebook-advance-draft-version.html|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girish was also part of several official committees, such as Planning Commission's working groups for 11th and 12th five-year plans, Planning Commission's Steering Committee on Energy, the Supreme Court appointed Committee on Solid Waste Disposal, and Planning Commission's Expert Group on Low Carbon Strategies for Inclusive Growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engagement in Policy Related Committees|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/contributions-recognition.html|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death==
Girish died on 2 February 2012 in New Delhi due to cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Power sector expert Sant dies of cardiac arrest|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-04/pune/31024432_1_renewable-energy-cardiac-arrest-power-sector|agency=Times of India|date=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A committee consisting of people from within and outside Prayas was formed to manage activities organised in Girish's memory and "to further his work of independent analysis and advocacy to promote public interest issues in the energy sector". These activities include an annual memorial lecture organised in Pune and a fellowship for young researchers pursuing public interest research and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial|url=http://www.prayaspune.org/peg/memorial.html|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global strategic petroleum reserves''' ('''GSPR''') refer to [[Petroleum|crude oil]] inventories (or stockpiles) held by the government of a particular country, as well as private industry, to safeguard the economy and help maintain [[national security]] during an [[energy crisis]].

According to the United States [[Energy Information Administration]], approximately {{convert|4.1|Goilbbl|m3}} of oil are held in strategic reserves, of which 1.4 billion is government-controlled. The remainder is held by private industry. In 2004 the U.S. [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] had the largest strategic reserve, with much of the remainder held by the other 27 members of the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fact Sheet on IEA Oil Stocks and Emergency Response Potential |publisher= International Energy Agency|date=2004-01-01 |url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2004/factsheetcover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-IEA countries have started work on their own strategic petroleum reserves. China has the largest of these new reserves.

Global oil consumption is in the region of {{convert|0.1|Goilbbl|m3}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;https://{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/report/global_oil.cfm|title=Short-Term Energy Outlook |publisher= U. S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|date= February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 4.1 bbl reserve is equivalent to 41 days of production. If there ever is a dramatic fall in global output, as envisaged by some [[peak oil]] analysts, the strategic petroleum reserves might be used to cover the shortfall. Covering a 50% shortfall would deplete the reserves in 82 days, although export leaders the [[Middle East]] and [[Russia|Russian]] exports represent only 22% and 6% respectively of global production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2242rank.html|title=Crude Oil - Exports |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency - The World Factbook|accessdate= 17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2241rank.html|title=Crude Oil - Production |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency - The World Factbook|accessdate= 17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Energy Agency reserves==
According to a March 2001 agreement, all 28 members of the [[International Energy Agency]] must have a strategic petroleum reserve equal to 90 days of the previous year's net oil imports for their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2002/beijing/KUOLT2.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105032856/http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2002/beijing/KUOLT2.PDF |archivedate=5 November 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120721230353/http://www.agiweb.org/gap/legis106/reauthspr.html Reauthorization of the Energy Policy &amp; Conservation Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Only net-exporter members of the IEA are exempt from this requirement. The exempt countries are [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. However, the UK and Denmark recently drew up plans to create their own strategic reserves in order to meet their legal obligations as [[European Union]] member states. This agreement was reviewed and ratified by Steven Brown in 2008.

==Forward commercial storage agreements==
To allow oil-exporting countries increased flexibility in their production quotas, there has been a progressive movement towards forward commercial storage agreements. These agreements allow petroleum to be stored within an oil-importing country. However, the reserves are technically under the control of the oil-exporting country. Such agreements enable oil-importing countries to access these commercial reserves in a timely and cost effective way.

==Emergency oil sharing agreements==
Several countries have agreements to share their stockpiles with other countries in the event of an emergency.

===The Japan, New Zealand and South Korea agreement===
In 2007, Japan announced a plan to share its strategic reserves with other countries in the region. Negotiations are under way between Japan and New Zealand for an oil-sharing deal whereby Japan sells part of its strategic reserves to New Zealand in the event of an emergency. New Zealand would be required to pay the market price for the oil, plus negotiated option fees for the amount of oil previously held for them by Japan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=49325 RIGZONE - Article Not Found&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191114/http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=49325 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea and Japan have agreed to share their oil reserves in the event of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/18/business/AS-FIN-SKorea-Japan-Oil.php South Korea, Japan agree to share oil reserves - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212201429/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/18/business/AS-FIN-SKorea-Japan-Oil.php |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United States and Israel agreement===
According to the 1975 [[Second Sinai withdrawal document]] signed by the United States and Israel, in an emergency the U.S. is obligated to make oil available for sale to Israel for a period of up to five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/MiddleEast/bg76.cfm The Iranian Oil Crisis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126173509/http://www.heritage.org/Research/MiddleEast/bg76.cfm |date=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The France, Germany, and Italy agreement===
France, Germany and Italy have an oil-sharing agreement in place that allows them to buy oil from each other in the event of an emergency.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
In 1968, the six members of the European Economic Community – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – agreed to maintain a minimum level of crude oil stocks and oil products corresponding to 65 days' worth of domestic consumption. In 1972, this obligation was raised to 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.l20.org/publications/16_rk_ES_Jacoby.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

===Kenya===
[[Kenya]] is setting up a Strategic Fuel Reserve, similar to that of cereals. The stocks would be procured by the [[National Oil Corporation of Kenya]] and stored by the [[Kenya Pipeline Company]] Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200804281577.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005154612/http://allafrica.com/stories/200804281577.html |archivedate=5 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malawi===
[[Malawi]] is considering creating a 22-day reserve of fuel, which is an expansion from the current five-day reserve. The government is planning to build storage facilities in the provinces of [[Chipoka]] and [[Mchinji]] as well as [[Kamuzu International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyasatimes.com/index.php?news=1915 Nyasa Times - Malawi breaking news, sports, showbiz, jobs, business and social networking - Malawi to increase fuel storage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211215524/http://www.nyasatimes.com/index.php?news=1915 |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
[[South Africa]] has an SPR managed by [[PetroSA]]. The main facility is the [[Saldanha Bay]] oil storage facility, which is a major transit point for oil shipping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/doing_business/economy/key_sectors/energy.htm South Africa's energy industry - SouthAfrica.info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061128224017/http://www.southafrica.info/doing_business/economy/key_sectors/energy.htm |date=28 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saldanha Bay's six in-ground concrete storage tanks give the facility a storage capacity of {{convert|45000000|oilbbl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fred.csir.co.za/www/sff/oil.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001840/http://fred.csir.co.za/www/sff/oil.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, China announced the expansion of its crude reserves into a two-part system. China's reserves would consist of a government-controlled strategic reserve complemented by mandated commercial reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.cn/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512051835/http://chinanews.cn/ |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy }}/news/2007-07-19/37721.html&lt;/ref&gt; The government-controlled reserves are being completed in three stages.

The reserves will be held at commercial refineries, Transneft facilities and state reserve facilities. The current planned size is {{convert|14665982|oilbbl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/russia-oil-reserves-idUSLDE76C0JZ20110713?rpc=401&amp;feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=rbssEnergyNews&amp;rpc=401 | work=Reuters | title=UPDATE 2-Russia to build state fuel stocks to ease shortages | date=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]] has SPRs consisting of gas, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil for 4.5 months of consumption. The reserves were created in the 1940s.

==Middle East==

===Iran===
In April 2006, the Fars News Agency reported that [[Iran]] was planning to create an SPR. The [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC) began construction of 15 crude oil storage tanks with a capacity of {{convert|10000000|oilbbl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/pdf.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002211847/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/pdf.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Iran announced plans to expand the SPR with a new facility on [[Kharg Island]] with four tanks holding {{convert|1000000|oilbbl}} each. Iran's SPR facilities are:
*[[Ahwaz]] – four storage tanks, total capacity {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3}}.
*[[Omidiyeh]] – three storage tanks, total capacity {{convert|3|Moilbbl|m3}}.
*[[Goureh]] – six storage tanks, total capacity {{convert|4|Moilbbl|m3}}.
*[[Sirri Island]] – one storage tank, total capacity {{convert|500000|oilbbl|m3}}.
*[[Bahregansar]] – one storage tank, total capacity {{convert|500000|oilbbl|m3}}.
*[[Kharg Island]] – four storage tanks, total capacity {{convert|4|Moilbbl|m3}}. (Planned facility, not operational yet.)

===Kuwait===
[[Kuwait]] has a joint stockpile located in [[South Korea]]. The deal gives South Korea first rights to purchase the oil. As of 2006, the size of the stockpile is {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoc.co.kr/ENG/sub04/sub04_1_5.jsp|title=Joint Stockpiling with Kuwait|publisher=[[Korea National Oil Corporation]]|access-date=2 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407203602/http://www.knoc.co.kr/ENG/sub04/sub04_1_5.jsp|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
As of 1975, [[Israel]] is believed to have a strategic oil reserve equal to 270 days of consumption.

===Jordan===

Jordan has strategic oil reserves equal to 60 days of consumption or {{convert|6240000|oilbbl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradeportalofindia.com/contentmgmt/Desktops2.asp?itemcode%3DI484%26compid%3Ditpo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183228/http://www.tradeportalofindia.com/contentmgmt/Desktops2.asp?itemcode=I484&amp;compid=itpo |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===United States===
{{Main|Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)}}
The [[United States]] has the world's largest reported [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] with a total capacity of 727 million barrels. If completely filled, the U.S. SPR could theoretically replace about 60 days of oil imports. The U.S. is estimated to import approximately {{convert|12000000|oilbbl/d}} of crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the facilities' maximum flow rate is limited to approximately {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} when filled to maximum capacity, declining as the reserve is emptied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/reserves/spr/spr-facts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428130222/http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/reserves/spr/spr-facts.html |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reserves are kept in salt caverns located at:
* Bryan Mound – near [[Freeport, Texas]]. Capacity of {{convert|226000000|oilbbl}}.
* Big Hill – near [[Winnie, Texas]]. Capacity of {{convert|160000000|oilbbl}}.
* West Hackberry – near [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]]. Capacity of {{convert|219000000|oilbbl}}.
* Bayou Choctaw – near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. Capacity of {{convert|72000000|oilbbl}}.
* [[Richton, Mississippi]]. A planned facility.

The U.S. also has the {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3|sing=on}} [[Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve]] to supply northeast home owners with heating oil if there is a shortage.

==Oceania==
As of 2008, [[New Zealand]] has a strategic reserve with a size of 170,000 tons or {{convert|1200000|oilbbl}}. Much of this reserve is based upon ticketed option contracts with Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which allow for guaranteed purchases of petroleum in the event of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKT20877720071227?rpc=401&amp; | work=Reuters | title=Nippon Oil sells emergency oil reserves option to NZ | date=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, [[Australia]] holds three weeks of petroleum, instead of the allotted 90 days that was agreed upon, according to the study 'Liquid Fuel Security' authored by [[Air Vice-Marshal]] John Blackburn, AO (retired).

[[File:Gregory Rift Topographical.svg|thumb|220px|Gregory Rift in East Africa]]
The '''Gregory Rift''' is the eastern branch of the [[East African Rift]] fracture system. The rift is being caused by the separation of the [[Somali plate]] from the [[Nubian plate]], driven by a [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|thermal plume]]. Although the term is sometimes used in the narrow sense of the [[Kenyan Rift]], the larger definition of the Gregory Rift is the set of faults and [[graben]]s extending southward from the [[Gulf of Aden]] through [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]] into Northern [[Tanzania]], passing over the local uplifts of the Ethiopian and Kenyan domes.{{sfn|Dawson|2008|p=2}}
Ancient fossils of early [[hominins]], the ancestors of humans, have been found in the southern part of the Gregory Rift.{{sfn|Dawson|2008|p=2}}

== Etymology ==
The Gregory Rift is named in honour of the British geologist [[John Walter Gregory]] who explored the geology of the rift in 1892-93 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/6/1/1.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Oldoinyolengai.jpg|thumb|[[Ol Doinyo Lengai]] erupting in 1966]]
The Gregory Rift lies within the [[Mozambique belt]], often considered to be the remains of an [[orogeny|orogenic system]] similar to the Himalayas. This belt runs from Ethiopia through Kenya, Tanzania and [[Mozambique]].{{sfn|Beccaluva|Bianchini|Wilson|2011|p=38}}
The rift is widest at the northern end in the [[Afar Triple Junction|Afar]] region, narrowing to a few kilometers in northern Tanzania, then splaying out in the North Tanzania Divergence.{{sfn|Dawson|2008|p=2}}
The Gregory Rift has shoulders rising over {{convert|3000|m|ft}} above sea level, {{convert|1000|m|ft}} above the inner part of the graben.{{sfn|Frisch|Meschede|2010|p=35}}
The Tanzanian portion includes [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the highest mountain in Africa, and the huge caldera of [[Ngorongoro]].{{sfn|Dawson|2008|p=2}}
This portion also contains [[Ol Doinyo Lengai]], the world's only active [[carbonatite]] volcano.{{sfn|Frisch|Meschede|2010|p=36}}

Lakes in the rift other than [[Lake Turkana]] are mostly small and shallow, some with fresh water but many being saline. The thickness of lake sediments is mostly unknown. In Lake Turkana they seem to be at most {{convert|4|km|mi}} thick, in the Baringo - Bogoria [[half-graben]] from {{convert|500|m|ft}} to {{convert|1000|m|ft}} thick and in the Afar depression up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} thick.{{sfn|Anadón|Cabrera|Kelts|1991|p=6}}

==Exploration==
[[File:Joseph Thomson.png|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]], first geologist to examine the region]]
The first geologist to explore the region was [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]], a member of an expedition in 1879&amp;ndash;1880 sponsored by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of Britain. From his observations he deduced the existence of a great fault.

Thomson returned in 1883, traveling through the rift valley in Kenya from [[Mount Longonot]] to [[Lake Baringo]]. Describing the valley around this lake he said: "Imagine if you can a trough or depression 3300 feet above sea level, and twenty miles broad, the mountains rising with very great abruptness on both sides to a height of 9000 feet". [[John Walter Gregory]] visited central Kenya in 1893 and again in 1919. His 1896 book ''The Great Rift Valley'' is considered a classic. Gregory was the first to use the term "rift valley", which he defined as "a linear valley with parallel and almost vertical sides, which has fallen owing to a series of parallel faults".{{sfn|Dawson|2008|p=3}}

In 1913 the German geologist [[Hans Reck]] made the first study of the strata in the [[Olduvai Gorge]] to the west of the Crater Highlands. He brought a large collection of mammalian fossils back to Berlin. In 1928 [[Louis Leakey]], the anthropologist, visited Berlin, where he saw that some of Reck's materials were [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Leakey began exploring Olduvai in the 1930s and collecting material that has led to the site being recognized as an important center of early [[hominin]] occupation.{{sfn|Dawson|2008|p=6}}

==Development==

Volcanism and rifting started in Kenya in the northern region of [[Turkana District|Turkana]] between 40 and 35 million years ago and then spread north and south. To the south volcanism and rifting happened together, first in other parts of northern Kenya around 30 million years ago, then around 15 million years ago in the central part of the [[Kenyan Rift]], 12 million years ago in southern Kenya and 8 million years ago in northern Tanzania.{{sfn|Beccaluva|Bianchini|Wilson|2011|pp=38-39}}
When rifting reached the [[Tanzanian Craton]], the rift split into the eastern Gregory Rift and the western [[Albertine Rift]], which are separated by the {{convert|1300|km|mi}} wide [[East African Plateau]].  Large shield volcanoes near the margins of the craton and in the adjacent Mozambique belt issued large volumes of basaltic to trachytic magmatism between five and one million years ago, with faulting around 1.2 million years ago.{{sfn|Beccaluva|Bianchini|Wilson|2011|pp=107}}
[[File:Elgeyo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Western cliffs of the Eastern Rift Valley near Iten with step faulting]]
Volcanic activity started in the central Ethiopian plateau around 30 million years ago, long before rifting began.
The first period of activity deposited flood basalts and rhyolites from {{convert|500|m|ft}} to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} thick.
Uplift of the Ethiopian plateau began around this time or soon after.
Between 30 million and 10 million years ago synrift shield volcanoes deposited from {{convert|1000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} of additional material over the Ethiopian flood basalts.
Rifting in Ethiopia began about 18 million years ago in the southwest and 11 million years ago in northern parts of the [[Main Ethiopian Rift]] as the opening of the Gregory rift caused the [[Afar Triple Junction]] to form.{{sfn|Beccaluva|Bianchini|Wilson|2011|pp=38-39}}
Volcanism from the Middle Pleistocene onward formed a chain of volcanoes along the floor of the rift throughout its length, dividing it into separate valleys.{{sfn|Anadón|Cabrera|Kelts|1991|p=5}}

There are some indications that the [[lithosphere]] may have thinned below the Gregory rift, although based on basalt geochemistry the lithosphere is at least {{convert|75|km|mi}} thick below the south of Kenya.{{sfn|Beccaluva|Bianchini|Wilson|2011|pp=108}}
The Gregory rift is oriented NS, and in the past the minimum horizontal tectonic stress direction was EW, the direction of extension. The alignment of rows of small [[Volcanic vent|vents]], [[Volcanic cone|cones]], [[Volcanic dome|domes]] and collapse pits in the [[Suswa]], [[Mount Silali|Silali]] and [[Kinangop Plateau]] regions support this theory.
However, data from oil and gas exploration wells in Kenya, vents in volcanic shields to the east of the rift at Huri Hills, Mount Marsabit and Nyambeni Hills and recent small cones at Suswa and east of the Silali caldera all indicate that the minimum horizontal stress direction has changed to NW-SE within the last half million years.{{sfn|Bosworth|Burke|Strecker|2000}}

'''Manifold vacuum''', or '''engine vacuum''' in an [[internal combustion engine]] is the difference in air pressure between the engine's [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] and [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Manifold [[vacuum]] is an effect of a [[piston]]'s movement on the [[Stroke (engine)#Induction stroke|induction stroke]] and the [[choked flow]] through a [[throttle]] in the intake manifold of an engine. It is a measure of the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an [[Automobile ancillary power|auxiliary power source]] to drive engine accessories and for the [[crankcase ventilation system]].

Manifold vacuum should not be confused with [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is an effect exploited in [[carburetor]]s to establish a pressure difference roughly proportional to mass airflow and to maintain a somewhat constant [[air/fuel ratio]]. It is also used in light airplanes to provide airflow for pneumatic gyroscopic instruments.

==Overview==
The rate of airflow through an internal combustion engine is an important factor determining the amount of power the engine generates. Most gasoline engines are controlled by limiting that flow with a [[throttle]] that restricts intake airflow, while a [[diesel engine]] is controlled by the amount of fuel supplied to the cylinder, and so has no "throttle" as such. Manifold vacuum is present in all [[naturally aspirated engine]]s that use throttles (including [[carburetor|carbureted]] and [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[gasoline engine]]s using the [[Otto cycle]] or the [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] cycle; [[diesel engine]]s do not have throttle plates).

The [[mass flow]] through the engine is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the rotation rate of the engine, the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed in a [[vehicle]] or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see [[variable displacement]]). Restricting the input flow reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of engine drag (see [[engine braking]]), as the engine must pump material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).

When the throttle is opened (in a car, the [[Car controls#Pedals|accelerator pedal]] is depressed), ambient air is free to fill the intake manifold, increasing the pressure (filling the vacuum). A [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection]] system adds fuel to the airflow in the correct proportion, providing energy to the engine. When the throttle is opened all the way, the engine's air induction system is exposed to full atmospheric pressure, and maximum airflow through the engine is achieved. In a naturally aspirated engine, output power is limited by the ambient [[barometric pressure]]. [[Supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s [[Turbocharger#Pressure increase / boost|boost]] manifold pressure above atmospheric pressure.

==Modern developments==
Modern engines use a manifold absolute pressure (abbreviated as ''MAP'') sensor to measure air pressure in the intake manifold. Manifold absolute pressure is one of a multitude of parameters used by the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) to optimize engine operation. It is important to differentiate between absolute and gauge pressure when dealing with certain applications, particularly those that experience changes in elevation during normal operation.  

Motivated by government regulations mandating reduction of fuel consumption (in the USA) or reduction of [[carbon dioxide emissions]] (in Europe), passenger cars and light trucks have been fitted with a variety of technologies (downsized engines; lockup, multi-ratio and [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive transmissions]]; [[variable valve timing]], forced induction, diesel engines, et al.) which render manifold vacuum inadequate or unavailable. Electric vacuum pumps are now commonly used for powering pneumatic accessories.

==Manifold vacuum vs. venturi vacuum==
Manifold vacuum is caused by a different phenomenon than [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is present inside [[carburetor]]s. Venturi vacuum is caused by the venturi effect which, for fixed ambient conditions (air density and temperature), depends on the total mass flow through the carburetor. In engines that use carburetors, the venturi vacuum is approximately proportional to the total mass flow through the engine (and hence the total power output). As ambient pressure (altitude, weather) or temperature change, the carburetor may need to be adjusted to maintain this relationship.

Manifold pressure may also be "ported". Porting is selecting a location for the pressure tap within the throttle plate's range of motion. Depending on throttle position, a ported pressure tap may be either upstream or downstream of the throttle. As the throttle position changes, a "ported" pressure tap is selectively connected to either manifold pressure or ambient pressure. Antique (pre-[[OBD II#OBD-II|OBD II]]) engines often used ported manifold pressure taps for [[Distributor|ignition distributors]] and [[Vehicle emissions control#Emissions control|emission-control components]].

==Manifold vacuum in cars==
Most [[automobile]]s use four-stroke [[Otto cycle]] engines with multiple [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s attached to a single [[inlet manifold]]. During the [[induction stroke]], the piston descends in the cylinder and the [[intake valve]] is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection|fuel injection system]], where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the inlet manifold from carburetor to engine.

To control the amount of fuel/air mix entering the engine, a simple [[butterfly valve]] (throttle plate) is generally fitted at the start of the intake manifold (just below the [[carburetor]] in carbureted engines). The butterfly valve is simply a circular disc fitted on a spindle, fitting inside the pipe work. It is connected to the accelerator pedal of the car, and is set to be fully open when the pedal is fully depressed and fully closed when the pedal is released. The butterfly valve often contains a small "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own idle jet.

If the engine is operating under light or no load and low or closed throttle, there is high manifold vacuum. As the throttle is opened, the engine speed increases rapidly. The engine speed is limited only by the amount of fuel/air mixture that is available in the manifold. Under full throttle and light load, other effects (such as [[valve float]], [[turbulence]] in the cylinders, or [[ignition timing]]) limit engine speed so that the manifold pressure can increase—but in practice, [[parasitic drag]] on the internal walls of the manifold, plus the restrictive nature of the venturi at the heart of the carburetor, means that a low pressure will always be set up as the engine's internal volume exceeds the amount of the air the manifold is capable of delivering.

If the engine is operating under heavy load at wide throttle openings (such as accelerating from a stop or pulling the car up a hill) then engine speed is limited by the load and minimal vacuum will be created. Engine speed is low but the butterfly valve is fully open. Since the pistons are descending more slowly than under no load, the pressure differences are less marked and parasitic drag in the induction system is negligible. The engine pulls air into the cylinders at the full ambient pressure.

More vacuum is created in some situations. On deceleration or when descending a hill, the throttle will be closed and a low gear selected to control speed. The engine will be rotating fast because the road wheels and transmission are moving quickly, but the butterfly valve will be fully closed. The flow of air through the engine is strongly restricted by the throttle, producing a strong vacuum on the engine side of the butterfly valve which will tend to limit the speed of the engine. This phenomenon, known as [[engine braking]], is used to prevent acceleration or even to slow down with minimal or no brake usage (as when descending a long or steep hill). This vacuum braking should not be confused with [[Compression release engine brake|compression braking]] (aka a "[[Jake brake]]"), or with [[exhaust brake|exhaust braking]], which are often used on large diesel trucks. Such devices are necessary for engine braking with a diesel as they lack a throttle to restrict the air flow enough to create sufficient vacuum to brake a vehicle.

===Uses of manifold vacuum===
[[File:1929-AEC-Regal-UU6646.jpg|thumb|Autovac fuel lifters. On both buses the red Autovac tank can be seen above and behind the left front wheel.]]
This low (or negative) pressure can be put to uses. A [[pressure gauge]] measuring the manifold pressure can be fitted to give the driver an indication of how hard the engine is working and it can be used to achieve maximum momentary fuel efficiency by adjusting driving habits: minimizing manifold vacuum increases momentary efficiency{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed; source with implementation preferred. Low manifold vacuum may indicate wide open throttle, not high efficiency|date=February 2016}}. A weak manifold vacuum under closed-throttle conditions shows that the butterfly valve or internal components of the engine ([[Poppet valve|valves]] or [[piston ring]]s) are worn, preventing good pumping action by the engine and reducing overall efficiency.

Vacuum is often used to [[Automobile accessory power|drive auxiliary systems]] on the vehicle. [[Vacuum servo|Vacuum-assist brake servos]], for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost [[Idiot proof|foolproof]]. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.

Prior to the introduction of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] in the USA by the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act]] of 1966, it was common to use manifold vacuum to drive [[windscreen wiper]]s with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap &amp; simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle [[HVAC]] systems also used manifold vacuum to drive actuators controlling airflow and temperature.

Another obsolete accessory is the "Autovac" fuel lifter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autovac.co.uk/ autovac.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses vacuum to raise fuel from the main tank to a small auxiliary tank, from which it flows by gravity to the carburetor. This eliminated the fuel pump which, in early cars, was an unreliable item.

===Manifold vacuum in diesel engines===
Many [[diesel engine]]s do not have butterfly valve throttles. The manifold is connected directly to the air intake and the only suction created is that caused by the descending piston with no venturi to increase it, and the engine power is controlled by varying the amount of fuel that is injected into the cylinder by a [[fuel injection]] system. This assists in making diesels much more efficient than petrol engines.

If vacuum is required (vehicles that can be fitted with both petrol and diesel engines often have systems requiring it), a butterfly valve connected to the throttle can be fitted to the manifold. This reduces efficiency and is still not as effective as it is not connected to a venturi. Since low-pressure is only created on the overrun (such as when descending hills with a closed throttle), not over a wide range of situations as in a petrol engine, a vacuum tank is fitted.

Most diesel engines now have a separate vacuum pump ("exhauster") fitted to provide vacuum at all times, at all engine speeds.

Many new [[BMW]] petrol engines do not use a throttle in normal running, but instead use "[[Valvetronic]]" variable-lift intake valves to control the amount of air entering the engine. Like a diesel engine, manifold vacuum is practically non-existent in these engines and a different source must be utilised to power the brake servo.

More generally, the surfaces of planetary bodies can be mapped even if they are too irregular to be modeled well with a sphere or ellipsoid; see [[#geoid|below]]. Even more generally, projections are a subject of several pure mathematical fields, including [[differential geometry]], [[projective geometry]], and [[manifold]]s. However, "map projection" refers specifically to a [[Cartography|cartographic]] projection.

==Background==
Maps can be more useful than [[globe]]s in many situations: they are more compact and easier to store; they readily accommodate an enormous range of scales; they are viewed easily on computer displays; they can facilitate measuring properties of the region being mapped; they can show larger portions of the Earth's surface at once; and they are cheaper to produce and transport. These useful traits of maps motivate the development of map projections.

However, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s [[Theorema Egregium]] proved that a sphere's surface cannot be represented on a plane without distortion. The same applies to other reference surfaces used as models for the Earth, such as oblate [[Spheroid|spheroids]], [[ellipsoids]] and [[Geoid|geoids]]. Since any map projection is a representation of one of those surfaces on a plane, all map projections distort. Every distinct map projection distorts in a distinct way. The study of map projections is the characterization of these distortions.

''Projection'' is not limited to [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projections, such as those resulting from casting a shadow on a screen, or the [[rectilinear projection|rectilinear]] image produced by a [[pinhole camera]] on a flat film plate. Rather, any mathematical function transforming coordinates from the curved surface to the plane is a projection. Few projections in actual use are perspective.

For simplicity, most of this article assumes that the surface to be mapped is that of a sphere. In reality, the [[Earth]] and other large [[celestial bodies]] are generally better modeled as [[oblate spheroid]]s, whereas small objects such as [[asteroid]]s often have irregular shapes. These other surfaces can be mapped as well. Therefore, more generally, a map projection is any method of "flattening" a continuous curved surface onto a plane.

==Metric properties of maps==
[[File:USGS map Albers conic tall.gif|frame|right|An [[Albers projection]] shows areas accurately, but distorts shapes.]]

Many properties can be measured on the Earth's surface independent of its geography. Some of these properties are:
* [[Area]]
* [[Shape]]
* [[Direction (geometry)|Direction]]
* [[Bearing (navigation)|Bearing]]
* [[Distance]]
* [[Scale (map)|Scale]]

Map projections can be constructed to preserve at least one of these properties, though only in a limited way for most. Each projection preserves, compromises, or approximates basic metric properties in different ways. The purpose of the map determines which projection should form the base for the map. Because many purposes exist for maps, a diversity of projections have been created to suit those purposes.

Another consideration in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the map. Data sets are geographic information; their collection depends on the chosen [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]] (model) of the Earth. Different datums assign slightly different coordinates to the same location, so in [[Scale (map)#The terminology of scales|large scale]] maps, such as those from national mapping systems, it is important to match the datum to the projection. The slight differences in coordinate assignation between different datums is not a concern for world maps or other vast territories, where such differences get shrunk to imperceptibility.

===Distortion===
{{main|Tissot's indicatrix}}

[[File:Tissot mercator.png|thumb|right|Tissot's Indicatrices on the Mercator projection]]
The classical way of showing the distortion inherent in a projection is to use Tissot's indicatrix. For a given point, using the scale factor ''h'' along the meridian, the scale factor ''k'' along the parallel, and the angle ''θ′'' between them, [[Nicolas Auguste Tissot|Nicolas Tissot]] described how to construct an ellipse that characterizes the amount and orientation of the components of distortion.&lt;ref name="SnyderFlattening"/&gt;{{rp|147–149}}&lt;ref name=SnyderManual&gt;Snyder. Working Manual, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; By spacing the ellipses regularly along the meridians and parallels, the network of indicatrices shows how distortion varies across the map.

==Construction of a map projection==
The creation of a map projection involves two steps:

# Selection of a model for the shape of the Earth or planetary body (usually choosing between a [[sphere]] or [[ellipsoid]]). Because the Earth's actual shape is irregular, information is lost in this step.
# Transformation of geographic coordinates ([[longitude]] and [[latitude]]) to [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] (''x'',''y'') or [[Polar coordinate system|polar]] plane coordinates. In large-scale maps, Cartesian coordinates normally have a simple relation to  [[Easting and northing|eastings and northings]] defined as a grid superimposed on the projection. In small-scale maps, eastings and northings are not meaningful, and grids are not superimposed.
&lt;!--# Reduction of the scale (it does not matter in what order the second and third steps are performed)--&gt;

Some of the simplest map projections are literal projections, as obtained by placing
a light source at some definite point relative to the globe and projecting its features onto a specified surface. This is not the case for most projections, which are defined '''only''' in terms of mathematical formulae that have no direct [[Geometry|geometric]] interpretation. However, picturing the light source-globe model can be helpful in understanding the basic concept of a map projection

===Choosing a projection surface===
[[File:Usgs map miller cylindrical.PNG|frame|right|A [[Miller cylindrical projection]] maps the globe onto a cylinder.]]
&lt;!-- If a surface can be transformed onto another surface without stretching, tearing, or shrinking, then the surface is said to be an '''applicable surface'''. (True, but if "applicable" is such a useful term, why isn't it used anywhere in the article, other than this definition?) --&gt;

A surface that can be unfolded or unrolled into a plane or sheet without stretching, tearing or shrinking is called a ''[[developable surface]]''. The [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[cone (geometry)|cone]] and the plane are all developable surfaces. The sphere and ellipsoid do not have developable surfaces, so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image. (To compare, one cannot flatten an orange peel without tearing and warping it.)

One way of describing a projection is first to project from the Earth's surface to a developable surface such as a cylinder or cone, and then to unroll the surface into a plane. While the first step inevitably distorts some properties of the globe, the developable surface can then be unfolded without further distortion.

===Aspect of the projection{{anchor|Aspect}}===
[[File:Usgs map traverse mercator.PNG|frame|right|This [[transverse Mercator projection]] is mathematically the same as a standard Mercator, but oriented around a different axis.]]

Once a choice is made between projecting onto a cylinder, cone, or plane, the '''aspect''' of the shape must be specified. The aspect describes how the developable surface  is placed relative to the globe: it may be  ''normal'' (such that the surface's axis of symmetry coincides with the Earth's axis), ''transverse'' (at right angles to the Earth's axis) or ''oblique'' (any angle in between).

===Notable lines===&lt;!-- [[Central meridian (map projections)]] links to this section --&gt;
The developable surface may also be either ''[[tangent]]'' or ''[[secant line|secant]]'' to the sphere or ellipsoid. Tangent means the surface touches but does not slice through the globe; secant means the surface does slice through the globe. Moving the developable surface away from contact with the globe never preserves or optimizes metric properties, so that possibility is not discussed further here.

Tangent and secant lines (''standard lines'') are represented undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, it is called a ''standard parallel''. The ''central meridian'' is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting. The central meridian (usually written ''λ''{{sub|0}}) and a parallel of origin (usually written ''φ''{{sub|0}}) are often used to define the origin of the map projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale===
{{further|Map scale factor}}
A [[globe]] is the only way to represent the earth with constant [[scale (map)|scale]] throughout the entire map in all directions. A map cannot achieve that property for any area, no matter how small. It can, however, achieve constant scale along specific lines.

Some possible properties are:
* The scale depends on location, but not on direction. This is equivalent to preservation of angles, the defining characteristic of a [[conformal map]].
* Scale is constant along any parallel in the direction of the parallel. This applies for any cylindrical or pseudocylindrical projection in normal aspect.
* Combination of the above: the scale depends on latitude only, not on longitude or direction. This applies for the [[Mercator projection]] in normal aspect.
* Scale is constant along all straight lines radiating from a particular geographic location. This is the defining characteristic of an equidistant projection such as the [[Azimuthal equidistant projection]]. There are also projections (Maurer's [[Two-point equidistant projection]], Close) where true distances from ''two'' points are preserved.&lt;ref name="SnyderFlattening"/&gt;{{rp|234}}

===Choosing a model for the shape of the body===
Projection construction is also affected by how the shape of the Earth or planetary body is approximated. In the following section on projection categories, the earth is taken as a [[sphere]] in order to simplify the discussion. However, the Earth's actual shape is closer to an oblate [[ellipsoid]]. Whether spherical or ellipsoidal, the principles discussed hold without loss of generality.

Selecting a model for a shape of the Earth involves choosing between the advantages and disadvantages of a sphere versus an ellipsoid. Spherical models are useful for small-scale maps such as world atlases and globes, since the error at that scale is not usually noticeable or important enough to justify using the more complicated ellipsoid. The ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct [[topographic map]]s and for other large- and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface. [[Latitude#Auxiliary latitudes|Auxiliary latitudes]] are often employed in projecting the ellipsoid.

{{anchor|geoid}}A third model is the [[geoid]], a more complex and accurate representation of Earth's shape coincident with what [[mean sea level]] would be if there were no winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, [[Map projection#Conformal|conformality]] and [[Map projection#Equal-area|equivalence]]. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped [[Geographic coordinate system#Geographic latitude and longitude|graticule]] would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid's graticule. Normally the geoid is not used as an [[Earth model]] for projections, however, because Earth's shape is very regular, with the [[undulation of the geoid]] amounting to less than 100&amp;nbsp;m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;m [[Earth radius]]. For irregular planetary bodies such as [[asteroids]], however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from.&lt;ref&gt;

==Classification==
A fundamental projection classification is based on the type of projection surface onto which the globe is conceptually projected. The projections are described in terms of placing a gigantic surface in contact with the earth, followed by an implied scaling operation. These surfaces are cylindrical (e.g. [[Mercator projection|Mercator]]), conic (e.g. [[Albers projection|Albers]]), and plane (e.g. [[Stereographic projection|stereographic]]). Many mathematical projections, however, do not neatly fit into any of these three conceptual projection methods. Hence other peer categories have been described in the literature, such as pseudoconic, pseudocylindrical, pseudoazimuthal, retroazimuthal, and [[Polyconic projection|polyconic]].

Another way to classify projections is according to properties of the model they preserve. Some of the more common categories are:
* Preserving direction (''azimuthal or zenithal''), a trait possible only from one or two points to every other point&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=nPdOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA192
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preserving shape locally (''[[map projection#Conformal|conformal]]'' or ''orthomorphic'')
* Preserving area (''equal-area'' or ''equiareal'' or ''equivalent'' or ''authalic'')
* Preserving distance (''equidistant''), a trait possible only between one or two points and every other point
* Preserving shortest route, a trait preserved only by the [[gnomonic projection]]
Because the sphere is not a developable surface, it is impossible to construct a map projection that is both equal-area and conformal.

==Projections by surface==

The three developable surfaces (plane, cylinder, cone) provide useful models for understanding, describing, and developing map projections. However, these models are limited in two fundamental ways. For one thing, most world projections in use do not fall into any of those categories. For another thing, even most projections that do fall into those categories are not naturally attainable through physical projection. As L.P. Lee notes,

{{quote|No reference has been made in the above definitions to cylinders, cones or planes. The projections are termed cylindric or conic because they can be regarded as developed on a cylinder or a cone, as the case may be, but it is as well to dispense with picturing cylinders and cones, since they have given rise to much misunderstanding. Particularly is this so with regard to the conic projections with two standard parallels: they may be regarded as developed on cones, but they are cones which bear no simple relationship to the sphere. In reality, cylinders and cones provide us with convenient descriptive terms, but little else.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;

  }} p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lee's objection refers to the way the terms ''cylindrical'', ''conic'', and ''planar'' (azimuthal) have been abstracted in the field of map projections. If maps were projected as in light shining through a globe onto a developable surface, then the spacing of parallels would follow a very limited set of possibilities. Such a cylindrical projection (for example) is one which:
# Is rectangular;
# Has straight vertical meridians, spaced evenly;
# Has straight parallels symmetrically placed about the equator;
# Has parallels constrained to where they fall when light shines through the globe onto the cylinder, with the light source someplace along the line formed by the intersection of the prime meridian with the equator, and the center of the sphere.

(If you rotate the globe before projecting then the parallels and meridians will not necessarily still be straight lines. Rotations are normally ignored for the purpose of classification.)

Where the light source emanates along the line described in this last constraint is what yields the differences between the various "natural" cylindrical projections. But the term ''cylindrical'' as used in the field of map projections relaxes the last constraint entirely. Instead the parallels can be placed according to any algorithm the designer has decided suits the needs of the map. The famous Mercator projection is one in which the placement of parallels does not arise by "projection"; instead parallels are placed how they need to be in order to satisfy the property that a course of constant bearing is always plotted as a straight line.

===Cylindrical===
{{See also|List of map projections#Cylindrical}}
[[File:Usgs map mercator.svg|frame|right|The Mercator projection shows [[rhumbs]] as straight lines. A rhumb is a course of constant bearing. Bearing is the compass direction of movement.]]
&lt;!-- use this somewhere else later: [[File:Usgs map space oblique mercator.PNG|frame|right|The [[space-oblique Mercator projection]] was developed by the [[USGS]] for use in [[Landsat]] images.]] --&gt;

A "normal cylindrical projection" is any projection in which [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] are mapped to equally spaced vertical lines and [[circles of latitude]] (parallels) are mapped to horizontal lines.&lt;!-- (or, [[mutatis mutandis]], more generally, radial lines from a fixed point are mapped to equally spaced parallel lines and concentric circles around it are mapped to perpendicular lines). --&gt;

The mapping of meridians to vertical lines can be visualized by imagining a cylinder whose axis coincides with the Earth's axis of rotation. This cylinder is wrapped around the Earth, projected onto, and then unrolled.

By the geometry of their construction, cylindrical projections stretch distances east-west. The amount of stretch is the same at any chosen latitude on all cylindrical projections, and is given by the [[Trigonometric function|secant]] of the [[latitude]] as a multiple of the equator's scale. The various cylindrical projections are distinguished from each other solely by their north-south stretching (where latitude is given by φ):
* North-south stretching equals east-west stretching ([[Secant (trigonometry)|sec]] ''φ''): The east-west scale matches the north-south scale: conformal cylindrical or [[Mercator projection|Mercator]]; this distorts areas excessively in high latitudes (see also [[Transverse Mercator projection|transverse Mercator]]).
* North-south stretching grows with latitude  faster than east-west stretching (sec{{sup|2}} ''φ''): The cylindric perspective (or [[central cylindrical projection|central cylindrical]]) projection; unsuitable because distortion is even worse than in the Mercator projection.
* North-south stretching grows with latitude, but less quickly than the east-west stretching: such as the [[Miller cylindrical projection]] (sec {{sfrac|4|5}}''φ'').
* North-south distances neither stretched nor compressed (1): [[equirectangular projection]] or "plate carrée".
* North-south compression equals the cosine of the latitude (the reciprocal of east-west stretching): [[cylindrical equal-area projection|equal-area cylindrical]].  This projection has many named specializations differing only in the scaling constant, such as the [[Gall–Peters projection|Gall–Peters]] or Gall orthographic (undistorted at the 45° parallels), [[Behrmann projection|Behrmann]] (undistorted at the 30° parallels), and [[Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection|Lambert cylindrical equal-area]] (undistorted at the equator). Since this projection scales north-south distances by the reciprocal of east-west stretching, it preserves area at the expense of shapes.

In the first case (Mercator), the east-west scale always equals the north-south scale. In the second case (central cylindrical), the north-south scale exceeds the east-west scale everywhere away from the equator. Each remaining case has a pair of [[secant line]]s—a pair of identical latitudes of opposite sign (or else the equator) at which the east-west scale matches the north-south-scale.

Normal cylindrical projections map the whole Earth as a finite rectangle, except in the first two cases, where the rectangle stretches infinitely tall while retaining constant width.

===Pseudocylindrical===
{{See also|List of map projections#pseudocylindrical}}
[[File:Usgs map sinousidal equal area.PNG|right|frame|A sinusoidal projection shows relative sizes accurately, but grossly distorts shapes. Distortion can be reduced by "interrupting" the map.]]

Pseudocylindrical projections represent the ''central'' [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] as a straight line segment. Other meridians are longer than the central meridian and bow outward, away from the central meridian. Pseudocylindrical projections map [[circle of latitude|parallels]] as straight lines. Along parallels, each point from the surface is mapped at a distance from the central meridian that is proportional to its difference in longitude from the central meridian. Therefore, meridians are equally spaced along a given parallel. On a pseudocylindrical map, any point further from the equator than some other point has a higher latitude than the other point, preserving north-south relationships. This trait is useful when illustrating phenomena that depend on latitude, such as climate. Examples of pseudocylindrical projections include:
* [[Sinusoidal projection|Sinusoidal]], which was the first pseudocylindrical projection developed. On the map, as in reality, the length of each parallel is proportional to the cosine of the latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname= SinusoidalProjection | title= Sinusoidal Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of any region is true.
* [[Collignon projection]], which in its most common forms represents each meridian as two straight line segments, one from each pole to the equator.

===Hybrid===
The [[HEALPix]] projection combines an equal-area cylindrical projection in equatorial regions with the [[Collignon projection]] in polar areas.

===Conic===
[[File:USGS map Albers conic tall.gif|frame|right|Albers conic.]]

The term "conic projection" is used to refer to any projection in which [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] are mapped to equally spaced lines radiating out from the apex and [[circles of latitude]] (parallels) are mapped to circular arcs centered on the apex.&lt;ref&gt;
Carlos A. Furuti.
[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjCon/projCon.html "Conic Projections"]
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (or, [[mutatis mutandis]], more generally, radial lines from a fixed point are mapped to equally spaced radial lines and concentric circles around it are mapped to circular arcs). --&gt;

When making a conic map, the map maker arbitrarily picks two standard parallels.  Those standard parallels may be visualized as [[secant line]]s where the cone intersects the globe—or, if the map maker chooses the same parallel twice, as the tangent line where the cone is tangent to the globe.  The resulting conic map has low distortion in scale, shape, and area near those standard parallels.  Distances along the parallels to the north of both standard parallels or to the south of both standard parallels are stretched; distances along parallels between the standard parallels are compressed.  When a single standard parallel is used, distances along all other parallels are stretched.

Conic projections that are commonly used are:
* [[Equidistant conic projection|Equidistant conic]], which keeps parallels evenly spaced along the meridians to preserve a constant distance scale along each meridian, typically the same or similar scale as along the standard parallels.
* [[Albers conic projection|Albers conic]], which adjusts the north-south distance between non-standard parallels to compensate for the east-west stretching or compression, giving an equal-area map.
* [[Lambert conformal conic projection|Lambert conformal conic]], which adjusts the north-south distance between non-standard parallels to equal the east-west stretching, giving a conformal map.

===Pseudoconic===
* [[Bonne projection|Bonne]], an equal-area projection on which most meridians and parallels appear as curved lines. It has a configurable standard parallel along which there is no distortion.
* [[Werner projection|Werner cordiform]], upon which distances are correct from one pole, as well as along all parallels.
* [[Polyconic projection|American polyconic]]

===Azimuthal (projections onto a plane)===
{{See also|List of map projections#azimuthal}}
[[File:Usgs map azimuthal equidistant.PNG|frame|right|An azimuthal equidistant projection shows distances and directions accurately from the center point, but distorts shapes and sizes elsewhere.]]

[[Azimuth]]al projections have the property that directions from a central point are preserved and therefore [[great circle]]s through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map. These projections also have radial symmetry in the scales and hence in the distortions: map distances from the central point are computed by a function ''r''(''d'') of the true distance ''d'', independent of the angle; correspondingly, circles with the central point as center are mapped into circles which have as center the central point on the map.

The mapping of radial lines can be visualized by imagining a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[tangent]] to the Earth, with the central point as tangent point.

The radial scale is ''r′''(''d'') and the transverse scale ''r''(''d'')/(''R''&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''d''|''R''}}) where ''R'' is the radius of the Earth.

Some azimuthal projections are true [[perspective projection]]s; that is, they can be constructed mechanically, projecting the surface of the Earth by extending lines from a [[point of perspective]] (along an infinite line through the tangent point and the tangent point's [[antipodal point|antipode]]) onto the plane:

* The [[General Perspective projection]] can be constructed by using a point of perspective outside the earth. Photographs of Earth (such as those from the [[International Space Station]]) give this perspective.
* The [[Orthographic projection (cartography)|orthographic projection]] maps each point on the earth to the closest point on the plane. Can be constructed from a point of perspective an infinite distance from the tangent point; ''r''(''d'') = ''c''&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''d''|''R''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname= OrthographicProjection | title= Orthographic Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Can display up to a hemisphere on a finite circle. Photographs of Earth from far enough away, such as the [[Moon]], approximate this perspective.
* The [[stereographic projection]], which is conformal, can be constructed by using the tangent point's [[antipodal point|antipode]] as the point of perspective.  ''r''(''d'') = ''c''&amp;nbsp;tan&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''d''|2''R''}}; the scale is ''c''/(2''R''&amp;nbsp;cos{{sup|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''d''|2''R''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname= StereographicProjection | title= Stereographic Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Can display nearly the entire sphere's surface on a finite circle. The sphere's full surface requires an infinite map.

Other azimuthal projections are not true [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] projections:
* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Azimuthal equidistant]]: ''r''(''d'') = ''cd''; it is used by [[amateur radio]] operators to know the direction to point their antennas toward a point and see the distance to it. Distance from the tangent point on the map is proportional to surface distance on the earth (;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname= AzimuthalEquidistantProjection | title= Azimuthal Equidistant Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the case where the tangent point is the North Pole, see the [[flag of the United Nations]])
* [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert azimuthal equal-area]]. Distance from the tangent point on the map is proportional to straight-line distance through the earth: ''r''(''d'') = ''c''&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''d''|2''R''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname= LambertAzimuthalEqual-AreaProjection | title= Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Logarithmic azimuthal projection|Logarithmic azimuthal]] is constructed so that each point's distance from the center of the map is the logarithm of its distance from the tangent point on the Earth. ''r''(''d'') = ''c''&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''d''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}); locations closer than at a distance equal to the constant ''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are not shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Projections by preservation of a metric property==
[[File:Usgs map stereographic.PNG|frame|right|A [[stereographic projection]] is conformal and perspective but not equal area or equidistant.]]

===Conformal===
{{Main|Conformal map projection}}
[[Conformal map|Conformal]], or orthomorphic, map projections preserve angles locally, implying that they map infinitesimal circles of constant size anywhere on the Earth to infinitesimal circles of varying sizes on the map. In contrast, mappings that are not conformal distort most such small circles into [[Tissot's indicatrix|ellipses of distortion]]. An important consequence of conformality
is that relative angles at each point of the map are correct, and the local scale (although varying throughout the map) in every direction around any one point is constant. These are some conformal projections:
* [[Mercator projection|Mercator]]: [[Rhumb line]]s are represented by straight segments
* [[Transverse Mercator projection|Transverse Mercator]]
* [[Stereographic projection|Stereographic]]: Any [[circle of a sphere]], great and small, maps to a circle or straight line.
* [[Roussilhe oblique stereographic projection|Roussilhe]]
* [[Lambert conformal conic projection|Lambert conformal conic]]
* [[Peirce quincuncial projection]]
* [[Adams hemisphere-in-a-square projection]]
* [[Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection]]

===Equal-area===&lt;!-- [[Equiareal]] links to here --&gt;
{{Redirect|Area preserving maps|the mathematical concept|Measure-preserving dynamical system}}
[[File:Mollweide projection SW.jpg|thumb|300px| The equal-area [[Mollweide projection]]]]

Equal-area maps preserve area measure, generally distorting shapes in order to do that. Equal-area maps are also called ''equivalent'' or ''authalic''. These are some projections that preserve area:

{{div col|colwidth=25em}}
* [[Albers conic projection|Albers conic]]
* [[Bonne projection|Bonne]]
* [[Bottomley projection|Bottomley]]
* [[Collignon projection|Collignon]]
* [[Cylindrical equal-area projection|Cylindrical equal-area]]
* [[Eckert II projection|Eckert II]], [[Eckert IV projection|IV]] and [[Eckert VI projection|VI]]
* [[Equal Earth projection|Equal Earth]]
* [[Gall–Peters projection|Gall orthographic]] (also known as Gall–Peters, or Peters, projection)
* [[Goode homolosine projection|Goode's homolosine]]
* [[Hammer projection|Hammer]]
* [[Hobo–Dyer projection|Hobo–Dyer]]
* [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert azimuthal equal-area]]
* [[Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection|Lambert cylindrical equal-area]]
* [[Mollweide projection|Mollweide]]
* [[Sinusoidal projection|Sinusoidal]]
* [[Strebe 1995 projection|Strebe 1995]]
* Snyder’s equal-area polyhedral projection, used for [[geodesic grid]]s.
* [[Tobler hyperelliptical projection|Tobler hyperelliptical]]
* [[Werner projection|Werner]]
{{div col end}}

===Equidistant===
[[File:Two-point equidistant projection SW.jpg|thumb|right|A [[two-point equidistant projection]] of Eurasia]]

These are some projections that preserve distance from some standard point or line:
* [[Equirectangular projection|Equirectangular]]—distances along meridians are conserved
* [[Plate carrée projection|Plate carrée]]—an [[Equirectangular projection]] centered at the equator
* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Azimuthal equidistant]]—distances along great circles radiating from centre are conserved
* Equidistant conic
* [[Sinusoidal projection|Sinusoidal]]—distances along parallels are conserved
* [[Werner cordiform projection|Werner cordiform]] distances from the [[North Pole]] are correct as are the curved distance on parallels
* [[Soldner projection|Soldner]]
* [[two-point equidistant projection|Two-point equidistant]]: two "control points" are arbitrarily chosen by the map maker. Distance from any point on the map to each control point is proportional to surface distance on the earth.

===Gnomonic===
[[File:Usgs map gnomic.PNG|frame|right|The [[Gnomonic projection]] is thought to be the oldest map projection, developed by [[Thales]] in the 6th century BC]]

[[Great circle]]s are displayed as straight lines:
* [[Gnomonic projection]]

===Retroazimuthal===
Direction to a fixed location B (the bearing at the starting location A of the shortest route) corresponds to the direction on the map from A to B:
* [[Littrow projection|Littrow]]—the only conformal retroazimuthal projection
* [[Hammer retroazimuthal projection|Hammer retroazimuthal]]—also preserves distance from the central point
* [[Craig retroazimuthal projection|Craig retroazimuthal]] ''aka'' Mecca or Qibla—also has vertical meridians

===Compromise projections===
[[File:Usgs map robinson.PNG|frame|right|The [[Robinson projection]] was adopted by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine in 1988 but abandoned by them in about 1997 for the [[Winkel tripel projection|Winkel tripel]].]]

Compromise projections give up the idea of perfectly preserving metric properties, seeking instead to strike a balance between distortions, or to simply make things "look right". Most of these types of projections distort shape in the polar regions more than at the equator. These are some compromise projections:
* [[Robinson projection|Robinson]]
* [[Van der Grinten projection|van der Grinten]]
* [[Miller cylindrical projection|Miller cylindrical]]
* [[Winkel tripel projection|Winkel Tripel]]
* [[Dymaxion map|Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion]]
* [[Bernard J. S. Cahill|B. J. S. Cahill's Butterfly Map]]
* [[Kavrayskiy VII projection]]
* [[Wagner VI projection]]
* [[Chamberlin trimetric projection|Chamberlin trimetric]]
* [[Oronce Finé]]'s cordiform

== Which projection is best? ==

The mathematics of projection do not permit any particular map projection to be "best" for everything. Something will always be distorted. Thus, many projections exist to serve the many uses of maps and their vast range of scales.  

Modern national mapping systems typically employ a [[Transverse Mercator projection|transverse Mercator]] or close variant for [[Scale (map)#Large scale, medium scale, small scale|large-scale maps]] in order to preserve [[Conformal map|conformality]] and low variation in scale over small areas. For [[Scale (map)#Large scale, medium scale, small scale|smaller-scale]] maps, such as those spanning continents or the entire world, many projections are in common use according to their fitness for the purpose, such as [[Winkel tripel projection|Winkel tripel]], [[Robinson projection|Robinson]] and [[Mollweide projection|Mollweide]].&lt;ref name="choosing"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reference maps of the world often appear on [[Map projection#Compromise projections|compromise projections]]. Due to distortions inherent in any map of the world, the choice of projection becomes largely one of aesthetics.

Thematic maps normally require an [[Map projection#Equal-area|equal area projection]] so that phenomena per unit area are shown in correct proportion.&lt;ref name="slocum"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, representing area ratios correctly necessarily distorts shapes more than many maps that are not equal-area. 

The [[Mercator projection]], developed for navigational purposes, has often been used in world maps where other projections would have been more appropriate.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;Bauer, H.A.

New York: John Wiley and Sons. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem has long been recognized even outside professional circles. For example, a 1943 ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial states:

{{quote|The time has come to discard [the Mercator] for something that represents the continents and directions less deceptively ... Although its usage ... has diminished ... it is still highly popular as a wall map apparently in part because, as a rectangular map, it fills a rectangular wall space with more map, and clearly because its familiarity breeds more popularity.&lt;ref name="SnyderFlattening"/&gt;{{rp|166}}}}

A controversy in the 1980s over the [[Peters map]] motivated the American Cartographic Association (now Cartography and Geographic Information Society) to produce a series of booklets (including ''Which Map Is Best''&lt;ref name="ACA1986"&gt;American Cartographic Association's Committee on Map Projections, 1986. ''Which Map is Best'' p. 12. Falls Church: American Congress on Surveying and Mapping.&lt;/ref&gt;) designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps. In 1989 and 1990, after some internal debate, seven North American geographic organizations adopted a resolution recommending against using any rectangular projection (including Mercator and Gall–Peters) for reference maps of the world.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Marcel Honoree Nestor, ''[[Ridder (title)|ridder]]''&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Ridder (title)|Ridder]] is a noble title given by the reigning monarch and commonly added between the first names and last name. It is not part of the birth name. ''Ridder'' is roughly equivalent with Knight.&lt;/ref&gt; Neels''' (30 December 1922 – 6 November 2016), known as '''Marc Sleen''', was a Belgian  [[cartoonist]]. He was mostly known for his comic ''[[The Adventures of Nero|The Adventures of Nero and Co.]]'', but also created gag comics like ''[[Piet Fluwijn en Bolleke]]'', ''[[De Lustige Kapoentjes]]'', ''[[Doris Dobbel]]'', ''[[Oktaaf Keunink]]'' and ''[[De Ronde van Frankrijk]]''.

Sleen was one of the most celebrated comics artists in his home country. His work is admired for its absurd and sometimes satirical comedy, as well for the fact that he worked completely singlehandedly without any assistance for 45 years on end, a feat that landed him a spot in ''[[The Guinness Book of Records]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref name="Magnussen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magnussen|first1=Anne|title=Comics &amp; Culture: Analytical and Theoretical Approaches to Comics|date=2000|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=9788772895802|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc Sleen|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sleen.htm|website=Lambiek Comiclopedia|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This feat has been surpassed since by [[Jim Russell (cartoonist)|Jim Russell]]'s ''[[The Potts]]'', which ran for 62 years.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-running-cartoon-strip-by-a-single-artist|title=Longest running cartoon strip by a single artist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) He was one of the few comics artists in Belgium who had a museum dedicated to his work.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marc Sleen krijgt eigen museum in Brussel|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf17062009_055|accessdate=7 November 2016|agency=Belga|publisher=Nieuwsblad|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Marc Sleen was born as Marcel Neels in [[Gentbrugge]], near [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name=Weyer&gt;De Weyer, Geert (2005). "Marc Sleen". In België gestript, pp. 160–161. Tielt: Lannoo.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied drawing in Ghent. During the [[Second World War]] he was imprisoned by Nazi soldiers in [[Fort Breendonk]] because his brother worked for the resistance. He was tortured and put in the death cell, but saved by the fact that after [[D-Day]] the officers moved all the prisoners to a different prison, where he could escape.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt; In 1944 he started to work as a political caricaturist in the Flemish newspaper ''[[De Standaard]]''. He also contributed illustrations and short comics for the newspaper and the youth supplement, and made illustrations and his first comics for the magazine ''Ons Volk''.&lt;ref name="Gazet"&gt;{{cite news|title=BIOGRAFIE. Marc Sleen, geestelijke vader van dagbladverschijnsel Nero|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/dmf20161107_02559524/biografie-marc-sleen-geestelijke-vader-van-dagbladverschijnsel-nero|agency=Belga|publisher=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=7 November 2016|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1947, Marc Sleen started a new series, ''The adventures of detective Van Zwam'' in the newspaper ''De Nieuwe Gids''.&lt;ref name=Weyer/&gt; In the first adventure [[Detective Van Zwam]] encounters a fool who thinks he is emperor [[Nero]]. After he regains his senses, they continue calling him Nero and slowly he became the star of the series. The name changes accordingly to ''The adventures of detective Van Zwam and Nero'' and after nine stories to ''The adventures of Nero and co''.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;

The series appeared for 55 years with a rhythm of two strips every day. This was typical for the Flemish comic tradition, as with ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' (''Spike and Suzy''). ''Nero'' became well known for its [[irony|ironic]] [[humour]] and references to current affairs. For instance, in the album, ''Het Vredesoffensief Van Nero'' ("Nero's Peace Offensive") (1951), Nero visits [[Joseph Stalin]] to make him drink an elixir that will make him a [[pacifism|pacifist]].&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;

Besides ''Nero'' Sleen drew many other comic strip series, many of them [[gag-a-day]] comics, for magazines like ''[['t Kapoentje]]'' and ''[[Ons Volkske]]''. Among the most well known were ''[[Piet Fluwijn en Bolleke]]'' (1947–1965), ''[[Doris Dobbel]]'' (1950–1965), ''[[Oktaaf Keunink]]'' (1952–1965) and ''[[De Lustige Kapoentjes]]''. Sleen also drew a daily cartoon during the [[Tour de France]] from 1947 until 1965, called ''[[De Ronde van Frankrijk]]''.

[[File:Nero in Antwerpen.jpg|thumb|Wall painting in [[Antwerp]] showing the main characters of ''Nero'']]
Between 1950 and 1965 Sleen published ''Nero'' in ''[[Het Volk (newspaper)|Het Volk]]'', after which he moved to ''[[De Standaard]]''. This caused a huge copyright controversy, as several newspapers fought over the rights over his syndicated comics. Thousands of readers switched from ''Het Volk'' to ''De Standaard'', just to follow his adventures in the newspaper. After that switch, he dropped all other series and devoted himself solely to ''Nero''.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;

From 1992 to 2002, he was aided by [[Dirk Stallaert]], a young Flemish comic artist, and at first the intention was to let Stallaert continue the series after Marc Sleen retired. But in the end, Stallaert didn't feel ready to continue it alone, and at the end of 2002, at the age of 80, Marc Sleen ended his career as a comics artist.&lt;ref name=Weyer/&gt;

Sleen designed album covers for records by Flemish actor, comedian and singer [[Jef Burm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Jef-Burm-Allo-Sjoe/release/5881518|title=Jef Burm - Allo Sjoe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burm was a former school mate of his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sint-niklaas.be/nieuws/sint-niklaas-in-de-ban-van-het-b-gevaar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918004903/http://www.sint-niklaas.be/nieuws/sint-niklaas-in-de-ban-van-het-b-gevaar |archivedate=18 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV documentary work==

Marc Sleen was also known as a traveller and animal friend. He made 35 [[safari]]s to Africa between 1961 and 1991, making more than 20 documentaries for the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]], mostly for the TV show ''"Allemaal Beestjes"''.&lt;ref name="Gazet"/&gt; A few books and records about his safaris appeared as well. Many of his comics featured animals and countries he has visited.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Marc Sleen is commonly considered one of the big names of the Flemish comics, together with [[Willy Vandersteen]] and [[Jef Nys]].&lt;ref name="Gazet"/&gt;

In 2005 he was selected as one of the 111 nominees for the title "The Greatest Belgian" ([[De Grootste Belg]]) in the Flemish edition. He ended in 48th place.&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;

On June 19, 2009, a museum dedicated to his life and career was opened in Brussels: the [[Marc Sleen Museum]]. Both Marc Sleen as well as King [[Albert II of Belgium]] were present.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; The king was a fan of ''Nero'' since his youth and both he and [[Baudouin of Belgium]] learned Dutch by reading "Nero".&lt;ref name="lambiek.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruell|first1=Niels|title=Marc Sleen Museum ingehuldigd|url=http://www.bruzz.be/nl/nieuws/marc-sleen-museum-ingehuldigd|accessdate=7 November 2016|publisher=Bruzz|date=18 June 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleen died at the age of 93 on the evening of November 6, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20161107_02559483|title=Striptekenaar Marc Sleen is overleden|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the [[Campo Santo, Ghent|Campo Santo]] in Ghent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur+en+media/kunsten/2.47499?eid=1.2814532|title=Marc Sleen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

The '''Marine Science Co-ordination Committee''' ('''MSCC''') is a UK government committee composed of representatives from public-funded bodies who have a remit to undertake marine scientific research. There are also three non-executive members.
The role of the MSCC is to implement the pan-UK Marine Science Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/documents/science/mscc/mscc-strategy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205114931/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/documents/science/mscc/mscc-strategy.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers the period 2010-2025.
The secretariat for the MSCC is hosted by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ([[Defra]]) and the [[Natural Environment Research Council]]'s [[National Oceanography Centre]].

The committee usually meets twice per year and was formed in 2008 in response to the recommendations of the House of Commons Select Committee Report 'Investigating the Oceans',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmsctech/470/470i.pdf|title= House of Commons Science and Technology Committee Investigating  the Oceans}}&lt;/ref&gt;and replaces the Inter-Agency Committee on Marine Science and Technology (IACMST). 

The Marine Science Co-ordination Committee's work is overseen by a Ministerial Marine Science Group, representing UK and Devolved Governments.

The MSCC also has oversight of the [[Marine Environmental Data and Information Network]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oceannet.org/|title= MEDIN_ Marine data}}&lt;/ref&gt;(MEDIN) and the UK Underwater Sound Forum.

A '''micrometeorite''' is essentially a [[micrometeoroid]] that has survived [[atmospheric entry|entry]] through [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. The [[particle size|size]] of such a [[particle]] ranges from 50 [[micrometre|µm]] to 2 [[millimeter|mm]]. Usually found on [[Earth]]'s surface, micrometeorites differ from [[meteorites]] in that they are smaller in size, more abundant, and different in composition. They are a subset of [[cosmic dust]], which also includes the smaller [[interplanetary dust]] particles (IDPs).&lt;ref name = "Brownlee1997"&gt;

Micrometeorites enter Earth's atmosphere at high [[velocity|velocities]] (at least 11&amp;nbsp;km/s) and undergo heating through [[drag (physics)|atmospheric friction]] and [[Compression (physics)|compression]]. Micrometeorites individually weigh between 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; g and collectively comprise most of the extraterrestrial material that has come to the present-day Earth.&lt;ref name="Love"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes meteoroids and micrometeoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere are visible as [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteors or "shooting stars"]], whether or not they reach the ground and survive as meteorites and micrometorites.

==Introduction==
Micrometeorite (MM) textures vary as their original structural and mineral compositions are modified by the degree of heating that they experience entering the atmosphere—a function of their initial speed and angle of entry. They range from unmelted particles that retain their original [[mineralogy]] (Fig. 1 a, b), to partially melted particles (Fig. 1 c, d) to round melted cosmic spherules (Fig. 1 e, f, g, h, Fig. 2) some of which have lost a large portion of their mass through vaporization (Fig. 1 i). Classification is based on composition and degree of heating.&lt;ref name ="Taylor2000"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and the huge number of particles entering the atmosphere each year (~10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 10&amp;nbsp;µm) suggests that large MM collections contain particles from all dust producing objects in the Solar System including asteroids, comets, and fragments from our Moon and Mars. Large MM collections provide information on the size, composition, atmospheric heating effects and types of materials accreting on Earth while detailed studies of individual MMs give insights into their origin, the nature of the [[carbon]], [[amino acid]]s and pre-solar grains they contain.&lt;ref&gt;

==Collection sites==
Micrometeorites have been collected from deep-sea [[sediment]]s, sedimentary rocks and polar sediments; they are currently collected primarily from polar snow and ice. Because of their low concentrations on the Earth's surface, MMs are sought in environments that concentrate these materials relative to terrestrial particles.

===Ocean sediments===
Melted micrometeorites (cosmic spherules) were first collected from deep-sea sediments during the 1873 to 1876 [[Challenger expedition|expedition of HMS ''Challenger'']]. In 1891, Murray and Renard found "two groups [of micrometeorites]: first, black magnetic spherules, with or without a metallic nucleus; second, brown-coloured spherules resembling chondr(ul)es, with a crystalline structure".&lt;ref name = "Murray &amp; Renard 1891"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, they suggested that these spherules were extraterrestrial because they were found far from terrestrial particle sources, they did not resemble magnetic spheres produced in furnaces of the time, and their [[Nickel-iron alloy|nickel-iron]] (Fe-Ni) metal cores did not resemble metallic iron found in volcanic rocks. The spherules were most abundant in slowly accumulating sediments, particularly red clays deposited below the [[carbonate compensation depth]], a finding that supported a meteoritic origin.&lt;ref name = "Murray &amp; Renard 1883"&gt;

===Comet vs asteroid origin of micrometeorites===
Whereas most meteorites likely originate from [[asteroids]], the contrasting makeup of micrometeorites suggests that most originate from [[comets]].

Fewer than 1% of MMs are [[Achondrite|achondritic]] and are similar to [[HED meteorites]], which are thought to be from the asteroid, [[4 Vesta]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The dominance of carbonaceous chondrite-like MMs and their low abundance in meteorite collections suggests that most MMs derive from sources different than those for most meteorites. Since most meteorites probably derive from asteroids, an alternative source for MMs might be comets. The idea that MMs might originate from comets originated in 1950.&lt;ref name="Whipple"/&gt;

Until recently the greater-than-25-km/s entry velocities of micrometeoroids, measured for particles from comet streams, cast doubts against their survival as MMs.&lt;ref name = "Raisbeck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial micrometeorites==
The influx of micrometeoroids also contributes to the composition of [[regolith]] (planetary/lunar soil) on other bodies in the Solar System. [[Mars]] has an estimated annual micrometeoroid influx of between 2,700 and 59,000&amp;nbsp;t/yr. This contributes to about 1m of micrometeoritic content to the depth of the Martian regolith every billion years. Measurements from the [[Viking program]] indicate that the Martian regolith is composed of 60% basaltic rock and 40% rock of meteoritic origin. The lower-density Martian atmosphere allows much larger particles than on Earth to survive the passage through to the surface, largely unaltered until impact. While on Earth particles that survive entry typically have undergone significant transformation, a significant fraction of particles entering the Martian atmosphere throughout the 60 to 1200-μm diameter range probably survive unmelted.&lt;ref name="Flynn 1990"&gt;{{Citation|last=Flynn|first=George J.|author2=McKay, David S.|title=An assessment of the meteoritic contribution to the martian soil|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1 January 1990|volume=95|issue=B9|pages=14497|doi=10.1029/JB095iB09p14497|bibcode = 1990JGR....9514497F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Water and Power''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|'''وزارت پانی و بجلی'''}}}}, abbreviated as '''MoPW''') was a [[Central government|federal]] [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Pakistan]]. 

The ministry was dissolved in August 2017. The water division was merged with newly created Ministry of Water Resources and the power division was moved under [[Ministry of Energy (Pakistan)|Ministry of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan PM creates new ministries|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/story/559153/Pakistan-PM-creates-new-ministries|accessdate=6 August 2017|work=Gulf-Times|date=6 August 2017|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companies/ Divisions== 
===Water and Power Development Authority===
{{main|Water and Power Development Authority}}

===National Transmission And Despatch Company===
NTDC is a limited company established in 1998. The main function of company is to purchase electric power from [[List of power stations in Pakistan|generation companies]] and then sells to [[List of electric supply companies in Pakistan|distribution companies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntdc.com.pk/CompanyProfile.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Flood Commission===
{{main|Federal Flood Commission}}
The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) is an agency within the Ministry that was created in 1977 in response to severe flooding by the [[Indus River]]. The FFC has been charged to execute flood control projects and protect lives and property from the impact of floods. By 2010 the FFC had received Rs 87.8 billion since its inception, and its own documents demonstrate  that numerous projects were initiated, paid for, and seemingly completed. However, after the devastating [[2010 Pakistan floods]] the agency has been severely criticized as apparently very little actual work had been done on the ground and it was accused of ineffectiveness and corruption. &lt;ref name=Ahmadani&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/19-Aug-2010/Heavily-funded-FFC-fails-to-deliver/|first=Ahmad|last=Ahmadani|title=Heavily funded FFC fails to deliver|newspaper=[[The Nation (Pakistan)]]|date=19 August 2010|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private Power and Infrastructure Board===
The Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) was created in 1994 to promote  [[private sector]] participation in the [[Energy in Pakistan|power sector of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.com.pk/islamabad/01-Feb-2012/senate-passes-private-power-infrastructure-board-bill&lt;/ref&gt;  PPIB facilitates investors in establishing private power projects and related infrastructure, executes Implementation Agreement (IA) with Project Sponsors and issues sovereign guarantees on behalf of [[Federal Government of Pakistan|government]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppib.gov.pk/N_about_ppib.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pakistanlegal.blogspot.com/2012/04/private-power-and-infrastructure-board.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container. &lt;u&gt;Top:&lt;/u&gt; A single molecule moves around randomly. &lt;u&gt;Middle:&lt;/u&gt; With more molecules, there is a clear trend where the solute fills the container more and more uniformly. &lt;u&gt;Bottom:&lt;/u&gt; With an enormous number of solute molecules, all randomness is gone: The solute appears to move smoothly and systematically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas, following Fick's laws.]]

'''Molecular diffusion''', often simply called '''diffusion''', is the thermal motion of all (liquid or gas) particles at [[temperature]]s above [[absolute zero]]. The rate of this movement is a function of temperature, [[viscosity]] of the fluid and the size (mass) of the particles. Diffusion explains the net [[flux]] of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move, but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of [[self-diffusion]], originating from the random motion of the molecules. The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform. Since the molecules are still in motion, but an equilibrium has been established, the end result of molecular diffusion is called a "dynamic equilibrium". In a [[Phase (matter)|phase]] with uniform temperature, absent external net forces acting on the particles, the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing.

Consider two systems; S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the same [[temperature]] and capable of exchanging [[Molecule|particles]]. If there is a change in the [[potential energy]] of a system; for example μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (μ is [[Chemical potential]]) an [[energy]] flow will occur from S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, because nature always prefers low energy and maximum [[entropy]].

Molecular diffusion is typically described mathematically using [[Fick's laws of diffusion]].

== Applications ==
Diffusion is of fundamental importance in many disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Some example applications of diffusion:
* [[Sintering]] to produce solid materials ([[powder metallurgy]], production of [[ceramic]]s)
* [[Chemical reactor]] design
* [[Catalysis|Catalyst]] design in chemical industry
* [[Steel]] can be diffused (e.g., with carbon or nitrogen) to modify its properties
* [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] during production of [[semiconductor]]s.

== Significance ==
[[File:Diffusion (1).png|thumb|280px|Schematic representation of mixing of two substances by diffusion]]
Diffusion is part of the [[transport phenomena]]. Of mass transport mechanisms, molecular diffusion is known as a slower one.

=== Biology ===
In [[cell biology]], diffusion is a main form of transport for necessary materials such as [[amino acid]]s within cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maton | first = Anthea | authorlink = |author2=Jean Hopkins |author3=Susan Johnson |author4=David LaHart |author5=Maryanna Quon Warner |author6=Jill D. Wright | title = Cells Building Blocks of Life | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1997 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = 66–67 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diffusion of solvents, such as water, through a [[semipermeable membrane]] is classified as [[osmosis]].

[[Metabolism]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rely in part upon diffusion in addition to bulk or active processes. For example, in the [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] of [[mammal]]ian [[lung]]s, due to differences in partial pressures across the alveolar-capillary membrane, [[oxygen]] diffuses into the blood and [[carbon dioxide]] diffuses out. Lungs contain a large surface area to facilitate this gas exchange process.

== Tracer, self- and chemical diffusion ==
[[File:Diffusion self1.svg|thumb|340px|Self diffusion, exemplified with an isotopic tracer of radioactive isotope &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na]]
[[File:Diffusion4.svg|thumb|340px|Example of chemical (classical, Fick's, or Fickian) diffusion of sodium chloride in water]]
&lt;!-- "Wasser" should be "Water" in second figure. --&gt;Fundamentally, two types of diffusion are distinguished:
* ''Tracer diffusion'' and ''Self-diffusion'', which is a spontaneous mixing of molecules taking place in the absence of concentration (or chemical potential) gradient. This type of diffusion can be followed using [[Isotopic labeling|isotopic tracers]], hence the name. The tracer diffusion is usually assumed to be identical to [[self-diffusion]] (assuming no significant [[Kinetic isotope effect|isotopic effect]]). This diffusion can take place under equilibrium. An excellent method for the measurement of [[self-diffusion]] coefficients is [[pulsed field gradient]] (PFG) [[NMR]], where no isotopic tracers are needed. In a so-called NMR [[spin echo]] experiment this technique uses the nuclear spin precession phase, allowing to distinguish chemically and physically completely identical species e.g. in the liquid phase, as for example water molecules within liquid water. The self-diffusion coefficient of water has been experimentally determined with high accuracy and thus serves often as a reference value for measurements on other liquids. The self-diffusion coefficient of neat water is: 2.299·10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m²·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and 1.261·10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m²·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name =wasser&gt;M. Holz, S.R. Heil, A. Sacco: ''Temperature-dependent self-diffusion coefficients of water and six selected molecular liquids for calibration in accurate 1H NMR PFG Measurements.'' In: ''Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.'' '''2''',4740–4742 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Chemical diffusion'' occurs in a presence of concentration (or chemical potential) gradient and it results in net transport of mass. This is the process described by the diffusion equation. This diffusion is always a non-equilibrium process, increases the system entropy, and brings the system closer to equilibrium.

The [[Mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]]s for these two types of diffusion are generally different because the diffusion coefficient for chemical diffusion is binary and it includes the effects due to the correlation of the movement of the different diffusing species.

== Non-equilibrium system ==
[[File:entropie.svg|thumb|280px|Illustration of low entropy (top) and high entropy (bottom)]]
Because chemical diffusion is a net transport process, the system in which it takes place is not an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] system (i.e. it is not at rest yet). Many results in classical thermodynamics are not easily applied to non-equilibrium systems. However, there sometimes occur so-called quasi-steady states, where the diffusion process does not change in time, where classical results may locally apply. As the name suggests, this process is a not a true equilibrium since the system is still evolving.

Non-equilibrium fluid systems can be successfully modeled with Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this theoretical framework, diffusion is due to fluctuations whose dimensions range from the molecular scale to the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brogioli and A. Vailati, ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0006163 Diffusive mass transfer by nonequilibrium fluctuations: Fick's law revisited]'', Phys. Rev. E '''63''', 012105/1-4 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical diffusion increases the [[entropy]] of a system, i.e. diffusion is a spontaneous and irreversible process. Particles can spread out by diffusion, but will not spontaneously re-order themselves (absent changes to the system, assuming no creation of new chemical bonds, and absent external forces acting on the particle).

== Concentration dependent "collective" diffusion ==
''Collective diffusion'' is the diffusion of a large number of particles, most often within a [[solvent]].

Contrary to [[brownian motion]], which is the diffusion of a single particle, interactions between particles may have to be considered, unless the particles form an ideal mix with their solvent (ideal mix conditions correspond to the case where the interactions between the solvent and particles are identical to the interactions between particles and the interactions between solvent molecules; in this case, the particles do not interact when inside the solvent).

In case of an ideal mix, the particle [[diffusion equation]] holds true and the diffusion coefficient ''D'' the speed of [[diffusion]] in the particle diffusion equation is independent of particle concentration. In other cases, resulting interactions between particles within the solvent will account for the following effects:
* the diffusion coefficient ''D'' in the particle diffusion equation becomes dependent of concentration. For an attractive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to decrease as concentration increases. For a repulsive interaction between particles, the diffusion coefficient tends to increase as concentration increases.
* In the case of an attractive interaction between particles, particles exhibit a tendency to coalesce and form clusters if their [[concentration]] lies above a certain threshold. This is equivalent to a [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] chemical reaction (and if the considered diffusing particles are chemical molecules in solution, then it is a [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]]).

== Molecular diffusion of gases ==
Transport of material in stagnant fluid or across streamlines of a fluid in a laminar flow occurs by molecular diffusion. Two adjacent compartments separated by a partition, containing pure gases A or B may be envisaged. Random movement of all molecules occurs so that after a period molecules are found remote from their original positions. If the partition is removed, some molecules of A move towards the region occupied by B, their number depends on the number of molecules at the point considered. Concurrently, molecules of B diffuse toward regimens formerly occupied by pure A.
Finally, complete mixing occurs. Before this point in time, a gradual variation in the concentration of A occurs along an axis, designated x, which joins the original compartments. This variation, expressed mathematically as -dC&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/dx, where C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of A. The negative sign arises because the concentration of A decreases as the distance x increases. Similarly, the variation in the concentration of gas B is -dC&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/dx. The rate of diffusion of A, N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, depend on concentration gradient and the average velocity with which the molecules of A moves in the x direction. This relationship is expressed by [[Fick's Law]]

:                &lt;math&gt;N_{A}= -D_{AB} \frac{dC_{A}}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;   (only applicable for no bulk motion)

where D is the Diffusivity of A through B, proportional to the average (squared?) molecular velocity and, therefore dependent on the temperature and pressure of gases. The rate of Diffusion N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,is usually expressed as the number of moles diffusing across unit area in unit time. As with the basic equation of heat transfer, this indicates that the rate of force is directly proportional to the driving force, which is the concentration gradient.
 
This basic equation applies to a number of situations. Restricting discussion exclusively to steady state conditions, in which neither dC&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/dx or dC&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/dx change with time, equimolecular counterdiffusion is considered first.

==Equimolecular counterdiffusion==

If no bulk flow occurs in an element of length dx, the rates of diffusion of two ideal gases (of similar molar volume) A and B must be equal and opposite, that is &lt;math&gt;N_A=-N_B&lt;/math&gt;.
 
The partial pressure of A changes by dP&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; over the distance dx. Similarly, the partial pressure of B changes dP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. As there is no difference in total pressure across the element (no bulk flow), we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dP_A}{dx}=-\frac{dP_B}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.

For an ideal gas the partial pressure is related to the molar concentration by the relation
            
:&lt;math&gt;      P_{A}V=n_{A}RT&lt;/math&gt;

where n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of moles of gas ''A'' in a volume ''V''. As the molar concentration ''C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is equal to ''n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/ V'' therefore
             
:&lt;math&gt;      P_{A}=C_{A}RT&lt;/math&gt;
  
Consequently, for gas A,

:&lt;math&gt; N_{A}=-D_{AB} \frac{1}{RT} \frac{dP_{A}}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

where D&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; is the diffusivity of A in B. Similarly,

:&lt;math&gt; N_{B}=-D_{BA} \frac{1}{RT} \frac{dP_{B}}{dx}=D_{AB} \frac{1}{RT}\frac{dP_{A}}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Considering that dP&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;/dx=-dP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/dx, it therefore proves that D&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;=D&lt;sub&gt;BA&lt;/sub&gt;=D. If the partial pressure of A at x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, integration of above equation,

:&lt;math&gt; N_{A}=-\frac{D}{RT} \frac{(P_{A2}-P_{A1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

A similar equation may be derived for the counterdiffusion of gas B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12082">[[Western Australia]] has relatively few species of [[moss]]; the most recent census found just 192 taxa. This represents just 10% of [[Australia]]'s total moss flora, even though Western Australia accounts for about one third of the Australia by area. This relatively low diversity has been attributed to the lack of [[rainforest]] in the state.&lt;ref name="Stoneburner 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoneburner, Ann |author2=Wyatt, Robert |author3=Catcheside, David |author4=Stone, Ilma   |last-author-amp=yes | title = Census of the Mosses of Western Australia | journal = The Bryologist | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | year = 1993 | pages = 86–101 | doi = 10.2307/3243324 | publisher = The Bryologist, Vol. 96, No. 1 | jstor = 3243324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the majority of the state's moss species occur in the [[Southwest Botanical Province]], with over 80% of all species, genera and families occurring there. This includes four species that are apparently endemic to the province.&lt;ref name="Stoneburner 1993"/&gt;

About 70% of Western Australia's moss taxa occur also in [[South Australia]], and a similar proportion occur also in [[New South Wales]]. Only about 50% occur also in [[Queensland]]. About half are restricted to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]], and a further 10% occur also only in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Stoneburner 1993"/&gt;

{{Redirect|OOI}}
The '''Ocean Observatories Initiative''' (OOI) is a [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]] Division of Ocean Sciences program that focuses the [[science]], [[technology]], [[education]] and [[outreach]] of an emerging network of science driven [[Ocean observations|ocean observing]] systems. It is a networked infrastructure of science-driven sensor systems to measure the physical, chemical, geological and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor as well as the overlying atmosphere, providing an integrated system collecting data on coastal, regional and global scales.  
[[File:OOI Station Map.jpg|thumb|right|OOI Station Map.  Credit: OOI Regional Scale Nodes program and the Center for Environmental Visualization, University of Washington]]OOI is funded by the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]].

OOI's goal is to deliver data and data products for a 25-year-plus time period within a scalable architecture that can meet emerging technical advances in ocean science.  These data are freely accessible online through the OOI [[cyberinfrastructure]].

==History==
OOI builds on the heritage of the ship-based expeditions of the last century and the more recent emphasis to increase ocean observation and in situ monitoring.

In 2003 the Pew Oceans Commission recommended changes designed to improve society’s use and stewardship of, and impact on, the coastal and global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Protecting_ocean_life/env_pew_oceans_final_report.pdf|title=Pew Oceans Commission.

In 2007, the National Science and Technology Council’s Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/nstc/oceans|title=Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an Ocean Research Priorities Strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/nstc-orppis.pdf|title= National Science and Technology Council’s Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology. 2006. Charting the Course for Ocean Science for the United States for the Next Decade: An Ocean Research Priorities Strategy (ORPP)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a research investment framework to advance understanding of ocean processes and interactions that facilitate responsible use of the ocean environment. The ORPS identified three cross-cutting elements, one of which is ocean observing for research and management.

In late 2007 the OOI project underwent its Preliminary Design Review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/about/planning-history/preliminary-design-review/|title=Preliminary Design Review|date=14 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 completed its Final Network Design Review resulting in the Final Network Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanobservatories.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/1101-00000_FND_OOI_ver_2-06_Pub.pdf Ocean Observatories Initiative.  2010 Final Network Design]&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2009, the National Science Board authorized the Director of NSF to award funds for the construction and initial operation of the OOI.  In September 2009, NSF and the Consortium for Ocean Leadership signed the Cooperative Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanleadership.org/2009/ocean-observatories-initiative-receives-award/|title=Ocean Leadership: Cooperative agreement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that initiated the construction phase of the OOI.

After nearly 10 years and expenses of US$386 million, in June 2016, NSF announced that most OOI data were flowing in real time  from more than 900 sensors at the 7 sites. The annual budget is approximately $55 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2016-06-09|title=US ocean-observing project launches at last|url=http://www.nature.com/news/massive-ocean-observing-project-launches-despite-turmoil-1.20031?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews|journal=Nature|volume=534|issue=7606|pages=159–160|doi=10.1038/534159a|bibcode=2016Natur.534..159W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
The OOI Program is managed and coordinated by the OOI Project Office at the [[Consortium for Ocean Leadership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanleadership.org|title=Ocean Leadership: Policy &amp; Legislation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is responsible for construction and initial operation.  Five Implementing Organizations are responsible for construction and development. 
* [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu|title=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography are responsible for the Pioneer and Global Arrays, including their moorings and autonomous vehicles. 
* [[Oregon State University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Oregon State University|url=http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2009/sep/osu-major-participant-national-initiative-create-global-ocean-observatory-system |title=OSU major participant in initiative to create global ocean observatory system |date=9/2/2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for the Endurance Array moorings and autonomous vehicles.
* [[University of Washington]] is responsible for regional cabled seafloor systems and moorings. 
* [[University of California, San Diego]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/release.php?id=1593|title=UC San Diego to Develop Ocean Observing Cyberinfrastructure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is implementing the cyberinfrastructure component.
* [[Rutgers University|Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]], with its partners [[University of Maine]] and [[Raytheon|Raytheon Mission Operations and Services]] is responsible for the education and public engagement software infrastructure.

==Themes==
The sites and platforms of the OOI components target the following key scientific processes:

===Ocean-atmosphere exchange===
Quantify the air-sea exchange of energy and mass, especially during high winds (greater than 20 meters-per-second), to provide estimates of energy and gas exchange between the surface and [[Deep sea|deep ocean]]. Such measurements should improve the predictive capability of storm forecasting and climate change models.

===Climate variability, ocean circulation and ecosystems===
Examine how climate variability affects [[Ocean current|ocean circulation]], weather patterns, the ocean’s biochemical environment and [[marine ecosystem]]s.

===Turbulent mixing and biophysical interactions===
Understand the role of turbulent mixing in the transfer of materials within the ocean and in the exchange of energy and gases between the ocean and atmosphere.

===Coastal ocean dynamics and ecosystems===
Quantify the processes governing the coastal ocean.

[[File:OOI Seafloor Science Themes.jpg|thumbnail|right| 	  OOI Seafloor processes. Image Credit: OOI Regional Scale Nodes program and the Center for Environmental Visualization, University of Washington]]

===Plate-scale, ocean geodynamics===
Examine the degree to which active [[tectonic plate]] boundaries influence the ocean from physical, chemical and biological perspectives. [[Lithosphere|Lithospheric]] movements and interactions at plate boundaries at or beneath the seafloor are responsible for short-term events such as [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s. These regions are also host to the densest hydrothermal and biological activity in the ocean basins.

===Fluid-rock interactions and the subseafloor biosphere===
The [[oceanic crust]] contains the largest [[aquifer]] on Earth. Thermal circulation and reactivity of seawater-derived fluids can modify the composition of oceanic plates, lead to the formation of [[hydrothermal vents]] that support unique micro- and macro-biological communities and concentrate [[methane]] to form massive methane gas and [[methane hydrate]] reservoirs.

==Components==
The four main components that comprise the OOI are: Coastal Global Scale Nodes (CGSN); Regional Scale Nodes (RSN); Cyberinfrastructure (CI) and Education and Public Engagement (EPE). Implementing organizations are responsible for these components.

===Coastal Global Scale Nodes (CGSN)===
The CGSN is made up of two coastal arrays and four global arrays.

Coastal arrays provide sustained, adaptable access to complex coastal systems. Coastal arrays extend from the continental shelf to the continental slope, allowing scientists to examine coastal processes including [[upwelling]], [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], shelf break fronts, and the role of filaments and [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] in cross-shelf exchange. Technologies that gather data in the coastal region include moored buoys with fixed sensors, moored vertical profilers, [[Submarine communications cable|seafloor cables]], gliders and [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s.

The coastal observatory includes a long-term Endurance Array in the Eastern Pacific and a re-locatable Pioneer Array in the Western Atlantic.  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution installed and operates the Pioneer Array. Oregon State University installed and operates the Endurance Array.

====Pioneer Array====

The Pioneer Array is a network of platforms and sensors that operate on the continental shelf and slope south of [[New England]].  A moored array is centered at the shelf break in the [[mid-Atlantic Bight]] south of [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts. [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs) sample the frontal region in the vicinity of the moored array and gliders resolve mesoscale features on the outer shelf and the slope sea between the shelf break front and the [[Gulf Stream]].

The Pioneer Array provides a three-dimensional view of key biophysical interactions at the shelf break using its flexible, multiplatform array that combines moored and mobile components with high spatial and temporal resolution.  In its initial location south of Cape Cod, the Pioneer is embedded within an established regional observing system. The Pioneer Array is planned to move from place to place over approximately five-year intervals to characterize processes in different coastal ocean environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/pioneer-array/|title=Pioneer Array At-Sea Test of Buoys Now Scheduled for September|date=28 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endurance Array====
[[File:OOI Endurance Array.png|thumb|left|Conceptual Design of the Endurance Array Oregon Line. Credit: Oregon State University.  Disclaimer: mooring sites are not yet finalized; all data are subject to revision without notice.]]
The Endurance Array, located on the continental shelf and slope off Oregon and Washington, provides a long-term network of moorings, benthic nodes, cabled and uncabled sensors and gliders.  The array consists of two lines of moorings, one off [[Newport, Oregon]] (the Oregon Line) and the other off [[Grays Harbor, Washington]] (the Washington Line).  Gliders sample between the mooring lines.  The array focuses on observing the influence of the [[Columbia River]] on the coastal ecosystem. It also samples a prototypical upwelling regime on a narrow continental shelf where [[anoxic event|anoxia events]] are common. Some Endurance Array Oregon Line infrastructure connects to the RSN cabled network to provide enhanced power and communications for observing water column and seafloor processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/endurance-array/|title=Coastal Endurance Array Online Instrument Tables|date=29 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OOI Global Arrays.png|thumbnail|right|Conceptual Design of the Global Arrays. Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Disclaimer: mooring site arrangements are not yet finalized, all data are subject to revision without notice.]]

====Global Arrays====
Locations of the global arrays were selected by a team of scientists (~300 people)&lt;ref&gt;Daly, K., R. Jahnke, M. Moline, R. Detrick, D. Luther, G. Matsumoto, L. Mayer, K. Raybould.  May 2006. [http://www.oceanleadership.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ooi_di_report_final.pdf Design and Implementation Workshop Report]&lt;/ref&gt; based on regions that are under-sampled and subject to extreme conditions (e.g., high winds and sea states) that are challenging for continuous or even frequent ship-based measurements.  The planned global study sites include instrumented moorings and gliders in four locations: [[Argentine Basin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/argentine-basin|title=Argentine Basin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irminger Sea]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/irminger-sea|title=Irminger Sea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Ocean]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/southern-ocean|title=Southern ocean|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Station Papa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/station-papa Station Papa]&lt;/ref&gt;  The global arrays are developed and operated by Woods Hole and Scripps.

Observations from these high latitude areas are critical to understanding ocean circulation and climate change processes.  The global arrays each include four moorings (except Station Papa, which has three) composed of fixed and moving sensors that measure air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum—as well as physical, biological, and chemical properties of the water column.  Each array also includes gliders to sample within the array’s footprint.

====Regional Scale Nodes (RSN)====
[[File:OOI Regional Scale Nodes Locations.jpg|thumbnail|left|The OOI Regional Scale Nodes focus on two primary study sites (Hydrate Ridge and Axial Seamount) with the potential for future expansion to other sites.

Regional Scale Nodes are cabled arrays of ocean observing sensors in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. They are connected by approximately 900 kilometers (560 miles) of electro-optical cable.  The design provides high power (10 kV, 8&amp;nbsp;kW) and bandwidth (10 GbE) to sensor arrays on the seafloor and throughout the water column using moorings with instrumented wire-following profilers, 200 m instrumented platforms and winched profilers.  The RSN was installed and operated by the University of Washington.

The two primary study sites are Hydrate Ridge, an area of massive sub-seafloor gas-hydrate deposits and fluxes of methane from the seafloor into the ocean, and Axial Seamount, the most magmatically robust volcano on the [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]] spreading center that erupted in April 2011.

The RSN complements the [[NEPTUNE]] cabled observatory that [[Ocean Networks Canada]] operates on the northern Juan de Fuca plate. Together these observatories enable long-term, plate-scale seafloor and ocean investigations in the Northeast Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanobservatories.org/infrastructure/ooi-station-map/regional-scale-nodes|title=OOI Station map Regional Scale Nodes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberinfrastructure===

[[File:Ci deployment topology for OOI.png|thumb|right|CI Deployment Topology. Graphic created by J.B. Matthews.]]

The Cyberinfrastructure component links marine infrastructure to scientists and users.  It manages and integrates data from the different OOI sensors.  It provides a common operating infrastructure, the Integrated Observatory Network (ION), connecting and coordinating the operations of the marine components (global, regional, and coastal scale arrays). It also provides resource management, observatory mission command and control, product production, data management and distribution (including strong data provenance) and centrally available collaboration tools.

ION connects and coordinates operations of the OOI marine components with oceanographic research communities.  The [[University of California, San Diego]] initially designed the cyber infrastructure.  The project later relocated to [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/ocean-observatory-project-hits-rough-water-1.16406|title=Ocean observatory project hits rough water|journal=Nature|volume=515|first=Alexandra|last=Witze|date=27 November 2014|publisher=|issue=515|pages=474–475|doi=10.1038/515474a|bibcode=2014Natur.515..474W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and Public Engagement (EPE)===
[[File:OOI Data Education Venues.jpg|thumbnail|left|Using OOI data in educational venues. Photo provided by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.]]

Education and Public Engagement includes educational data visualization tools to engage students in active scientific inquiry.  Collectively, these tools provide easy access for the development and use of scientific data visualization, helping translate science themes into educational materials, deliver the capability to build and edit online lesson and lab units, enable virtual collaboration and sharing of oceanographic data and learning materials and facilitate broader data access. Services were developed and integrated into a single interface planned for release in fall 2014—accessible through a web [[application programming interface]] (API).  This API also provides a framework that other computer scientists and programmers can use to develop new educational products for the web and other mobile applications.

Specifically, the EPE planned five online services including: 
* Educational visualization tools
* Ontology-linked concept mapping tool
* Lab-lesson builder
* Educational resource database
* Collaboration portal for educators.

The {{Nihongo|'''Okinawa Trough'''|沖縄トラフ|Okinawa Torafu}} (also called '''{{zh|中琉界沟}}''', literally '''China-Ryukyu Border Trough'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Defending Diaoyu Islands|url=http://baodiao.lib.tsinghua.edu.cn:4237/oralhistory/chronicle.html|publisher=Tsinghua University (Beijing) Library|accessdate=3 June 2013|quote="横渡中琉界沟黑水沟，进入"琉球大洋"，乃因此沟以东属琉球海域，以西包括钓鱼台列屿乃属中国海域。"}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) is a seabed feature of the [[East China Sea]]. It is an active, initial back-arc rifting basin which has formed behind the Ryukyu arc-trench system in the West Pacific.  It developed where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Eurasia Plate.&lt;ref&gt;Thakur, Naresh Kumar ''et al.'' (2010). {{google books|iqL67NrCQloC|Exploration of Gas Hydrates: Geophysical Techniques,'' p. 119.|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is a [[back-arc basin]] formed by extension within the continental lithosphere behind the far deeper [[Ryukyu Trench]]-arc system.&lt;ref&gt;Sibuet, Jean-Claude ''et al.'' [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987JGR....9214041S "Back arc extension in the Okinawa Trough,"] ''Journal of Geophysical Research,'' Vol. 92, Issue B13, p. 14041-14063.&lt;/ref&gt;   It has a large section more than {{convert|1000|m}} deep and a maximum depth of {{convert|2716|m}}.

The Okinawa Trough  still in an early stage of evolving from arc type to back-arc activity.

==Implications for the China–Japan maritime boundary==

===Interpretations===
[[Image:Okinawa trough topographic.png|thumb|right|Okinawa trough]]
The existence of the Okinawa Trough complicates descriptive issues in the East China Sea.&lt;ref name="ji11"&gt;Ji, Guoxing. (1995). [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7rq2b069  "Maritime Jurisdiction in the Three China Seas," p. 10.] UC Berkeley: [[UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation]]; retrieved 15 Nov 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor [[Ji Guoxing]] of the Asia-Pacific Department at [[Shanghai International Studies University|Shanghai Institute for International Studies]],
* China's interpretation of the geography is that {{quotation|"...the Okinawa Trough proves that the continental shelves of China and Japan are not connected, that the Trough serves as the boundary between them, and that the Trough should not be ignored ...."&lt;ref name="ji11"/&gt;}}
* Japan's interpretation of the geography is that {{quotation|"...the trough is just an incidental depression in a continuous continental margin between the two countries ... and that any legal effect of the trough should be ignored ...."&lt;ref name="ji11"/&gt;}}

=== Legal Procedure ===
On August 15, 2013, China’s mission did a presentation to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/clcs_home.htm]{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CLCS) established under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS). The presentation was on the proposal that demarcates the limits of the outer continental shelf beyond 200 [[nautical mile|nm]] in part of the [[East China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Did a Presentation to CLCS on Demarcating Limits of Over-200-nm Outer Continental Shelf of the East China Sea|author=State Oceanic Administration|location=[[Beijing]], China|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013|language=Chinese}}{{Full|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China states that China’s continental shelf in the [[East China Sea]] extends to China-Ryukyu Border Trough naturally, which has been over 200 [[nautical mile]]s away from the mainland baseline of Chinese territorial waters. According to [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]], any country claiming continental shelves beyond 200 [[nautical|nm]] shall provide relevant scientific evidence to CLCS. To collect solid data, China deployed 14 scientific survey ships, covering an area of 250,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legally and Scientifically Sound--Discussions about China’s Proposal on Demarcating Outer Continental Shelf in the East China Sea|author=State Oceanic Administration|location=[[Beijing]], China|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013|language=Chinese}}{{Full|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Chinese|author=Xinjing Bao|title=Experts Discusses China’s Proposal|url=http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2013/08-17/5173552.shtml|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the igneous rock|other uses|Porphyry (disambiguation){{!}}Porphyry}}
'''Porphyry''' is a textural term for an [[igneous]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] consisting of large-grained [[crystal]]s such as [[feldspar]] or [[quartz]] dispersed in a fine-grained [[silicate]] rich, generally [[aphanitic]] [[matrix (geology)|matrix or groundmass]]. The larger crystals are called [[phenocryst]]s. In its non-geologic, traditional use, the term ''porphyry'' refers to the purple-red form of this stone, valued for its appearance.

The term ''porphyry'' is from [[Ancient Greek]] (πορφύρα ''porphúra'') and means "[[purple]]".  Purple was the color of royalty, and the "imperial porphyry" was a deep purple igneous rock with large crystals of [[plagioclase]]. Some authors claimed the rock  was the hardest known in antiquity.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"PORPHYRY" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 1701. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Imperial" grade porphyry was thus prized for monuments and building projects in [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and later. Porphyry typically has hardness 7 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} corresponding to steel and quartz. 

Subsequently, the name was given to any [[igneous rocks]] with large crystals. The adjective ''[[porphyritic]]'' now refers to a certain [[rock microstructure|texture]] of igneous rock regardless of its chemical and mineralogical composition. Its chief characteristic is a large difference in size between the tiny matrix crystals and the much larger phenocrysts. Porphyries may be [[aphanite]]s or [[phanerite]]s, that is, the groundmass may have invisibly small crystals as in [[basalt]], or crystals easily distinguishable with the eye, as in [[granite]].  Most types of igneous rocks display some degree of porphyritic texture.

== Formation ==
Porphyry deposits are formed when a column of rising [[magma]] is cooled in two stages. In the first stage, the magma is cooled slowly deep in the crust, creating the large crystal grains with a diameter of 2&amp;nbsp; mm or more. In the second and final stage, the magma is cooled rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a [[volcano]], creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.

=== Porphyry copper ===
{{main article|Porphyry copper}}
[[File:USGS PorphyryCu.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram of zonation in a porphyry copper deposit]]
The term porphyry is also used for a mineral deposit called a "copper porphyry".  The different stages of cooling that create porphyritic textures in intrusive and [[hypabyssal]] porphyritic rocks also lead to a separation of dissolved metals into distinct zones. 

This process, which occurs primarily when fluids are driven off the cooling magma, is one of the main reasons for the existence in the world of rich, localized metal ore deposits such as those of [[gold]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[zinc]], [[rhenium]] and [[tungsten]]. This enrichment occurs in the porphyry itself, or in other related igneous rocks or surrounding country rocks, especially [[carbonate rock]] (in a process similar to [[skarn]]s). Collectively, these type of deposits are known as "porphyry copper deposits".&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, R. and Skinner, B., 1979, Rocks and Rock Minerals, pg. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhomb porphyry ===
'''Rhomb porphyry''' is a [[volcanic rock]] with gray-white large [[porphyritic]] [[rhombus|rhomb-]] shaped [[phenocrysts]] embedded in a very fine-grained red-brown [[matrix (geology)|matrix]].  The composition of rhomb porphyry places it in the [[trachyte]]–[[latite]] classification of the [[QAPF diagram]].

Rhomb porphyry [[lava]]s are only known from three [[rift]] areas: the [[East African Rift]] (including [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]), [[Mount Erebus]] near the [[Ross Sea]] in [[Antarctica]], and the [[Oslo graben]] in [[Norway]]. It is intrusive.

== Uses ==
===Historical===
[[File:Venice – The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb| [[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|The Tetrarchs]], a porphyry sculpture sacked from the Byzantine ''[[Philadelphion]]'' palace in 1204, Treasury of St.&amp;nbsp;Marks, [[Venice]]]]
[[Pliny's Natural History]] affirmed that the "Imperial Porphyry" had been discovered at an isolated site in Egypt in AD&amp;nbsp;18, by a Roman legionary named Caius Cominius Leugas.&lt;ref name="Via Porphyrites"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199806/via.porphyrites.htm |title=Via Porphyrites |publisher=Saudi Aramco World |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians used other decorative porphyritic stones of a very close composition and appearance, but apparently remained unaware of the presence of the Roman grade although it was located in their own country. 

This particular Imperial grade of porphyry came from a [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|single quarry]] in the [[Eastern Desert]] of [[Egypt]], from 600 million-year-old [[andesite]] of the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]]. The road from the quarry westward to [[Qena]] (Roman Maximianopolis) on the Nile, which [[Ptolemy]] put on his second-century map, was first described by [[Strabo]], and it is to this day known as the ''Via Porphyrites'', the Porphyry Road, its track marked by the [[hydreuma]]ta, or watering wells that made it viable in this utterly dry landscape. 

Porphyry was extensively used in Byzantine imperial monuments, for example in [[Hagia Sophia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=KhpUAAAAMAAJ }} |title=Hagia Sophia |author=Emerson Howland Swift |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the "Porphyra", the official delivery room for use of pregnant Empresses in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=5ETkj98KKqYC |page=346 }} |title=The Great Palace Of Constantinople |author=A. G. Paspatēs |publisher= |date=2004-04-30 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fourth century the quarry was lost to sight for many centuries. The scientific members of the French Expedition under [[Napoleon]] sought it in vain, and it was only when the Eastern Desert was reopened for study under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] that the site was rediscovered by [[James Burton (Egyptologist)|James Burton]] and [[John Gardiner Wilkinson]] in 1823.

As early as 1850&amp;nbsp;BC on [[Crete]] in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Knossos]] there were large column bases made of porphyry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Michael Hogan|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes|title=''Knossos fieldnotes''|publisher=The  Modern Antiquarian|year=2007|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the porphyry columns in Rome, the red porphyry [[toga]]s on busts of [[emperor]]s, the porphyry panels in the revetment of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]],&lt;ref name="Via Porphyrites"/&gt; as well as the altars and vases and fountain basins reused in the [[Renaissance]] and dispersed as far as [[Kiev]], all came from the one quarry at ''Mons Porpyritis''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/projects.asp?ProjectID=34 |title=Archaeology |publisher=Arch.soton.ac.uk |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321020500/http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/projects.asp?ProjectID=34 |archivedate=2008-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Porphyry Mountain", the Arabic ''Jabal Abu Dukhan''), which seems to have been worked intermittently between 29 and 335 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/417/special.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Special: East of Edfu |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=1999-02-24 |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813210130/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/417/special.htm |archivedate=August 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyry was also used for the blocks of the [[Column of Constantine]] in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=cfRTip1qBJcC |page=9 |title=The Cambridge companion to the Age of Constantine, Volume 13 By Noel Emmanuel Lenski }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
In countries where many cars have studded winter tires such as Sweden, Finland and Norway, it is common that highways are paved with asphalt made of porphyry aggregate to make the wearing course withstand the extreme wear from the spiked tires.

''Rock Mechanics &amp; Rock Engineering'', Vol 50, Springer, Vienna, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00603-017-1305-0.&lt;/ref&gt; It expresses the quality of the rock mass for [[slope stability]] using the Q-slope value, from which long-term stable, reinforcement-free slope angles can be derived.

The Q-slope value can be determined with:

&lt;math&gt;Q_{slope}= \left ( \frac{RQD}{J_n} \right ) \times {\left ( \frac{J_r}{J_a} \right )_0} \times \left ( \frac{J_{wice}}{SRF_{slope}} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

Q-slope utilizes similar parameters to the [[Q-system (geotechnical engineering)|Q-system]]&lt;ref&gt;Barton, N.R.; Lien, R.; Lunde, J. (1974). "Engineering classification of rock masses for the design of tunnel support". ''Rock Mechanics and rock engineering.'' Vol. 6, Springer-Verlag, pp. 189-236.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been used for over 40 years in the design of ground support for [[tunnel]]s and underground excavations. The first four parameters, RQD ([[Core recovery parameters|rock quality designation]]), J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (joint set number), J&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (joint roughness number) and J&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (joint alteration number) are the same as in the Q-system. However, the [[friction|frictional]] resistance pair J&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and J&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; can apply, when needed, to individual sides of a potentially unstable wedges. Simply applied orientation factors (&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), like (J&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/J&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x0.7 for set J&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and (J&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;/J&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x0.9 for set J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, provide estimates of overall whole-wedge frictional resistance reduction, if appropriate. The Q-system term J&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced with J&lt;sub&gt;wice&lt;/sub&gt;, and takes into account a wider range of environmental conditions appropriate to rock slopes, which are exposed to the environment indefinitely. The conditions include the extremes of [[Erosion|erosive]] [[rainfall intensity|intense rainfall]], [[frost weathering|ice wedging]], as may seasonally occur at opposite ends of the rock-type and regional spectrum. There are also slope-relevant SRF (strength reduction factor) categories.

Multiplication of these terms results in the Q-slope value, which can range between 0.001 (exceptionally poor) to 1000 (exceptionally good) for different rock masses.

A simple formula for the steepest slope angle (β), in degrees, not requiring reinforcement or support is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\beta = 20\log_{10}Q_{slope}+65^\circ &lt;/math&gt;

Q-slope is intended for use in reinforcement-free site access road cuts, roads or railway cuttings, or individual benches in [[Open-pit mining|open cast mines]]. It is based on over 200 case studies in slopes ranging from 35 to 90 degrees in fresh hard rock slopes as well as weak, [[weathering|weathered]] and [[Saprolite|saprolitic]] rock slopes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Bar, N.; Barton, N.R. (2017). "The Q-slope Method for Rock Slope Engineering".

(eds.), ''Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering: From the Past to the Future Development of Rock Mechanics;'' Taylor &amp; Francis Group, London, pp. 585-590.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rock slope design techniques have been derived using Q-slope and geophysical survey data, primarily based on V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (P-wave velocity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar|first1=N.|last2=Barton|first2=N.R. (2018) |title=Rock Slope Design using Q-slope and Geophysical Survey Data|journal=Periodica Polytechnica Civil Engineering|doi=10.3311/PPci.12287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Q-slope is not intended as a substitute for conventional and more detailed slope stability analyses, where these are warranted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5280">Organized in 1990, '''Redwood Summer''' was a movement of [[Environmentalism|environmental activism]] aimed at protecting [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') trees from logging by northern [[California]] timber companies. The first official protest associated with Redwood Summer took place in June 1990 at the [[Louisiana Pacific]] export dock in [[Samoa, California|Samoa California]]. Beginning that same month logging companies organized "Right to Work Rallies" in support of the timber extraction industry. Redwood Summer is a part of the larger Timber Wars of the 1990s. "Timber Wars" is also the title of a book by [[Judi Bari]] documenting the protests over the decade.

A 1990 California Voter Initiative, Proposition 130 ("Forests Forever") was placed on the November 6, 1990 ballot.  The Redwood Summer organizers sought to disrupt logging until forest lands gained extra protection under Proposition 130. 

On May 24, 1990, [[Judi Bari]] and [[Darryl Cherney]] were driving through Oakland, California when a pipe bomb exploded directly under Bari's driver side seat. They were on a tour to recruit college students for Redwood Summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.judibari.org/ |title=Brief History of the Judi Bari Bombing Case |publisher=The Judi Bari Website |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film advocating the theory that the FBI placed the bomb, titled "[[Who Bombed Judi Bari|Who Bombed Judi Bari?]]" (not to be confused with the 1991 [[Stephen Talbot]] documentary of the same name) was released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/27/judi_bari_revisited_new_film_exposes| title=Judi Bari Revisited: New Film Exposes FBI Coverup of 1990 Car Bombing of California Environmentalist| publisher=Democracy Now!| date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/06/entertainment/la-et-mn-who-bombed-judi-barr-capsule-20121207| author=Sheri Linden| title=Review: 'Who Bombed Judi Bari?' wants to know| publisher=Los Angeles Times| date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/02/local/la-me-gs-judge-orders-testing-of-evidence-in-judi-bari-bombing-20120402| author=Dean Kuipers| title=Judge orders testing of evidence in Judi Bari bombing| publisher=Los Angeles Times| date=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the history of [[Earth First!]] had continually been controversial, Bari attempted to make Redwood Summer an act of nonviolent civil disobedience, rather than a flat-out confrontation. Protesters were asked to keep the demonstration free of items that may possible compromise this goal, such as alcohol, drugs, and weapons.&lt;ref name= "Talbot1990"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Talbot|first1=Stephen|title=Who Set the Bomb|publisher=Mother Jones|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of this intention Bari, and Redwood Summer, faced limited support from other environmental organizations. The Sierra Club refused to participate in the movement reportedly citing insurance and liability concerns.&lt;ref name= "Dunlap2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunlap|first1=Riley|title=American Environmentalism the US Environmental Movement, 1970-1990|date=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gail Lucas, who represented The Sierra Club in the matter, denounced Redwood Summer saying it could “generate strong antagonism”.&lt;ref name= "Talbot1990"/&gt; Bari did not feel that Lucas “represent[ed] the people who wrote the Forests Forever initiative, organized the Redwood Summer protests, or filed the grassroots lawsuits.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bari|first1=Judi|title=The Sierra Club Surrender|publisher=Anderson Valley Advertiser|date=March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental protection Information Center (EPIC) of Garberville, CA did not criticize the Redwood Summer movement or Earth First!, but needed to maintain “clean hands” should they be involved in a litigation with Maxxam, parent corporation of Pacific Lumber Company.&lt;ref name="Bevington2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bevington|first1=Douglas|title=American Environmentalism: Grassroots Activism from the Spotted Owl to the Polar Bear|date=2009|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, Redwood Summer lived up to its commitment of nonviolence, causing inconvenience to timber workers and slowing logging in demonstration areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forster|first1=David|title=Summer’ free of violence despite frayed tempers|publisher=The Times Standard|date=September 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its stated cooperative intentions the demonstrations tended to be confrontational, fueling animosity from timber workers, and sparked numerous counter protests.&lt;ref name="Dunlap2014"/&gt; Proposition 130 was defeated after an opposition campaign that highlighted Earth First! and Redwood Summer.  Over the next decade EPIC filled numerous lawsuits against timber companies in the area.&lt;ref name="Bevington2009"/&gt;

A '''riometer''' (commonly ''r''elative ''i''onospheric ''o''pacity meter, although originally: '''R'''elative '''I'''onospheric '''O'''pacity '''M'''eter for '''E'''xtra-'''T'''errestrial '''E'''missions of '''R'''adio noise&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite journal | first=C.G. | last=Little | first2=H. | last2=Leinbach |date=February 1959 | title=The Riometer - A Device for the Continuous Measurement of Ionospheric Absorption | journal=Proceedings of the IRE | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=315–320 | doi= 10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287299}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an instrument used to quantify the amount of electromagnetic-wave [[ionospheric absorption]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R.D | last=Hunsucker |author2=J.K Hargreaves | year=2003 | title=The High-Latitude Ionosphere and its Effects on Radio Propagation|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, a riometer measures the "opacity" of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In the absence of any ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a ''quiet-day curve.'' Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in [[decibels]]. Riometers are generally passive radio [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] operating in the [[VHF]] radio frequency range (~30-40&amp;nbsp;MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic [[synchrotron radiation]] and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.

==Description==
The riometer was developed in the mid 1950s by scientists at the [[University of Alaska]] who were researching the radio propagation effects of [[aurorae]].&lt;ref name="little" /&gt; At times aurorae resulted in complete failure of long distance radio communication to planes in the Arctic - a matter of considerable concern to the US Air Force at a time of tension with the Soviet Union{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Riometers are still used today for ionospheric research and are typically located in polar and sub-polar areas.

Initially, riometers were single, wide-beam detectors and measured the cosmic noise absorption (CNA). Multi-beam riometers have also been developed, which have multiple narrow beams, typically formed by a Butler matrix on a phased antenna array. Each beam forms its own riometer and has its own quiet-day curve determination. These individual beams form [[pixels]] on the sky allowing simple images of cosmic noise absorption to be formed.&lt;ref name="HonaryMarple2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honary|first1=F.|last2=Marple|first2=S.R.|last3=Barratt|first3=K.|last4=Chapman|first4=P.|last5=Grill|first5=M.|last6=Nielsen|first6=E.|title=Invited Article: Digital beam-forming imaging riometer systems|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=82|issue=3|year=2011|pages=031301|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.3567309}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, interferometry has been used to provide all-sky, spatially-continuous imaging of CNA.&lt;ref name="McKayFallows2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Fallows|first2=R.A.|last3=Norden|first3=M.|display-authors=etal|title=All-sky interferometric riometry|journal=Radio Science|volume=50|issue=10|year=2015|pages=1050–1061|issn=0048-6604|doi=10.1002/2015RS005709}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to use riometers to observe multiple frequencies (typically in the range 25-40&amp;nbsp;MHz). An inverse problem technique can be applied to the measurements to ascertain not just the absorption, but a model of the electron content as a function of sight distance.&lt;ref name="KeroVierinen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kero|first1=A.|display-authors=etal|title=Ionospheric electron density profiles inverted from a spectral riometer measurement|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=41|issue=15|year=2014|pages=5370–5375|issn=0094-8276|doi=10.1002/2014GL060986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SEG-Y''' (sometimes '''SEG Y''') [[file format]] is one of several standards developed by the [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] (SEG) for storing [[geophysics|geophysical]] data. It is an [[open standard]], and is controlled by the SEG Technical Standards Committee, a non-profit organization.

The format was originally developed in 1973 to store single-line [[seismic reflection]] digital data on [[magnetic tape]]s. The specification was published in 1975.&lt;ref name="rev0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barry |first=K.M. |author2=Cavers, D.A. |author3=Kneale, C.W.  |year=1975 |title=Recommended standards for digital tape formats |journal=Geophysics |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=344–352 |url=http://www.seg.org/documents/10161/77915/seg_y_rev0.pdf |doi=10.1190/1.1440530 |bibcode = 1975Geop...40..344B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format and its name evolved from the SEG "Ex" or Exchange Tape Format.&lt;ref name="rev0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Northwood |first=E.J. |author2=Weisinger, R.C. |author3=Bradley, J.J. |year=1967 |title=Recommended standards for digital tape formats |journal=Geophysics |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1073–1084 |url=http://www.seg.org/documents/10161/77915/seg_a_b_ex.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since its release, there have been significant advancements in geophysical data acquisition, such as 3-dimensional [[seismic]] techniques and high speed, high capacity recording.

The most recent revision of the SEG-Y format was published in 2017, named the ''rev 2.0'' specification.&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://seg.org/Portals/0/SEG/News%20and%20Resources/Technical%20Standards/seg_y_rev2_0-mar2017.pdf|title=SEG-Y_r2.0: SEG-Y revision 2.0 Data Exchange format|last=|first=|publisher=Society of Exploration Geophysicists|year=2017|isbn=|editor-last=Hagelund|editor-first=Rune|location=Tulsa, OK|pages=|editor2=Stewart A. Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still features certain [[Legacy system|legacies]] of the original format (referred as ''rev 0''), such as an optional SEG-Y tape label, the main 3200 [[byte]] textual [[EBCDIC]] [[character encoding|character encoded]] tape header and a 400 byte binary header.

[[Image:SEGY_file_byte_stream_structure.svg]]

This image shows the byte stream structure of a SEG-Y file, with rev 1 Extended Textual File Header records.

Many SEG-Y programs do not totally follow the specification.  For example, ODEC uses the opposite byte order and adds 320 bytes to the tail of each trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sioseis.ucsd.edu/diskin.html |title=SIOSEIS DISKIN Documentation |accessdate=2009-02-09 |publisher=Paul Henkart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Siberian Traps''' ({{lang-ru|Сибирские траппы}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Sibirskiye trappy}}) is a large region of [[volcanic rock]], known as a [[large igneous province]], in [[Siberia]], [[Russia]]. The massive eruptive event that formed the Traps is one of the largest-known [[Volcano|volcanic]] events that has occurred in the last {{Nowrap|500 million}} years.

The eruptions continued for roughly two million years and spanned the P–T boundary, or the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic boundary,]] which occurred between {{Mya|251|250}}.&lt;ref name="Yadong2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yadong|author2=Joachimski,Wignall,Yan,Chen,Jiang,Wang,La|date=October 27, 2013|title=Lethally Hot Temperatures During the Early Triassic Greenhouse|journal=Science|volume=338|pages=366–70|doi=10.1126/science.1224126|pmid=23087244|bibcode=2012Sci...338..366S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/science/new-studies-of-permian-extinction-shed-light-on-the-great-dying.html "New Studies of Permian Extinction Shed Light On the Great Dying"], [[New York Times]], April 30, 2012.

The source of the Siberian Traps basaltic rock has been attributed to a [[mantle plume]], which rose until it impacted against the bottom of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], producing volcanic eruptions through the [[Siberia (continent)|Siberian]] [[Craton]].&lt;ref name="Foulger2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html|title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy|author=Foulger, G.R.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that, as the Earth's [[Lithosphere|lithospheric]] [[Plate tectonics|plates]] moved over the mantle plume (the [[Iceland plume]]), the plume produced the Siberian Traps in the Permian and Triassic periods, later going on to produce volcanic activity on the floor of the Arctic Ocean in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]], and then generating volcanic activity in Iceland.&lt;ref name="Morgan&amp;Morgan20072"&gt;{{Citation|last=Morgan|first=W.

The main source of rock in this formation is basalt, but both [[mafic]] and [[felsic]] rocks are present, so this formation is officially called a Flood Basalt Province. The inclusion of mafic and felsic rock indicates multiple other eruptions that occurred and coincided with the one-million-year-long eruption that created the majority of the basaltic layers. The traps are divided into sections based on their chemical, stratigraphical, and petrographical composition.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ivanov|first=Alexei V.|last2=He|first2=Huayiu|last3=Yan|first3=Liekun|last4=Ryabov|first4=Viktor V.|last5=Shevko|first5=Artem Y.|last6=Palesskii|first6=Stanislav V.|last7=Nikolaeva|first7=Irina V.|title=Siberian Traps large igneous province: Evidence for two flood basalt pulses around the Permo-Triassic boundary and in the Middle Triassic, and contemporaneous granitic magmatism|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.04.001|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=122|pages=58–76|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.04.001|bibcode=2013ESRv..122...58I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on prehistoric life==

One of the major questions is whether the Siberian Traps were directly responsible for the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic mass extinction event]] that occurred 250 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erwin|first=Douglas H.|date=January 1994|title=The Permo-Triassic Extinction|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/367231a0|journal=Nature|volume=367|pages=231-236|via=Google Scholar|bibcode=1994Natur.367..231E|doi=10.1038/367231a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they were themselves caused by some other, larger event, such as an [[Impact event|asteroid impact]]. A recent hypothesis put forward is that the volcanism triggered the growth of &lt;i&gt;[[Methanosarcina]]&lt;/i&gt;, a microbe that then spewed enormous amounts of [[methane]] into Earth's atmosphere,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alm|first=Eric J.|last2=Boyle|first2=Edward A.|last3=Cao|first3=Changqun|last4=Fournier|first4=Gregory P.|last5=French|first5=Katherine L.|last6=Rothman|first6=Daniel H.|last7=Summons|first7=Roger E.|date=April 2014|title=Methanogenic Burst in the End-Permian Carbon Cycle|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/15/5462.short|journal=PNAS|volume=111|pages=5462-5467|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately altering the Earth's carbon cycle based on observations such as a significant increase of inorganic carbon reservoirs in marine environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

This extinction event, also called the Great Dying, affected all life on Earth, and is estimated to have killed about 95% of all species living at the time.&lt;ref name="Benton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benton M J|authorlink=Michael Benton|year=2005|title=When Life Nearly Died: The Greatest Mass Extinction of All Time|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28573-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/when-life-on-earth-was-nearly-extinguished.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Luann|last2=Poreda|first2=Robert J.|last3=Hunt|first3=Andrew G.|last4=Bunch|first4=Theodore E.|last5=Rampino|first5=Michael|date=23 Feb 2001|title=Impact Event at the Permian-Triassic Boundary: Evidence from Extraterrestrial Noble Gases in Fullerenes|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5508/1530|journal=Science|volume=291|pages=1530-1533|via=|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1530B|doi=10.1126/science.1057243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the disastrous events that impacted the Earth continued to repeat themselves on Earth 5 to 6 million years after the initial extinction occurred.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhong-Qiang|date=May 2012|title=The Timing and Pattern of Biotic Recovery Following the End-Permian Mass Extinction|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1475|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=5|pages=375-383|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time a small portion of the life that survived the extinction was able to repopulate and expand starting with low trophic levels (local communities) until the higher trophic levels (large habitats) were able to be re-established.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Calculations of sea water temperature from [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements indicate that at the peak of the extinction, the Earth underwent lethally hot global warming, in which equatorial ocean temperatures exceeded {{Convert|40|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yadong|last2=Joachimski|first2=Michael M.|last3=Wignall|first3=Paul B.|last4=Yan|first4=Chunbo|last5=Chen|first5=Yanlong|last6=Jiang|first6=Haishui|last7=Wang|first7=Lina|last8=Lai|first8=Xulong|date=19 Oct 2012|title=Lethally Hot Temperatures During the Early Triassic Greenhouse|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/366|journal=Science|volume=338|pages=366-370|via=|bibcode=2012Sci...338..366S|doi=10.1126/science.1224126}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took roughly 8 to 9 million years for any diverse ecosystem to be re-established; however, new classes of animals were established after the extinction that did not exist beforehand.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhong-Qiang|date=May 2012|title=The Timing and Pattern of Biotic Recovery Following the End-Permian Mass Extinction|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1475|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=5|pages=375-383|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palaeontological evidence further indicates that the global distribution of [[tetrapod]]s vanished, with very rare exceptions in the region of [[Pangaea]] that is today [[Utah]], between latitudes bounded by approximately 40°S to 30°N. The tetrapod gap of equatorial Pangaea coincides with an end-Permian to Middle Triassic global "coal gap" that indicates the loss of [[peat]] swamps. Peat formation, a product of high plant productivity, was reestablished only in the [[Anisian]] stage of the Triassic, and even then only in high southern latitudes, although [[gymnosperm]] forests appeared earlier (in the Early [[Olenekian|Spathian]]), but again only in northern and southern higher latitudes.&lt;ref name="Eureka"&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-01/ci-csv010912.php "Could Siberian volcanism have caused the Earth's largest extinction event?"], ''[[Eurekalert!]]'', 9 January 2012. Retrieved on 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In equatorial Pangaea, the establishment of conifer-dominated forests was not until the end of the Spathian, and the first coals at these latitudes did not appear until the [[Carnian]], around 15 million years after their end-Permian disappearance. These signals suggest equatorial temperatures exceeded their thermal tolerance for many [[marine vertebrates]] at least during two thermal maxima, whereas terrestrial equatorial temperatures were sufficiently severe to suppress plant and animal abundance during most of the Early Triassic.&lt;ref name = Yadong&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yadong|author2=Joachimski,Wignall,Yan,Chen,Jiang,Wang,La |title=Lethally Hot Temperatures During the Early Triassic Greenhouse|journal=Science|date=October 27, 2013|volume=338|pages=366–70|doi=10.1126/science.1224126|pmid=23087244|bibcode=2012Sci...338..366S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
The volcanism that occurred in the Siberian Traps resulted in copious amounts of magma being ejected from the Earth's crust—leaving permanent traces of rock from the same time period of the mass extinction that is able to be examined today.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Seth D.|last2=Bowring|first2=Samuel A.|date=28 August 2015|title=High-precision geochronology confirms voluminous magmatism before, during, and after the Earth's most severe extinction.|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/7/e1500470|journal=Earth Science|volume=1|pages=|via=Science Advances}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[zircon]] is found in some of the volcanic rocks. To further the accuracy of the age of the zircon, several varying aged pieces of zircon were organized into a timeline based on when they crystallized.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Seth D.|last2=Bowring|first2=Samuel A.|date=28 August 2015|title=High-precision geochronology confirms voluminous magmatism before, during, and after the Earth's most severe extinction.|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/7/e1500470|journal=Earth Science|volume=1|pages=|via=Science Advances}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CA-TIMS technique, a chemical abrasion age-dating technique that eliminates variability in accuracy due to lead depletion in zircon over time,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattinson|first=James M.|date=July 2005|title=Zircon U-Pb chemical abrasion ("CA-TIMS") method: Combined annealing and multi-step partial dissolution analysis for improved precision and accuracy of zircon ages|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254105001452|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=220|pages=47-66|via=Elsevier|bibcode=2005ChGeo.220...47M|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2005.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was then used to accurately determine the age of the zircons found in the Siberian Traps. Eliminating the variability due to lead, the CA-TIMS age-dating technique allowed [[uranium]] within the zircon to be the centre focus in linking the volcanism in the Siberian Traps that resulted in high amounts of magmatic material with the Permian–Triassic mass extinction.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

To further the connection between the Permian–Triassic extinction event, other disastrous events occurred around the same time period, such as sea level changes, meteor impacts and volcanism.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Luann|last2=Poreda|first2=Robert J.|last3=Hunt|first3=Andrew G.|last4=Bunch|first4=Theodore E.|last5=Rampino|first5=Michael|date=23 Feb 2001|title=Impact Event at the Permian-Triassic Boundary: Evidence from Extraterrestrial Noble Gases in Fullerenes|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5508/1530|journal=Science|volume=291|pages=1530-1533|via=|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1530B|doi=10.1126/science.1057243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically focusing on volcanism, rock samples from the Siberian Traps and other southern regions were obtained and compared.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=M.B., et al.|date=January 2009|title=The Timing and Extent of the Eruption of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province: Implications for the End-Permian Environmental Crisis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08006389|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=277|pages=9-20|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basalts and [[gabbro]] samples from several southern regions close to and from the Siberian Traps were dated based on argon isotope 40 and argon isotope 39 age-dating methods.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; [[Feldspar]] and [[biotite]] was specifically used to focus on the samples age and duration of the presence magma from the volcanic event in the Siberian Traps.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The majority of the basalt and gabbro samples dated to 250 million years ago, covered a surface area of five million square kilometres on the Siberian Traps&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; and occurred within a short period of time with rapid rock solidification/cooling.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basu|first=A.R.|last2=Renne|first2=P.R.|date=July 1991|title=Rapid Eruption of the Siberian Traps Flood Basalts at the Permo-Triassic Boundary|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/253/5016/176|journal=Science|volume=253|pages=176-179|via=Google scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies confirmed that samples of gabbro and basalt from the same time period of the Permian–Triassic event from the other southern regions also matched the age of samples within the Siberian Traps. This confirms the assumption of the linkage between the age of volcanic rocks within the Siberian Traps, along with rock samples from other southern regions to the Permian–Triassic mass extinction event.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Sinus Medii''' ("Central Bay") is a small [[lunar mare]]. It takes its name from its location at the intersection of the [[Moon]]'s [[equator]] and [[prime meridian]]; as seen from the [[Earth]], this feature is located in the central part of the Moon's near side, and it is the point closest to the Earth. From this spot the Earth would always appear directly overhead, although the planet's position would vary slightly due to [[libration]].

During the [[Apollo program]], Sinus Medii was desingated ALS3. Flight operations planners were concerned about having the optimum lighting conditions at the landing site, hence alternative landing sites moved progressively westward, following the terminator. A delay of two days for weather or equipment reasons would have sent [[Apollo 11]] to Sinus Medii instead of ALS2, [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]; another two-day delay would have resulted in ALS5, a site in [[Oceanus Procellarum]], being targeted.

==Geology==
[[File:Sinus Medii 2093 med.jpg|thumb|left|Oblique view facing south of central Sinus Medii from [[Lunar Orbiter 2]], showing Bruce crater at right and Oppolzer crater above left]]
[[File:Sinus Medii AS16-M-0842.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Oblique view facing north from [[Apollo 16]]]]

The selenographic [[coordinate]]s of Sinus Medii are {{Lunar coords and quad cat|2.4|N|1.7|E}}, and its diameter is 335&amp;nbsp;km. It joins [[Mare Insularum]] in the west with [[Mare Vaporum]] to the north.

The eastern part of this area is notable for a series of [[rille]] systems. In the far northeast is the [[Rima Hyginus]], which is bisected by the crater [[Hyginus (crater)|Hyginus]]. At the far eastern end is the 220-km long [[Rima Ariadaeus]] rille which continues eastward to the edge of the [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]. At longitudes 4-6° E is the [[Rimae Triesnecker]] rille system, named after the crater [[Triesnecker (crater)|Triesnecker]] just to the west.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The northern edge of the Sinus Medii is formed by a highland region, with the impact craters [[Murchison (crater)|Murchison]] and [[Pallas (crater)|Pallas]] along the border. Near the northern border on this mare is the cup-shaped [[Chladni (crater)|Chladni]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Another highland region lies to the south and southeastern edge of the Sinus Medii. Several flooded craters lie along this border, with [[Flammarion (lunar crater)|Flammarion]] near the western edge, then [[Oppolzer (crater)|Oppolzer]], [[Réaumur (crater)|Réaumur]], and [[Seeliger (crater)|Seeliger]] further east. The [[Rima Flammarion]] and [[Rima Oppolzer]] [[rille]]s lie along the edge of the mare near their corresponding craters. Also along the southeast border and bisecting the prime meridian is the crater [[Rhaeticus (crater)|Rhaeticus]].

In the western half of the interior are the small craters [[Bruce (crater)|Bruce]] and [[Blagg (crater)|Blagg]]. Near the western end of the mare are the flooded craters [[Schröter (lunar crater)|Schröter]] and [[Sömmering (crater)|Sömmering]].

==Names==
[[Image:Langrenus map of the Moon 1645.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Michael Van Langren|Langren's]] map (1645), on which the name ''Sinus Medius'' first appeared]]
The English astronomer [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] was the first to give a name to this mare, calling it Insula Medilunaria ("Middlemoon Island").&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for its present name originates with [[Michael Van Langren]], who labelled it Sinus Medius in his 1645 map.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.41, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Hevelius]] called the feature Mare Adriaticum ("The [[Adriatic Sea]]") in his 1647 map.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.53, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hevelius_1647/&gt; [[Giovanni Riccioli]] called it Sinus Aestuum ("Bay of Hot Days") in his 1651 map.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A.

==Exploration==
[[Image:Surveyor 6 Fig 7-41d2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mosaic of the mare surface from Surveyor 6]]
The [[Surveyor 6]] mission landed to the west-southwest of [[Bruce (crater)|Bruce]] crater inside Sinus Medii in November 1967.  Prior to that in July 1967, the [[Surveyor 4]] had crashed nearby.

The '''Stabilization fund of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|Стабилизационный фонд Российской Федерации}})&lt;!--Stabilizatsionny fond Rossiyskoy Federatsi--&gt; was
established based on a [[Order of the Government of Russia|resolution]] of the [[Government of Russia]] on 1 January 2004, as a part of the [[Federal budget of Russia|federal budget]] to balance the federal budget at the time of when [[oil price]] falls below a cut-off price, currently set at US$27 per barrel. In February 2008 the Stabilization Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalization101.org/k-the-russian-stablization-fund/ Russia's Stabilization Fund], Globalization 101, a project of SUNY LEVIN Institute, retrieved on 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; was split into a [[Russian Reserve Fund|Reserve Fund]], which is invested abroad in low-yield securities and used when oil and gas incomes fall, and the [[Russian National Wealth Fund|National Welfare Fund]], which invests in riskier, higher return vehicles, as well as federal budget expenditures. The Reserve Fund was given $125 billion and the National Welfare Fund was given $32 billion. By the end of 2016 the two funds consisted respectively of $38.2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/swfs/russia-reserve-fund/|title=Russia Reserve Fund on SWFI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 72.2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/swfs/national-welfare-fund/|title=National Welfare Fund on SWFI}}&lt;/ref&gt; billion.  

The Fund was created to create a reserve of [[liquidity]] with the additional benefit of reducing [[inflation]]ary pressure and insulating the [[economy of Russia]] from volatility of raw material export earnings, which was among the reasons of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. To prevent high inflation rates the fund is invested into abroad only.

==Recent developments==
According to amendments to [[Budget Code of Russia|Russia’s budget code]] inspired by President [[Vladimir Putin]]’s budget address of March 2007 and passed in April 2007, in February 2008 the Stabilization Fund was supposed to be split into a Reserve Fund, to be invested abroad in low-yield securities and used when oil and gas incomes fall, and a Future Generations’ Fund (later renamed the [[Russian National Wealth Fund|National Wealth Fund]]), which will invest in riskier, higher return vehicles, as well as federal budget expenditures. Unlike the Stabilization Fund, the new funds will also accumulate revenues from oil products and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/business/20070411/63487391.html RIA Novosti - Business - Russia's Duma approves Stabilization Fund transformation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20070427/64535324.html RIA Novosti - Opinion &amp; analysis - Putin's address leaves philosophy aside&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-adv/specialsale/spotlight/russia07/russia.html International Spotlight: Russia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2007, President [[Vladimir Putin]] urged the government to pump surplus oil revenue into domestic stocks by buying Russian blue chips such as [[Gazprom]] and [[Rosneft]], which had fallen since the beginning of the year, instead of foreign securities, which previously had been explicitly forbidden due to fear of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/21/bloomberg/bxputin.php Putin wants oil revenue to go into Russian stock market - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accumulation and expenditure==
The Fund accumulates revenues from the export duty for oil and the tax on
oil mining operations when the price for Urals oil exceeds the set cut-off price.

The capital of the Fund may be used to cover the federal [[budget deficit]] and
for other purposes, if its balance exceeds 500 billion [[Russian ruble|rubles]], spending amounts are subject to the federal budget law for the corresponding [[fiscal year]].

As the capital of the Fund had exceeded the level of 500 billion rubles in
2005, part of its surplus was used for early [[foreign debt]] repayments as well as to
cover Russian Pension Fund's deficit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/171417/national-debt-of-russia-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product/ Statistics on the National Debt in Russia in relation to GDP from 2002 to 2012], World Economic Outlook Database, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The details of these transactions in 2005 are

==Investment Policy==

===Governance Structure===

The Fund is managed by the [[Ministry of Finance (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Finance]], in accordance with the procedure defined by the Government of the Russian Federation. Some functions of asset management may be delegated to the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation]] ("the Bank of Russia"), based on its agreement with the Government.

Concerning the Fund's objectives, its capital is to be invested in foreign sovereign debt securities. Securities' eligibility criteria are subject to the Government's approval.

The Ministry of Finance is empowered by the Government to establish the
Fund's currency composition and its strategic asset allocation in line with the
investment policy for the Fund's management.

The Ministry of Finance may use one or both of the following schemes
defined by the Government to invest the Fund's capital.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Schemes defined by the Government to invest the Fund's capital
|-
| Investment in eligible foreign fixed income securities directly
|-
| Allocation to the Federal Treasury's accounts with the Bank of Russia in foreign currency, with the total return of these accounts based on indices composed of eligible foreign debt securities and defined by the Ministry of
Finance.
|}
The Fund assets are currently invested solely under second scheme
(allocation to the Federal Treasury's accounts with the Bank of Russia).

===Investment Guidelines===
The Government determined that eligible debt securities for the Fund investment are to correspond to the following requirements.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Fixed income securities of Austria, Belgium, [[Finland]], France, Germany, [[Greece]], Ireland, Italy, [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, denominated in [[US dollar]]s, [[euro]], [[GB pound]]s (sovereign debt securities)
|-
| Issuer shall have a long-term [[credit rating]] at AAA/Aaa level (highest investment grade) from at least two of the following three rating agencies: [[Moody's Investors Service]], [[Standard and Poor's]], [[Fitch Ratings]]
|-
| Minimum amount outstanding of a candidate security: 1 billion US dollars, 1 billion euro, 500 million GB pound respectively
|-
| Securities shall be [[Bullet strategy]]
|-
| Securities shall have no call or put options
|-
| Fixed coupon type if a coupon bond
|-
| Not for private placement
|}

Debt securities on the date of purchase will have a minimum remaining maturity of 0,25 years and are not to exceed three years.

'''The Fund assets are currently invested in the following currency composition:'''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| align="left" | US dollars|| |45%
|-
| align="left" | Euro|| |45%
|-
| align="left" | GB pounds|| |10%
|}

Currency composition and the maturity restrictions are applicable to all Fund's assets and are subject to revisions by the Ministry of Finance.

==Reporting==

The Ministry of Finance publishes a monthly report in [[Media of Russia|mass media]] on the
Fund's accumulation, spending and balance and reports quartelry and annually to the Government
on accumulation, investment and spending of the Fund's capital.
The Government will report quarterly and annually on the Fund's accumulation,
spending and investment of capital to both chambers of the
[[Russian Parliament]] ([[State Duma]] and [[Federation Council of Russia|Council of Federation]]).

A '''swamp''' is a [[wetland]] that is forested.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations.&lt;ref name="Hughes, F.M.R. 2003"&gt;Hughes, F.M.R. (ed.). 2003. The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests. FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, D.A, Thompson, T.A., Booth, R.K. and Nicholas, J.R. 2007. Lake-level variability and water availability in the Great Lakes. USGS Circular 1311. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some swamps have [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]], or dry-land protrusions, covered by [[aquatic vegetation]], or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/fringe/glossary.html Swamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610150754/http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/fringe/glossary.html |date=2007-06-10 }} (from glossary web page of the [[United States Geological Survey]])&lt;/ref&gt; or soil saturation. The two main types of swamp are "true" or [[Freshwater swamp forest|swamp forest]]s and "transitional" or [[shrub swamp]]s. In the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a [[bog]], [[fen]], or [[muskeg]]. The water of a swamp may be [[fresh water]], [[brackish water]] or [[seawater]]. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the [[Congo River|Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., L.H. Fraser, A.I. Solomeshch, W.J. Junk, D.R. Campbell, M.T.K. Arroyo and C.J.R. Alho. 2009. Wet and wonderful: the world's largest wetlands are conservation priorities. BioScience 59: 39–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between marshes and swamps==

A [[marsh]] is a wetland composed mainly of grasses and reeds found near the fringes of lakes and streams, serving as a transitional area between land and aquatic ecosystems. A swamp is a wetland composed of trees and shrubs found along large rivers and lake shores.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-difference-between-marshes-and-swamps.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomorphology and hydrology==

Swamps are characterized by slow-moving to stagnant waters. Many adjoin [[river]]s or [[lake]]s. Swamps are features of areas with very low [[Terrain#Relief|topographic relief]].

==Draining==

Historically, humans have drained swamps to provide additional land for [[agriculture]] and to reduce the threat of diseases borne by swamp insects and similar animals.{{clarify|date=November 2013}}&lt;!--diseases borne by...similar animals??--&gt;&lt;ref name="Dugan, P. 2005"&gt;Dugan, P. (ed.) 2005. Guide to Wetlands. Buffalo, New York. Firefly Books. 304 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Many swamps have also undergone intensive logging, requiring the construction of drainage ditches and canals. These ditches and canals contributed to drainage and, along the coast, allowed salt water to intrude, converting swamps to [[marsh]] or even to open water.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;  Large areas of swamp were therefore lost or degraded. [[Louisiana]] provides a classic example of wetland loss from these combined factors.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.  Environmental Reviews 15: 1- 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe has probably lost nearly half its wetlands.&lt;ref name="Dugan, P. 2005"/&gt; New Zealand lost 90 percent of its wetlands over a period of 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, M. and Clarkson, B. 2010. Wetland Restoration: A Handbook for New Zealand Freshwater Systems. Manaaki Whenua Press, Lincoln, N.Z. {{ISBN|978-0-478-34707-4}} (online)&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists recognise that swamps provide valuable ecological services including flood control, fish production, water purification, carbon storage, and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In many parts of the world authorities protect swamps.  In parts of Europe and North America, swamp restoration projects are becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Hughes, F.M.R. 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Environment Canada. 2004. How Much Habitat is Enough? A Framework for Guiding Habitat Rehabilitation in Great Lakes Areas of Concern. 2nd ed. 81 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the simplest steps to restoring swamps involve plugging drainage ditches and removing [[levee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land value, productivity and conservation==

Swamps and other [[wetlands]] have traditionally held a very low [[property value]] compared to fields, [[prairie]]s, or [[woodland]]s. They have a reputation for being unproductive land that cannot easily be utilized for human activities, other than perhaps [[hunting]] and [[animal trapping|trapping]]. Farmers, for example, typically drained swamps next to their fields so as to gain more land usable for planting crops.

Many societies now realize that swamps are critically important to providing [[fresh water]] and [[oxygen]] to all life, and that they are often breeding grounds for a wide variety of species. Indeed, floodplain swamps are extremely important in fish production.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe-McConnell, R. H. (1975). Fish Communities in Tropical Fresh waters: Their Distribution, Ecology and Evolution. London: Long man&lt;/ref&gt; Government environmental agencies (such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]) are taking steps to protect and preserve swamps and other wetlands. In Europe, major effort is being invested in the restoration of swamp forests along rivers.&lt;ref name="Hughes, F.M.R. 2003"/&gt; Conservationists work to preserve swamps such as those in northwest Indiana in the United States [[Midwest]] that were preserved as part of the [[Indiana Dunes]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S. &amp; Mark, S.

In Asia, tropical peat swamps are located in mainland East Asia and Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, peatlands are mainly found in low altitude coastal and sub-coastal areas and extend inland for distance more than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} along river valleys and across watersheds. They are mostly to be found on the coasts of East Sumatra, Kalimantan (Central, East, South and West Kalimantan provinces), West Papua, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Peninsular Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak, Southeast Thailand, and the Philippines (Riley ''et al.'',1996). Indonesia has the largest area of tropical peatland. Of the total {{convert|440000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} tropical peat swamp, about {{convert|210000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} are located in Indonesia (Page, 2001; Wahyunto, 2006).

The [[Vasyugan Swamp]] is a large swamp in the western [[Siberia]] area of the [[Russian Federation]]. This is one of the largest swamps in the world, covering an area larger than [[Switzerland]].

The [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya Swamp]] at the lower  end of the Mississippi River is the largest swamp in the [[United States]]. It is an important example of southern cypress swamp&lt;ref&gt;Conner, W. H. and Buford, M. A. (1998). Southern deepwater swamps. In Southern Forested Wetlands: Ecology and Management, eds. M. G. Messina and W. H. Conner, pp. 261–87. Boca Raton, FL: Lewis Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been greatly altered by logging, drainage and levee construction.&lt;ref&gt;Reuss, M. (1998). Designing the Bayous: The Control of Water in the Atchafalaya Basin 1800–1995. Alexandria, VA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Office of History.&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous swamps in the United States are the forested portions of the [[Everglades]], [[Okefenokee Swamp]], [[Barley Barber Swamp]], [[Great Cypress Swamp]] and the [[Great Dismal Swamp]]. The Okefenokee is located in extreme southeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and extends slightly into northeastern [[Florida]]. The [[Great Cypress Swamp]] is mostly in [[Delaware]] but extends into [[Maryland]] on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]. [[Point Lookout State Park]] on the southern tip of Maryland contains a large amount of swamps and marshes. The [[Great Dismal Swamp]] lies in extreme southeastern [[Virginia]] and extreme northeastern [[North Carolina]]. Both are [[National Wildlife Refuge]]s. Another swamp area, [[Reelfoot Lake]] of extreme western [[Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky]], was created by the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]]. [[Caddo Lake]], the Great Dismal and Reelfoot are swamps that are centered at large lakes. Swamps are often called ''[[bayou]]s'' in the [[southeastern United States]], especially in the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] region.

The '''UK Energy Research Centre''' ('''UKERC''') is the focal point for UK research on [[sustainable energy]], and is central to the [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils']] Energy Programme.&lt;ref name=ukerc-about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=About_us&amp;structure=Home|title=About us|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre has its headquarters at the campus of [[Imperial College, London]], providing support to 70 researchers based in 11 universities and research institutions across the UK: UCL; Strathclyde; Leeds; Imperial College London; Exeter; Sussex; the University of East Anglia; the Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Cardiff; Oxford; Aberdeen.

The organisation takes an independent, whole-systems approach, drawing on technical and non-technical disciplines including engineering, economics and the physical, environmental and social sciences. The Centre helps to co-ordinate the overall UK [[energy research]] effort and acts as a bridge between the UK energy research community, the international research community, business and policymakers.&lt;ref name=ukerc-about /&gt;

==History==
UKERC was established in April 2004, following a recommendation from the 2002 Energy Review initiated by Sir David King, the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/about-us/history.html|title=History|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was set up to address key controversies in the energy field through comprehensive assessments of the current state of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012004031/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 |date=2009-10-12 }}, page i, August 2009, published October 08, 2009, UK Energy Research Centre, {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the Centre ran from 2004 - 2009.

In March 2009, £18.5 million was allocated to support the second phase of work at the UK Energy Research Centre for 2009 – 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2009/07-ukerp.asp £18 million to secure the future of UK energy research], July 2009, NERC&lt;/ref&gt; Under the second phase of funding, UKERC focused on five themes: Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Energy Systems, Energy and Environment, and Technology and Policy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Research|title=Programmes|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the UK Energy Research Centre was awarded funding for a third phase of work, which would run from 2014 to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/ukenergyresearchcentre/|title=RCUK commits £14 million to UK Energy Research Centre - EPSRC website|website=www.epsrc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Activity==
UKERC's third phase combines a research programme focused on six core themes: future energy system pathways; resources and vectors; energy systems at multiple scales; energy, economy and societal preferences; decision making; technology, policy and assessment - with an HQ function aimed at engaging with the wider UK energy research community, policy makers and energy industry. 

The Centre acts as the bridge between the UK energy research community and the wider world; fulfilling the role of a national energy research laboratory by both informing and representing the energy research community and acting as a catalyst for UK-wide collaboration in order to address the key energy challenges ahead.

UKERC's interdisciplinary research studentships have enabled whole-systems interdisciplinary research across scientific, engineering and socio-economic boundaries.

Full details of all UKERC's activities and research output can be found at UKERC's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk|title=UKERC|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Atlas===
UKERC's Research Atlas is an information resource for current and past UK energy research and development activity. The online database has information on energy-related research capabilities in the UK and a series of energy roadmaps showing research problems to be overcome before new technologies can be made commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukerc.rl.ac.uk/|title=UKERC Energy Data Centre|website=ukerc.rl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===National Energy Research Network (NERN)===
The National Energy Research Network (NERN) is open to all energy researchers and other sectors, including business, and provides updates on news, jobs, events, opportunities and developments across the energy field in the form of a weekly newsletter.

===Summer School===
UKERC runs an annual '''Summer School''', which runs for a week and combines seminars from internationally leading speakers with project work and professionally facilitated developmental activities.

'''Uraš''' or '''Urash''', in [[Sumerian mythology]], is a goddess of earth, and one of the consorts of the sky god [[Anu]]. She is the mother of the goddess [[Ninsun]] and a grandmother of the [[hero]] [[Gilgamesh]].

However, ''Uras'' may only have been another name for [[Antum]], Anu's wife.&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Horowitz|title=Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA231|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-99-7|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Uras'' even became applied to Anu himself, and acquired the meaning "heaven".&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"/&gt; [[Ninurta]] also was apparently called ''Uras'' in later times.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Anthony Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pr8-i1iFnIQC&amp;pg=PA182|year=1992|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70794-8|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
