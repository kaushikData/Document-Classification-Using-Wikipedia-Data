'''Afghan Football Club Chaman''' or '''Afghan FC''' are a [[football (soccer)]] club playing in the [[Pakistan Premier League]] (PPL). The club is based in [[Chaman]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]], a border city near [[Afghanistan]]. The Afghan Club plays at their homeground Jamal Nasir Stadium in Chaman.

In 2000, Afghan FC Chaman played in an invitation tour at [[Kandahar Stadium]], Afghanistan, against a local team from [[Kandahar]]. During the third and final game of the tour, Taliban religious police burst into the ground and stopped the game in the middle. The Taliban arrested twelve of the Afghan FC Chaman players and had their heads shaved as punishment for wearing shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/18/rorymccarthy |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |title=Taliban send off footballers in shorts |first=Rory |last=McCarthy |date=July 18, 2000 |access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghan FC Chaman are founding members of the Pakistan Premier League. Afghan FC avoided relegation in the 2006–07 season, finishing in 9th spot, 2 points above [[Wohaib F.C.]] who edged out [[HBL F.C.]] to survive as well.

'''K.B. Bashkimi''', also known as '''Bashkimi''' or '''Bashkimi Prizren''', is a basketball club created in 1945, in [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo]]. Since 1991, Bashkimi is competing in [[Kosovo]]'s first division [[Kosovo Basketball Superleague|IP Superliga]].

==History==
Bashkimi is the oldest basketball team in Kosovo, and one of the oldest in the Balkans, being founded as early as 1945. That makes them older than all the current teams in the NBA, and many of the greatest basketball teams in Europe. It has traditionally been the most representative sports team of the city of Prizren. Initially competing in the ex-Yugoslavian competitions, Bashkimi was to join the first season of the Kosovo Basketball League. Orange and black have traditionally been the team's colours, and the current logo is also the oldest and the only one that can be found in team's archive. Bashkimi is one of Kosovo's greatest basketball teams, forming a traditional "big four" together with Prishtina, Peja and Trepca. Nevertheless, it has been a while since Bashkimi has won a trophy for the last time. The last trophy won by the team was the League Cup back in 2002/03 season. 2014/15 was the first season to see Bashkimi participating in an international competition, when the team joined the regional Balkan League.

The best-known players of the team since its founding include [[Davor Pejčinović]], Johny Philips, Lee Benson, Schin Kerr, Vedran Bosnic, Billy Armstrong, Bledar Gjeqaj, and [[William Njoku]].

'''Baujan Field''' is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] located in [[Dayton, Ohio]] on the [[University of Dayton]] campus. Its main tenants are the [[Dayton Flyers men's soccer|Dayton Flyers men's]] and women's soccer teams.  

It was originally built in 1925 as UD's main athletic field, and was named in honor of longtime head football coach [[Harry Baujan]] in 1961.  After the football team moved to [[Welcome Stadium]] in 1974, the concrete grandstand was torn down, and it was retrofitted for soccer.  Bleachers were the only seats available from then until 2000, when a terraced seating section was carved into the hillside.

'''Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Boughton, Cheshire]]. The ground is located in grounds which formerly belonged to [[Boughton Hall]]. The ground is located off Boughton Hall Avenue, with the [[Shropshire Union Canal]] to the north. The ground is used by [[Chester Boughton Hall Cricket Club]].

==History==
The first recorded match held on the ground was in 1886, when Boughton Hall played Huyton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/406_misc.html|title=Other matches played on Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground, Chester|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheshire County Cricket Club|Cheshire]] first used the ground in 1910 when they played [[Northumberland County Cricket Club|Northumberland]] in the [[Minor Counties Championship]].&lt;ref name="MCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/406_minc.html|title=Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground, Chester|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to and after [[World War I]], Cheshire played a match annually at the ground, until [[World War II]]. Following the war Cheshire returned to the ground in 1951, however this would be their last match there until 1970.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; In 1972, the ground was selected as a home venue for [[Minor Counties North]] in the [[1972 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]], where the team played a single [[List A cricket|List A]] match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="LAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/406_a.html|title=List A Matches played on Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground, Chester|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 to 1988, the ground held one Minor Counties Championship match annually.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt;

Cheshire played their first List A match at the venue in the first round of the [[1988 NatWest Trophy]],&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; which saw them record a famous victory against [[first-class cricket|first-class]] opponents [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/50/50142.html|title=List A Matches played on Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground, Chester|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cheshire lost their second round match held at Boughton Hall against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]. The following season, Cheshire played a further List A match there against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in the [[1989 NatWest Trophy]], which ended in defeat.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; Cheshire played their first [[MCCA Knockout Trophy]] match there in 1992 against Northumberland,&lt;ref name="MCCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/406_mint.html|title=Minor Counties Trophy Matches played on Boughton Hall Cricket Club Ground, Chester|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Minor Counties Championship cricket returning there in 1993 when [[Dorset County Cricket Club|Dorset]] visited the ground.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; List A cricket returned to the ground in the [[1995 NatWest Trophy]] when [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] defeated Cheshire, while in the [[1998 NatWest Trophy]] the same opponents visited, with Essex once again triumphing.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; The ground was used infrequently by Cheshire in [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|minor counties]] during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCCA"/&gt;

Cheshire's first match there in the 21st century came against [[Lincolnshire County Cricket Club|Lincolnshire]] in a List A match in the [[2000 NatWest Trophy]], which Lincolnshire won.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; The ground held its final List A match in first round of the [[2002 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]] when Cheshire played the [[Lancashire Cricket Board]], with the match held in 2001 to avoid fixture congestion in 2002.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; Cheshire won by 8 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/72/72857.html|title=Cheshire v Lancashire Cricket Board, 2002 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheshire played a total of seven List A matches at the ground, winning two and losing five. Minor counties cricket returned in 2003, with Cheshire playing a single Minor Counties Championship match annually since then.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; Three MCCA Knockout Trophy matches have been played there since 2007, all with [[Devon County Cricket Club|Devon]] as the opposition.&lt;ref name="MCCA"/&gt;

'''Braly Municipal Stadium''' is a 14,215-seat [[stadium]] in [[Florence, Alabama]].  It is primarily used for [[American football]], and is the home field of the [[University of North Alabama]] Lions and the Florence High School Falcons. It also hosted the [[NCAA Division II Football Championship]] games from 1986–2013, which were broadcast on [[ESPN]]. UNA holds a 252-114-8 record at Braly Stadium. It has also hosted 30 of UNA's 47 Division II Playoff games.&lt;ref name="braly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Braly Stadium|url=http://una.sidearmsports.com/facilities/?id=2|website=The Official Athletics Site of the University of North Alabama Lions|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The stadium is a block east of the university campus and adjacent to the Florence Middle School/Freshman Center. The middle school was formerly Coffee High School, but was transformed in 2004 when Florence's two public high schools merged.  Braly is named for Thomas Braly, Jr., a Coffee High School coach who was principal of the school from 1945 until his death in 1963.&lt;ref name="braly"/&gt;

==Facilities==
[[Seating capacity]] has increased by 6,200 seats since 1980 (5,000 in 1980 and 1,200 in 1998). The original playing surface featured a sand foundation that enabled the field to withstand six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) of rain at one time without altering the footing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Braly Stadium|url=http://www.d2championship.com/Braly_Stadium/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125001451/http://www.d2championship.com/Braly_Stadium/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 November 2005|website=d2championship.com|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, that surface was replaced with ProGrass synthetic turf during the summer of 2010.

Other renovations include a $175,000 scoreboard with a message center installed in 1995 and a 1998 renovation that doubled the working press area as well as provided additional restrooms and viewing booths for game administration. The 1995 scoreboard was replaced in 2010 with a $57,000 LED based scoreboard along with a new elevator to the press box and a resealing of the running track around the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Board Ready for Friday's Jamboree|url=http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20100819/news/100819835?|website=timesdaily.com|accessdate=7 July 2017}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new three-level press box consists of a first level that seats up to 50 sportswriters.  The second level has areas for coaching staffs from competing schools, the public address announcer, the clock operator, the stadium manager, and also provides space for radio crews from both home and visiting teams.  The third floor is used by television and film crews.

'''''Diceball!''''' is a baseball [[board game]] where two players roll the dice to face each other on a baseball field. Just like in [[baseball]], there is a visiting team and a home team. Both players use the dice to throw the baseball from the mound to the plate and field the ball on defense. Diceball! was designed to mirror the statistical reality of baseball. A regular game of Diceball! (without [[extra innings]]) lasts on average 45 minutes.

==History==

The game was designed on a pizza box by a 16-year old from [[Rawdon, Québec]], [[Daniel Girard]], in 1979, while the [[Montreal Expos]] were chasing the pennant in the [[National League]]. Daniel Girard brought his game to his High School, where he organized tournaments with other students. Given the popularity of the game in his school, Girard also brought his game to University where it caught fire too. 
The interest created by the game was noticed by an entrepreneur, [[Louis Desjardins]]. Louis Desjardins decided to launch the game alongside Daniel Girard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiManno|first1=Rosie|title=Fun doodle leads to hit baseball board game|journal=The Toronto Star|date=January 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roseman|first1=Ellen|title=As you pass Go, put up $100,000|journal=The Globe and Mail|date=December 20, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapointe1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lapointe |first1=Josée |title=Baseball dé-joué |journal=Le Soleil |date=February 16, 1996 |page=C1–C2 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arcand1992&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arcand |first1=Denis |title=Un jeu de baseball sur table! |journal=La Presse |date=October 28, 1992 |page=2 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay and rules==
To start the game, the visiting team puts a pawn (as a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] and eventually runner) in the batter's box, to get the pitcher's throws. The die replaces the ball. The [[pitcher]] rolls the die until 1) the batter is struck out 2) the batter is walked or 3) or the ball is hit. If the ball is hit, the offensive team rolls a die to determine the number of dice to be used to hit the ball.

The number of dice indicated are rolled and added up. Numbers from 1 to 36 show the location where the ball is [[hit (baseball)|hit]] and the ball is placed on the [[game board]]. If the ball is hit on a circle, the ball was hit in the air and an out is recorded. If the ball is hit on a number in a cloud, it means that this is a [[ground ball]] and that the batter will have to try to reach a base before the defense throws to that base. If the ball is hit to a star-shaped zone, the runner starts to run around the bases while the defence goes to recover the ball on the star. If the stars are from 27 to 36 it is a [[homerun]] and all runners score.

Every batter who runs around the bases and reaches home plate before three outs score a run. As soon as three outs are recorded, stranded runners are removed from the bases. The teams trade places: the defense becomes the offense.

=== Basic version===
In the basic version of Diceball, pawns are used as defensive players and are also used as runners by the opponent. A white pawn is used as a ball. The offense use dice to hit the ball in different spots on the game board and the offensive players try to move the players toward home plate as the defense try to stop the offense by forwarding the ball around.

=== Expert version===
An Expert section in the rule book includes more baseball features like the [[stolen base]], the [[sacrifice bunt]] and the [[sacrifice fly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/144476/diceball-rules|title=Diceball Rules|website=BoardGameGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
Strategy plays a role in the game. The ability to decide when to run around the bases or to stop will create momentum or result in outs. Players have the power to try to steal a base, to order a bunt to try to send a runner to second to avoid the [[double play]] and/or put a player in a [[scoring position]]. A player can also try to advance or score on a sacrifice fly. All these extra plays are subjected to the laws of probability like the rest of the rules of Diceball.

==Reception==

Diceball! got positive reviews upon its launch in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. [[Games Magazine]] named it as one of the top '''[[Games 100]]''' in the [[United States]] in 1991, 1992 and 1993. {{quote |text=Although the luck of the dice plays a major role in this baseball board game, players can make plenty of decisions that affect the outcome. For instance, the dice may tell you that you've just hit a liner to center, but it's up to you to decide whether to try stretching it to a double and whether the runner on second should risk going wee wee wee all the way home. For a more challenging game, use the advanced rules for basestealing, hit-and-run plays, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=100 Games|journal=Games Magazine|date=December 1993|volume=17|issue=118|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


[[Burt Hochberg]], a senior [[Games (magazine)|Games magazine]] editor said in an interview he gave to the [[Montreal Gazette]]:
{{quote |text=When I first heard about it, I asked myself what the hell Canadians knew about baseball. Then I played it. Now I take Diceball with me when I travel.&lt;ref name=Lamey1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamey |first1=Mary |title=Diceball eyes board-game big leagues |journal=[[Montreal Gazette]] |date=June 20, 1994 |page=F3, F15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


In January 1994, Diceball was presented in the [[American International Toy Fair]] in New York and [[Daniel Girard]], a Diceball inventor, said in an interview to the [[Montreal Gazette]]:
{{quote |text=The first harbinger of success came at Dorval airport, where a suspicious U.S. Customs agent examined one of the games closely and then tried to buy it on the spot.&lt;ref name=Lamey1994&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}} 


The [[RKO Radio Networks|Unistar Radio Networks]] of [[New York City|New York]] (lately [[Westwood One]]) described it as the best baseball game on the market:
{{quote |text=If you like baseball and games you have to try Diceball. Up till now the only baseball board games available have been either the statistical kind with individual player cards and lots of charts or some totally juvenile kind of game with spinners.
Diceball is a truly original simulation of our national pastime. The fielders actually run to retrieve the ball while the runners are rounding the bases. This is all done through the roll of dice. There is plenty of strategy for fans like myself who want to see how well we can manage a team and yet the game is so simple that it can be played just for the fun of it.
The statistics from the game are amazingly close to real baseball. You will hear the roar of the crowd and smell the hot dogs when you play Diceball. There should be a warning on the box that the game is addictive. My game club can`t stop playing it and we already have a media league set up in the New York area.
Because of its originality and great playability I give Diceball the highest rating as the best baseball game on the market today.
 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |author=Mike Fitzgerald |series=Country Gold Saturday Night |network=[[RKO Radio Networks|Unistar Radio Networks]] |date=April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


The Canadian Toy Testing Council (CTTC), a non-profit agency, that publishes a Toy Report yearly included Diceball in its 1994 report. The game received a three-star rating, the highest score. According to the Montreal Gazette, the game was shipped off to 300 test families in the Ottawa-Hull area for evaluation. Response was excellent across the board, especially from players who liked baseball. Diceball has won the council’s highest accolade, a three-star rating.&lt;ref name=Lamey1994&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


The game was also reviewed in [[USA TODAY]] and got press coverage in Canada's national newspaper, [[The Globe and Mail]], [[The Toronto Star]] and [[The Ottawa Citizen]]. It was also featured in Quebec in [[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] and [[Le Journal de Montréal]]. In Canada, Diceball! had also a lot of television coverage where it was featured on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]-[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].

==Social and tournament play==
Before it was launched and while it was launched, Diceball! was the center of many tournaments, in schools, colleges and workplaces.&lt;ref name=Lapointe1996 /&gt; Former Expos pitcher [[Denis Boucher]] won a Diceball! tournament involving sports reporters in [[Montreal]]. After the tournament, Boucher said that you will find in Diceball! all the things that happen in real baseball. He added that playing the game is a great way to spend time with friends. By winning the Diceball! tournament, Denis Boucher was given a $250 cheque that he gave to the Sun Youth Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ladouceur |first1=Pierre |title=Boucher lance... les dés pour Jeunesse au Soleil |journal=La Presse |date=September 21, 1993 |page=8 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical accuracy==

Diceball! got positive press reviews partly because of its statistical similarities to the actual games of baseball. In Diceball! the batter puts the ball in play 66% of the time compared to 76% in [[Major League Baseball]]. The [[batter (baseball)|batter]] is struck out 23% of the time, against 15% in baseball. 11% of the [[at-bats]] end up in walks compared to 9% in baseball. The ball is hit a few less times in Diceball! However, the game is balanced out by the greater probability of getting a [[base hit]] when the ball is hit (.339 vs. .304).

Taking into accounts [[strikeouts]], the offensive average in Diceball! is almost the same as baseball. .251 versus .254. Since there are more walks and errors in Diceball! than in real baseball, the players [[on-base percentage]] is .349 compared to .340 in real baseball. Even the odds of getting an out are realistic. 33.6% of ground balls in Diceball! (34.8% in baseball) 11.7% are flyballs or liners to the [[infield]] (14.7% in baseball) and 20.8% are fly balls in the [[outfield]] (20.1% in baseball). On average one more runner gets on [[base (baseball)|base]] from each team in a Diceball! game than in an actual baseball game.

The more dice you roll on a hit ball, the greater the probability of getting a base hit. With one die, the average is .167; with 2 it is .278; with 3, .287; with 4 dice, it is .356; with 5 dice .351; with 6 dice, your average climbs to .472. The overall average when the ball is hit in play is .319, not counting infield hits. Adding infield hits, the overall average when the ball is hit is .339.&lt;ref name=Lapointe1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Arcand1992 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MLB statistics used in the text were taken from: {{cite book|last1=Zminda|first1=Don|last2=Dewan|first2=John|title=Stats Baseball Score Board 1989|date=1989|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in schools==
Praised for its statistical accuracy, Diceball! was used in schools in the USA to teach youngsters the virtues of understanding statistics.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Eastville Stadium''', also known as '''Bristol Stadium''' and '''Bristol Stadium – Eastville''', was a stadium in [[Eastville, Bristol|Eastville]], a northern suburb of the English city of [[Bristol]].

Constructed in 1897, it was the home of [[Bristol Rovers F.C.]], the [[Bristol Bulldogs]] speedway team and was also a [[greyhound racing]] venue. During 1986 it was also the home of the short-lived Bristol Bombers American football team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britballnow.co.uk The UK and Ireland American Football results service] Alltime UK History – Club Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==

===History===
Rovers played their home games at Eastville (nicknamed "The Ville") until forced to leave by financial difficulties in 1986. Rovers then spent a decade at [[Twerton Park]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] before returning to the city to play at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]] where they remain to this day. The record attendance was 39,462.

Built near to a [[gas holder]], the constant smell of [[town gas]] in the air gave rise to the name used for Bristol Rovers fans of "The Gas" or "Gasheads".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolrovers2.co.uk/eastvillestadium.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204037/http://www.bristolrovers2.co.uk/eastvillestadium.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname "The Gas" began as a derogatory nickname used by [[Bristol City]] fans, however Rovers fans now refer to themselves as Gasheads as a badge of honour. The number 12 squad shirt has been officially allocated to "Gasheads" by the club in honour of the crowd being the 12th man.

Another unique feature of Eastville was the flower beds behind each goal.

===Tote End===
[[File:The Tote End, Eastville Stadium, Bristol 1986 (301079828).jpg|thumb|right|The Tote End in 1986]]
The Tote End or simply the Tote was a large section of covered [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] behind one of the goals. Originally built in 1935, the Tote End terrace was built following the curve of the [[greyhound racing]] track. It had a small covered section in the South-West corner.

The [[The Tote|Totaliser clocks]] mounted first on the back of the terrace and then after a larger roof was added in 1961 to cover most of the terrace, on the roof fascia, gave it its name.

With a boisterous and intimidating atmosphere, largely due to it being a favoured spot for the more vociferous Rovers supporters, and given the nature of football in Britain in the 1970s, it became notoriously linked with [[bovver boy]]s and [[hooliganism]] – a period documented by the book ''Bovver'' by Chris Brown.

Shortly after Rovers left Eastville in 1986, the Tote End was bulldozed.

==Greyhound racing==

===Opening===
Racing started on Saturday June 16, 1928 becoming the second track in Bristol to open after [[Knowle Stadium]]. The first ever winner was a greyhound called Vivacious who collected £20 for his connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =78|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The [[Tote board|totalisator system]] was introduced in 1932 securing the future of the stadium, this was in contrast to the football club who were in financial difficulties. During 1939 Bristol Rovers F.C negotiated a sale price to the Bristol Greyhound Company, albeit by the chairman, who carried out the deal without the knowledge of his fellow directors. Eastville changed hands for £12,000 and the first General Manager was Lieutenant-Colonel Forsdike who was to become secretary of the [[National Greyhound Racing Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Greyhound and Racing Greyhound|pages =94–96|year=1975|publisher=Page Brothers (Norwich)|isbn=0-85020-0474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Golden Crest]] competition was introduced in 1937 and became one of the most important races in the provincial calendar. In 1945 Shannon Shore recorded an impressive win by ten lengths in a new track record for 500 yards; the black dog was timed at 28.76secs during the Golden Crest final. A second major competition was introduced in 1946 and this was the [[British Bred Produce Stakes|Western Two Year Old Produce Stakes]].

In 1947 [[Oxford Stadium]] owner Leslie Calcutt was appointed as Director of Bristol Greyhound Racing Association Ltd, a move that would eventually result in Bristol taking over Oxford. The company also acquired [[Swindon Stadium]] in 1952 and would be known as Bristol Stadium Ltd following the death of Leslie Calcutt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|pages =48–49|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastville became one of the first circuits to abandon grass in 1968, becoming sand based, many tracks would follow suit over the next decade. After selling Oxford Stadium to the council Ian Stevens became General Manager at Eastville in 1975 and in 1980 the track became one of eight tracks to be awarded Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contracts resulting in a steady income stream. The track suffered a serious fire in August 1980 with the majority of the south stand destroyed causing more than £1 million worth of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|pages =24–25|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When trainer Henry Kibble retired his son Terry took over the kennels and provided Eastville with its first [[English Greyhound Derby]] finalist in 1991 with Dempsey Duke. The greyhound also won the Blue Riband, [[East Anglian Derby]] and [[Reading Masters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes/Sellers|first=Julia/John|title=Ladbrokes Greyhound Fact File|pages =39–42|year=1992|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure===
The company now known as the BS Group sold Eastville for development, plans were announced for a new Bristol greyhound stadium but never came to fruition. The stadium closed on 27 October 1997 with the entire greyhound operation moving to sister track Swindon. The site became an [[IKEA]] superstore.

===Competitions===
*[[British Bred Produce Stakes|Western Two Year Old Produce Stakes]]
*[[Golden Crest]]

==Speedway==
In 1977 the [[Newport Wasps]] speedway team relocated to Bristol as the [[Bristol Bulldogs]] and remarkably the speedway track was placed on top of the greyhound circuit and then dug up again every meeting. The speedway only ran for two seasons in the British League before the team withdrew, and speedway has never been run in the city since.

A '''golf ball retriever''' is used by [[golf]]ers in order to retrieve lost or misplaced [[golf ball|balls]].  They allow one to retrieve balls from [[water hazard]]s, deep [[Golf course#Fairway and rough|rough]] or even the occasional [[Bunker (golf)|sand trap]], where they would not otherwise be able to reach them.

Golf ball retrievers use telescopic extensions to extend up to 4.5 metres, enabling balls to be lifted from water using the swivelling cup at the end.
This piece of equipment is invaluable especially if playing on golf courses where water hazards are prevalent.

'''Kaplakriki''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Hafnarfjörður]], [[Iceland]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar]].  The stadium holds over 6,000 spectators and has offers 3050 seats. The plan for the stadium development is to expand the seating capacity to over 4,000 seats taking the maximum capacity to over 7,000. Long term plans though are to make the stadium an all-seater, full square stadium with around 6,000 seats and roofs over the stands.   

Kaplakriki Stadium is a part of multi-sport complex which besides a state-of-the-art stadium, includes a multi functional sports arena which mainly is used for handball and as a concert venue. The Handball arena holds over 3000 spectators in seats. The arena was one of the venues for the [[1995 World Men's Handball Championship]] in Handball and has hosted several national games. A state-of-the-art track and field arena was opened in 2014 and will serve as an all season facility and an expansion to the outdoor track and field course located at Kaplakriki complex.
 
Kaplakriki is also a large training area which includes an indoor-football facility called ''Risinn'' (The Giant) although it is not as big as ''Fífan'' or ''Egilshöllin'', which are other indoor football facilities located in [[Kópavogur]] and [[Reykjavík]].

In the 2016 league season, FH drew an average home attendance of 1,541, the highest in the league&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Lady Byng Memorial Trophy''', formerly known as the '''Lady Byng Trophy''', is presented each year to the [[National Hockey League]] "player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of [[sportsmanship]] and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability".&lt;ref name="Byng history3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashladybyng.htm |title=Lady Byng Memorial Trophy history |accessdate=2007-08-20 |publisher=Legendsofhockey.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806164042/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashladybyng.htm |archivedate=2007-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy has been awarded 88 times to 53 different players since it was first awarded in 1925. The original trophy was donated to the league by [[Evelyn Byng, Viscountess Byng of Vimy|Lady Byng of Vimy]], then&amp;ndash;[[viceregal consort of Canada]].

The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the [[Professional Hockey Writers Association]], and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 points system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jon_dolezar/news/2003/04/01/dolie_insider/|title=Foppa shows the most Hart|accessdate=2007-08-01|date=2003-04-20|author=Jon Dolezar |publisher=SI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

==History==
The trophy is named in honour of [[Evelyn Byng, Viscountess Byng of Vimy|Marie Evelyn Moreton (Lady Byng)]], [[Viceregal consort of Canada|wife]] of [[Julian Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Viscount Byng of Vimy]], a [[Vimy Ridge]] war hero who was [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1921 to 1926. Lady Byng, who was an avid hockey fan, decided to donate the trophy to the NHL in 1925.&lt;ref name="Byng history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=24938|title=Lady Byng Memorial Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She decided the trophy's first winner would be [[Frank Nighbor]] of the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]].  Late in the season, Lady Byng invited Nighbor to [[Rideau Hall]], showed him the trophy, and asked him if the NHL would accept it as an award for its most gentlemanly player.  When Nighbor said he thought it would, Lady Byng, much to Nighbor's surprise, awarded him the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Champions:  The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=[[Chicago]] |isbn=1-57243-213-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=P194703&amp;type=Player&amp;page=bio&amp;list=ByName#photo Frank Nighbor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040804080848/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p194703&amp;type=Player&amp;page=bio&amp;list=ByName |date=2004-08-04 }} at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] site.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Frank Boucher]] of the [[New York Rangers]] won the award seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so impressed that she gave him the original trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in [[1935–36 NHL season|1935–36]]. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy.&lt;ref name="Byng history"/&gt; In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher's home.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award winners==
Besides Boucher, a number of players have won the award multiple times, including [[Wayne Gretzky]] who won it five times, [[Red Kelly]] and [[Pavel Datsyuk]] with four wins, and [[Bobby Bauer]], [[Alex Delvecchio]], [[Mike Bossy]], [[Martin St. Louis]], and [[Ron Francis]] with three each. Because of Boucher's seven wins, the [[New York Rangers]] join [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit]] as the only two clubs who have won the award fourteen times, followed by [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto]] with nine wins, [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago]] and [[Boston Bruins|Boston]] tied with eight, and [[Los Angeles Kings|Los Angeles]] with six.&lt;ref name="Byng history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0004454|title=Lady Byng Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-20|publisher=canadianencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Oates]] was a six-time finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy but never won.

Five players have won both the Lady Byng Trophy and the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as league MVP in the same season: [[Buddy O'Connor]]  ([[1947–48 NHL season|1947–48]]), [[Bobby Hull]] ([[1964–65 NHL season|1964–65]]), [[Stan Mikita]] ([[1966–67 NHL season|1966–67]] and [[1967–68 NHL season|1967–68]]), [[Wayne Gretzky]] ([[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]]) and [[Joe Sakic]] ([[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01]]). Mikita is also the only player to win the Hart, [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]], and Lady Byng trophies in the same season, doing so consecutively in the 1966–67 and 1967–68 seasons. Gretzky, Bobby Hull, and Martin St. Louis also won these three awards, but not in the same season. Bobby and [[Brett Hull]] are the only father-son combination to win the Hart and Lady Byng trophies.&lt;ref name="Hart history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/hart.html |title=Hart Memorial Trophy history |accessdate=2007-07-31 |publisher=NHL.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427123613/http://www.nhl.com/trophies/hart.html |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Quackenbush]], [[Red Kelly]], and [[Brian Campbell]] are the only defensemen to have won the Lady Byng Trophy, with Kelly being the only one to win it multiple times (3 as a defenseman, 4 overall). After Kelly, no defenseman won the award for a 58-year stretch which ended in 2012 when Campbell received the honor, though [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]] narrowly lost to [[Joe Sakic]] in 2001. No goaltender has ever won the award.

'''Red Bull X-Fighters''' is a [[Freestyle Motocross|freestyle motocross]] motorbike stunt competition, contested in [[bullring]]s and famous locations and sites. Created back in 2001, Red Bull X-Fighters is the most popular freestyle motocross event in the world with a 15-year plus history and more than 50 past events on six continents. The riders are invited to compete head-to-head through a series of knockout rounds in front of some of the world's most iconic locations.

==History==
===X-Fighters: 2001–06===
[[File:Plaza de toros de Valencia 1.JPG|thumb|right|210px|X-Fighters inaugural venue, the [[Plaza de Toros de Valencia]].]]
X-Fighters was founded in 2001, and became the most famous [[freestyle motocross]] event series in the world. The [[Plaza de Toros de Valencia]] in [[Spain]] was where it began, being the first venue to host the competition. A 12,000 crowd was recorded, with [[United States|American]] 'Mad' [[Mike Jones (motocross rider)|Mike Jones]] taking out the inaugural event, and the host nations very own Edgar Torronteras coming second and [[French people|French]] rider, Xavier Fabre coming third respectively. After the impact made in 2001, Red Bull X-Fighters returned for a second time. Moving from the [[bullring]] in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] to [[Madrid]]'s [[Las Ventas]]. The crowd had almost doubled in size from the previous year, with the arena to a full capacity of nearly 20,000. It was another close series of head-to-heads between riders like [[Mike Metzger]] and the previous year's champion, Mike Jones. But it was [[Spain]]'s Edgar Torronteras, that won the event and took the trophy that season.&lt;ref name=Become-15-years-madrid-highlights&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/m/en_INT/article/15-years-madrid-highlights | title=15 Years Madrid Highlights | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=24 June 2016 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firmly securing X-Fighters foothold as one of the major events in FMX history and [[Europe]]'s biggest FMX event.&lt;ref name=X-Fighters-History&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/en_INT/about | title=Video: Red Bull X-Fighters History | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=3 September 2016 | accessdate=3 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Travispastrana1009.JPG|thumb|left|120px|Madrid 04 &amp; 06 champion, [[Travis Pastrana]].]]
2003 was to bring about some major developments to the event. It introduced the line up of events to increase from one to two that year with both Valencia and Madrid staging competitions in their bullrings. But [[Red Bull]] X-Fighters and the entire sport of FMX witnessed one of its first major tricks. At Las Ventas in Madrid, a new rider to the competition, the 18-year-old from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[Nate Adams]] created freestyle world of motocross history after performing the first ever back flip at the event.&lt;ref name=Become-Part-Of-History&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/ja_IC/video/become-part-history | title=Become Part Of History! | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=13 April 2016 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riders then returned to compete in the bullring of Madrid for the only X-Fighters event of 2004. Having a major impact on the pace of progression in the sport that year that the back flip had gone from what most people didn't think was possible to an almost standard feature in most riders runs. Riders were not only performing back flips with ease, they were laying down back flip combinations.&lt;ref name="Become-Part-Of-History" /&gt; Joining the event was a new face on the Red Bull X-Fighters scene, the well-known [[Travis Pastrana]]. It saw him and Adams stage the first of their head-to-head battles, going all in a battle against each other and pulling off spectacular 360's in front of huge crowds. Pastrana took first and Adams second. Ronnie Renner did his first competitive backflip in Madrid that year.&lt;ref name="Become-15-years-madrid-highlights" /&gt; The following year, after continuous success in Spain, X-Fighters staged its first event outside of Europe. Bringing the riders in FMX to compete at the biggest bullring on the planet, the [[Plaza de Toros México]] in [[Mexico City]]. The growing popularity of the sport was proved by the capacity crowd of over 40,000 fans. Once again the riders proved why FMX was becoming one of the most incredible spectator sports in the world by putting on another massive watched competition that was eventually won by Ronnie Renner. After [[Mexico]], Madrid hosted yet another event, which Nate Adams won. Lastly, in 2006, Mexico City and Madrid were to repeat the following year and host the last two events before the World Tour format began.&lt;ref name="X-Fighters-History" /&gt;

===World Tour: 2007–15===
In 2007, X-Fighters was becoming a global phenomenon. But the year had a special significance as X-Fighters moved from the exclusive bullring locations into new inspirational arenas. It reached double figures, celebrating its tenth competition in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0704/nr-xfighters.htm | title=Red Bull X-Fighters - Mexico 2007 | work=Banderas News | date=30 April 2007 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was the next stop that was a new direction for the event. Instead of the bullrings that housed every event so far, Red Bull X-Fighters instead built a very different course. Against a backdrop of historic [[Slane Castle]] in [[Ireland]]. This stunning setting had previously played host to the likes of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and [[Guns N' Roses]]. Although the conditions were wet as rain fell heavily in Slane Castle, dampening most riders ability to really take on the course. But there was one rider that refused to be compromised and displayed the pure pioneer spirit, coming first in the event, Travis Pastrana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vitalmx.com/features/Red-Bull-X-Fighters-Slane-Castle,1464 | title=Red Bull X-Fighters, Slane Castle | work=Vital MX | date=4 September 2016 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ireland, the newly world tour ended and rounded off in a return to [[Madrid]]. Pastrana again proving he was one of the greatest riders after he rode to yet his second consecutive win that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vitalmx.com/features/red-bull-x-fighters-madrid,1709 | title=Red Bull X-Fighters: Madrid | work=Vital MX | date=2 August 2007 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Dany Torres" piloto espanhol (2464430432).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Dany Torres at the [[Rio de Janeiro]] event.]]
2008 will always be remembered amongst FMX fans as the year Red Bull X-Fighters truly became a fully fledged international tour. That was the year it went global. Expanding its line up of stops from three in 2007 to six. Taking in [[Mexico]], making its first visit to [[South America]] with a trip to the [[Sambadrome]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] before coming north of the border to [[Texas]]. Then across the Atlantic to the European legs of Spain, [[Germany]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motocrossactionmag.com/uncategorized/2008-red-bull-x-fighters-schedule-announced | title=2008 RED BULL X-FIGHTERS SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED | work=Motocross Action Magazine | date=30 September 2007 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Mat Rebeaud]]'s devastating dominance in 2008, the international line-up of riders were competitive and much different as event nineteen marked the start of the 2009 season and a fresh new face joined the line up of riders competing in the monumental [[Plaza de Toros México]]. A 17-year-old from [[New Zealand]], [[Levi Sherwood]]. As soon as he came out into that arena it soon became clear that he had something that would set the sport a light. His superb debut showing resulted in a worthy win and set the tone for what was going to continue to be a landmark season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://motocross.transworld.net/news/red-bull-x-fighters-mexico-city-results/#A68hBOGeqLZewBXZ.97 | title=Red Bull X Fighters Mexico City Results | work=Transworld Motocross | date=30 March 2009 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a closely fought contest in [[Calgary, Canada]], the tour rode into Texas. The course built in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] for the twenty-first Red Bull X-Fighters certainly was known as one of their biggest courses created. With new tricks being performed, [[Cam Sinclair]] introduced the double back flip. He successfully pulled it off, being the first rider to do so in a competition run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2009/06/article/red-bull-x-fighters-texas-results/ | title=Red Bull X-Fighters Texas Results | work=Moto USA | date=29 June 2009 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving on to the next event in Madrid, Sinclair again attempted the double back flip but this time got it horribly wrong. He suffered severe head injuries, a ruptured liver, extensive internal bleeding, a broken shoulder and cheekbone, also had brain swelling causing him to be in a coma for seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.petethomasoutdoors.com/2010/07/cam-sinclair-to-star-at-x-games-a-year-after-nearfatal-crash.html | title=Cam Sinclair to star at X Games a year after near-fatal crash | work=Pete Thomas Outdoors | date=28 July 2010 | accessdate=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Sinclair in recovery, the 2009 tour ended with Red Bull X-Fighters twenty-third event and a first for [[London]] with a spectacular finale at the iconic [[Battersea Power Station]].

[[File:Rumo ao Topo (2463722845).jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Jeremy Stenberg]] at an X-Fighters event.]]
In 2010 Red Bull X-Fighters were granted permission to stage an event in [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] right beside the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], using it as their backdrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://racerxonline.com/2010/06/25/russian-debut-for-red-bull-x-fighters | title=2010 Red Bull X-Fighters World Tour Italy | work=Racer X | date=26 June 2010 | accessdate=6 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only that, they were also given permission to base an event at the [[Giza Plateau]] in [[Egypt]] with the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] in the background. Red Bull X-Fighters then marked past in its quarter century with another return to its long serving Madrid. Australian [[Robbie Maddison]] had a special surprise in store for the Spanish fans pulling off a body varial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.actionrecon.com/robbie-maddison-wins-red-bull-x-fighters-in-spain/ | title=Robbie Maddison wins Red bull x-fighters in Spain. | work=Action Recal | date=24 July 2010 | accessdate=6 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A first ever seen trick in the competition, Maddison went on to win the event but it was to be his downfall as he prepared for the following event in London. He bailed in an attempt at the volt badly, ending his season. After the [[United Kingdom|UK]] stop, X-Fighters wrapped up its twenty-ninth event by rounding off the 2010 tour in [[Italy]] where [[Nate Adams]] achieved another first to add to his Red Bull X-Fighters career. Being the first rider to claim a second tile for a second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2010/10/article/2010-red-bull-x-fighters-world-tour-italy/ | title=2010 Red Bull X-Fighters World Tour Italy | work=Moto USA | date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=6 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 saw Red Bull X-Fighters reach its 10th year anniversary and stadiums and arenas across the world were selling out to a huge international fan base. It brought up its 30th event on [[Jumeirah Beach]] in [[Dubai]]. The tour then encountered a spectacular show when it staged round two of the championship in front of the [[Monumental Axis]] in the [[Brazil]] capital, [[Brasilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.behindmagazine.com/contents/red-bull-x-fighters-world-tour-brasilia/ | title=RED BULL X FIGHTERS WORLD TOUR – BRASILIA | work=Behind Magazine.com | date=27 May 2011 | accessdate=6 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of a crowd with over 100,000 people, was the biggest FMX attended event in the history of the sport.&lt;ref name="X-Fighters-History" /&gt; Following the events in [[Rome]], [[Madrid]], and [[Poznań]], the tour ended in a grand finale on [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] in the heart of Sydney Harbour, Australia. Making the most of competing in front of his home crowd for the first time was Australia's Josh Sheehan. He surprised everyone by pulling off the last win of 2011. But the tour title that year belonged to someone else, Dany Torres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/action/fmx/story/_/id/6980808/josh-sheehan-wins-red-bull-x-fighters-sydney-dany-torres-wins-2011-series | title=Dany Torres claims X-Fighters title | work=ESPN | date=19 September 2011 | accessdate=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Red Bull X-Fighters tour took a huge leap forward. It started in Dubai with a course that included the biggest jump distance ever built in a competitive freestyle course but the next event was a giant leap of FMX kind. In Glen Helen, Red Bull created the biggest course ever constructed.&lt;ref name="X-Fighters-History" /&gt; After the huge course the tour moved to Europe in Madrid where New Zealander [[Levi Sherwood]] took a stunning victory and extended his lead in the overall standings. Next up was [[Munich]]'s [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] which became the stage of a night of huge drama and significance in the freestyle world. The leading man was Tom Pagès. The tour was set for another close finale once again on Cockatoo Island in Australia. It saw Jackson Strong perform X-Fighters first front flip and did it again one handed. But it came down to the overall current first and second place riders to meet in the final for a chance to win the World Tour title. It was Sherwood whom bet Pagès after he performed the huge tricks and style when it really mattered to take the 2012 title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/m/en_MX/article/sherwood-wins-red-bull-x-fighters-world-tour | title=SHERWOOD WINS RED BULL X-FIGHTERS WORLD TOUR | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=6 October 2012 | accessdate=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Slam: 2016–present===
After eight spectacular years of the Red Bull X-Fighters World Tour, 2016 concentrated on one season highlight event at the legendary [[Las Ventas|Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas]] in Madrid on June 24. The Red Bull X-Fighters stop in Madrid marked the 15th straight year that the famous bullring hosted the event of Freestyle Motocross, where the world's best riders have been showcasing new and exciting tricks since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.your-adrenaline-fix.com/red-bull-x-fighters.html | title=2016 Red Bull X-Fighters Details | work=Your Adrenaline Fix | date=29 October 2015 | accessdate=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]]'s [[Tom Pagès]] became the first rider in history to win Madrid three consecutive times with his stirring victory in 2015 in front of another sold-out house of 23,000 spectators. Travis Pastrana of the USA had also won Madrid three times but not consecutively while Spanish rider Dany Torres had won the most important stop of the season twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/m/en_ES/article/focus-2016-one-highlight-event-madrid | title=FOCUS IN 2016 ON ONE HIGHLIGHT EVENT IN MADRID | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=29 October 2015 | accessdate=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Tom Pagès who carved his name into the record books with a spectacular fourth straight Red Bull X-Fighters win in Madrid, the spiritual home of freestyle motocross that celebrated its 15th anniversary in style in front of a full house. At the Las Ventas bullring Pagès treated the crowd to his new Front Flip Flair, the first time ever the trick was performed in competition. In an epic three-way battle featuring the world's best FMX riders, [[Clinton Moore]], the 2015 World Tour champion, came in a close second after a flawless run in the final with his Bundy jump recorded to be 14 meters high by a new [[Intel]] high-tech device. Josh Sheehan had to settle for third despite nailing his signature double back flip. [[Levi Sherwood]] of [[New Zealand]] finished fourth on an unforgettable night at the FMX extravaganza in the Spanish capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/en_INT/article/pages-wins-red-bull-x-fighters-madrid-again | title=PAGÈS WINS RED BULL X-FIGHTERS MADRID AGAIN! | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=25 June 2016 | accessdate=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each day of every event, riders get opportunities to train. Day one starts off with a briefing. Day two is qualification and day three is competition. In qualification, there is one 90-second qualifying run. All twelve riders ride in their start order. Any rider who misses a qualifying session will be scored in the last place position. Should more than one rider miss the qualifying session then previous year's Tour rank will determine placing, with the lowest ranked rider being scored as the last place. Should no Tour rank exists, and then a draw will take place to establish rank for the purpose of qualifying. The results of the qualification will define the three groups of four riders that will compete in the Cuadrillas Elimination.&lt;ref name=x-fighters-about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redbullxfighters.com/en_INT/about | title=X-Fighters About | work=Red Bull X-Fighters | date=7 September 2016 | accessdate=7 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuadrillas Elimination is where each group of four riders will spin a roulette of tricks one time (old-school tricks that are barely shown in competition). All riders have to pull out this trick within their 50-second run. The best two riders of each group qualify for the semi-final. At the completion of each rider's run, the judges award a score. When all riders in this round have completed a scored run, the scores are announced and the top scored rider advances through to the semi-final. Six riders are then qualified in pairs and battle head-to-head in the semi-final, in which there is no mandatory trick. Each rider takes his own run with a pre-determined time limit (75 seconds). The lower seeded rider in each pair ride first. Time starts when the rider takes his first jump. After each run, the rider goes a pre-designated position to watch his replays on the big screen. The second rider in the pair, who is not riding, will wait at the Hot Spot, remove his helmet and watch the other rider's run. After the second rider's run, both wait at a pre-designated position for the judges' decision of whom of the two is in the Final round. The winner from each battle would advance to the final.&lt;ref name="x-fighters-about" /&gt;

The final consists of three winners from the semi-final that meet in a head-to-head run-off. Each rider takes his own run with a pre-determined time limit (75 seconds). The rider from the semi-final A will ride first followed by the winner of the semi-final B and C. Time will start when the rider takes his first jump. After the 75 seconds each rider can perform a Bonus Trick which is not affected by the time limit. After each run, the rider goes a pre-designated position to watch his replay on the big screen. The second and third riders, who are not riding, will wait at the Hot Spot, remove their helmet and watch the other rider's run. After the third rider's run, all three wait at a pre-designated position for the judges' decision of whom of the three will be celebrated as the winner of the [[Red Bull]] X-Fighters competition. Overall the riders can win five helmets. If there is a tie (e.g. two riders win two helmets and one rider 1 helmet) the Bonus Tricks decides on the winner.&lt;ref name="x-fighters-about" /&gt;

===Judging===
Judging in all rounds consist of five judges, each one judging the overall impression based on the following criteria:
* Variety
* Execution
* Form and flow
* Use of course
* Challenge
* Energy
* Excitement
* Entertainment

There are two separate judging systems for the Red Bull X-Fighters competition. Round one judging panel comprises five judges, plus one Head Judge. These judges will award each rider a score from 1-100 points. Final score will be represented as a number from 0–100 based on an average of all five judges' scores (From a total of 0 - 500 ÷ 5 judges) In the semi-finals and final, each judge award each of the riders in the heat a score on a scale of 1–100 points. The rider with the highest score from a single judge will win that judge's vote. The rider who gets three or more judges' votes out of five will win the match-up. The Head Judge is solely responsible for indicating when time expires on a run. If, in the mind of the Head Judge, a rider is considered to be 'on approach' to a jump when the time clock reaches zero, then that jump (or series of jumps in a double-double or 6-pack) will count in the rider's final score. The Head Judge will also have the ability to change any single score or group of scores and makes the final decision in any tiebreaker situations. Should two or more riders in Round one have a scoring tie out of 100 points, then the high and low scores for each rider will be eliminated and the remaining three scores averaged to give a score of 100 points. Should this method still result in a tie then the highest single score will break the tie(s). In the event that none of these methods breaks the tie(s) then the Head Judge will break the tie(s)&lt;ref name="x-fighters-about" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">'''Taistelupetankki''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "combat pétanque") is an outdoor sport game based on [[pétanque]], developed in [[Finland]] in 1999. Taistelupetankki is played with the same equipment as pétanque, but it can be played in more diverse terrain.

In the game, a player (or a team) has two metal balls. On his/her turn, the player tries to get at least one of his/her balls closest to the jack. There are two ways to get one's ball closest to the jack: try to throw one's ball close enough in the first place, or try to knock an opponent's ball or the jack off with one's own ball. A popular tactic is to use one ball to knock an opponent's ball off and the other to get closest to the jack. If a player doesn't get even one of his balls closest to the jack on his/her turn, he/she drops out of the game. The game continues until only one player remains.

Taistelupetankki players describe the game as "continuing where pétanque left off".

==Equipment==
* Two iron balls, discernible from others. Diameter 60 to 80 mm, weight 600 to 800 g.
* Jack, usually made of wood. Diameter 20 to 40 mm.

==Course of the game==
One of the players, usually the winner of the last game or the youngest player, throws the jack to a place he/she deems worthy. After this, a combination shot happens, where every player throws both of their balls, one at a time, onto the playing field, every player at the same time. It is recommended to watch where the balls land.

The first proper throwing round is started by the player who has either of his/her balls the furthest away from the jack. Both balls are thrown, one at a time, towards the jack so that at least one of them ends up closest to the jack. If the player fails to do this on his/her turn, he/she drops out of the game.

The next throwing turn is for the player who has either of his/her balls the furthest away from the jack. This continues until all players have thrown their balls, and this order of throwing continues for the following rounds.

===The throw===
The player picks his/her ball up from the ground from between his/her feet and throws it where he/she stands. Contrary to normal pétanque, it is allowed to jump during the throw, provided that the player lands on the same spot where he/she started from. The ball must travel in the air at least 10 cm.

===Duration===
The game can last from five minutes to an hour, depending on the circumstances (skill, terrain conditions, weather, number of successful knocks, the players' mental state...)

===Judges===
The players act as judges themselves, in order to reach a [[consensus]] should controversial situations arise.

==Competitions==
The Finnish Taistelupetankki Association holds competitions open to everyone. There are competitions all year round, mostly based on the [[Helsinki metropolitan area|capital region]]. Also individual competitions are held annually at least in [[Tampere]] and [[Tallinn]].

'''West Bromwich Road''' was a sports ground in [[Walsall]], [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Walsall F.C.]] between 1893 and 1895, and again from 1900 until 1901.

==History==
Following complaints from local residents, Walsall left [[the Chuckery]] ground at the end of the [[1892–93 Football League|1892–93 season]] to move to West Bromwich Road.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballgroundguide.com/old-grounds-and-stands/fellows_park_walsall.htm Fellows Park] Football Grounds Guide&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ground was not ready for the start of the [[1893–94 Football League|1893–94 season]], and the first two matches were played at [[the Oval (Wednesbury)|the Oval]] in [[Wednesbury]]. West Bromwich Road featured a football pitch surrounded by a running track, with a stand on the western touchline and some banking behind the southern goal.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p144, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first League match played at West Bromwich Road was 5–1 win over [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on 23 September 1893, with 1,500 spectators present. Walsall left the ground at the end of the [[1894–95 Football League|1894–95 season]] to move to [[Fellows Park]], but returned midway through the [[1900–01 Football League|1900–01 season]] after being evicted from the new ground. After finishing the season at West Bromwich Road, the club returned to Fellows Park for the [[1901–02 Football League|1901–02 season]]. The final match at the ground was a 0–0 draw with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 22 April 1901 with only 800 spectators in attendance. The site was later used for housing.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;
