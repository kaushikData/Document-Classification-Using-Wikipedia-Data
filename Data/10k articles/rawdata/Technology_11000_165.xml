'''Air-augmented rockets''' (also known as rocket-ejector, ramrocket, ducted rocket, integral rocket/ramjets, or ejector ramjets) use the supersonic exhaust of some kind of rocket engine to further compress air collected by ram effect during flight to use as additional [[working mass]], leading to greater effective thrust for any given amount of fuel than either the rocket or a ramjet alone.

It represents a hybrid class of rocket/ramjet engines, similar to a [[ramjet]], but able to give useful thrust from zero speed, and is also able in some cases to operate outside the atmosphere, with fuel efficiency not worse than both a comparable ramjet or rocket at every point.

==Operation==

In a conventional chemical rocket engine, the rocket carries both its fuel and its [[oxidizer]] in its fuselage.  The chemical reaction between the fuel and the oxidizer produces reactant products which are nominally gasses at the pressures and temperatures in the rocket's combustion chamber.  The reaction is also highly energetic (exothermic) releasing tremendous energy in the form of heat; that is imparted to the reactant products in the combustion chamber giving this mass enormous internal energy which, when expanded through a [[nozzle]] is capable of producing very high exhaust velocities. The exhaust is directed rearward through the nozzle, thereby producing a thrust forward. 

In this conventional design, the fuel/oxidizer mixture is both the [[working mass]] and energy source that accelerates it. It is easy to demonstrate that the best performance is had if the working mass is as low as possible. Hydrogen, by itself, is the theoretical best rocket fuel. Mixing this with oxygen in order to burn it lowers the overall performance of the system by raising the mass of the exhaust, as well as greatly increasing the mass that has to be carried aloft – oxygen is much heavier than hydrogen.

One potential method of increasing the overall performance of the system is to collect either the fuel or the oxidizer during flight. Fuel is hard to come by in the atmosphere, but oxidizer in the form of gaseous oxygen makes up to 20% of the air. There are a number of designs that take advantage of this fact. These sorts of systems have been explored in the [[liquid air cycle engine]] (LACE).

Another idea is to collect the working mass. With an air-augmented rocket, an otherwise conventional rocket engine is mounted in the center of a long tube, open at the front. As the rocket moves through the atmosphere the air enters the front of the tube, where it is compressed via the ram effect. As it travels down the tube it is further compressed and mixed with the fuel-rich exhaust from the rocket engine, which heats the air much as a combustor would in a [[ramjet]]. In this way a fairly small rocket can be used to accelerate a much larger working mass than normal, leading to significantly higher thrust within the atmosphere.

===Advantages===

The effectiveness of this simple method can be dramatic. Typical solid rockets have a [[specific impulse]] of about 260 seconds (2.5 kN·s/kg), but using the same fuel in an air-augmented design can improve this to over 500 seconds (4.9 kN·s/kg), a figure even the best hydrogen/oxygen engines can't match. This design can even be slightly more efficient than a [[ramjet]], as the exhaust from the rocket engine helps compresses the air more than a ramjet normally would; this raises the combustion efficiency as a longer, more efficient nozzle can be employed. Another advantage is that the rocket works even at zero forward speed, whereas a ramjet requires forward motion to feed air into the engine.

===Disadvantages===

It might be envisaged that such an increase in performance would be widely deployed, but various issues frequently preclude this. The intakes of high-speed engines are difficult to design, and they can't simply be located anywhere on the airframe whilst getting reasonable performance – in general, the entire airframe needs to be built around the intake design. Another problem is that the air thins out as the rocket climbs, so the amount of additional thrust is limited by how fast the rocket climbs. Finally, the air ducting weighs about 5× to 10× more{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} than an equivalent rocket that gives the same thrust. This slows the vehicle quite a bit towards the end of the burn.

==History==

The first{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} serious attempt to make a production air-augmented rocket was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] '''Gnom''' rocket design, implemented by Decree 708-336 of the Soviet Ministers of 2 July 1958. More recently [[NASA]] has re-examined similar technology for the GTX program as part of an effort to develop [[SSTO]] spacecraft.
[[Image:GTX-5880trefny-f2.jpg|thumb|NASA GTX Reference vehicle]]
Air-augmented rockets finally entered mass production in 2016 when the [[Meteor_(missile)|Meteor Air to Air Missile]] was introduced into service.

In [[metallurgy]], '''alpha case''' is the oxygen-enriched surface [[phase (matter)|phase]] that occurs when [[titanium]] and its alloys are exposed to heated air or oxygen. Alpha case is hard and brittle, and tends to create a series of microcracks which will reduce the metal's performance and its fatigue properties. Alpha case can be minimized or avoided by processing titanium at very deep vacuum levels. However once present on the surface,  the currently applied method to remove the Alpha case is by the subtractive methods of machining and /or chem milling. An emerging technique is to subject the metal to an electrochemical treatment in molten salts, such as calcium chloride or lithium chloride at elevated temperatures. This method, as proven in laboratory, is effective in removal of the dissolved oxygen from the alpha case, and hence recovery of the metal. However, the unwanted consequence of the high temperature treatment is the growth of the grains in the metal. Grain growth may be limited by lowering the molten salt temperature. Alternatively, the metal may be rolling-pressed again to break the large grains into smaller ones &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wh25860v256k5w95/|title=''Cathodic deoxygenation of the alpha case on titanium and alloys in molten calcium chloride''|last=George |first=Zheng Chen|author2=Derek J.

An '''automated pool cleaner''' is a [[vacuum cleaner]] intended to collect [[debris]] and [[sediment]] from swimming pools with minimal human intervention. Popularly dubbed a &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;creepy-crawly&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; or "Kreepy Krauly" in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kreepykrauly.co.za/our-success/&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of several types of swimming pool vacuum cleaners. Other major types are battery-powered or manually powered wands effective only for very small pools, [[kiddie pool|kiddie]] or wading pools and small spas and hot tubs, and battery-powered, handheld/extended reach pool and spa vacuums. The latter are powered by rechargeable batteries and can be hand held attached to a telescopic pole used for extended reach. These are used for small to medium-sized pools, larger spas, and to spot clean larger pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent No: 6,797,157|url=http://www.patentbuddy.com/Patent/6797157|publisher=Patentbuddy.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;creepy-crawly&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; derives from the vacuum's webbed-nozzle crawling creepily through the underwater mist as well as for its creepy suction noise. &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Creepy crawly&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; originally referred to strange creatures that crawl on the bottom of the ocean, as the webbed nozzle of the vacuum slightly resembles an octopus in both appearance and suction ability.

== History ==

=== Evolution ===

Swimming pool cleaners evolved from two areas of science: development of the [[water filter]] and early cistern cleaners.
The forerunner of today's pool cleaners were cistern cleaners. A cistern (Middle English cisterne, from the Latin cisterna, from cista, box, from Greek kistê, basket) is a waterproof receptacle for holding liquids, usually water. Often cisterns were and still are built to catch and store rainwater. The great palaces of antiquity had both lavish pools and cisterns. They were prevalent in early America as well. [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] makes reference to a cistern cleaner patent filed (though never issued) as early as 1798. Before swimming pools were affordable and fashionable, many swam in their larger cisterns.

In 1883 John E. Pattison of New Orleans filed an application for a "Cistern and Tank Cleaner " and the first discovered patent was issued the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 302,353 Cistern and Tank Cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US302353|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It swept and scraped the bottom of a cistern or tank, and through a combination of suction and manipulation of the water pressure was able to separate and remove sediment without removing the water. Over the next 20 years his invention was improved on numerous occasions. Many pool cleaner patents issued in the modern era refer to some of the cistern cleaners as predecessors of their invention.

=== Early models ===

The first swimming pool cleaner was invented in 1912 by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania local citizen John M. Davison. On November 26, 1912, he submitted a patent application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office entitled "Cleaning Apparatus For Swimming Pools And The Like," patent number 1,056,779 that was issued on March 25, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 1,056,779 Portable electric pool cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1056779|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first suction-side pool cleaner was invented by Roy B. Everson of Chicago in 1937, which he entitled "Swimming Pool Cleaner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 2,141,811 Swimming pool cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2141811|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen years later, the first suction-side pool cleaner was the work of Joseph Eistrup of San Mateo, California, who called his invention simply "Pool Cleaner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 2,902,705 Pool Cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2902705|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the first truly automatic, aptly named "Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner" was created by Andrew L. Pansini of Greenbrae, California, founder of the industry icon Jandy Corporation. Patent Number 3,032,044 was touted by Pansini as "an automatic swimming pool cleaner", which is effective to remove the scum, dirt and other accumulations from both the bottom and side walls of a pool to disperse foreign matter in the, water for removal therefrom by normal pump-filter system of the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 3,032,044 Automatic swimming pool cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3032044|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first robotic pool cleaner that used electricity was the work of Robert B. Myers of Boca Raton, Florida in 1967, who filed a patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 3,439,368 Swimming Pool Cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3439368|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and last of the generally accepted pool cleaner technologies, the pressure-side cleaner, was invented by Melvyn L. Henkin of Tarzana, California in 1972. His "Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner, United States Patent Number 3,822,754 utilized three wheels to allow the machine "to travel underwater along a random path on the pool vessel surface for dislodging debris therefrom". The design is probably familiar to pool owners as the Polaris Pool Cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 3,822,754 Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3822754|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently from his American counterparts [[Ferdinand Chauvier]] invented the [[Kreepy Krauly]] in [[South Africa]] in 1974 in [[Springs, Gauteng|Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kreepykrauly.co.za/our-success/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

There are three main types of automated or automatic swimming pool cleaners, classified by the drive mechanism and source of power used:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Suction-side ===
In this type, water pumped out of the pool via its skimmer or drains is used for locomotion and debris suction and returned after being filtered via pool return or outlet valves. This is the least expensive and most popular type. It traces a random course. This type of cleaner is usually attached via a 1.5 inch hose to a vacuum plate in the skimmer, or to a dedicated extraction or "vac" line on the side of the pool. The suction action of the pool's pump provides motive force to  the machine to randomly traverse the floor and walls of the pool, extracting dirt and debris in its path. The first automatic pool cleaner was a suction cleaner.

These are the least expensive and most widely used pool cleaners with purchase costs ranging in the $100–$300 price range. They are powered solely by the main pump of the pool and utilize the pool's filter system to remove dirt and debris from the water. These machines effectively diminish the suction of the main pump - using them will increase the electricity costs and require the main pump and filter system to be serviced more frequently. There is minimal maintenance and part replacement costs on these devices over time.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Pressure-side ===

In this design, pool water inflow is further pressurized using a secondary "booster" pump on most but not all models. This high-pressure water is used for locomotion and debris suction, employing the [[venturi effect]]. It traces a random course. The requirement of a booster pump makes this type the highest in  electricity use of the three types of pool cleaners.

The pressure causes turbulence in the water, distributing some debris on the floor and walls of the pool, some of which is re-floated to the pool surface and then sucked into the main filter through the skimmer inlets. A portion of the dirt and debris is caught in an attached filter bag. The purchase cost of this type of cleaner range from a minimum of $200 to about $700 plus the costs of the booster pump, usually over $200. Some more sophisticated models can cost over $1,000.

Both suction-side and pressure-side cleaners are dependent on the pool's main pump and filter system to remove contaminants from the pool water, so cannot remove particles smaller than the pore size of the pool's existing filter element. Such elements can be made of sand, diatomaceous earth, zeolite or other natural or synthetic materials. That particle size ranges from under 5&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] for diatomaceous filters to well in excess of 50&amp;nbsp;µm for sand filters. Disadvantages of these types of pool cleaners are the additional electricity use, and filtration limitation by the pore size of the main filter element, as well as the time and effort needed to attach the device to the ports that connect to the main pump and filter, and the increased burden of maintenance time and expense on the pool's mechanics.

=== Electric robotic ===

These cleaners are independent from the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least {{convert|10|ft|m}} from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high rate of speed back into the pool water. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and "brushes" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.

An internal microchip is pre-programmed to turn on and off and reverse the direction of the drive motors. The chip will cause the machine to change direction when it reaches a wall or the water surface after climbing the pool walls.

These machines may also be directed by sensors located in the bump bars which, on contact with objects such as a wall, cause a reverse in direction, with a small offset allowing it to move one machine's width over on each crossing of the pool. The delay timer is an important feature for many pools, as many switch off a number of circulation pumps during the night to allow suspended particles to settle on the bottom of the pool; after a couple of hours the pool cleaner begins its cleaning cycle. This cleaning cycle is set up to complete before the pumps are turned back on. Though not necessary for adequate pool cleaning, this feature saves energy and improves cleaning efficiency.

In order to move forward and backward and negotiate walls and steps electric robotic cleaners rely on three natural principles, traction and movement caused by the drive motor and tracks, buoyancy created by the large areas inside the machine that fills with air, and the force resulting from the high pressure of water being emitted from the top of the machine that pushes it against the floor and walls. Some electric robotic machines use brushes made out of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [[Polyvinyl alcohol]] that has an adherence quality that allows the unit to almost cling to the walls, steps and floors. They also are resistant to dirt and oil improving lifespan over rubber or other synthetic materials.

The combination of these three natural principles along with an internal mercury switch that tells the microchip that the unit has gone from a horizontal to vertical position as it climbs a wall allows it to change direction from ascending to descending the wall at pre-programmed intervals based on the average height of a pool walls. Some machines have delayed timers that cause the robot to remain at the water line, where more dirt accumulates, for momentarily resulting in a scrubbing action, much like the wheels of a powerful automobile spinning or peeling out.

The major benefits of these machines are efficiency in time, energy, and cleaning ability as well as low maintenance requirements and costs. The major disadvantage is purchase cost which can range from $500 for floor-cleaning-only machines to over $2,000 for the most sophisticated residential units.

== Commercial versions ==

According to P.K. Data of Duluth, a Georgia consulting and market research firm that has been retained for many years by the pool and spa industry's internal trade organization, The Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals (APSP) there are approximately 14,000,000 residential pools and spas in the United States and over 400,000 commercial or public pools. As a result, this has created a market for larger, more powerful commercial pool cleaners. All commercial pool cleaners are electric robotic and can range in price from a little over $1,000 to upwards of $15,000 or more. They closely resemble residential models but in addition to their addition size they are made with heavy duty components and often more sophisticated computer guidance and on and off systems.

== Controlling legislation ==

There have been attempts for nearly 100 years to mandate the use of pool cleaners, primarily addressed to public pools. Currently the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] located in the Greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area on a grant provided by the National Swimming Pool Foundation (NSPF) is about to publish the first uniform Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). Included is a section on pool filtration proposed regulations directed to the nation's 3200+ state and local agencies that enforce laws and ordinances relating to the operation of swimming pools and spas.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Historical perspective ===

The proposed MAHC is not the first attempt to propose a uniform aquatic health code. The credit for that goes to the [[American Public Health Association]](APHA) which 100 years ago recognized the dangers of improperly maintained aquatic facilities and formed a committee in 1918 that, for the next 66 years, issued eleven so-called "Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places Standards For Design, Construction, Equipment And Operation" recommended ordinances and regulations. But for a variety of reasons none of these recommendations were adopted, at least not formally or completely adopted.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Uniform Aquatic Health Code====
The APHA has tried to develop a uniform aquatic health code, or what it referred to for years as referenced above, and published short reports annually from 1920 through 1925 that it simply referred to as "Report of the Committee On Bathing Places". and finally in 1926 &lt;ref&gt;Report of the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the A.P.H.A. and the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers 1926, Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places Report of the A. P. H. A. and the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers, presented to the Public Health Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fifty-sixth Annual Meeting at Cincinnati, Oct. 18, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; published in its journal its first comprehensive report it called "Standards for Design, Construction, Equipment and Operation" for "Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places". Twelve others were published through 1981. However, its lack of authority to enforce them is implied by the changing description of what was limited to their recommendations or suggestions and the expressed purposes in issuing them.

====Reports====
*In 1957, it referred to its report as "Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places".&lt;ref&gt;''Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places'' Prepared by the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers and the Engineering and Sanitation Section of the American Public Health Association 1957&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the most comprehensive one since 1926 and until it stopped issuing them in 1981 it referred in 1964 to its report as "Suggested Ordinance and Regulations Covering Public Swimming Pools" and in 1970 one for "Private Swimming Pools". Its last report in 1981 was called "Public Swimming Pools: Recommended Regulations for Design and Construction, Operation and Maintenance". In 1926 appears the committee believed its standards would be adopted by the empowered jurisdictions, although who they were never mentioned in the report.
*In 1964 the boldest move of all took place as it presented its recommendations in the form of proposed ordinances and regulations and in the Forward concluded: "State and local governments who desire to enact this Suggested Ordinance and Regulations Covering Public Swimming Pools a useful resource".

====New York City Meeting, 1912====
In 1912, coincidentally the same year when the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] issued the first patent for a swimming pool cleaner, the Sanitary Engineering Section of the [[American Public Health Association]] (APHA) convened in New York City to lay the groundwork for the first recommended pool and spa regulations. As reported in the American Journal of Public Health in April 1912 a meeting was held in Havana the previous December and at the New York meeting among the subjects that the committee was to be studying was "Hygiene of swimming pools".&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Volume 11, April 1912, Issue 4, Read at the Annual meeting of the Association, held in Havana, December 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later a committee on swimming pools was appointed at the APHA's annual meeting in Chicago and in 1920 a similar committee was appointed at the meeting in Washington, D.C. In 1921 and periodically over the next seven decades until the work of the APHA on this subject matter went through a series of divisions and consolidations, diverted elsewhere its committees and joint committees with other health-orientated public and quasi-public organizations issued proposed ordinances and regulations in the form of unenforceable recommendations. Despite their intended and published goals, none became law, uniform, much less national.&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Sanitary control of a public swimming pool George W. Simons, Jr., Chief Sanitary Engineer, Florida State Board of Health, Jacksonville, FLA., Read before Sanitary Engineering Section, American Public Health Association, at San Francisco, Cal.. September 17, 1920 Report of the committee on bathing places Read before the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fiftieth Annual Meeting, New York City, November 17, 1921, and adopted by vote of the Section&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the proposed Standards included more than a passing reference of the need to properly clean a pool. A few, but curiously not all of these recommended ordinances and regulations, related to the use of a vacuum, although the first that included any specificity in 1923 at least required a certain level of clarity. The 1921 report, barely a few pages in length, made this reference to the need to clean the pool.

{{ quote
| Pool cleaning is done by completely emptying the pool an average of twice weekly and scrubbing with stiff brushes and soap. Hose flushing follows the scrubbing. After the flushing outlet is opened, the well turned on and clean water allowed to water over the floor of the drains, etc...
}}

The 1923 report of the American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association read before the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fifty-second Annual Meeting at Boston, Massachusetts, October 8, 1923. slightly longer, but still very brief stated:

{{ quote
| Section 3. Clearness: At all times when the pool is in use the water shall be sufficiently clear to permit a black disk six inches in diameter on a white filed, placed on the bottom of the pool at the deepest point, to be clearly visible from both sides of the pool when the water is quiet.
}}

It further stated:

{{ quote
| No swimming pool shall be opened to the use of bathers on any day until all visible dirt (not stains) on the bottom of the pool and any visible scum or floating matter on the surface has been removed. Scum and floating matters may be infectious material and should always be removed as soon as possible after they are observed.
}}

Therefore, in 1921 it was recognized that infectious material, namely pathogens collect in the pool and should be removed.

It was not until 1926 twelve years after the organization recognized the need to address swimming pool "hygiene" and eight years after the committee was organized that the first true report was issued and later published in the Journal of the American Public Health Association. Of all of its reports from 1920 through 1981 the first major report by the APHA the 1926 one, written in narrative form as were the succeeding nine ones though 1957 the committee included the detailed provisions relating to pool cleaning, vacuuming and vacuums:

{{ quote
| E. Suction Cleaner: In the opinion of the committee the only satisfactory method of removing the dirt, hair, etc., settling on the bottom of a pool is by means of a suction cleaner. As such cleaners are commonly operated by the circulation pumps; they may be classed as an adjunct to the recirculation system. When a suction cleaner is to be operated by the recirculation pump, a gate with graduated stem or other registering device should be provided for throttling the flow from the pool outlet to permit the pump to operate at maximum efficiency when the suction cleaner is in use. Fixed pipe connections for attachment of suction cleaner to pump suction should be of ample size to reduce friction to a minimum and the cleaner and all removable connections should be designed to provide a maximum velocity at the suction nozzle.

XXVI Cleaning Pool

A. Visible dirt on the bottom of a swimming pool shall not be permitted to remain more than 24 hours.
B. Any visible scum or floating material on the surface of a pool shat be removed within 24 hours by flushing or other effective means
}}

The 1964 report included the following language:

{{ quote
| A vacuum-cleaning system shall be provided. When an integral part of the recirculation system, sufficient connections shall be located in the walls of the swimming pool, at least eight inches below the water line and "Visible dirt on the bottom of the swimming pool shall be removed every 24 hours or more frequently as required. Visible scum or floating matter on the swimming pool surface shall be removed within 24 hours by flushing or other effective means.
}}

The CDC was founded (in 1946), followed by the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Education and Welfare (in 1953), now the Department of Health, and Human Services and its 11 operating divisions, the National Health Service Corps (in 1977) and along the way a variety of private and non-profit aquatic organizations such as the National Spa and Pool Association (in 1956), now the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals the National Swimming Pool Foundation (in 1965).

Presently a variety, but not by a long shot the majority, of states and jurisdictions that have codified the requirement of inclusion of an independent vacuum cleaner including the two states with the highest number and concentration of both residential and public pools:

California: 2010 Title 24, Part 2, Vol. 2 California Building Code. Section 3140B, Cleaning Systems:

{{ quote
| A vacuum cleaning system shall be available which is capable of removing sediment from all parts of the pool floor. A cleaning system using potable water shall be provided with an approved backflow protection device as required by the California Department of Public Health under Sections 7601 to 7605.
| &lt;ref&gt;2010 Title 24, Part 2, Vol. 2 California Building Code. Section 3140B, Cleaning Systems&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Florida:

Florida Department of Health section 64E-9.007 Recirculation and Treatment System Requirements

{{ quote
| (12) Cleaning system&amp;nbsp;– A portable or plumbed in vacuum cleaning system shall be provided. All vacuum pumps shall be equipped with hair and lint strainers. Recirculation or separate vacuum pumps shall not be used for vacuuming purposes when in excess of 3 horsepower. When the system is plumbed in, the vacuum fittings shall be located to allow cleaning the pool with a 50 foot maximum length of hose. Vacuum fittings shall be mounted no more than 15 inches below the water level, flush with the pool walls, and shall be provided with a spring loaded safety cover which shall be in place at all times. Bag type cleaners which operate as ejectors on potable water supply pressure must be protected by a vacuum breaker. Cleaning devices shall not be used while the pool is open to bathers.
| &lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Health section 64E-9.007 Recirculation and Treatment System Requirements&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

=== Call to action ===

In 2005 the CDC in response to a growing concern and feared epidemic with the [[pathogen]] [[Cryptosporidium]] the Center for Disease Control [[Center for Disease Control]], much like the [[American Public Health Association]] did in 1912 convened many of the country's foremost medical and other scientific experts to study the concern for aquatic health. As a result, in 2007 they began their quest, again much like the APHC for a uniform aquatic health code.

Each health and safety segment has been assigned to a committee to study it and draft a proposed module open for public comment before being adopted and then recommended to the nation's 3200+ state and local health agencies that enact ordinances and regulations for swimming pools and spa and other aquatic facilities, inspect and monitor them and then enforce the regulations. Since the focus of the MAHC was to respond to the threat of Cryptosporidium the Technical Committee of Recirculation Systems and Filtration is a major focus. The University of North Carolina Charlotte Associate Professor James Amburgey is the Chairperson of the Center For Disease Control, Model Aquatic Health Code Technical Committee on Recirculation Systems and Filtration.

Amburgey has conducted many tests to evaluation existing swimming pool filters and his conclusions have been they are extremely ineffective in most cases to help remove Cryptosporidium.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Amburgey, Jonathan M. Goodman, Olufemi Aborisade, Ping Lu, Caleb L. Peeler, Will H. Shull, Roy R. Fielding, Michael J. Arrowood, Jennifer L. Murphy and Vincent R. Hill, "Are Swimming Pool Filters Really Removing Cryptosporidium?' University of North Carolina at Charlotte&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to be working with several manufacturers of swimming pool and spa vacuum cleaners to develop a filter bag that will result in exponential advancements in the current filter bags, cleaners and vacuums on the market.

An '''automatic weather station''' (AWS) is an automated version of the traditional [[weather station]], either to save human labour or to enable measurements from remote areas.&lt;ref name=AWSs/&gt; An AWS will typically consist of a weather-proof enclosure containing the [[data logger]], [[rechargeable battery]], [[telemetry]] (optional) and the meteorological sensors with an attached [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] or [[wind turbine]] and mounted upon a mast. The specific configuration may vary due to the purpose of the system.&lt;ref name="AWSs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automaticweatherstation.com/index.html|title=Automatic Weather Stations|last=King|first=Jeremy|accessdate=2009-04-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090522121225/http://www.automaticweatherstation.com/index.html| archivedate= 22 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system may report in near real time via the [[Argos System]] and the [[Global Telecommunications System]],&lt;ref name="AWSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwamrc.ssec.wisc.edu/aboutaws.html |title=About the Automatic Weather Station project |work=Automatic Weather Station project |publisher=The National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204082102/http://uwamrc.ssec.wisc.edu/aboutaws.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or save the data for later recovery.&lt;ref name="ADDI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aadi.no/Aanderaa/Products/AWS/default.aspx|title=ADDI Automatic weather stations|publisher=ADDI|accessdate=2009-04-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326051841/http://www.aadi.no/Aanderaa/Products/AWS/default.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-26|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the past, automatic weather stations were often placed where [[electricity]] and communication lines were available. Nowadays, the [[photovoltaic module|solar panel]], [[wind turbine]] and [[mobile phone]] technology have made it possible to have wireless stations that are not connected to the electrical grid or hardline telecommunications network.&lt;ref name=ABM/&gt;

==Sensors==

* [[Anemometer]] for measuring [[wind speed]]
* [[Wind vane]] for measuring [[wind direction]]
* [[Hygrometer]] for measuring [[humidity]]
* [[Barometer]] for measuring [[atmospheric pressure]]

Some stations can also have&lt;ref name="ABM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/pub_ag/aws/aws.shtml|title=Automatic Weather Stations for Agricultural|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=2009-04-15| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090531104246/http%3A//www%2Ebom%2Egov%2Eau/inside/services_policy/pub_ag/aws/aws%2Eshtml| archivedate= May 31, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ceilometer]] for measuring cloud height
* Present weather sensor and/or [[visibility]] sensor 
* [[Rain gauge]] for measuring liquid-equivalent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]
* Ultrasonic snow depth sensor for measuring depth of [[snow]]
* [[Pyranometer]] for measuring [[solar radiation]]

Unlike manual weather stations, [[automated airport weather station]]s cannot report the class and amount of [[cloud]]s. Also, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] measurements are difficult, especially for [[snow]], as the gauge must empty itself between observations. For present weather, all phenomena that do not touch the sensor, such as [[fog]] patches, remain unobserved.&lt;ref name=AWSs/&gt; The change from manual observations to automatic weather stations is a major non-climatic change in the climate record.&lt;ref name="begert"&gt;Begert, M., Schlegel, T., and Kirchhofer, W.: Homogeneous temperature and precipitation series of Switzerland from 1864 to 2000. Int. J. Climatol., 25, 65–80, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The change in instrumentation, enclosure and location can lead to a jump in, for example, the measured temperature or precipitation values, which can lead to erroneous estimates of climate trends. This change, and related non-climatic changes, have to be removed by [[homogenization_(climate)|homogenization]].

==Data-logger==
[[File:Data-logger for automatic weather station.png|thumb| Data-logger for automatic weather station]]
The data-logger is the heart of the Automatic Weather Station.&lt;br/&gt;
In high quality weather stations, the data-logger may be designed by the supplier to be the perfect solution for a particular meteorological client.
Indeed, usually data-loggers found in the market don't fit the requirement in terms of power consumption, inputs, communication, protection against animals (ants, rats, etc.),  humidity, salty air, sand, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
The main functions of a data-logger are:
* Measurement: the data-logger collects the information from every sensor and archives it.
* Calculation: the data-logger processes most of the meteorological data for the users (avg, min, max...).
* Data storage: the data-logger saves all the data either on its own memory or on uSD memory card.
* Power supply: the data-logger manages the power supply of the Automatic Weather Station, using a solar panel for instance.
* Communication: the data-logger manages the communication protocols with the remote server. The different communication protocols are usually [[GSM]], [[GPRS]], [[Real-time communication|RTC]], [[WiFi]], [[Secure Digital|uSD]], and [[RS232]].

==Enclosures==
[[File:Weather Station Enclosure.png|thumb|left|Enclosure with solar panel for data-logger of weather station]]
Enclosures used with automatic weather stations are typically weather proof [[fiberglass]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or [[stainless steel]], With ABS being the cheapest, cast aluminium paint&lt;ref name="AWS-AluminiumEnclosure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulsonic.net/dmdocuments/Dc0073-0-EN%20Pulsiane%204.pdf|title=AWS with cast aluminium enclosure|accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or stainless steel the most durable and fiberglass being a compromise.&lt;ref name=AWSs/&gt;












[[File:AWS(Automatic Weather station).JPG|thumb|AWS]]

==Power supply==
The main power source for an automatic weather station depends on its usage.  Many stations with lower power equipment usually use one or more solar panels connected in parallel with a [[battery regulator|regulator]] and one or more rechargeable batteries. As a rule of thumb, solar output is at its optimum for only 5 hours each day. As such, mounting angle and position are vital. In the Northern Hemisphere, the solar panel would be mounted facing south and vice versa for the Southern Hemisphere. The output from the solar panels may be supplemented by a wind turbine to provide power during periods of poor sunlight, or by direct connection to the local electrical grid.  Most [[automated airport weather station]]s are connected to the commercial power grid due to the higher power needs of the ceilometer and present weather sensors, which are active sensors and emit energy directly into the environment.&lt;ref name=ABM/&gt;

==Mast==
The standard mast heights used with automatic weather stations are 2, 3, 10 and 30 meters. Other sizes are available, but typically these sizes have been used as standards for differing applications.&lt;ref name=AWSs/&gt;
*The 2 meter (6.6 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect a human subject. The mast height is referenced to head height.
*The 3 meter (9.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect crops (such as wheat, sugar cane etc.) The mast height is referenced to crop top.
*The 10 meter (32.8 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters without interference from objects such as trees, buildings or other obstructions. Typically the most important weather parameter measured at this height is wind speed and direction.
*The 30 meter (98.4 feet) mast is used for the measurement of parameters over stratified distances for the purposes of data modelling. A common application is to take measurements of [[wind]], [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] at 30, 10, and 2 meters. Other sensors are mounted around the 2 meter or lower height.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">'''Bank Night''' was a lottery game franchise in the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. It was invented and marketed by [[Charles U. Yaeger]], a former booking agent for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="time37"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bank Night Bans|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|date=1937-01-11|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757281,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Bank Night was played at 5,000 of America's 15,000 active theaters, and copies of it were played at countless more.&lt;ref name="time37" /&gt; The popularity of Bank Night and similar schemes contributed to the resiliency of the film industry during the Great Depression more than any other single business tactic.&lt;ref name="cinema"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the American cinema Hollywood as a modern business enterprise|pages=28|author=Balio, T.|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_J9HTLOI08wC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;vq=Bank+Night&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3r_bv39YxA93kOFvinrm9bisIAQg|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-20334-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Bank Night was run as a franchise which was leased to theaters for from $5 to $50 a week, depending on their size. The payment entitled the owner to run an event called Bank Night, and each owner was given a film reel with a Bank Night trailer, as well as a registration book and equipment to draw numbers to pick winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moviegoing in America: A Sourcebook in the History of Film Exhibition|author=Waller, Gregory Albert|year=2001|isbn=0-631-22592-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uDrSrWWq9EC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone could enter their name in a book kept by the theater manager, and on Bank Night, a name would be drawn at random. The person selected must reach the stage within a set amount of time to claim their prize, usually a few minutes (they would not be required to purchase a ticket to enter the theater). While not technically requiring any purchase, and thus circumventing the numerous local lottery laws of the time, Bank Night had the effect of drawing people to theaters, many of whom bought tickets anyway.&lt;ref name="time37" /&gt;

==History==
Yeager invented Bank Night in 1931 in [[Denver, Colorado]]. The concept was immediately successful. Although lucrative, the franchise faced scrutiny from state and municipal authorities, who often challenged theaters in court for holding Bank Nights.&lt;ref name="time37" /&gt; It quickly spawned copycats to get around the franchise fee, such as ''Prosperity Night'', ''Treasure Night'' and ''Movie Sweepstakes''.&lt;ref name="cinema" /&gt;

An example was the sweepstakes held at the [[Palace Theatre (Marion, Ohio)|Palace Theatre]] in Marion, Ohio. Starting May 7, 1936, the Palace held a weekly, Wednesday night sweepstakes. Patrons were given a free sweepstakes ticket when a Wednesday matinee movie ticket was purchased. Also, any adult who wanted to participate in the Wednesday night drawing could simply stop by the theatre and register. It was not necessary to purchase a movie ticket or to be inside the theatre when the winner was announced. Each participant received a ticket with the name of a horse. On the Palace stage, a drawing was made in which the names of 20 horses were picked from a huge wire hopper. Once announced, each horse name was placed on a blackboard opposite one of 20 numbers. Then, four films were carried to the stage, each of them showing 20 horses in a race. Someone chose a film and it was taken to the projection booth, and the film was shown. Each horse had a number, and the audience watched the race. The order of finish determined the winner of the first ($200), second ($10) and third ($5) prizes. If the winner was not in the theatre the prize accumulated for the next week. The legality of the popular sweepstakes was challenged by a local prosecutor under Ohio's anti-lottery rules after a [[Keystone Cops]]-like raid on the theatre during a performance. The prosecutor's legal theory was rejected by the jury and the theatre management immediately reinstated the sweepstakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Scott|title=A Theatre History of Marion, Ohio: John Eberson's Palace &amp; Beyond|date=2015|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston|pages=108–112|isbn=9781626199507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fad lost much of its popularity by the late 1930s, first to competing games such as [[Screeno]] and other lottery-like games, but popularity further declined as cities such as [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]] took stances against Bank Night and similar games in 1936, and soon theater owners in many jurisdictions faced arrest or fines for running Bank Nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1937-01-26|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=ANENT THE STRANGE PRACTICE OF 'BANK NIGHT'|pages=X5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The improving economy and [[World War II]] also contributed to changing consumer tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Venerable venue had awesome beginnings|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|author=HARTZELL, SCOTT TAYLOR|date=2002-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bank Night was the plot of the 1936 [[Charley Chase]] short ''Neighborhood House''. Bank Nights were jokingly referenced in the films ''[[After the Thin Man]]'' and "Calling All Husbands" (1940) . It is also mentioned in at least two Warner Brothers cartoons directed by [[Tex Avery]]: ''[[A Day at the Zoo]]'' and ''[[Thugs with Dirty Mugs]]'' (both released in 1939). Bank Nights were also humorously referenced in the Hope/Crosby film "Road to Singapore" (1940) and the 1939 film adaptation of the Rodgers and Hart musical "[[On Your Toes]]".

[[File:Toronto ON 2003 Blackout.jpg|thumb|right|alt=City skyline at dusk with only a very few office building windows lit|Toronto during the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]], which required black-starting of generating stations.]]

A '''black start''' is the process of restoring an electric [[power station]] or a part of an [[electric grid]] to operation without relying on the external [[transmission network|electric power transmission network]] to recover from a total or partial shutdown.&lt;ref name=Knight01&gt;Knight, U.G.  ''Power Systems in Emergencies - From Contingency Planning to Crisis Management '' John Wiley &amp; Sons 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-471-49016-6}} section 7.5 The 'Black Start' Situation&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, the electric power used within the plant is provided from the station's own generators.  If all of the plant's main generators are shut down, station service power is provided by drawing power from the grid through the plant's transmission line. However, during a wide-area outage, off-site power from the grid is not available. In the absence of grid power, a so-called black start needs to be performed to [[Bootstrapping#Electric power grid|bootstrap]] the power grid into operation.

To provide a black start, some power stations have  small [[diesel generator]]s, normally called the ''black start diesel generator'' (BSDG), which can be used to start larger generators (of several [[megawatt]]s capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for [[boiler feedwater pump]]s, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation.  It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections.  A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide [[excitation_(magnetic)|excitation]] current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations.  Certain types of [[combustion turbine]] can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.&lt;ref&gt;Philip P. Walsh, Paul Fletcher ''Gas turbine performance'', John Wiley and Sons, 2004 {{ISBN|0-632-06434-X}},  page  486&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a utility in Southern California has successfully demonstrated the use of a battery energy storage system to provide a black start, firing up a combined cycle gas turbine from an idle state.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energy-storage.news/news/california-batterys-black-start-capability-hailed-as-major-accomplishment-i&lt;/ref&gt;

==A black start sequence==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
One method of black start (based on a real scenario) might be as follows:
# A [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] starts a small [[diesel generator]] installed in a hydroelectric generating station.
# The power from the diesel generator is used to bring the generating station into operation.
# Key [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines between the station and other areas are energized.
# The power from the station is used to start one of the nuclear/fossil-fuel-fired [[base load power plant|base load]] plants.
# The power from the base load plant is used to restart all of the other power plants in the system.

Power is finally re-applied to the general [[electricity distribution]] network and sent to the consumers.  Often this will happen gradually; starting the entire grid at once may be unfeasible. In particular, after a lengthy outage during summer, all buildings will be warm, and if the power were restored at once, the demand from air conditioning units alone would be more than the grid could supply. In colder climates a similar issue can occur in winter with the use of heating devices.

In a larger grid, black start will often involve starting multiple "islands" of generation (each supplying local load areas), and then synchronising and reconnecting these islands to form a complete grid.  The power stations involved have to be able to accept large step changes in load as the grid is reconnected.

There are multiple methods of commencing a black start: hydro-electric dams, diesel generators, open cycle gas turbines, compressed air storage, and so on.  Different generating networks take different approaches, dependent on factors such as cost, complexity, the availability of local resources (i.e. suitable valleys for dams), the interconnectivity with other generating networks, and the response time necessary for the black start process.

==Procurement of black start services==
[[File:ERCOTOperator 2.jpg|thumb|An operator at ERCOT]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the grid operator has commercial agreements in place with some generators to provide black start capacity, recognising that black start facilities are often not economic in normal grid operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/99A34EB4-76F4-4042-AA12-35D6DD843FA7/3073/black_start.pdf Introduction to Black Start](National Grid plc) Covers technical and commercial background.&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical of power stations from the [[CEGB]] era to have a number of open-cycle gas turbines (i.e. no heat recovery modules attached) that can run the entirety of the plant necessary to operating a full generating unit; these would normally be started by diesel generators, fed in turn by battery backups. Once up to speed these gas turbines are capable of running the entire plant associated with the rest of the power station, negating the need to bring power in from other sources.

In the North American [[independent system operator]]s, the procurement of black start varies somewhat. Traditionally, black start was provided by integrated utilities and the costs were rolled into a broad tariff for cost recovery from ratepayers. In those areas which are not part of organized electricity markets, this is still the usual procurement mechanism.  In the deregulated environment, this legacy of cost-based provision has persisted, and even recent overhauls of black-start procurement practices, such as that by the [[ISO New England]], have not necessarily shifted to competitive procurement, although deregulated jurisdictions have a bias for market solutions rather than cost-of-service (COS) solutions.

In the United States, there are currently three methods of procuring black start. The most common is cost-of-service, as it is the simplest and is the traditional method. It is currently used by the [[California Independent System Operator]] (CAISO), the [[PJM Interconnection]]&lt;ref&gt;See PJM Tariff: Schedule 6A of the PJM Tariff, available online at: http://www.pjm.com/documents/downloads/agreements/tariff.pdf and
Blackstart Business Rules, available online at: http://www.ieso.ca/Documents/consult/se16/se16_DACP-SWG-20060216-pjm-blackstart.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NYISO|New York Independent System Operator]]&lt;ref&gt;See the NYISO Accounting and Billing Manual, 2006, available online at: http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/documents/manuals/administrative/acctbillmnl.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt; (NYISO). Although the exact mechanisms differ somewhat the same approach is used, namely that units are identified for black start and their documented costs are then funded and rolled into a tariff for cost recovery. The second method is a new method used by the Independent System Operator of New England&lt;ref&gt;See  ISO-NE "Order Accepting Application" Docket No. ER03-291, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , Issued Feb. 14 2003, available online at http://www.iso-ne.com/committees/comm_wkgrps/trans_comm/tariff_comm/mtrls/2006/may162006/index.html

&lt;/ref&gt; (ISO-NE). The new methodology is a flat rate payment which increases black start remuneration to encourage provision. The monthly compensation paid to a generator is determined by multiplying a flat rate (in $/KWyr and referred to as the $Y value) by the unit's Monthly Claimed Capability for that month. The purpose of this change was to simplify procurement and encourage  provision of the black start service. The final method of procurement is competitive procurement as used by the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;See ERCOT Protocols Section 6, 2006 available online at: {{cite web

  ERCOT’s bidding form is available online at: http://www.ercot.com/mktrules/protocols/current/22-%28A%29BlackStart-050105.doc
&lt;/ref&gt; (ERCOT). Under this approach ERCOT runs a market for black start services. Interested participants submit an hourly standby cost in $/hr (e.g. $70 per hour), often termed an availability bid, that is unrelated to the capacity of the unit. Using various criteria ERCOT evaluates these bids and the selected units are paid as bid, presuming an 85% availability. Each black start unit must be able to demonstrate that it can startup another unit in close proximity to begin the islanding and synchronization of the grid.

In other jurisdictions there are differing methods of procurement. The New Zealand System Operator&lt;ref&gt;See the Electricity Commission of New Zealand's Governance Rules, Schedule C5, Nov. 1 2005 at 180-182, available online at: {{cite web|url=http://www.electricitycommission.govt.nz/pdfs/rulesandregs/rules/rulespdf/Part-C-sched-C5-1Nov05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007072811/http://www.electricitycommission.govt.nz/pdfs/rulesandregs/rules/rulespdf/Part-C-sched-C5-1Nov05.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; procures the blackstart capability via competitive tender. Other jurisdictions also appear to have some sort of competitive procurement, although not as structured as ERCOT. These include the [[Alberta Electric System Operator]],&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.aeso.ca/files/Nov05_BlackstartPP_v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Independent Electric System Operator of Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.theimo.com/imoweb/marketsAndPrograms/anc_serv.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228022033/http://www.theimo.com/imoweb/marketsAndPrograms/anc_serv.asp |archivedate=2008-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which use a long-term "request for proposals" approach similar to New Zealand and ERCOT.

Though black-outs are common occurrences in North America,{{Citation needed|reason=They are not common in Canada and the US.  Although they might be in Mexico and Central America, then North America should not be used.|date=June 2018}} they are virtually unknown in Germany. The first black start on a Germany's grid was tested in 2017 at WEMAG battery power station in Schwerin on a disconnected, isolated grid. The WEMAG battery plant proved that it can restore the power grid after major disruption or blackout.&lt;ref&gt;https://cleantechnica.com/2017/08/15/first-black-start-germanys-grid/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations on black start sources==
Not all generating plants are suitable for black-start capability.  Wind turbines are not suitable for black start because wind may not be available when needed.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Brendan et al; '' Wind Power Integration - Connection and System Operational Aspects'', Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2007 
{{ISBN|978-0-86341-449-7}} page 245&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind turbine]]s, [[small hydro|mini-hydro]], or [[micro-hydro]] plants, are often connected to [[induction generator]]s which are incapable of providing power to re-energize the network. &lt;ref&gt; George G. Karady, Keith E. Holbert, ''Electrical Energy Conversion and Transport: An Interactive Computer-Based Approach'',John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, {{ISBN|1118498038}} page 9-57&lt;/ref&gt;   The black-start unit must also be stable when operated with the large reactive load of a long transmission line. Many [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) converter stations cannot operate into a "dead" system, either, since they require [[Commutator (electric)|commutation]] power from the system at the load end.  A [[Pulse-width modulation]] (PWM)-based voltage-source converter HVDC scheme has no such restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Beaty, H. Wayne; Fink, Donald G. (ed) '' Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th Edition)'', McGraw-Hill 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-07-144146-9}} page 15-22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design Academy Eindhoven''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] educational institute for [[art]], [[architecture]] and [[design]] in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]. The work of its faculty and alumni have brought it international recognition.

==History==

The Design Academy Eindhoven was established in 1955 and was originally named the Akademie Industriële Vormgeving Eindhoven. In 1997, the Academy moved into "[[:nl:Witte Dame (gebouw)|De Witte Dame]]" (The White Lady) building and subsequently changed its name to Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE). In 1999, [[Lidewij Edelkoort|Li Edelkoort]], was elected chairwoman of the Academy. In 2009 she left the Design Academy to pursue personal projects and was replaced by Anne Mieke Eggenkamp as chair. She was in turn succeeded by Thomas Widdershoven from 2013 until September 2016. Since 2017, Joseph Grima has taken place as CD.

==Structure==

The bachelor's program is split into eight [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic department|departments]], broadly covering art, architecture, fashion design, graphic design and industrial design. As the structure of the bachelor's program is intended to be flexible, students are free to move between departments and all students graduate with the same degree, a [[Bachelor of Design]].

The DAE also offers four distinct master's programs: [[M.Des]] Contextual Design, [[M.Des]] Social Design, [[M.Des]]  Information Design, and [[M.Des]] Design Curating and Writing.

==International Reputation==

The Design Academy Eindhoven's (DAE) emphasis on engaging complex social and cultural issues has gained it an international reputation. The Dutch collective [[Droog Design]] features several DAE alumni, ''Orange Alert'' organizes exhibitions and events of DAE students work in New York and several DAE alumni have been nominated for the "Designer of the Year" awards at the [[Design Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/02/garden/a-school-for-new-dutch-masters.html?pagewanted=all Stephen Treffinger, "A School for New Dutch Masters"], ''The New York Times'', 2 Oct 2003, accessed 2 Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''House of Concepts: Design Academy Eindhoven'' tells the 60-year history of the academy, outlining how many significant Dutch artists, architects and designers have been associated with the DAE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.square-mag.co.uk/2009/01/21/house-of-concepts-design-academy-eindhoven/ "House of Concepts: Design Academy Eindhoven"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605040931/http://www.square-mag.co.uk/2009/01/21/house-of-concepts-design-academy-eindhoven/ |date=2009-06-05 }}, ''Square'' magazine, 21 Jan 2009, accessed 3 Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Every year, in the fall, the [[Dutch Design Week]] is held in Eindhoven with an array of Design-related events.  These include the graduation exhibit (featuring the works of that year's graduates of the DAE) and the [[Dutch Design Awards]].

'''Detonating cord''' (also called '''detonation cord''', '''detacord''', '''det. cord''', '''detcord''', '''primer cord''' or '''sun cord''') is a thin, flexible plastic tube usually filled with [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]] (PETN, pentrite). With the PETN exploding at a rate of approximately 6400 m/s, any common length of detonation cord appears to explode instantaneously. It is a high-speed [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]] which explodes, rather than burns, and is suitable for detonating [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]]s. The [[velocity of detonation]] is sufficient to use it for synchronizing multiple charges to detonate almost simultaneously even if the charges are placed at different distances from the point of initiation. It is used to reliably and inexpensively chain together multiple explosive charges. Typical uses include [[mining]], [[drill]]ing, [[demolition]]s, and warfare.

"[[Cordtex]]" and "[[Primacord]]" are two of many [[trademark]]s which have slipped into use as a [[Generic trademark|generic]] term for this material.

== Effects ==
As a transmission medium, it can act as a downline between the initiator (usually a trigger) and the blast area, and as a trunkline connecting several different explosive charges. As a timing mechanism, detonation cord [[detonation|detonates]] at a very reliable rate (about [[Orders of magnitude (speed)|7,000–8,000]] m/[[second|s]]), enabling engineers to control the pattern in which charges are detonated. This is particularly useful for demolitions, when structural elements need to be destroyed in a specific order to control the collapse of a building.

While it looks like nylon cord, the core is a compressed powdered [[explosive material|explosive]], usually PETN (pentrite), and it is initiated by the use of a [[blasting cap]]. Detonation cord will initiate most commercial high explosives ([[dynamite]], [[gelignite]], sensitised gels, etc.) but will not initiate less sensitive blasting agents like [[ANFO]] on its own. 25 to 50 grain/foot (5.3 to 10.6 g/m) detonation cord has approximately the same initiating power as a #8 blasting cap in every 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) along its entire length. A small charge of PETN, [[TNT]], or other [[explosive booster]] is required to bridge between the cord and a charge of insensitive blasting agent like ANFO or most [[Water_gel_explosive|water gels]].

==Rating==
Detonating cord is rated in explosive mass per unit length. This is expressed in [[grain (measure)|grain]]s per foot in the United States, or in grams per metre elsewhere. A "grams per metre" rating will be roughly one fifth the "grains per foot" rating. For example, "50 grain det. cord" refers to detonating cord which has 50 grains of explosive per foot of length—or approximately 10 g/m. This is a typical "default" rating for connecting charges for blasting; lighter detonating cords may be used for "low noise blasting" and movie [[special effect]]s, while heavier cords, used where the cord is employed to have some direct explosive effect—such as for precision rock carving work—may use 50 to 250 grain/foot (10 to 50 g/m) detonating cord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crazyhorsememorial.org/about-us/carving-the-mountain/an-inside-look-at-carving-a-mountain/ An Inside Look at Carving a Mountain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct employment==
Low-yield detonating cord can be used as a precision cutting charge to remove cables, pipes, wiring, fiber optics, and other utility bundles by placing one or more complete wraps around the target. Detonation cord is used in commercial boilers to break up clinkers (solidified coal ash slag) adhering to tube structures. Also a vertical centered cord being lowered into the water of a drilled well can remove any clogging that obstructs water flow.  Higher-yield detonating cord can be used to cut down small trees, although the process is very uneconomical compared to using bulk explosive, or even a chainsaw. High-yield detonating cord placed by divers has been used to remove old dock pilings and other underwater obstructions.  Creating a slipknot from detonating cord yields a field-improvised device that can be quickly employed to cut a locked doorknob off a door. Detonation cord can be taped in several rings to the outline of a military man-sized target and detonated, breaching a man-sized hole into wooden doors or light interior walls. Detonating cord is also employed directly in building demolition where thin concrete slabs need be broken via channels drilled parallel to the surface, an advantage over dynamite since a lower minimum of explosive force may be used and smaller diameter holes are sufficient to contain the explosive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/detonators/about/about.html Discovery Channel ''The Detonators'' Episode 4: BEACH RESORT and INDUSTRIAL CHIMNEY]&lt;/ref&gt; Anything much more substantial than these uses requires the use of additional explosives.

==Colloquialisms==
The Finnish army [[colloquialism]] for detonation cord is ''anopin pyykkinaru'' (mother-in-law's clothesline), as it resembles ordinary clothesline.

In [[Filipino language|Filipino]], the corresponding word ''mitsa'' has come to be used in a phrase “mitsa ng buhay” which translates to "detonating cord of [one’s] life", a metaphor for something that is very likely to cause one’s death via direct jeopardization (e.g. extreme sports, versus smoking).

==In media==
Detonation cord was referenced in the 2009 film ''[[A Perfect Getaway]]'' by [[Timothy Olyphant]]'s character as "a handy tool".

A length of detonation cord was used to clear a path through a minefield in the 2009 film ''[[Terminator Salvation]]''.

Detonation cord was shown to be used by US cavalry troops to clear trees from a landing zone in the 2002 movie ''[[We Were Soldiers]]''.

A spool of primer cord was used by [[Alan Alda]]'s character Hawkeye in the TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M.A.S.H.]]'' (Season 9, Episode 12, "Depressing News") to demolish his newly built replica of the [[Washington Monument]] crafted from tongue depressors.

Fiona Glenanne from the TV show [[Burn Notice]] uses detonating cord very often to breach enemy buildings.

'''Doug Richard''' (born May 6, 1958) is an American entrepreneur best known for his television appearances in the United Kingdom. He appeared as a "Dragon" on the first two series of ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]'' and was also a government adviser.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/bipc/pdfs/richardreport2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525202132/http://www.bl.uk/bipc/pdfs/richardreport2008.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-richard-review-of-apprenticeships|title=The Richard Review of Apprenticeships|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education==
Richard received his undergraduate degree from [[University of California at Berkeley]] majoring in psychology in 1980. He received his Doctorate of Law at [[University of California at Los Angeles]] in 1985. He received his Executive Management Certificate from UCLA School of Business in 1989.

==Business background==
Richard founded his first company, ITAL Computers in 1985, which sold services that integrated computer aided design and manufacture systems to the southern California aerospace industry. ITAL Computers was sold in a private transaction in 1991 and the profits used to found his second company, Visual Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2810687/Doug-Richard-biography.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Doug Richard biography | date=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard co-founded, managed and sold Visual Software with his partner John Halloran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Micrografx Inc| url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/micrografx-inc | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Visual Software was sold to [[Micrografx]], a NASDAQ listed public company for $12,000,000 in shares in 1996.  In 1997, Richard became the president and CEO of Micrografx, the company by whom he had been acquired the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lets-talk-computers.com/guests/micrografx/igrafx/|title=Let's Talk Computers - Interviews with MicroGrafx - About iGrafx Designer Suite|work=lets-talk-computers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stb-systems-licenses-micrografx-simply-3d-2-leading-3d-graphics-software-to-be-bundled-with-stbs-multimedia-accelerator-boards-75597987.html|title=STB Systems Licenses Micrografx Simply 3D 2 Leading 3D Graphics Software to...

Micrografx was sold to Corel Corporation in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2583085/enterprise-applications/corel-expanding-graphics-offerings-by-buying-micrografx.html|title=Corel expanding graphics offerings by buying Micrografx|author=Todd R.

After the sale of [[Corel]] Corporation, Richard re-located to [[Cambridge]] with his family. Shortly after the move, Richard co-founded the Cambridge Angels,&lt;ref&gt;http://cambridgeangels.com/&lt;/ref&gt; an angel investment group focusing on technology startups in the Cambridge region, with Robert Sansom in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-angels-group|title=Cambridge Angels group|work=crunchbase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from the Cambridge Angels in 2008.

Richard was an active angel investor from 2001-2008. His first investment was in a [[Manchester]] based startup, Designer Servers, known as DSVR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/Designer-Servers-(UK-virtual-server-hosting-company)-(DSVR).html|title=DSVR - Designer Servers (UK virtual server hosting company) - AcronymFinder|work=acronymfinder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whatinvestment.co.uk/article_assets/articledir_4748/2374468/What_Investment_Angel_Guide_LKD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;    Richard and the founders successfully exited from the company in 2004 when it was sold to the company that became Legend Communications, PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1787928 | work=Bloomberg | title=Designer Servers Ltd.: Private Company Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2001, Richard co-founded [[Library House]] with a group of entrepreneurs and angel investors from the Cambridge Cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econsultancy.com/nma-archive/28189-library-house-to-help-vcs-find-best-cambridge-investments|title=Library House to help VCs find best Cambridge investments|author=NMA Staff|work=NMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Library House was founded as a buy-side research house focusing on technology startups and be-spoke analysis for venture capital firms. The financial downturn in 2008 led venture firms to reduce their investments in research forcing Library House into administration as another victim of the global downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/dec/05/startups-downturn|title=Library House online VC tracker goes in to administration|author=paidContent|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its database of transactions, which was the only database of European venture activity, was sold to Dow Jones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library House]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Richard co-founded Trutap, with David Whitewood, a mobile software company offering free text and interactive messaging across the internet, prior to the introduction of smart phones. Trutap received three rounds of funding from two investors, Tudor Investments and the Cambridge Angels. The company closed in good order and the remaining investment was returned to Investors after the company was unable to pivot with the introduction and success of the [[iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trutap|title=Trutap|work=crunchbase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Richard founded School for Startups Ltd.

==''Dragons' Den''==
In late 2004, Richard was approached by the [[BBC]] to join a new reality TV show called ''[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]]''. Richard was joined by [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]], [[Duncan Bannatyne]], [[Rachel Elnaugh]] and [[Simon Woodroffe]] as the first 'Dragons'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/about/history.shtml|title=BBC - Dragons' Den - About the Show - History of the show|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard appeared on the first two series of the programme. He voluntarily stepped down after the end of the second series after accepting a position as a venture partner with the hedge fund Tudor Investments.

'''Electrorheological''' ('''ER''') '''fluids''' are [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s of extremely fine non-conducting but electrically active particles (up to 50 [[micrometre]]s diameter) in an electrically insulating [[fluid]]. The apparent [[viscosity]] of these fluids changes reversibly by an order of up to 100,000 in response to an [[electric field]]. For example, a typical ER fluid can go from the consistency of a [[liquid]] to that of a [[gel]], and back, with response times on the order of [[millisecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanicheh|first=Azadeh|last2=Mintzopoulos|first2=Dionyssios|date=June 2008|others=et al|title=Evaluation of Electrorheological Fluid Dampers for Applications at 3-T MRI Environment|url=http://www.coe.neu.edu/Research/robots/papers/TM_HERI_v2.pdf|journal=IEEE/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS|series=3|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is sometimes called the Winslow effect after its discoverer, the American inventor Willis Winslow, who obtained a US patent on the effect in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2417850}}: Winslow, W. M.: 'Method and means for translating electrical impulses into mechanical force', 25 March 1947&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote an article published in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Winslow | first = Willis M. | title = Induced fibration of suspensions | journal = J. Appl. Phys. | volume = 20 | pages = 1137–1140 | year = 1949 | doi = 10.1063/1.1698285 | issue = 12 |bibcode = 1949JAP....20.1137W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The normal application of ER fluids is in fast acting [[hydraulic manifold|hydraulic valves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Simmonds | first = AJ | title = Electro-rheological valves in a hydraulic circuit | journal = IEE Proceedings-D | volume = 138 | issue = 4 | pages = 400–404 |date=July 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[clutch]]es, with the separation between plates being in the order of 1&amp;nbsp;mm and the applied [[potential]] being in the order of 1 kV. In simple terms, when the electric field is applied, an ER hydraulic valve is shut or the plates of an ER clutch are locked together, when the electric field is removed the ER hydraulic valve is open or the clutch plates are disengaged. Other common applications are in ER [[brakes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Seed | first = M |last2=Hobson|first2= GS|last3=Tozer|first3= RC|last4=Simmonds|first4= AJ| title = Voltage-controlled Electrorheological brake | booktitle = Proc. IASTED Int. Symp. Measurement, Sig. Proc. and Control | publisher = ACTA Press | pages = Paper No. 105-092-1 | date = September 1986 | location = Taormina, Italy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (think of a brake as a clutch with one side fixed) and [[shock absorbers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stanway | first = R |last2=Sproston|first2= JL|last3=El-Wahed|first3= AK| title = Applications of electro-rheological fluids in vibration control: a survey | journal = Smart Mater.

There are many novel uses for these fluids. Potential uses are in accurate abrasive polishing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14040048 | title=The electromechanical principle of electrorheological fluid-assisted polishing | author=KIM W. B. | author2= LEE S. J. | author3= KIM Y. J. | author4=LEE E. S. | journal=International journal of machine tools &amp; manufacture | year=2003 | volume=43 | issue=1 | publisher=Elsevier | location=Kidlington, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Haptic technology|haptic]] controllers and tactile displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1117/12.598713 | last = Liu | first = Y |last2=Davidson|first2= R|last3=Taylor|first3= P| title = Investigation of the touch sensitivity of ER fluid based tactile display | journal =  Proceedings of SPIE | volume = 5764 | issue = | pages = 92–99 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ER fluid has also been proposed to have potential applications in [[flexible electronics]], with the fluid incorporated in elements such as rollable screens and keypads, in which the viscosity-changing qualities of the fluid allowing the rollable elements to become rigid for use, and flexible to roll and retract for storing when not in use. Motorola filed a patent application for [[mobile device]] applications in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwiredview.com/2008/01/25/foldable-rollable-phone-from-motorola/|title=Foldable/ rollable phone from Motorola|work=unwiredview.com|date=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ER effect ==
The change in apparent viscosity is dependent on the applied [[electric field]], i.e. the potential divided by the distance between the plates. The change is not a simple change in [[viscosity]], hence these fluids are now known as ER fluids, rather than by the older term Electro Viscous fluids. The effect is better described as an electric field dependent shear [[yield stress]]. When activated an ER fluid behaves as a [[Bingham plastic]] (a type of [[viscoelastic]] material), with a yield point which is determined by the electric field strength. After the yield point is reached, the fluid shears as a [[fluid]], i.e. the incremental [[shear stress]] is proportional to the rate of shear (in a [[Newtonian fluid]] there is no yield point and stress is directly proportional to shear). Hence the resistance to motion of the fluid can be controlled by adjusting the applied electric field.

== Composition and theory ==
ER fluids are a type of [[smart fluid]]. A simple ER fluid can be made by mixing [[Corn starch|cornflour]] in a light vegetable oil or (better) [[silicone oil]].

There are two main theories to explain the effect: the interfacial tension or 'water bridge' theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stangroom | first = JE | title = Electrorheological Fluids | journal = Phys. Technol. | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 290–296 | year = 1983 | doi = 10.1088/0305-4624/14/6/305 |bibcode = 1983PhTec..14..290S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[electrostatic]] theory. The water bridge theory assumes a three phase system, the particles contain the third phase which is another liquid (e.g. water) immiscible with the main phase liquid (e.g. oil). With no applied electric field the third phase is strongly attracted to and held within the particles. This means the ER fluid is a suspension of particles, which behaves as a liquid. When an electric field is applied the third phase is driven to one side of the particles by electro [[osmosis]] and binds adjacent particles together to form chains. This chain structure means the ER fluid has become a solid. The electrostatic theory assumes just a two phase system, with [[dielectric]] particles forming chains aligned with an electric field in an analogous way to how [[magnetorheological fluid]] (MR) fluids work. An ER fluid has been constructed with the solid phase made from a conductor coated in an insulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tam | first = W Y |last2=Yi|first2= G H|last3=Wen|first3= W|last4=Ma|first4= H|last5=Sheng|first5= P| title = New Electrorheological Fluid: Theory and Experiment | journal =  Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 78 | issue = 15 | pages = 2987–2990 |date=April 1997| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.2987 | bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.2987T}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ER fluid clearly cannot work by the water bridge model. However, although demonstrating that some ER fluids work by the electrostatic effect, it does not prove that all ER fluids do so. The advantage of having an ER fluid which operates on the electrostatic effect is the elimination of leakage current, i.e. potentially there is no [[direct current]]. Of course, since ER devices behave electrically as [[capacitor]]s, and the main advantage of the ER effect is the speed of response, an [[alternating current]] is to be expected.

The particles are electrically active. They can be [[ferroelectric]] or, as mentioned above, made from a [[Electrical conductor|conducting material]] coated with an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], or electro-osmotically active particles. In the case of ferroelectric or conducting material, the particles would have a high [[dielectric constant]]. There may be some confusion here as to the dielectric constant of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], but "if a material with a high dielectric constant is placed in an electric field, the magnitude of that field will be measurably reduced within the volume of the dielectric" (see main page: [[Relative permittivity|Dielectric constant]]), and since the [[electric field]] is zero in an ideal conductor, then in this context the dielectric constant of a conductor is infinite.

Another factor that influences the ER effect is the geometry of the [[electrode]]s. The introduction of parallel grooved electrodes showed slight increase in the ER effect but perpendicular{{Clarify| parallel and perpendicular to what?|date=April 2010}} grooved electrodes doubled the ER effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Georgiades | first = G |last2=Oyadiji|first2= SO| title = Effects of electrode geometry on the performance of electrorheological fluid valves | journal = Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–111 | year = 2003| doi = 10.1177/1045389X03014002006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A much larger increase in ER effect can be obtained by coating the electrodes with electrically polarisable materials. This turns the usual disadvantage of [[dielectrophoresis]] into a useful effect. It also has the effect of reducing leakage currents in the ER fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Monkman G.J. ‑ Addition of Solid Structures to Electrorheological Fluids ‑ Journal of Rheology ‑ Vol 35, pp. 1385-7, October 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant electrorheological (GER) fluid was discovered in 2003,&lt;ref name= "GER" /&gt; and is able to sustain higher yield strengths than many other ER fluids. The GER fluid consists of [[Urea]] coated [[nanoparticle]]s of [[Barium]] [[Titanium]] [[Oxalate]] suspended in [[silicone oil]]. The high yield strength is due to the high [[dielectric constant]] of the particles, the small size of the particles and the [[Urea]] coating. Another advantage of the GER is that the relationship between the [[electrical field]] strength and the [[yield strength]] is linear after the electric field reaches 1 kV/mm. The GER is a high yield strength, but low electrical field strength and low [[current density]] fluid compared to many other ER fluids. The procedure for preparation of the suspension is given in.&lt;ref name= "GER"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wen | first = W |last2=Huang|first2= X|last3=Yang|first3= S|last4=Lu|first4= K|last5=Sheng|first5= P| title = The giant electrorheological effect in suspensions of nanoparticles | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = 727–730 |date=November 2003 | doi = 10.1038/nmat993 | pmid = 14528296 |bibcode = 2003NatMa...2..727W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The major concern is the use of [[oxalic acid]] for the preparation of the particles as it is a strong [[organic acid]].

== Problems and advantages ==
A major problem is that ER fluids are suspensions, hence in time they tend to settle out, so advanced ER fluids tackle this problem by means such as matching the densities of the solid and liquid components, or by using nanoparticles, which brings ER fluids into line with the development of [[magnetorheological fluid]]s. Another problem is that the breakdown voltage of air is ~ 3 kV/mm, which is near the electric field needed for ER devices to operate.

An advantage is that an ER device can control considerably more mechanical power than the electrical power used to control the effect, i.e. it can act as a power amplifier. But the main advantage is the speed of response, there are few other effects able to control such large amounts of mechanical or hydraulic power so rapidly.

Unfortunately, the increase in apparent viscosity experienced by most Electrorheological fluids used in shear or flow modes is relatively limited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">The '''European environmental research and innovation policy''' is a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a [[resource-efficient]] and [[climate]] resilient society and economy in sync with the [[natural environment]]. It is based on the [[Europe 2020]] strategy for a smart, [[sustainable]] and inclusive economy and it realises the [[European Research Area]] (ERA) and Innovation Union in the field of environment.
The aim of the European environmental research and innovation policy is to contribute to a transformative agenda for Europe in the coming years, where the quality of life of the citizens and the environment are steadily improved, in sync with the competitiveness of businesses, the societal inclusion and the management of resources.

==Main features==

The '''European environmental research and innovation policy''' has a multidisciplinary character and involve efforts across many different sectors to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire [[value chain]] of human activities. To reduce resource use and [[environmental impacts]] whilst increasing competitiveness requires a decisive societal and technological transition to an economy based on a sustainable relationship between nature and human well-being. The availability of sufficient [[raw materials]] is addressed as well as the creation of opportunities for growth and new jobs. Innovative options are developed in policies ranging across science, technology, economy, regulations, society and citizens’ behavior, and governance. Research and innovation activities improve the understanding and forecasting of climate and environmental change in a systemic and cross-sectoral perspective, reduce uncertainties, identify and assess vulnerabilities, risks, costs, mitigation measures and opportunities, as well as expand the range and improve the effectiveness of societal and policy responses and solutions.

==International context==

{{See also|Sustainable development|Sustainable Development Goals }}
The European environmental research and innovation policy was placed in the context of the process at the [[United Nations]] to develop a set of [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) that were agreed at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] on [[Sustainable development]] in 2012 and are now integrated into the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. These goals have succeeded the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and are universally applicable to all Nations, hence also to the [[European Union]] and its Member States.

==Implementation through Framework Programmes==

{{See also|Horizon 2020}}
The implementation of the European environmental research and innovation policy relies on a systemic approach to innovation for a system-wide transformation. For large extent, it is carried out through the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.

The current Framework Programme is called [[Horizon 2020]] and environmental research and innovation is envisaged across the entire programme with an interdisciplinary approach. Current price estimates suggest that more than 6,5 € billion per year could be made available for activities related to sustainable development during the duration of Horizon 2020, addressing both research and innovation differently from previous FPs.&lt;ref&gt;It is expected that at least 60% of the overall Horizon 2020 budget should be related to sustainable development, and that climate-related expenditure should exceed 35% of the budget [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm "Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme"], ''[[European Commission]]'', Brussels, 3 December 2013. Retrieved on 18 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon 2020 is open to cooperation with researchers and innovators world-wide in order to foster co-design and co-creation of solutions that may have a global impact.

New calls for research and innovation proposals have been opened on 14 October 2015. Information is contained in the Horizon 2020 participant portal.

A '''grid compass'''&lt;ref name="Grid00"&gt;[http://www.histo.cat/1/AC066_2-16.pdf CAA Advisory circular ]&lt;/ref&gt; known as well as '''grid steering [[compass]]''', is a navigating instrument. It is a design of magnetic compass that facilitates steering a steady course without the risk of [[parallax]] error.

The ''grid compass'' is the simplest steering compass from the pilot's or helmsman's point of view, because he doesn't need to watch the number (or the division mark) of the wanted course. He has only to steer the craft so that the N/S compass needle lies parallel between the lines of the overlay disc. The principle is similar to the compass-controlled autopilot.&lt;ref name="Grid02" /&gt; Although sophisticated electronics have taken over for commercial navigation, light aircraft, gliders and yachtsmen still use the grid compass because of its simplicity and ease of use.

==Description==
The compass card is in the form of a bold parallel sided arrow which indicates magnetic north. Some models have an east/west cross bar as well. Overalying this but in the same gimbal or suspension is a transparent plate which can be rotated around the same axis as the compass card but has sufficient friction (or a mechanical clamp) to stay fixed relative to the gimbal system once set to a course. Across this disk are engraved a series of parallel lines. The outer edge of this disk is marked in clockwise in degrees, the radial line meeting 0º being parallel to the engraved lines, so that a course can be laid for any bearing from 0º to 359º. By keeping the arrow on the card and the lines on the overlay parallel, the pilot or helmsman can keep the course set. The frequency of the degree markings depend upon the size of the compass.

To set a course the rotating ring is (unlocked and) turned so that the heading in degrees on the ring alines with the centre line of the craft. The craft comes on to the required course when the arrow on the compass card is parallel with the lines on the ring.&lt;ref name="Fair2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Fairhall|author2=Mike Peyton|title=Pass Your Yachtmaster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN0Jf0SXwhQC&amp;pg=PA10|date=17 May 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-4628-6|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grid steering compasses (Type P8 to Type P11) were fitted in [[World War II]] [[Spitfire]] [[aeroplane]]s, replacing the old P4 series of instruments. They were used for course setting and reading, and as a check compass on aircraft fitted with a remote indicating compass.&lt;ref name="Grid02"&gt;[http://www.histo.cat/1/Grid_compass_ref.JPG Grid compass description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heath Company began the HERO 1 project in October 1979. The first units were available in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronicdesign.com/analog/whatever-happened-heathkit Whatever Happened To Heathkit?], By Lou Frenzel, Electronic Design, Feb 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Models included the HERO 1, HERO Jr., and HERO 2000. Heathkit supported the HERO robot line up until 1995. All three were available as kits, or for more money, prebuilt by Heathkit. Since 2013 the 1980s models are considered collectors items, due to their apparent rarity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kLIIBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;ots=lUJUCsO2XQ&amp;dq=heathkit%20sales%20hero%20robots&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=heathkit%20sales%20hero%20robots&amp;f=false Classic Heathkit Electronic Test Equipment], By Jeff Tranter, 2013, Page 12.

Introduced in 1982, it featured a 6808 microprocessor with four kilobytes of memory and sensors for light, sound and motion. Programs could be stored on cassette tape and a speech synthesizer and robotic arm were available as options. It is now a sought after collector's item.'' {{ISBN|0992138205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most part, they cannot perform practical tasks, but are more geared toward [[entertainment robot|entertainment]] and education above all.

HERO 1 was a self-contained mobile robot controlled by an onboard [[computer]] with a [[Motorola]] 6808 [[CPU]] and 4 kB of [[RAM]]. The robot featured light, sound, and motion detectors as well as a [[sonar]] ranging sensor. An optional arm mechanism and speech synthesizer was available for the kit form and included in the assembled form.&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Robillard: HERO 1 - Advanced Programming and Interfacing, H.W.

To make this power available in a simple way, [[high-level programming language]]s were created. For example, the ANDROTEXT language was a HERO 1 editor and [[compiler]] developed in 1982 for the [[IBM PC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=ACM | year=1982 | title=ANDROTEXT for HERO 1 Editor and Compiler IBM PC | journal= Online Historical Encyclopaedia of Programming Languages, ACM History of Programming Language Conference (HOPL) | url= http://hopl.info/showlanguage2.prx?exp=8316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Solem | first=J.

A smaller version of HERO was released later, called HERO Jr. Heathkit intended it for the home market, and therefore made it less complex, and more self-contained. Like HERO 1, HERO Jr. had a 6808 processor, but only 2 kB of RAM. As well, it sported onboard [[speech synthesis]], a [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] sonar range sensor, a light sensor, and a sound sensor. An optional infrared sensor was available as well. Other optional components included a pair of extra batteries to double the operational time between charges, from an estimated 4 hours to 8 hours. A remote control accessory allowed users to drive the robot around. It included a motion sensor that caused the robot to croak "SOM-THING-MOVE" when it detected a source of [[Motion (physics)|motion]].

Heathkit released several add-ons to increase the robot's capabilities, including a transmitter to activate a home security system in the event it sensed movement while on "guard duty". Also, additional cartridges with programs and games were available, as well as a components to allow the user to directly program the robot.

The drive mechanism is backward compared to the HERO 1, with the drive and steering wheel in the back of the robot. The head section featured an indentation to allow the robot to transport up to {{convert|10|lb|kg}}. The robot could speak several phrases from various films that either involved robots or computers. It was also capable of remembering and repeating back its masters name, as well as singing songs, reciting poems, acting as an alarm clock, and making its own combinations of phonemes to create a robotic gibberish.

[[File:PryLeverBar.jpg|thumb|A "pry lever bar" used on docks, in warehouses and around railroad stations during the steam locomotive era]]

A '''hand truck''', also known as a '''two wheeler''', '''stack truck''', '''trundler''', '''box cart''', '''sack barrow''', '''cart''', '''dolly''', '''sack truck''',  or '''bag barrow''', is an L-shaped box-moving [[cart|handcart]] with handles at one end, [[wheel]]s at the base, with a small ledge to set objects on, flat against the floor when the hand-truck is upright.{{r|Bureau2013}} The objects to be moved are tilted forward, the ledge is inserted underneath them, and the objects allowed to tilt back and rest on the ledge. The truck and object are then tilted backward until the weight is balanced over the large wheels, making otherwise bulky and heavy objects easier to move. It is a [[lever#Classes of levers|first-class lever]].{{r|Company2004}}

==Overview==
Sack trucks were originally used in the 18th century to move large sacks of spices on docks by young boys, from the age of 11, who were unable to lift the large sacks by hand. By using this method they were able to work as well as grown men in moving items around.{{r|Lee2008}} Later, such trucks were amended for use in many different industries, such as brewing, where hops were moved in sacks.

Some hand trucks are equipped with [[stairclimber]] wheels, which, as the name implies, are designed to go up and down stairs. Stairclimber wheels can sometimes be problematic when trying to turn on flat ground as four wheels in a fixed position will be in contact with the ground.

Hand trucks are fabricated from many different types of materials, including steel tube, aluminum tube, aluminum extrusion and high impact plastics. Most commercial hand trucks used for beverage and food service deliveries are rugged and very light. They are usually constructed from two extruded aluminum channel side rails and cast aluminum or magnesium parts.

Some of the options that may be considered are the types of wheels, stair climber, handle type and size of wheels.

Other things to be considered should be the load shape compared with the backrest shape, ''e.g.'', cylindrical loads should sit on curved backrests, and the environmental conditions in which the hand truck will operate.  For example, on loose or uneven ground oversize wheels are a great advantage; solid or puncture-proof foam filled tires may be used where punctures could deflate pneumatic tires.

A rule of thumb is that the toe or nose of the truck should be at least one-third of the length of the load.

Hand trucks are sometimes used as [[baggage cart]]s by [[porter (carrier)|porters]] in [[train station]]s and [[skycap]]s at [[airport]]s.

A '''piano tilter''' is a type of hand truck for moving an [[upright piano]] without damaging it.{{r|Stauffer1989}} Unlike a traditional dolly which pivots around a smaller wheel or point, the piano tilter has large curved sections to gently tilt an upright piano until it is lying flat on its back.

'''Henry Milward &amp; Sons''' (now known as '''ENTACO''') is an English manufacturer of [[sewing needle]]s based in [[Redditch]].&lt;ref name = "Entaco"/&gt;

==History==
The earliest reference to the Milward family in connection with needle making is a [[James Milward]] who was a needle maker on Fish Hill in 1676.
Symon Milward created the company of Henry Milward &amp; Sons aka '''Milward's Needles''' (Milward's) in 1730 at the age of 40, in [[Redditch]], United Kingdom. It was however, his son Henry who takes credit for the foundation of the company as the company was registered in his name during the first year of his birth.[see Redditch Museum Family tree] 
From the first half of the 18th century, the name of Henry Milward and Sons became well known as the makers of good quality needles.

At one point they were the largest [[manufacturer]] of its type in the world, producing [[knitting needles]], [[surgical needle]]s, and [[fishing tackle]], from a number of [[factories]] both in the UK and globally, such as [[Murcia]], Spain.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Knitting &amp; surgical needles==
The manufacture of needles was originally a [[cottage industry]]. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the industry prospered and became [[mechanised]].  By the late 1800s the company was the largest manufacturer in the whole district.

Redditch became the hub of the needle industry in the UK, with [[trade directory|trade directories]] showing that in the Redditch area in 1868/9 there were 117 firms listed as manufacturers in various aspects of needle and fish tackle trades. Small needle businesses [[Amalgamation (business)|amalgamated]], often through inter-marriage between the leading needle makers of Redditch. Henry Milward and sons amalgamated with John James, [[W. Avery &amp; Son]], Wm. Bartlett, and thus the "Milward empire" grew.

William Hall of Studley amalgamated with Thos. Harper, Samuel Thomas, H. Wilkes and William Vale among others and formed a group of needle makers known as '''Amalgamated Needles &amp; Fish Hooks'''. This resulted in Milwards and the aforementioned group being the 2 largest needle makers in the district. 

In 1912 John James and Sons merged into Henry Milward and sons and a new board was announced.  Members of the board consisted of C.B James as chairman and C.F Milward as deputy chairman, H.T Milward, A.D Barfleet and C.E James.

In 1930 two of the great needlemaker giants Milward's of Redditch and Hall's of Studley joined forces under a single holding company, Amalgamated Needles and Fish Hooks Limited, who formed in 1932 a separate manufacturing organisation called The English Needle and Fishing Tackle Co. Ltd (ENTACO).

However Milward's needles continued in Redditch until the 1950s, there were [[satellite]] factories setup during [[World War II]] in [[Evesham]], [[Bewdley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[Moreton-in-Marsh]]. The basic needle plant was dispersed between Studley and Redditch during the war and in 1952 Arrow Works was officially opened and were still producing some brands of Milward's needles as were first made and marketed under the name of Henry Milward &amp; Sons.

The years of greatest growth both in factory growth and world sales were at the end of the 19th century when the [[fortunes]] of the company were in the hands of Charles Frederick and Henry Tomson.

==Fishing tackle==
[[Colonel]] Henry Milward was a fervent [[Angling|fly angler]] who decided to mix business with pleasure when he created '''Milward’s Fishing Tackle Company''' as part of his [[centuries]]-old needle-factory. A dozen [[workers]] left needle- and [[syringe]]-making to become experts in hooks, flies, devons, spoons and [[split-cane rod]]s. This remarkable adventure lasted until 1965, when Milward died. 

Milward, alongside Allcock, Partridge, Wilkins, Lee, Martinez &amp; Bird and J.W. Young was just one of many [[fishing tackle]] manufacturers located in Redditch, just south of Birmingham

==Milward Family Directors==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Colonel C.F. Milward Esq==
[[Colonel]] C.F. Milward, [[Deputy Lieutenant]], was born in the United States and returned to England at the age of 5 and in due course he entered the family business, he was responsible for the companies amalgamations prior to 1930, he became the major [[chairman of the board]] of the [[holding company]] A.N. &amp; F.H. Limited. His father was a [[justice of the peace]].

He was elected to the Mastership of the [[Livery Company]], The Worshipful Company of Needle Makers, and was [[High Sheriff]] of [[Worcestershire]]. He was known as the Colonel.

==H.T Milward, J.P Esq==
H.T Milward, [[justice of the peace]], was known as Mr Harry, and was the Colonel's cousin. Harry's father was Colonel [[Victor Milward]], a [[Member of Parliament]]. Harry's main interest in the family business was sales and included [[Russia]] in his sales trips.

In 1930, the [[board of directors]] were: Charles F Milward ([[Chairman]] of the company), Henry T Milward J.P, G.H. Corbet-Milward, C. Ernest James, Gerald Bartleet, Arthur D. Bartleet, and L. Sidney Milward.

When these 2 great figures died, others took over the running of the company, now renamed '''Needle Industries Limited''', but still the name Milward was the major trading company.

The next Joint [[Managing Director]]s were Basil King [[OBE]] and Alderman L. Haines of [[William Hall and Company]], whilst [[Colonel]] G.V. Milward [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] of [[Worcestershire]], was a director of the company. Colonel Milward became the [[Managing Director]] of Milwards Fishing Tackle. He was also responsible for [[Surgical needle]]s and braided [[Surgical suture|suture]] manufacture after he returned to the company after he saw [[active service]] between 1939-1945.

During the term of G.B King's Managing Directorship that Arrow Works in Studley was built, thus creating the business as we knew it to this present day. During this phase, the last of the [[Milward family]] was in the business: [[Ian Newton]], grandson of Mr Harry briefly was [[Sales management|Sales Manager]] (Needles) until 1968.

Since 1952 the fortunes of the Milward business were in the hands of L.H.Beare and in the 1980s J.A Mackrael was the managing director. The trend of taking over companies continued, taking over Abel Morrall's [[Aero Needles]] (1989). Although Milwards owned many companies, each retained their own trade mark and name!

==Purchase and subsequent sale by Coats==
In 1973 the entire [[share capital]] was purchased by Coats Patons Ltd, now known as [[Coats PLC]]. [[Needle Industries]] continued until the 1990s when Coats sold it to its management. Coats retained the Milwards brand name for its own use.

Following the [[management buyout]] of Needle Industries, led by Victor Barley, a new company was registered in 1991 called ENTACO,&lt;ref name ="Entaco"&gt;http://www.entacolimited.com/History.html&lt;/ref&gt; (an acronym of English Needle &amp; Tackle Company) in the old Victoria Works, adjacent to  Needle Industries. Mr Barley was Managing Director of Entaco from 1991-1997. 

Entaco were involved in a cartel with Prym and Coats at the later end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/38338/38338_332_1.pdf |title=Commission Decision |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date=26 October 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Milward and Sons and its employees boast over a quarter of a millennium making needles.

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of Lily perfume]]

The word ''[[perfume]]''  is used today to describe scented mixtures and is derived from the Latin word, "''per fumus''," meaning ''through smoke''. The word [[Perfumery]] refers to the art of making perfumes. Perfume was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Persian people|Persian]]s and the [[Arab]]s. Although perfume and perfumery also existed in East Asia, much of its fragrances were [[incense]] based. The basic ingredients and methods of making perfumes are described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]].

== Mesopotamia ==

The world's first recorded chemist is a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker whose existence was recorded on a 1200 BCE [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablet]] in Babylonian [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strathern, Paul |title=Mendeleyev's Dream&amp;nbsp;— The Quest For the Elements|location=New York | publisher=Berkley Books|year=2000|isbn=0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held a powerful role in the Mesopotamian government and religion, as the overseer of the Mesopotamian Royal Palace. She developed methods for scent extraction techniques that would lay the basis for perfume making. She recorded her techniques and methods and those were passed on, with her most groundbreaking technique in using solvents.&lt;ref&gt; Gabriele Kass-Simon, Patricia Farnes, Deborah Nash, eds. (1999). Women of science : righting the record (First Midland Book ed.). Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana Univ. Press. p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==

Perfume and perfumery also existed in [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus civilization]], which existed from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. One of the earliest distillation of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1=A.K. Sharma|author2= Seema Wahad|author3= Raśmī Śrīvāstava|page=140|publisher=I. K. International Pvt Ltd|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perfume references are part of a larger text called Brihat-Samhita written by [[Varāhamihira]], an Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer living in the city of Ujjain. He was one of the ‘nine jewels’ in the court of the Maharaja of Malwa. The perfume portion mainly deals with the manufacture of perfumes to benefit ‘royal personages and inmates of harems’. The text is written as Sanskrit slokas with commentary by a 10th century Indian commentator Utpala.&lt;ref&gt;https://purplepaperplanes.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/perfume-from-ancient-indian-texts-brihat-samhita/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1975 report, archeologist Dr Paolo Rovesti found a terracotta distillation apparatus in the Indus valley together with oil containers made of the same material, carbon dated to 3000 BCE. The report also states that terracotta vessels with plugged orifices of woven materials were used so that when fragrant plant materials were covered with boiling water the vapours impregnated the material, which was subsequently wrung out to isolate the oil.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Bible describes a sacred perfume (Exodus 30:22-33) consisting of liquid myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, fragrant cane, and cassia.  Its use was forbidden, except by the priests.
The women wore perfume to present their beauty.

== Islamic ==
{{see also|Alchemy and chemistry in Islam}}

[[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic cultures]] contributed significantly to the development of Western perfumery in two significant areas: perfecting the extraction of fragrances through steam distillation and introducing new raw materials. Both have greatly influenced Western perfumery and [[Science|scientific]] developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

With a rise of Islam, Muslims improved perfume production and continued to use perfumes in daily life and in practicing religion. They used musk, roses and amber, among other materials. As traders, Islamic cultures such as the Arabs and Persians had wider access to a wide array of spices, resins, herbs, precious woods, herbs and animal fragrance materials such as ambergris and musk. In addition to trading, many of the flowers and herbs used in perfumery were cultivated by the Muslims&amp;nbsp;— rose and jasmine were native to the region, and many other plants (i.e.: bitter orange and other citrus trees, all of which imported from China and southeast Asia) could be successfully cultivated in the Middle East, and are to this day key ingredients in perfumery.

In [[Islamic]] culture, perfume usage has been documented as far back as the 6th century and its usage is considered a religious duty. Muhammad said:

{{cquote|''The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male [[Muslim]] who has attained the age of puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with [[Miswaak]] (type of twig used as a toothbrush), and the using of perfume if it is available.'' (Recorded in [[Sahih Bukhari]]).}}

They often used to blend extracts with the cement of which mosques were built.&lt;ref name="The History of Perfume"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Perfume|url=http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html|website=everythinkaboutperfume.com|accessdate=3 February 2015|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208043220/http://www.everythinkaboutperfume.com/history.html|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rituals gave incentives to scholars to search and develop a cheaper way to produce incenses and in mass production.

Many great discoveries originates from the region in 10th century, the time when the still was invented, and as a consequence of which the distill techniques considerably improved. Thanks to the hard work of two talented [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabian chemists]]: [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber, born 722, Iraq), and [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus, born 801, Iraq) who established the perfume industry. Jabir developed many techniques, including distillation, evaporation and filtration, which enabled the collection of the odour of plants into a vapour that could be collected in the form of water or oil.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Martin (1973), "Early Arabic Pharmacology," ''E.J. Brill: Leiden'', {{ISBN|90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kindi, however, was the real founder of perfume industry as he carried out extensive research and experiments in combining various plants and other sources to produce a variety of scent products. He elaborated a vast number of ‘recipes’ for a wide range of perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. His work in the laboratory is reported by a witness who said:

{{cquote|''I received the following description, or recipe, from Abu Yusuf Ya'qub b. Ishaq al-Kindi, and I saw him making it and giving it an addition in my presence''.}}

The writer goes on in the same section to speak of the preparation of a perfume called ''ghaliya'', which contained musk, amber and other ingredients; too long to quote here, but which reveals a long list of technical names of drugs and apparatus. Al-Kindi also wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which he named ‘''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations''’. It contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described one hundred and seven methods and recipes for perfume-making, and even the perfume making equipment, like the alembic, still bears its Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hassani, Woodcok and Saoud (2006) 1001 Inventions; Muslim Heritage in Our World, FSTC, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian [[Islamic medicine|Muslim doctor]] and chemist [[Avicenna]] (also known as Ibn Sina) introduced the process of extracting oils from [[flowers]] by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes were mixtures of oil and crushed herbs, or petals which made a strong blend. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both of the raw ingredients and distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and [[Science|scientific]] developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

Eventually perfume arrived to European courts through [[Al-Andalus]] in the west, and on the other side, with the crusaders in the east. For instance, eggs and floral perfumes were brought to Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries from Arabia, by returning [[crusaders]], through trade with the Islamic world. Those who traded for these were most often also involved in trade for spices and dyestuffs. There are records of the Pepperers Guild of London, going back to 1179; which show them trading with Muslims in spices, perfume ingredients and dyes.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;Dunlop, D.M. (1975), "Arab Civilization," ''Librairie du Liban''&lt;/ref&gt; Catharina de [[Medici]] initiated the perfume industry in Europe when she left Italy in the 16th century to marry the French crown prince.&lt;ref name="The History of Perfume"/&gt;

== Western ==

Knowledge of something perfumery came to [[Europe]] as early as the 14th century due partially to [[Arabic]] influences and knowledge. But it was the [[Hungarians]] who ultimately introduced the first modern perfume. The first modern perfume, made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution, was made in 1370 at the command of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]] and was known throughout [[Europe]] as [[Hungary Water]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], and in the 16th century, Italian refinements were taken to France by [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s personal perfumer, [[Rene le Florentin]]. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulas could be stolen en route.

===France===
[[France]] quickly became the European center of perfume and cosmetic manufacture.  Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France mainly in [[Grasse]] now considered the world capital of perfume. During the [[Renaissance]] period, perfumes were used primarily by royalty and the wealthy to mask body odors resulting from the sanitary practices of the day. Partly due to this patronage, the western perfumery industry was created.
Perfume enjoyed huge success during the 17th century. [[Perfumed glove]]s became popular in France and in 1656, the guild of glove and perfume-makers was established. Perfumers were also known to create poisons; for instance, a French duchess was murdered when a perfume/poison was rubbed into her gloves and was slowly absorbed into her skin.

Perfume came into its own when [[Louis XV]] came to the throne in the 18th century. His court was called "la cour parfumée" (the perfumed court). [[Madame de Pompadour]] ordered generous supplies of perfume, and King Louis demanded a different fragrance for his apartment every day. The court of Louis XIV was even named due to the scents which were applied daily not only to the skin but also to clothing, fans and furniture. Perfume substituted for soap and water. The use of perfume in France grew steadily. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were being grown in the [[Grasse]] region of France to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, France remains the centre of the European perfume design and [[trade]].

After [[Napoleon]] came to power, exorbitant expenditures for perfume continued. Two quarts of violet cologne were delivered to him each week, and he is said to have used sixty bottles of double extract of [[jasmine]] every month. Josephine had stronger perfume preferences. She was partial to musk, and she used so much that sixty years after her death the scent still lingered in her boudoir.

=== England ===

Perfume use peaked in England during the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (reigned 1509-1547) and Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603). All public places were scented{{by whom|date=July 2015}} during Queen Elizabeth's rule, since she could not tolerate bad smells.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It was said that the sharpness of her nose was equaled only by the slyness of her tongue. Ladies of the day took great pride in creating delightful fragrances and they displayed their skill in mixing scents.

As with industry and the arts, perfume underwent profound change in the 19th century. Changing tastes and the development of modern chemistry laid the foundations of modern perfumery as alchemy gave way to chemistry.

=== Russia ===

Perfume manufacture in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] grew after 1861 and became globally significant by the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;

'''IEC 61131''' is an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard for [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]]. It was known as IEC 1131 before the change in numbering system by IEC. The parts of the IEC 61131 standard are prepared and maintained working group 7, programmable control systems, of subcommittee SC 65B of [[List of IEC technical committees|Technical Committee]] TC65 of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

==Sections of IEC 61131==
Standard ''IEC 61131'' is divided into several parts:&lt;ref&gt;[https://webstore.iec.ch/searchform&amp;q=61131 All parts available for "IEC 61131"], IEC Webstore&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 1: General information. It is the introductory chapter; it contains definitions of terms that are used in the subsequent parts of the standard and outlines the main functional properties and characteristics of PLCs.
* Part 2: Equipment requirements and tests - establishes the requirements and associated tests for programmable controllers and their peripherals.  This standard prescribes: the normal service conditions and requirements (for example, requirements related with climatic conditions, transport and storage, electrical service, etc.); functional requirements (power supply &amp; memory, digital and analog [[I/O]]s); functional type tests and verification (requirements and tests on environmental, vibration, drop, free fall, I/O, power ports, etc.) and [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) requirements and tests that programmable controllers must implement.  This standard can serve as a basis in the evaluation of safety programmable controllers to [[IEC 61508]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">[[Image:Ice blasting.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Preemptive ice blasting on the [[Rideau River]] in [[Ottawa]]]]
'''Ice blasting''' is the use of [[explosives]] to break up [[ice]] in rivers, greatly aiding navigation systems. 
This is done during the spring when snow is melting and river ice is breaking up.  There is always a chance that the ice flows could collide creating an [[ice jam]] and blocking the river.  The river, filled with melt water, will quickly [[flood]] and often cause damage to nearby settlements.  Thus in most northern areas governments quickly act to break up the ice jams before they can do much damage.  This is most easily done with explosives. These explosives may be planted from the shore, or in some cases by helicopter. Explosives can also be remotely delivered by artillery or dropped by bombers.  In the large rivers of the [[Siberia]] the Russian airforce is sometimes called in to bomb ice jams.

Some districts, where flooding is especially common, do preemptive ice blasting. The city of [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, for instance, blasts the [[Rideau River]] each spring to break up the ice. In 1994, for instance, 10,000 sticks of dynamite were used to break up ice along 9 kilometres of the river.&lt;ref&gt;
Grant Hopkins "Ice-blasting on Rideau will have to be limited to avoid heavy fish toll, study says." ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' Jun 12, 1994. pg. D.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ice blasting has a number of disadvantages.  It is expensive and dangerous requiring highly skilled explosives experts.  When blasting is occurring the public must be warned to keep their distance.  The blasting has negative environmental consequences. Fish and other river creatures are inevitably killed and the river bottom is scarred.  [[Unexploded ordnance]] can also be a concern where remote delivery is used.

The project is a study of a proposed interstellar precursor mission that would probe the nearby interstellar medium and measure the properties of magnetic fields and [[cosmic ray]]s and their effects on a spacecraft leaving the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=David /&gt; Mission launch plans analyzed direct, one planet, multi-planet, and upper-stage trades.&lt;ref name=NASA2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interstellarexplorer.jhuapl.edu/mission/mission_design_req.html |title=Innovative Interstellar Probe: Mission Design Requirements|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a concept study, a number of technologies, configurations, and mission goals were considered, leading to the choice of a spacecraft propelled with [[ion engine]]s powered by a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG).&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/MAD/ACT-PRE-MAD-InnSys-McNutt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus was getting a spacecraft launched by about 2014, achieving 200 AU by the year 2031.&lt;ref&gt;[http://authors.library.caltech.edu/6296/1/MCNaipcp06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of strategies were assessed, including using launch windows (not counting backups) for a Jupiter assist in 2014, 2026, 2038, and 2050{{mdash}}about every 12 years.&lt;ref name=NASA2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1344">The '''Instructograph''' was a [[paper tape]]-based machine used for the study of [[Morse code]].

The paper tape mechanism consisted of two reels which passed a paper tape across a reading device that actuated a set of contacts which changed state dependent on the presence or absence of hole punches in the tape. The contacts could operate an audio oscillator for the study of [[International Morse Code]] (used by radio), or a sounder for the study of [[American Morse Code]] (used by railroads), or a light bulb ([[Aldis Lamp]] - used by Navy ship to ship or by [[Heliograph]]).

The Instructograph was in production from about 1920 through 1983. The first US patent, No. 1,725,145, was granted to Otto Bernard Kirkpatrick, of Chicago, IL, on August 20, 1929.  Most of them would be wound by hand or be plugged into a wall outlet. Most plugin outlet based instructographs would have a set of knobs that can control the speed and volume. The latest version of the Instructograph was the model 500 which included a built in solid state oscillator.  This model was available to be purchased as new through at least 1986.

'''JC3IEDM''', or '''Joint Consultation, Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model''' is a model that, when implemented, aims to enable the interoperability of systems and projects required to share [[Command and control|Command and Control (C2)]] information. JC3IEDM is an evolution of the [[C2IEDM]] standard that includes joint operational concepts, just as the Land Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model ([[LC2IEDM]]) was extended to become C2IEDM.  The program is managed by the [[Multilateral Interoperability Programme]] (MIP).

== The Joint C3 Information Exchange Data Model ==

JC3IEDM is produced by the MIP-NATO Management Board (MNMB) and ratified under [[NATO]] STANAG 5525.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'True' JC3IEDM ratified as NATO STANAG 5255 | author = MIP | url = http://www.mip-site.org/010_Public_Home_News.htm| publisher = MIP | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; JC3IEDM a fully documented standard for an information exchange data model for the sharing of C2 information.

The overall aim of JC3IEDM is to enable "international interoperability of C2 information systems at all levels from corps to battalion (or lowest appropriate level) in order to support multinational (including NATO), combined and joint operations and the advancement of digitisation in the international arena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'True' MULTILATERAL INTEROPERABILITY PROGRAMME NATO DATA ADMINISTRATION GROUP MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT | author = MIP | url = http://www.mip-site.org/publicsite/06-Other_Documents/MIP-NDAG_MOA/MIP-NDAG-MOA%204%20Feb%2004.pdf| publisher = MIP | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to JC3IEDM's documentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='True' JC3IEDM-Main-GBR-DMWG-Edition_3.1b_2007-12-13 |author=MIP |url=http://www.mip-site.org/publicsite/04-Baseline_3.0/JC3IEDM-Joint_C3_Information_Exchange_Data_Model/JC3IEDM-Main-GBR-DMWG-Edition_3.1b_2007-12-13.pdf |publisher=MIP |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621124523/http://www.mip-site.org/publicsite/04-Baseline_3.0/JC3IEDM-Joint_C3_Information_Exchange_Data_Model/JC3IEDM-Main-GBR-DMWG-Edition_3.1b_2007-12-13.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this aim is attempted to be achieved by "specifying the minimum set of data that needs to be
exchanged in coalition or multinational operations. Each nation, agency or community of
interest is free to expand its own data dictionary to accommodate its additional
information exchange requirements with the understanding that the added specifications
will be valid only for the participating nation, agency or community of interest. Any
addition that is deemed to be of general interest may be submitted as a change proposal
within the configuration control process to be considered for inclusion in the next version
of the specification."

"JC3IEDM is intended to represent the core of the data identified for exchange across multiple functional areas and multiple views of the requirements. Toward that end, it lays down a common approach to describing the information to be exchanged in a command and control (C2) environment.
# The structure should be sufficiently generic to accommodate joint, land, sea, and air environmental concerns.
# The data model describes all objects of interest in the sphere of operations, e.g., organizations, persons, equipment, facilities, geographic features, weather phenomena, and military control measures such as boundaries.
# Objects of interest may be generic in terms of a class or a type and specific in terms of an individually identified item. All object items must be classified as being of some type (e.g. a specific tank that is identified by serial number WS62105B is an item of type "Challenger" that is a heavy UK main battle tank).
# An object must have the capability to perform a function or to achieve an end. Thus, a description of capability is needed to give meaning to the value of objects in the sphere of operations.
# It should be possible to assign a location to any item in the sphere of operations. In addition, various geometric shapes need to be represented in order to allow commanders to plan, direct, and monitor operations. Examples include boundaries, corridors, restricted areas, minefields, and any other control measures needed by commanders and their staffs.
# Several aspects of status of items need to be maintained.
# The model must permit a description of the composition of a type object in terms of other type objects. Such concepts include tables of organizations, equipment, or personnel.
# The model must reflect information about what is held, owned or possessed in terms of types by a specific object item.
# There is a need to record relationships between pairs of items. Key among these is the specification of unit task organizations and orders of battle.
# The model must support the specification of current, past, and future role of objects as part of plans, orders, and events.
# The same data structure should be used to record information for all objects, regardless of their hostility status.
# Provision must be made for the identification of sources of information, the effective and reporting times, and an indication of the validity of the data."

==JC3IEDM development history and current maturity==

JC3IEDM has been developed from the initial Generic Hub (GH) Data Model, which changed its name to Land C2 Information Exchange Data Model (LC2IEDM) in 1999. Development of the model continued in a Joint context and in November 2003 the C2 Information Exchange Data Model (C2IEDM) Edition 6.1 was released. Additional development to this model, incorporating the NATO Corporate Reference model, resulted in the model changing its name again to JC3IEDM with JC3IEDM Ed 0.5 being issued in December 2004.

Subsequent releases have seen areas of the model developed in greater depth than others and there is variation in the number of sub-types and attributes for each type in the current version. An example is HARBOUR within the FACILITY type which has 43 attributes compared to a VESSEL-TYPE with 12 attributes or a WEAPON-TYPE with 4 attributes. The associated attributes of a certain type also lack support for exploiting with those of other types. For example, VESSEL-TYPE does not support the length or width of a vessel in its attributes but HARBOUR has both maximum vessel length and width attributes.

==National policies related to JC3IEDM==

The UK Ministry of Defence has mandated JC3IEDM as the C2 Information Exchange Model, in Joint Service Publication (JSP) 602:1007, for use on all systems and/or projects exchanging C2 information within and interoperating with the Land Environment at a Strategic and Operational Level. It is strongly recommended for other environments and mandated for all environments at the Tactical level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'True' JSP 602 1007 Database Services | author = MOD | url = http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ACEDA71B-ABEF-469F-B027-BADCE0CB7841/0/200702271007Database_Servicesv1_1U.pdf | publisher = MOD | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; JSP 602:1005 for Collaborative Services has also mandated JC3IEDM in the tactical domain for all systems/projects providing data sharing collaborative services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'True' JSP 602 1005 Collaborative Services | author = MOD | url = http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ACEDA71B-ABEF-469F-B027-BADCE0CB7841/0/200702271007Database_Servicesv1_1U.pdf | publisher = MOD | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''limit price''' (or '''limit pricing''') is a price, or [[pricing strategies|pricing strategy]], where products are sold by a supplier at a price low enough to make it unprofitable for other players to enter the market.

It is used by [[monopoly|monopolists]] to discourage entry into a [[Market (economics)|market]], and is illegal in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Milgrom]] and [[Donald John Roberts|John Roberts]], 1982.  "Limit Pricing and Entry under Incomplete Information: An Equilibrium Analysis," ''Econometrica'', 50(2).  pp. [http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/archive/refs4245.pdf 443-459.]&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity produced by the incumbent firm to act as a deterrent to entry is usually larger than would be optimal for a monopolist, but might still produce higher [[economic profits]] than would be earned under [[perfect competition]].

The problem with limit pricing as strategic behavior is that once the entrant has entered the market, the quantity used as a threat to deter entry is no longer the incumbent firm's [[best response]]. This means that for limit pricing to be an effective deterrent to entry, the threat must in some way be made credible. A way to achieve this is for the incumbent firm to constrain itself to produce a certain quantity whether entry occurs or not.  An example of this would be if the firm signed a union contract to employ a certain (high) level of labor for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Carlton"&gt;Dennis W. Carlton and Jeffery M. Perloff, 2004. ''Modern Industrial Organization'', 4th edition,  [http://www.lavoisier.fr/notice/frSWORK23A3RW32O.html Description.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is to build excess production capacity as a commitment device.

It is important to note that due to the often ambiguous nature of cost in production, it may be relatively easy for a firm to avoid legal difficulties when undertaking such action. Due to this ambiguous nature, limit pricing may well be a commonly used strategy even in modern economies. However, it is often very hard to regulate, since limit pricing is often synonymous with a market monopoly. When a monopoly exists, it becomes very difficult to compare alternative prices with other, similar firms to confirm claims that limit pricing may be occurring.

==Simple example==
In a simple case, suppose industry [[demand]] for good X at market price P is given by:

 &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Q^D} = a - bP&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose there are two potential producers of good X, Firm A, and Firm B. Firm A has no [[fixed costs]] and constant [[marginal cost]] equal to &lt;math&gt; c &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Firm B also has no fixed costs, and has constant marginal cost equal to &lt;math&gt;gc&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (so that Firm B's marginal cost is greater than Firm A's).

Suppose Firm A acts as a monopolist. The profit-maximizing monopoly price charged by Firm A is then:

 &lt;math&gt;p^M = \frac{a + cb}{2b}&lt;/math&gt;

Since Firm B will never sell below its marginal cost, as long as &lt;math&gt;p^M \le gc&lt;/math&gt;, Firm B will not enter the market when Firm A charges &lt;math&gt;p^M&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the market for good X is an effective monopoly if:

 &lt;math&gt;g \ge \frac{a + cb}{2cb}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose, on the contrary, that:

 &lt;math&gt;g &lt; \frac{a + cb}{2cb}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, if Firm A charges &lt;math&gt;p^M&lt;/math&gt;, Firm B has an incentive to enter the market, since it can sell a positive quantity of good X at a price above its marginal cost, and therefore make positive profits. In order to prevent Firm B from having an incentive to enter the market, Firm A must set its price no greater than &lt;math&gt;gc&lt;/math&gt;. To maximize its profits subject to this constraint, Firm A sets price &lt;math&gt;p^L = gc&lt;/math&gt; (the limit price).

The '''lumped element model''' (also called '''lumped parameter model''', or '''lumped component model''') simplifies the description of the behaviour of spatially distributed physical systems into a [[topology]] consisting of discrete entities that approximate the behaviour of the distributed system under certain assumptions. It is useful in [[electrical network|electrical systems]] (including [[electronics]]), mechanical [[multibody system]]s, [[heat transfer]], [[acoustics]], etc.

Mathematically speaking, the simplification reduces the [[State space (controls)|state space]] of the system to a [[counting number|finite]] [[dimension]], and the [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) of the continuous (infinite-dimensional) time and space model of the physical system into [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs) with a finite number of parameters.

== Electrical systems==
&lt;!-- started as a copy from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumped_matter_discipline&amp;oldid=544612541 --&gt;

=== Lumped matter discipline===
The '''lumped matter discipline''' is a set of imposed assumptions in [[electrical engineering]] that provides the foundation for '''lumped circuit abstraction''' used in [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Anant Agarwal and Jeffrey Lang, course materials for 6.002 Circuits and Electronics, Spring 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare ([http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/video-lectures/6002_l1.pdf PDF]), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt; The self-imposed constraints are:

1. The change of the magnetic flux in time outside a conductor is zero.
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \phi_B} {\partial t} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

2. The change of the charge in time inside conducting elements is zero.
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial q} {\partial t} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

3. Signal timescales of interest are much larger than propagation delay of [[electromagnetic waves]] across the lumped element.

The first two assumptions result in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] when applied to [[Maxwell's equations]] and are only applicable when the circuit is in [[steady state (electronics)|steady state]].  The third assumption is the basis of the lumped element model used in [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]].  Less severe assumptions result in the [[distributed element model]], while still not requiring the direct application of the full Maxwell equations.

=== Lumped element model ===
The lumped element model of electronic [[Electrical network|circuit]]s makes the simplifying assumption that the attributes of the circuit, [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[capacitance]], [[inductance]], and [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], are concentrated into idealized [[electrical component]]s; [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s, etc. joined by a network of perfectly [[Electrical conduction|conducting]] wires.

The lumped element model is valid whenever &lt;math&gt;L_c \ll \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_c&lt;/math&gt; denotes the circuit's characteristic length, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; denotes the circuit's operating [[wavelength]].
Otherwise, when the circuit length is on the order of a wavelength, we must consider more general models, such as the [[distributed element model]] (including [[transmission line]]s), whose dynamic behaviour is described by [[Maxwell's equations]].  Another way of viewing the validity of the lumped element model is to note that this model ignores the finite time it takes signals to propagate around a circuit.  Whenever this propagation time is not significant to the application the lumped element model can be used.  This is the case when the propagation time is much less than the [[period (physics)|period]] of the signal involved.  However, with increasing propagation time there will be an increasing error between the assumed and actual phase of the signal which in turn results in an error in the assumed amplitude of the signal.  The exact point at which the lumped element model can no longer be used depends to a certain extent on how accurately the signal needs to be known in a given application.

Real-world components exhibit non-ideal characteristics which are, in reality, distributed elements but are often represented to a [[first-order approximation]] by lumped elements.  To account for leakage in [[capacitor]]s for example, we can model the non-ideal capacitor as having a large lumped [[resistor]] connected in parallel even though the leakage is, in reality distributed throughout the dielectric. Similarly a [[wire-wound resistor]] has significant [[inductance]] as well as [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] distributed along its length but we can model this as a lumped [[inductor]] in series with the ideal resistor.

== Thermal systems==
A '''lumped capacitance model''', also called '''lumped system analysis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Incropera |author2=DeWitt |author3=Bergman |author4=Lavine | title = Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer | edition = 6th | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-471-45728-2 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | pages = 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduces a [[thermal system]] to a number of discrete “lumps” and assumes that the [[temperature]] difference inside each lump is negligible.  This approximation is useful to simplify otherwise complex [[differential equation|differential]] heat equations.  It was developed as a mathematical analog of [[electrical capacitance]], although it also includes thermal analogs of [[electrical resistance]] as well.

The lumped capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction, which may be used whenever [[heat conduction]] within an object is much faster than heat transfer across the boundary of the object. The method of approximation then suitably reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system (spatial temperature variation within the object) to a more mathematically tractable form (that is, it is assumed that the temperature within the object is completely uniform in space, although this spatially uniform temperature value changes over time). The rising uniform temperature within the object or part of a system, can then be treated like a capacitative reservoir which absorbs heat until it reaches a steady thermal state in time (after which temperature does not change within it).

An early-discovered example of a lumped-capacitance system which exhibits mathematically simple behavior due to such physical simplifications, are systems which conform to ''Newton's law of cooling''. This law simply states that the temperature of a hot (or cold) object progresses toward the temperature of its environment in a simple exponential fashion. Objects follow this law strictly only if the rate of heat conduction within them is much larger than the heat flow into or out of them. In such cases it makes sense to talk of a single "object temperature" at any given time (since there is no spatial temperature variation within the object) and also the uniform temperatures within the object allow its total thermal energy excess or deficit to vary proportionally to its surface temperature, thus setting up the Newton's law of cooling requirement that the rate of temperature decrease is proportional to difference between the object and the environment. This in turn leads to simple exponential heating or cooling behavior (details below).

===Method===
To determine the number of lumps, the [[Biot number]] (Bi), a dimensionless parameter of the system, is used.  Bi is defined as the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the [[convective heat transfer]] resistance across the object's boundary with a uniform bath of different temperature. When the [[thermal resistance]] to heat transferred into the object is larger than the resistance to heat being [[diffused]] completely within the object, the Biot number is less than 1. In this case, particularly for Biot numbers which are even smaller, the approximation of ''spatially uniform temperature within the object'' can begin to be used, since it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.

If the Biot number is less than 0.1 for a solid object, then the entire material will be nearly the same temperature with the dominant temperature difference will be at the surface. It may be regarded as being "thermally thin". The Biot number must generally be less than 0.1 for usefully accurate approximation and heat transfer analysis. The mathematical solution to the lumped system approximation gives [[Newton's law of cooling]].

A Biot number greater than 0.1 (a "thermally thick" substance) indicates that one cannot make this assumption, and more complicated [[heat transfer]] equations for "transient heat conduction" will be required to describe the time-varying and non-spatially-uniform temperature field within the material body.

The single capacitance approach can be expanded to involve many resistive and capacitive elements, with Bi &lt; 0.1 for each lump.   As the Biot number is calculated based upon a [[characteristic length]] of the system, the system can often be broken into a sufficient number of sections, or lumps, so that the Biot number is acceptably small.

Some characteristic lengths of thermal systems are:
* Plate: thickness
* [[Fin]]: thickness/2
* Long [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]: diameter/4
* [[Sphere]]: diameter/6

For arbitrary shapes, it may be useful to consider the characteristic length to be volume / surface area.

==== Thermal purely resistive circuits ====

A useful concept used in heat transfer applications once the condition of steady state heat conduction has been reached, is the representation of thermal transfer by what is known as thermal circuits. A thermal circuit is the representation of the resistance to heat flow in each element of a circuit, as though it were an [[electrical resistor]]. The heat transferred is analogous to the [[electric current]] and the thermal resistance is analogous to the electrical resistor. The values of the thermal resistance for the different modes of heat transfer are then calculated as the denominators of the developed equations. The thermal resistances of the different modes of heat transfer are used in analyzing combined modes of heat transfer. The lack of "capacitative" elements in the following purely resistive example, means that no section of the circuit is absorbing energy or changing in distribution of temperature. This is equivalent to demanding that a state of steady state heat conduction (or transfer, as in radiation) has already been established.

The equations describing the three heat transfer modes and their thermal resistances in steady state conditions, as discussed previously, are summarized in the table below:

|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In cases where there is heat transfer through different media (for example, through a [[composite material]]), the equivalent resistance is the sum of the resistances of the components that make up the composite.  Likely, in cases where there are different heat transfer modes, the total resistance is the sum of the resistances of the different modes. Using the thermal circuit concept, the amount of heat transferred through any medium is the quotient of the temperature change and the total thermal resistance of the medium.

As an example, consider a composite wall of cross-sectional area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The composite is made of an &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; long cement plaster with a thermal coefficient &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; long paper faced fiber glass, with thermal coefficient &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;. The left surface of the wall is at &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and exposed to air with a convective coefficient of &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt;. The right surface of the wall is at &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; and exposed to air with convective coefficient &lt;math&gt;h_o&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Thermal Circuits2.jpg|thumb|center|500px| {{pufc|Thermal Circuits2.jpg}}]] --&gt;

Using the thermal resistance concept, heat flow through the composite is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}=\frac{T_i-T_o}{R_i+R_1+R_2+R_o}=\frac{T_i-T_1}{R_i}=\frac{T_i-T_2}{R_i+R_1}=\frac{T_i-T_3}{R_i+R_1+R_2}=\frac{T_1-T_2}{R_1}=\frac{T_3-T_o}{R_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;R_i=\frac{1}{h_iA}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_o=\frac{1}{h_oA}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_1=\frac{L_1}{k_1A}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_2=\frac{L_2}{k_2A}&lt;/math&gt;

====Newton's law of cooling====
{{Main|Newton's Law of Cooling}}

'''Newton's law of cooling''' is an empirical relationship attributed to English physicist [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642 - 1727). This law stated in non-mathematical form is the following:

{{Quotation|The rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.}}

Or, using symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;\text {Rate of cooling} \sim \!\, \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

An object at a different temperature from its surroundings will ultimately come to a common temperature with its surroundings. A relatively hot object cools as it warms its surroundings; a cool object is warmed by its surroundings. When considering how quickly (or slowly) something cools, we speak of its ''rate'' of cooling - how many degrees' change in temperature per unit of time.

The rate of cooling of an object depends on how much hotter the object is than its surroundings. The temperature change per minute of a hot apple pie will be more if the pie is put in a cold freezer than if it is placed on the kitchen table. When the pie cools in the freezer, the temperature difference between it and its surroundings is greater. On a cold day, a warm home will leak heat to the outside at a greater rate when there is a large difference between the inside and outside temperatures. Keeping the inside of a home at high temperature on a cold day is thus more costly than keeping it at a lower temperature. If the temperature difference is kept small, the rate of cooling will be correspondingly low.

As Newton's law of cooling states, the rate of cooling of an object - whether by [[thermal conduction|conduction]], [[Convective heat transfer|convection]], or [[thermal radiation|radiation]] - is approximately proportional to the temperature difference Δ''T''. Frozen food will warm up faster in a warm room than in a cold room. Note that the rate of cooling experienced on a cold day can be increased by the added convection effect of the [[wind]]. This is referred to as [[wind chill]]. For example, a wind chill of -20&amp;nbsp;°C means that heat is being lost at the same rate as if the temperature were -20&amp;nbsp;°C without wind.

====Applicable situations====
This law describes many situations in which an object has a large thermal capacity and large conductivity, and is suddenly immersed in a uniform bath which conducts heat relatively poorly. It is an example of a thermal circuit with one resistive and one capacitative element. For the law to be correct, the temperatures at all points inside the body must be approximately the same at each time point, including the temperature at its surface. Thus, the temperature difference between the body and surroundings does not depend on which part of the body is chosen, since all parts of the body have effectively the same temperature. In these situations, the material of the body does not act to "insulate" other parts of the body from heat flow, and all of the significant insulation (or "thermal resistance") controlling the rate of heat flow in the situation resides in the area of contact between the body and its surroundings. Across this boundary, the temperature-value jumps in a discontinuous fashion.

In such situations, heat can be transferred from the exterior to the interior of a body, across the insulating boundary, by convection, conduction, or diffusion, so long as the boundary serves as a relatively poor conductor with regard to the object's interior. The presence of a physical insulator is not required, so long as the process which serves to pass heat across the boundary is "slow" in comparison to the conductive transfer of heat inside the body (or inside the region of interest—the "lump" described above).

In such a situation, the object acts as the "capacitative" circuit element, and the resistance of the thermal contact at the boundary acts as the (single) thermal resistor. In electrical circuits, such a combination would charge or discharge toward the input voltage, according to a simple exponential law in time. In the thermal circuit, this configuration results in the same behavior in temperature: an exponential approach of the object temperature to the bath temperature.

====Mathematical statement====
Newton's law is mathematically stated by the simple first-order differential equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d Q}{d t} = - h \cdot A(T(t)- T_{\text{env}}) =  - h \cdot A \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''Q'' is thermal energy in [[joule]]s
:''h'' is the [[heat transfer coefficient]] between the surface and the fluid
:''A'' is the surface area of the heat being transferred
:''T'' is the temperature of the object's surface and interior (since these are the same in this approximation)
:''T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the environment
:Δ''T(t)'' = ''T(t)'' - ''T&lt;sub&gt;env&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the time-dependent thermal [[gradient]] between environment and object

Putting heat transfers into this form is sometimes not a very good approximation, depending on ratios of heat conductances in the system. If the differences are not large, an accurate formulation of heat transfers in the system may require analysis of heat flow based on the (transient) heat transfer equation in nonhomogeneous or poorly conductive media.

==== Solution in terms of object heat capacity ====

If the entire body is treated as lumped capacitance heat reservoir, with total heat content which is proportional to simple total [[heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the temperature of the body, or &lt;math&gt;Q = C T&lt;/math&gt;.  It is expected that the system will experience [[exponential decay]] with time in the temperature of a body.

From the definition of heat capacity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; comes the relation &lt;math&gt;C = dQ/dT&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating this equation with regard to time gives the identity (valid so long as temperatures in the object are uniform at any given time):  &lt;math&gt;dQ/dt  = C (dT/dt)&lt;/math&gt;. This expression may be used to replace &lt;math&gt;dQ/dt&lt;/math&gt; in the first equation which begins this section, above. Then, if &lt;math&gt;T(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of such a body at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T_{env}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the environment around the body:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d T(t)}{d t} = - r (T(t) - T_{\mathrm{env}}) = - r \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;r = hA/C&lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant characteristic of the system, which must be in units of &lt;math&gt;s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and is therefore sometimes expressed in terms of a characteristic [[time constant]] &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; given by: &lt;math&gt;r = 1/t_0 = \Delta T/(dT(t)/dt)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in thermal systems, &lt;math&gt;t_0 = C/hA&lt;/math&gt;. (The total [[heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of a system may be further represented by its mass-[[specific heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by its mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, so that the time constant &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is also given by &lt;math&gt;mc_p/hA&lt;/math&gt;).

The solution of this differential equation, by standard methods of integration and substitution of boundary conditions, gives:

: &lt;math&gt; T(t) = T_{\mathrm{env}} + (T(0) - T_{\mathrm{env}}) \ e^{-r t}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

If:

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(t) \quad &lt;/math&gt; is defined as : &lt;math&gt; T(t) - T_{\mathrm{env}} \ , \quad &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(0)\quad &lt;/math&gt; is the initial temperature difference at time 0,

then the Newtonian solution is written as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(t) = \Delta T(0) \ e^{-r t} = \Delta T(0) \ e^{-t/t_0}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

This same solution is almost immediately apparent if the initial differential equation is written in terms of &lt;math&gt;\Delta T(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as the single function to be solved for.
'
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d T(t)}{d t} = \frac{d \Delta T(t)}{d t} = - \frac{1}{t_0} \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;

===Applications===
This mode of analysis has been applied to [[forensic science]]s to analyze the time of death of humans. Also, it can be applied to [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating and air-conditioning, which can be referred to as "building climate control"), to ensure more nearly instantaneous effects of a change in comfort level setting.&lt;ref&gt;Heat Transfer - A Practical Approach by ''Yunus A Cengel''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- need a better reference--&gt;

== Mechanical systems ==
The simplifying assumptions in this domain are:
* all objects are [[rigid body|rigid bodies]];
* all interactions between rigid bodies take place via [[kinematic pair]]s (''joints''), [[spring (device)|spring]]s and [[dashpot|dampers]].

== Acoustics ==
In this context, the lumped component model extends the distributed concepts of [[Acoustic theory]] subject to approximation. In the acoustical lumped component model, certain physical components with acoustical properties may be approximated as behaving similarly to standard electronic components or simple combinations of components.

*A rigid-walled cavity containing air (or similar compressible fluid) may be approximated as a [[capacitor]] whose value is proportional to the volume of the cavity. The validity of this approximation relies on the shortest wavelength of interest being significantly (much) larger than the longest dimension of the cavity.
*A [[reflex port]] may be approximated as an [[inductor]] whose value is proportional to the effective length of the port divided by its cross-sectional area. The effective length is the actual length plus an [[end correction]]. This approximation relies on the shortest wavelength of interest being significantly larger than the longest dimension of the port.
*Certain types of damping material can be approximated as a [[resistor]]. The value depends on the properties and dimensions of the material. The approximation relies in the wavelengths being long enough and on the properties of the material itself.
*A [[loudspeaker]] drive unit (typically a [[woofer]] or [[subwoofer]] drive unit) may be approximated as a series connection of a zero-[[Electrical impedance|impedance]] [[voltage]] source, a [[resistor]], a [[capacitor]] and an [[inductor]]. The values depend on the specifications of the unit and the wavelength of interest.

== Heat transfer for buildings ==
The simplifying assumption in this domain are:
* all heat transfer mechanisms are linear, implying that radiation and convection are linearised for each problem;

Several publications can be found that describe how to generate LEMs of buildings. In most cases, the building is considered a single thermal zone and in this case, turning multi-layered walls into Lumped Elements can be one of the most complicated tasks in the creation of the model. Ramallo-González's method (Dominant Layer Method) is the most accurate and simple so far.&lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A.P., Eames, M.E. &amp; Coley, D.A., 2013. Lumped Parameter Models for Building Thermal Modelling: An Analytic approach to simplifying complex multi-layered constructions. Energy and Buildings, 60, pp.174-184.&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, one of the layers is selected as the dominant layer in the whole construction, this layer is chosen considering the most relevant frequencies of the problem. In his thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A.P. 2013. Modelling Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramallo-González shows the whole process of obtaining the LEM of a complete building.

LEMs of buildings have also been used to evaluate the efficiency of domestic energy systems &lt;ref&gt;Cooper, S.J.G., Hammond, G.P., McManus, M.C., Ramallo-Gonzlez, A. &amp; Rogers, J.G., 2014. Effect of operating conditions on performance of domestic heating systems with heat pumps and fuel cell micro-cogeneration. Energy and Buildings, 70, pp.52-60.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the LEMs allowed to run many simulations under different future weather scenarios.

'''MaRS Discovery District''' is a not-for-profit corporation founded in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in 2000. Its stated goal is to commercialize publicly funded medical research and other technologies with the help of local private enterprises and as such is a [[public-private partnership]].&lt;ref name="How did MaRS get started"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/story/ |title=How did MaRS get started |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission MaRS says, "MaRS helps create successful global businesses from Canada's science, technology and social innovation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our mission, our vision {{!}} MaRS|url=http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/mission/|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2014}}, [[Startup company|startup companies]] emerging from MaRS had created more than 4,000 jobs, and in the period of 2011 to 2014 had raised over $750 million in [[capital investments]].&lt;ref name=philipiddis2014&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/incubators-blossom-along-with-their-startups/5245/|title=Incubators Blossom along with Their Startups|last=Philipiddis|first=Alex|date=15 June 2014|work=[[Gen.

It is located on the corner of [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] and [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] in the city of Toronto’s [[Discovery District]], adjacent to the [[University of Toronto]] and its affiliated research hospitals at the [[University Health Network]].

The MaRS development consists of two phases.

=== Phase 1 ===
MaRS Discovery District Phase 1 was designed by Adamson Associates Architects and includes:

* The Heritage Building (formerly a wing of the [[Toronto General Hospital]]),
* The Atrium
* The South Tower
* The Toronto Medical Discovery Tower

====The Heritage Building====
Inside the Heritage Building's four-storey brick façade (preserved) are tenant spaces occupied by professional services, industry associations, pharmaceutical companies and offices of Canadian universities and the [[Province of Ontario]]. In 2006, the MaRS Centre received the Heritage Toronto Award of Excellence for Architectural Conservation and Craftsmanship. The building was designed by [[Pearson and Darling]] and opened in 1911.

====The Atrium====
The MaRS atrium is a glass-roofed public thoroughfare that provides walkway access to Heritage Building tenants and retail vendors, as well as access to the South and Medical Discovery Towers. Its bottom level features a sub-dividable conference area that hosts public and private events. MaRS encourages events from across Toronto's arts, culture and broader urban community. The Atrium's lower level also features a media centre, video conferencing rooms and a public food court.

====The South Tower====
This eight-storey structure houses incubator programs and shared laboratory and research facilities. The {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, wet-lab-capable building spans eight floors in the MaRS Centre. The tower boasts advanced mechanical and electrical systems, floors with enhanced load bearing capabilities and {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} slab-to-slab clearances.

Occupying the second and third floors of the South Tower — directly above the MaRS corporate offices, is the MaRS Incubator – a dedicated space that houses offices and laboratories for approximately two dozen life science and technology firms.

====Toronto Medical Discovery Tower====
With {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}} of state-of-the-art wet labs, the 15-storey Toronto Medical Discovery Tower accommodates leading-edge scientific equipment and houses the basic research activities of two of Canada's premier research hospitals: the University Health Network and the Hospital for Sick Children.

Situated on the corner of College and Elizabeth Street, the building was designed with typical research and development lab floors configured with a side core arrangement and sheathed in metal and glass. The tower portions rest on a three-storey limestone podium that aligns with the heights of the adjoining College Wing and the formal landscape forecourt that extends the full block.

The shell and core of the TMDT is designed to accommodate a full lab program based on 80 percent wet lab and 20 percent dry lab. The lab floors have been configured to maximize future flexibility. The mechanical and electrical rooms, power and communication distribution systems, general and special exhaust risers, floor drains and service zones, have been established to allow for fit-out by future tenants.

Phase 1 began operations in 2005.&lt;ref name="How did MaRS get started"/&gt;

=== West Tower ===
West Tower (formerly known as Phase 2), designed by Bregman + Hamann Architects, constitutes a {{convert|780000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition to the MaRS centre in the form of a 20-story tower on the complex’s west wing.  The tower was developed by [[Alexandria Real Estate Equities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Construction began in late 2007, and was scheduled to be completed in spring 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/News/Press-Releases/2007/Alexandria-20070626.html MaRS Selects Alexandria Real Estate Equities to Expand the MaRS Centre in the Discovery District of Toronto.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705022315/http://www.marsdd.com/News/Press-Releases/2007/Alexandria-20070626.html |date=2008-07-05 }}. Accessed on: June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Phase 2 construction was put on hold due to the [[Late 2000s recession|economic downturn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialpost.com/news/story.html?id=970255 Toronto's MaRS project a step too far.

==Criticism==
[[Image:MaRSAtrium.jpg|200 px|thumb|Inside the MaRS Centre atrium.]]

In April 2010, criticism of the $471,874 salary collected by MaRS CEO Ilse Treurnicht in 2008 was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Boutin |title=Troubling Facts about MaRS Discovery District |url=http://www.growthtimes.com/2010/04/troubling-facts-about-mars-discovery-district-part-1-of-4/ |work=Growth Times |date=April 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also criticized Liberal government-led funding, lack of accountability and rigor in measuring results, claims of public-private partnerships and the absence of visible minorities among MaRS's team of advisors.

On August 27, 2010, the [[National Post]] relayed some of these criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adam McDowell |title=Discovering life at MaRS: Toronto’s premier innovation district |work=[[National Post]]|date=August 27, 2010 |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/Discovering+life+MaRS+Toronto+premier+innovation+district/3452631/story.html |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewed criticism was published in 2011, pointing in particular to the $100,000 increase in Treurnicht's salary, her $534,000 salary in 2010, and questioning the public and private funding of the Phase II expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Boutin |title=CEO of MaRS got 22% raise (one month before Ontario wage freeze?), made $533K in 2010 |work=Growth Times |date=August 3, 2011|url=http://www.growthtimes.com/2011/08/ceo-of-mars-got-22-raise-one-month-before-ontario-wage-freeze-made-533k-in-2010|accessdate=August 5, 2011|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toronto Sun]] published articles on the topic as well, questioning the high compensation levels at the charitable trust institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/02/salaries-increase-at-mars-discovery-district|author=Jonathan Jenkins |title=Salaries increase at MaRS Discovery District |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maadiran group''' is an [[Iran]]ian conglomerate group. 
The group is composed of a public company as well as several fully private entities. The group is a multi-generational family company with no links to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The core business of the Maadiran Group revolves around technology manufacturing, distribution, [[solution]]s, and support services. It has a distribution channel of over 1800 direct sales dealers and over 6000 sales sub-dealers. It expanded with significant investments into venture capital, consumer finance, banking, green tech, plastics production, and real estate development.

The group was established in 1964 and was formerly known as Iran Office Machines Company Ltd. It is an exclusive distributor for [[Sharp Corporation]], [[LG Group]], [[AOC International|AOC]], [[Dell]], [[Asus]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[CTS Electronics]], [[TCL Corporation|TCL]], [[Optoma]], [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]], [[Olivetti]], and [[Epson]] as well as a number of other brands. Maadiran also has several own brand product lines including a range of specialised technical solutions and consumables operating under the brand name [[Meva]], and a range of AV and home appliance products being sold under [[X-Vision]] brand, lifestyle products under the [[xelle]] brand, and biodegradable products under [[kisabz]].

In 2004 the group began to export its locally manufactured products to the [[Middle East]]. This trend increased dramatically in early 2005 when [[LG Electronics]] began to buy Iranian-produced LG-Maadiran monitors for its own exports to the [[Persian Gulf]] markets. Maadiran also markets its [[Meva]] and [[X-Vision]] brands to regional markets.

Maadiran's after-sales support subsidiary, has 21 regional branches through which it provides support all over Iran. These 21 branches in turn support a larger network of over 500 authorized service dealers across the country.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Maadiran is the number one manufacturer of DVB-T Set-top and mobile devices within Iran with a total output of 710,000 units in 2013. Its [[X-Vision]] brand is also the third most popular television brand within the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Maadiran Logo==

The original Maadiran logo consisted of two bars with the company name written in both [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[English language|English]] inside the bars.

The Maadiran Group logo was created by [[Iran]]ian calligrapher and logo-designer Mr. Chehreh-Pardaz.  This logo was first used by the group in 2000 and was the first logo in which the company's new name, 'Maadiran', appeared.

'''MangoO Microfinance Management''' is a [[free and open-source software]] solution for the management of small-scale [[microfinance]] institutions (MFIs).&lt;ref&gt;[https://mangoo-microfinance.github.io/mangoO-Microfinance Website of the MangoO Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Development of mangoO Microfinance Management started in September 2014 when the [[SACCO]] of Luweero Diocese in [[Uganda]] sought to improve their administration. The major target was to computerise their hitherto manual and paper-based book-keeping. As other available software solutions seemed to target big-scale MFIs, they decided to design their own tailor-made solution.

== Objectives ==
The main target in the development of mangoO was to design a microfinance software with an extremely simple user interface. Most workers at Luweero Diocese SACCO were inexperienced in the use of computers in general. The software, therefore, needed to focus on ease of use and maximum automation. As a result, mangoO is best equipped to serve small-scale (primarily single-branch) MFIs.

== Technological background ==
For its major part, mangoO was written in [[PHP]] with some additional [[JavaScript]] and [[CSS]]. The database uses [[MySQL]]. As the required webserver can run locally as well as remotely, the system offers a maximum of flexibility for different scenarios. On the client side, only an ordinary [[web browser]] is needed.
MangoO was published on [[GitHub]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/mangoO-Microfinance/mangoO-Microfinance Github-Repository of MangoO]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 under the [[GNU General Public Licence]] (GPLv3).

'''Margaret Dreier Robins''' (6 September 1868 – 21 February 1945) was an [[United States|American]] [[labor leader]].

==Early life==
She was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on 6 September 1868.&lt;ref name=anb /&gt; Her parents, Theodor Dreier, a successful businessman, and Dorthea Dreier, were both immigrants from Germany.&lt;ref name="Kort"&gt;Carol Kort; Liz Sonneborn. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iCcpVOQRtN0C&amp;pg=PA55 A to Z of American Women in the Visual Arts]''. Infobase Publishing; 1 January 2002. {{ISBN|978-1-4381-0791-2}}. p. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's maiden name was Dreier and her parents were cousins from [[Bremen, Germany]]. Their ancestors where civic leaders and merchants. Theodor came to the United States in 1849 and became partner of the English iron firm of Naylor, Benson and Company's New York branch. He married Dorothea in 1864 during a visit to Bremen and brought her back with him to the United States and they lived in a brownstone house in [[Brooklyn Heights, New York]].&lt;ref name="SichermanGreen1980"&gt;Barbara Sicherman; Carol Hurd Green. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CfGHM9KU7aEC&amp;pg=PA205 Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary]''. Harvard University Press; 1980. {{ISBN|978-0-674-62733-8}}. p. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MargaretDreierRobins1911LaFollette.tif|thumb|left|Margaret Dreier Robins, ''LaFollette's Magazine,'' January 1, 1911]]
Margaret Dreier had a brother and three sisters.&lt;ref name="Kort" /&gt; Her sister [[Mary Dreier|Mary]] was a social reformer. Her sisters Dorothea and [[Katherine Sophie Dreier|Katherine]] were painters.&lt;ref name="SichermanGreen1980" /&gt;

She was privately educated because her parents believed that the study of the arts was too often neglected in traditional education. In her teens, Robins suffered from physical ailments which left her depressed and weak.&lt;ref name=anb&gt;{{Cite ANB|title=Robins, Margaret Dreier|author=Sandra Opdycke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social reform career==
[[File:Sketch_by_Marguerite_Martyn_of_labor_leader_Margaret_Dreier_Robins,_1910.jpg|thumb| Sketch by journalist [[Marguerite Martyn]], with her reaction to the interview, 1910]]
At age nineteen, she began doing charity work at [[Brooklyn Hospital Center|Brooklyn Hospital]] and soon became involved in other progressive causes. She met the reformer [[Josephine Shaw Lowell]] in 1902, and through Lowell joined in the Woman’s Municipal League, an organization that helped women avoid prostitution. Another collaborator was [[Frances Kellor]], with whom she founded the New York Association for Household Research which provided lodging and placement for women domestic workers.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;
 
In 1904, increasingly interested in workers’ rights, Dreier joined the [[Women's Trade Union League]], then only a small, budding organization. She became the president of its New York chapter in 1905; president of the Chicago chapter 1907-1914; and treasurer of the national organization and rose quickly in its ranks. In 1907, she was elected president of the national organization and began a fifteen-year tenure as its leader. Meanwhile, she married the lawyer and social worker [[Raymond Robins]] in 1905.  The newleyweds split their time between running a settlement house in Chicago, Illinois and [[Chinsegut Hill]] in Brooksville, Florida.

[[File:Raymond and Margaret Dreier Robins.jpg|thumb|left|Raymond and Margaret Dreier Robins on their Chinsegut Hill estate, 1917]]
As president of the League, Robins helped organize women into unions, educate women workers, and advocate for progressive legislation. She created a Training School for Women to educate women workers about organizing and leadership skills. She supported and became active in a number of well publicized strikes, most notably the [[International Ladies Garment Workers Union|International Ladies Garment Workers]]’ strike in 1910. She pushed for protective legislation limiting the hours of women’s work, and she presided over the League during its most influential period.

She served on the executive board of the Chicago Federation of Labor after 1908, and in 1915 was appointed to the unemployment commission by the [[governor of Illinois]].

In 1919, Robins played an important role in the creation of the first [[The International Congress of Working Women|International Congress of Working Women]]. Robins agreed to send both [[Rose Schneiderman]] and [[Mary Anderson (labor leader)|Mary Anderson]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], where with other female labor leaders they organized an international labor women’s conference to prepare for the upcoming [[International Labour Organization]] convention in October in Washington, D.C.

In 1924, Robins retired from her activist work and moved full-time with her husband to [[Florida]]. She died in 1945.

'''Mechanical heat treatment''' (MHT) is an alternative waste treatment technology. This technology is also commonly termed [[autoclaving]]. MHT involves a [[wikt:mechanical|mechanical]] sorting or pre-processing stage with technology often found in a [[material recovery facility]]. The mechanical sorting stage is followed by a form of [[thermal treatment]]. This might be in the form of a [[waste autoclave]] or processing stage to produce a [[refuse derived fuel]] pellet. MHT is sometimes grouped along with [[mechanical biological treatment]]. MHT does not however include a stage of biological degradation ([[anaerobic digestion]] or [[composting]]).

Different MHT systems may be configured to meet various objectives with regard to the [[waste]] outputs from the process. The alternatives (depending on the system employed) may be one or more of the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/ENVIRONMENT/waste/wip/newtech/pdf/mechbiotreat.pdf MHT &amp; MBT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210040602/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/wip/newtech/pdf/mechbiotreat.pdf |date=2006-12-10 }}[[Mechanical Biological Treatment]] and [[Mechanical Heat Treatment]] of [[Municipal Solid Waste]], [[Defra]], Waste Implementation Programme, New Technologies&lt;/ref&gt;

*Separate an 'organic rich' component of the waste for subsequent [[biological process]]ing
*Produce a refuse derived fuel to be applied in an appropriate process to utilise its energy potential; and
*Extract materials for [[recycling]] (typically [[glass]] and [[metal]]s, potentially [[plastic]]s and the fibrous organic and paper fraction)

'''Medicon Valley''' is a leading international [[life sciences|life-sciences]] cluster in [[Europe]], spanning the [[Greater Copenhagen (metropolitan region)|Greater Copenhagen region]] of eastern [[Denmark]] and southern [[Sweden]]. It is one of Europe's strongest life science clusters, with a large number of life science companies and research institutions located within a relatively small geographical area. The name has officially been in use since 1997.

Major life science sectors of the Medicon Valley cluster includes [[pharmacology]], [[biotechnology]], [[Health technology|health tech]] and medical technology. It is specifically known for its research strengths in the areas of [[neurological disorders]], [[inflammatory diseases]], [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]].
 
== Background and activities ==
The population of Medicon Valley reaches close to 4 million inhabitants. In 2008, 60% of Scandinavian pharmaceutical companies were located in the region. The area includes 17 universities, 32 hospitals, and more than 400&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediconvalley.com/industry/database|title=Medicon Valley Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; life science companies. 20 are large pharmaceutical or medical technology firms and 170 are dedicated biotechnology firms. Between 1998 and 2008, 100  new  biotechnology  and  medical  technology  companies  were  created here. The biotechnology industry alone employs around 41,000 people in the region, 7,000 of whom are academic researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mva.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/State_of_Medicon_Valley_2017.pdf|title=Medicon Valley report 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicon Valley Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

International companies with major research centres in the region include [[Novo Nordisk]], [[Baxter International|Baxter]], [[Lundbeck]], [http://www.leo-pharma.com/ LEO Pharma], [https://www.hemocue.com/ HemoCue] and [[Ferring Pharmaceuticals]]. There are more than 7 [[science park]]s in the region, all with a significant focus on life science, including the [[Medicon Village]] in Lund, established in 2010. Companies within Medicon Valley account for more than 20% of the total GDP of Denmark and Sweden combined.&lt;ref name="Basic Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mva.org/medicon-valley/ |title=Medicon Valley Region |publisher=Medicon Valley Alliance |accessdate=26 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= |title=The  life  science  cluster  of  Medicon  Valley,  Scandinavia |author1=Asheim, B.  |author2=J.

A '''mobile phone operator''', '''wireless provider''', or '''carrier''' is a mobile [[telecommunications]] [[company]] that provides wireless Internet [[GSM|GSM services]] for mobile device users.  The operator gives a [[SIM card]] to the customer who inserts it into the mobile device to gain access to the service.

There are two types of mobile operators:

* a [[Mobile network operator|mobile network operator (MNO)]] which owns the underlying [[GSM core network|network]] and [[GSM frequency bands|spectrum assets]] required to run the service.
* a [[Mobile virtual network operator|mobile virtual network operator (MVNO)]] which buys wholesale service from an MNO and sells on to its own customers.

{{As of|May 2016}} (and for years before), the world's largest individual mobile operator by subscribers is [[China Mobile]] with over 835 million mobile subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinamobileltd.com/ir.php?menu=11 Operation Data – Customer Numbers] China Mobile Official Site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/11/china-mobile-telecomms|title=State owned China Mobile is world's biggest mobile phone operator|author=Tania Branigan|date=January 11, 2010|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50 mobile operators have over 10 million subscribers each, and over 150 mobile operators had at least one million subscribers by the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Source: wireless intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, there were 4.6 billion mobile subscribers, a number that is estimated to grow. Total mobile‐cellular subscriptions reached almost 6 billion by end 2011, corresponding to a global penetration of 86%.

==History==
{{Main|History of mobile phones}}
Prior to 1973, cellular mobile device technology was limited to devices installed in cars and other vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;See Amos Joel patent 3,663,762.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first fully automated telephone calling system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1960, called [[MTD (mobile network)|MTA]] (mobile telephone system A). Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to determine which base station the device was currently at.  In 1962, an upgraded version called ''Mobile System B (MTB)'' was introduced. In 1971, the [[MTD (mobile network)|MTD]] version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZRo-lxUDwkC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Mobile+System+A+(MTA)&amp;hl=sv#v=onepage&amp;q=m%C3%A4kitalo&amp;f=false Mingtao Shi, ''Technology base of mobile cellular operators in Germany and China'', page 55 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilen50ar.se/eng/FaktabladENGFinal.pdf Facts about the Mobile. A Journey through Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824090114/http://www.mobilen50ar.se/eng/FaktabladENGFinal.pdf |date=August 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.

In 1958, development began on a similar service in the USSR, the Altay system for motorists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishrussia.com/?p=307 The first Russian mobile phone]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the service started in Moscow, and by 1970, was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.

In 1959 a private telephone company located in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&amp;T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola radio telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public cellular telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas.

In 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic telephone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

One of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the [[Autoradiopuhelin|ARP]] network in [[Finland]], launched in 1971.

On April 3, 1973, [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]], a [[Motorola]] researcher and executive, made the first analog mobile phone call using a heavy prototype model. He called Dr. [[Joel S. Engel]] of [[Bell Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shiels |first=Maggie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2963619.stm |title=BBC interview with Martin Cooper | work=BBC News | date=April 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially automated cellular network (the [[1G]] generation) was launched in Japan by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] in 1979. The initial launch network covered the full metropolitan area of Tokyo's over 20 million inhabitants with a cellular network of 23 base stations. Within five years, the NTT network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan and became the first nationwide 1G network.  Several other countries also launched 1G networks in the early 1980s including the UK, [[Mexico]] and Canada.

In the 1990s, the 'second generation' ([[2G]]) mobile phone systems emerged, primarily using the [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] standard.  In 1991, the first GSM network ([[Radiolinja]]) launched in [[Finland]].

American and Canadian wireless providers tend to subsidize phones for consumers but tend to require 2 or 3 year contracts, while Asians and Europeans sell the phone at full cost while the monthly fees charged are lower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://calgaryherald.com/business/phone+coming/7207372/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical communication''', also known as '''optical telecommunication''', is [[communication]] at a distance using [[light]] to carry information. It can be performed visually or by using [[electronics|electronic devices]]. The earliest basic forms of optical communication date back several millennia, while the earliest electrical device created to do so was the [[photophone]], invented in 1880.

An optical [[communication system]] uses a [[transmitter]], which encodes a [[message]] into an optical [[signal (information theory)|signal]], a [[Communication channel|channel]], which carries the signal to its destination, and a [[Tuner (radio)|receiver]], which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. When electronic equipment is not employed the 'receiver' is a person visually observing and interpreting a signal, which may be either simple (such as the presence of a [[beacon|beacon fire]]) or complex (such as lights using color codes or flashed in a [[Morse code]] sequence).

[[Free-space optical communication]] has been deployed in space, while terrestrial forms are naturally limited by geography, weather and the availability of light. This article provides a basic introduction to different forms of optical communication.

== Forms ==
Visual techniques such as [[smoke signals]], [[beacon|beacon fires]], [[hydraulic telegraph]]s, [[ship flags]] and [[semaphore line]]s were the earliest forms of optical communication.&lt;ref name="Burns2004"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7eUUy8-VvwoC&amp;pg=PA29 Chapter 2: Semaphore Signalling] {{ISBN|978-0-86341-327-8}} Communications: an international history of the formative years R.

[[Distress flare]]s are still used by mariners in emergencies, while [[lighthouse]]s and [[navigation light]]s are used to communicate navigation hazards.

The [[heliograph]] uses a [[mirror]] to [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] sunlight to a distant observer.&lt;ref name="Boer"&gt;Harris, J.D. [http://rapidttp.com/milhist/vol111jh.html Wire At War - Signals communication in the South African War 1899–1902]. Retrieved on 1 June 2008. Note a discussion on the heliograph use during the Boer War.&lt;/ref&gt; When a signaler tilts the mirror to reflect sunlight, the distant observer sees flashes of light that can be used to transmit a prearranged signaling code.  [[Navy|Naval]] [[ship]]s often use [[signal lamp]]s and [[Morse code]] in a similar way.

[[Aviator|Aircraft pilots]] often use [[visual approach slope indicator]] (VASI) projected light systems to land safely, especially at night. Military aircraft landing on an [[aircraft carrier]] use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck.  The coloured light system communicates the aircraft's height relative to a standard landing [[glideslope]]. As well, [[Air traffic control#Airport control|airport control towers]] still use [[Aldis lamp]]s to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed.

In the present day a variety of electronic systems optically transmit and receive information carried by pulses of light. [[Fiber-optic communication]] cables are now employed to send the great majority of the electronic data and long distance telephone calls that are not conveyed by either [[radio]], [[Microwave transmission|terrestrial microwave]] or [[Communications satellite|satellite]]. [[Free-space optical communication]]s are also used every day in various applications.

=== Semaphore line ===
{{Main|Semaphore line}}
[[File:OptischerTelegraf.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A replica of one of [[Claude Chappe|Chappe's]] [[semaphore tower]]s (18th century).]]
A [[Semaphore line|'semaphore telegraph']], also called a 'semaphore line', 'optical telegraph', 'shutter telegraph chain', 'Chappe telegraph', or 'Napoleonic semaphore', is a system used for conveying information by means of visual signals, using towers with pivoting arms or shutters, also known as blades or paddles. Information is encoded by the position of the mechanical elements; it is read when the shutter is in a fixed position.&lt;ref name="EncyBrit1824"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdEnc1832"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhEbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA657 Telegraph], Volume 17 of The Edinburgh encyclopaedia, pp. 664-667, 1832 David Brewster, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semaphore lines were a precursor of the [[electrical telegraph]]. They were far faster than [[post rider]]s for conveying a message over long distances, but far more expensive and less private than the electrical telegraph lines which would later replace them. The maximum distance that a pair of semaphore telegraph stations can bridge is limited by geography, weather and the availability of light; thus, in practical use, most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances. Each relay station would also require its complement of skilled operator-observers to convey messages back and forth across the line.

The modern design of semaphores was first foreseen by the British [[polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]], who first gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy in a 1684 submission to the [[Royal Society]]. His proposal (which was motivated by military concerns following the [[Battle of Vienna]] the preceding year) was not put into practice during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, J.B. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120208081932/http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/railway/semaphor/semhist.htm The Origin of the Railway Semaphore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [[Boston University]], 15 April 2000, Revised 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McVeigh, Daniel P. [http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/html/part2.html An Early History of the Telephone: 1664-1865, Part 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [[Columbia University|Columbia University in The City of New York]], Institute For Learning Technologies, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first operational optical semaphore line arrived in 1792, created by the French engineer [[Claude Chappe]] and his brothers, who succeeded in covering [[France]] with a network of 556 stations stretching a total distance of {{convert|4,800|km}}. It was used for military and national communications until the 1850s.

Many national services adopted signaling systems different from the Chappe system. For example, [[UK|Britain]] and [[Sweden]] adopted systems of shuttered panels (in contradiction to the Chappe brothers' contention that angled rods are more visible). In [[Spain]], the engineer [[Agustín de Betancourt]] developed his own system which was adopted by that state. This system was considered by many experts in Europe better than Chappe's, even in France.

These systems were popular in the late 18th to early 19th century but could not compete with the [[electrical telegraph]], and went completely out of service by 1880.&lt;ref name="Burns2004"/&gt;

=== Semaphore signal flags ===
{{Main|Flag semaphore}}
[[File:020118-N-6520M-011 Semaphore Flags.jpg|thumb|A naval signaler transmitting a message by flag semaphore (2002).]]
[[Flag semaphore|Semaphore Flags]] is the system for conveying information at a distance by means of visual signals with hand-held flags, rods, disks, paddles, or occasionally bare or gloved hands. Information is encoded by the position of the flags, objects or arms; it is read when they are in a fixed position.

Semaphores were adopted and widely used (with hand-held [[flag]]s replacing the mechanical arms of [[semaphore line|shutter semaphores]]) in the maritime world in the 19th century. They are still used during [[Underway replenishment|underway replenishment at sea]] and are acceptable for emergency communication in daylight or, using lighted wands instead of flags, at night.

The newer flag semaphore system uses two short poles with square flags, which a signaler holds in different positions to convey letters of the alphabet and numbers. The transmitter holds one pole in each hand, and extends each arm in one of eight possible directions. Except for in the rest position, the flags cannot overlap. The flags are colored differently based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land. At sea, the flags are colored red and yellow (the [[International maritime signal flags#Letters|Oscar flags]]), while on land, they are white and blue (the [[International maritime signal flags#Letters|Papa flags]]). Flags are not required, they just make the characters more obvious.

=== Optical fiber ===
{{Main|Fiber-optic communication}}
[[Optical fiber]] is the most common type of channel for optical communications. The transmitters in optical fiber links are generally [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) or [[laser diode]]s.  [[Infrared]] light, rather than [[visible light]] is used more commonly, because optical fibers transmit infrared wavelengths with less [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]. The signal encoding is typically simple [[intensity modulation]], although historically optical phase and [[frequency modulation]] have been demonstrated in the lab. The need for periodic [[signal regeneration]] was largely superseded by the introduction of the [[erbium-doped fiber amplifier]], which extended link distances at significantly lower cost.

=== Signal lamps ===
{{Main|Signal lamp|Aviation light signals}}
[[File:TC with light gun.JPG|thumb|left|An [[air traffic control]]ler holding a signal light gun that can be used to direct aircraft experiencing a radio failure (2007).]]
[[Signal lamp]]s (such as Aldis lamps), are visual signaling devices for optical communication (typically using Morse code). Modern signal lamps are a focused lamp which can produce a pulse of light. In large versions this pulse is achieved by opening and closing shutters mounted in front of the lamp, either via a manually operated pressure switch or, in later versions, automatically.

With hand held lamps, a [[Curved mirror#Concave mirrors|concave mirror]] is tilted by a trigger to focus the light into pulses. The lamps are usually equipped with some form of optical sight, and are most commonly deployed on naval vessels and also used in airport control towers with coded [[aviation light signals]].

[[Aviation light signals]] are used in the case of a [[NORDO|radio failure]], an [[aircraft]] not equipped with a radio, or in the case of a hearing-impaired pilot. [[Air traffic control]]ers have long used signal light guns to direct such aircraft. The light gun's lamp has a focused bright beam capable of emitting three different colors: red, white and green. These colors may be flashing or steady, and provide different instructions to aircraft in flight or on the ground (for example, "cleared to land" or "cleared for takeoff"). Pilots can acknowledge the instructions by wiggling their plane's wings, moving their [[aileron]]s if they are on the ground, or by flashing their [[Aircraft landing lights|landing]] or [[navigation light]]s during night time. Only 12 simple standardized instructions are directed at aircraft using signal light guns as the system is not utilized with [[Morse code]].

=== Photophone ===
{{Main|Photophone}}
The [[photophone]] (originally given an alternate name, [[radiophone]]) is a communication device which allowed for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of speech on a beam of [[light]]. It was invented jointly by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] on February 19, 1880, at Bell's 1325 'L' Street laboratory in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pg. 336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SDU"&gt;Jones, Newell. [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html First 'Radio' Built by San Diego Resident Partner of Inventor of Telephone: Keeps Notebook of Experiences With Bell] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060904235846/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html |date=2006-09-04 }}, San Diego Evening Tribune, July 31, 1937. Retrieved from the University of San Diego History Department website, November 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were later to become full associates in the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Laboratory projects|Volta Laboratory Association]], created and financed by Bell.

On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message of considerable distance, from the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] to the window of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters (about 700&amp;nbsp;ft.) away.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pg. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carson-2007-gvttw"&gt;Carson 2007, pg. 76-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groth"&gt;Groth, Mike. [http://www.bluehaze.com.au/modlight/GrothArticle1.htm Photophones Revisted], 'Amateur Radio' magazine, [[Wireless Institute of Australia]], Melbourne, April 1987 pp. 12–17 and May 1987 pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 11"&gt;Mims 1982, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell believed the photophone was his most important [[invention]]. Of the 18 [[patent]]s granted in Bell's name alone, and the 12 he shared with his collaborators, four were for the photophone, which Bell referred to as his'' 'greatest achievement''', telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was ''"the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone"''.&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 14"&gt;Mims 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The photophone was a precursor to the [[fiber-optic communication]] systems which achieved popular worldwide usage starting in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;Morgan, Tim J. "The Fiber Optic Backbone", [[University of North Texas]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist-1984.V72.No1"&gt;Miller, Stewart E. "Lightwaves and Telecommunication", ''[[American Scientist]]'', Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, January–February 1984, Vol. 72, No. 1, pp. 66-71, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/i27852430 Issue Stable URL].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallardo+Mims"&gt;Gallardo, Arturo; [[Forrest Mims|Mims III, Forrest M.]].

Accessed January 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The master patent for the photophone ({{US patent|235199}} ''Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone''), was issued in December 1880,&lt;ref name="Groth" /&gt; many decades before its principles came to have practical applications.

=== Free-space optical communication ===
{{Main|Free-space optical communication |Optical wireless communications}}
Free-space optics (FSO) systems are employed for '[[last mile]]' [[telecommunication]]s and can function over distances of several kilometers as long as there is a clear [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] between the source and the destination, and the optical receiver can reliably decode the transmitted information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= A 173-mile 2-way all-electronic optical contact |url= http://www.modulatedlight.org/optical_comms/optical_qso_173mile.html |work= Modulated light web site |author= Clint Turner |date= October 3, 2007 |accessdate= June 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other free-space systems can provide high-data-rate, long-range links using small, low-mass, low-power-consumption subsystems which make them suitable for communications in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=K.|title=Recent Development in High-Data Rate Optical Communications at JPL|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2014/18156|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various planned [[Satellite constellation|satellite constellations]] intended to provide global broadband coverage take advantage of these benefits and employ [[laser communication in space|laser communication]] for inter-satellite links between the several hundred to thousand satellites effectively creating a space-based [[optical mesh network]].

More generally, transmission of unguided optical signals is known as [[optical wireless communications]] (OWC). Examples include medium-range [[visible light communication]] and short-distance [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], using infrared LEDs.

=== Heliograph ===
[[Image:Australian Heliograph in Egyptian Desert 1940.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Heliograph]]: Australians using a heliograph in North Africa (1940).]]
{{Main|Heliograph}}
A [[heliograph]] ({{Lang-el|Ἥλιος}} ''[[helios]]'', meaning "sun", and {{lang|el|γραφειν}} ''[[wikt:-graphy|graphein]]'', meaning "write") is a wireless solar [[telegraph]] that signals by flashes of [[sunlight]] (generally using [[Morse code]]) reflected by a [[mirror]]. The flashes are produced by momentarily pivoting the mirror, or by interrupting the beam with a shutter.

The heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous optical communication over long distances during the late 19th and early 20th century. Its main uses were in military, surveys and forest protection work. They were standard issue in the British and Australian armies until the 1960s, and were used by the Pakistani army as late as 1975.&lt;ref name="Boer"/&gt;

'''Palo''' is a memory resident multidimensional ([[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) or multidimensional online analytical processing ([[MOLAP]])) [[database]] server and typically used as a [[business intelligence]] tool for [[management accounting|controlling]] and [[budget]]ing purposes with [[spreadsheet]] software acting as the user interface. Beyond the multidimensional data concept, Palo enables multiple users to share one centralised data storage ([[single version of the truth]]).

This type of [[database]] is suitable to handle complex data models for business management and statistics. Apart from multidimensional queries, data can also be written back and consolidated in real-time. To give rapid access to all data, Palo stores them in the memory during run time. The server is available as [[open-source software|open-source]] and [[proprietary software]].

[[Jedox]] was founded by Kristian Raue in 2002 and developed by Jedox AG, a company based in [[Freiburg]], Germany. The firm currently employs approximately 100 people. Kristian Raue's departure from Jedox was announced in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jedox.com/en/about-jedox/news/kristian-raue-leaves-jedox-ag.html Jedox announces founder's departure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606063250/http://www.jedox.com/en/about-jedox/news/kristian-raue-leaves-jedox-ag.html |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Palo for Excel is an open source [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Microsoft Excel]]. There is also an open source plug-in for [[OpenOffice.org]] named [[PalOOCa]] (discontinued), with Java and web client also available from the JPalo project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpalo.com/en/ Tools, Consulting and Service for Palo]&lt;/ref&gt; Palo can also be integrated into other systems via its client libraries for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[PHP]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], or [[.NET Framework]]. It is fairly easy to communicate with Palo OLAP Server, since it uses [[representational state transfer]] (REST).

Starting in October 2008, Palo supports [[XML for Analysis]] and [[MultiDimensional eXpressions]] (MDX) APIs for connectivity, and [[OLE DB for OLAP]] interface which allows standard Excel pivot tables to serve as a client tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palo Open Source OLAP Server now supports MDX and Excel Pivot Tables |url=http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/10965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting September 2011, Palo supports [http://ssasefprovider.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=sdx&amp;referringTitle=Glossary SDX] dialect of [[LINQ]].

Palo also provides a web-based spreadsheet interface called Palo Web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palo.net/index.php?id=5 Palo Web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720170024/http://www.palo.net/index.php?id=5 |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Palo Suite is a tightly integrated framework consisting of: Palo MOLAP Server, Palo ETL Server, Palo Web (Palo Spreadsheet - Connection, User, ETL, File and Report Manager), Palo for Excel, Palo Supervision Server and the Palo Client Libraries.

The Data in Palo database is stored as a cube in the Palo MOLAP server.  The Palo Excel Add-In component is used as a service to communicate between the Excel and the Palo MOLAP Server.

'''paysafecard''' is a prepaid [[E-commerce payment system|online payment]] method based on vouchers with a 16-digit [[Personal Identification Number|PIN]] code, independent of bank account, credit card, or other personal information. Customers can purchase vouchers at local sales outlets and pay online by entering the code at the checkout of the respective website (e. g. an online game). paysafecard codes are ''not'' designated to be passed by mail or telephone.

paysafecard is issued and distributed country-wise; cross-border and cross-currency usage is possible within some limits. The scope of services and partner webshops varies by country. In most countries, a personal account called ''my paysafecard'' for uploading PINs is available. Starting in [[Austria]] in 2000, as of 2018 paysafecard is available in over 40 countries. Two former competitors, Dutch ''Wallie'' and British [[Ukash]], have been absorbed into paysafecard.

In 2013, paysafecard was acquired by British [[digital wallet]] provider [[Skrill]], and in 2015 as part of the Skrill Group by the ''Optimal Payments Group'', an global online payment processing provider regulated in the [[United Kingdom]]. Optimal Payments subsequently rebranded as [[Paysafe Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cardnotpresent.com/optimal-payments-rebrands-as-paysafe-nov-12-2015/ |title=Optimal Payments Rebrands as Paysafe |last=Leibovitch |first=Daniel |date=12 November 2015 |website=cardnotpresent.com |access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ewallet-optimizer.com/paysafecard-details-and-information/ |title=Paysafecard – Details &amp; Information |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=ewallet-optimizer.com |access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, paysafecard became a part of the multinational ''Optimal Payments'' online payment corporation, which subsequently rebranded as [[Paysafe Group]]. The group now directly offers certain products and services under the ''Paysafe'' brand. paysafecard, however, continues to be a subsidiary brand of the Paysafe Group in its own right, alongside some others, like the digital wallets [[Skrill]] and [[Neteller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/paysafe-group-homepage/ |title=Welcome to Paysafe Group |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=paysafe.com |access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources erreneously interpret ''Paysafe'' to be the name of the company originally issuing the ''paysafecard'' product, and sometimes suggest this to be the core company of the Paysafe Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brokervergleich.net/ripple-kaufen-mit-paysafe |title=Ripple kaufen mit Paysafe |last= |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=brokervergleich.net |access-date=22 December 2017|quote= |language=German |trans-title=Buy Ripple With Paysafe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ewallet-optimizer.com/skrill/paysafe-group-plc/ |title=Paysafe Group PLC History |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=ewallet-optimizer.com |access-date=26 January 2018 |quote=Paysafe started in 2000 with four Austrians who developed “cash for the internet” and named their product paysafecard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Early years ===
The company behind paysafecard is based in [[Vienna]], Austria, and was founded in 2000 as ''paysafecard.com Wertkarten AG'' ("paysafecard.com prepaid card Inc."), later transferred into a [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]], a [[private limited company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trademarks.justia.com/790/76/paysafecard-pay-cash-pay-79076910.html |title=PAYSAFECARD PAY CASH. PAY SAFE. - Trademark Details |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=4 January 2018 |website=trademarks.justitia.com |access-date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical partner providing expertise and the original hardware was [[IBM]] Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-07.ibm.com/services/pdf/paysafecardcom_makes_web_shopping_simple_secure.pdf |title=paysafecard.com makes Web shopping simple, secure, private |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=2001 |website=ibm.com |publisher=[[IBM]] |access-date=April 4, 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, paysafecard launched also in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Internet-Prepaid-Karte-ab-heute-erhaeltlich-38559.html |title=Internet-Prepaid-Karte ab heute erhältlich |last=Dambeck |first=Holger |date=5 June 2001 |website=heise.de |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |access-date=24 May 2018 |language=German |trans-title=paysafecard obtainable as from today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, paysafecard received an EU funding under the ''eTEN'' program supporting electronic services with a trans-European dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.die-wirtschaft.at/die-wirtschaft/long-road-102386 |title=The Long Road |last=Hornacek |first=Harald |date=28 November 2005 |website=die-wirtschaft.at |access-date=22 December 2017 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, paysafecard launched in Slovenia, Greece, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name ="finextra2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/15783/pre-paid-paysafecard-set-for-launch-in-uk |title=Pre-paid Paysafecard set for launch in UK |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=30 August 2006 |website=finextra.com |access-date=24 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, British subsidiary ''Prepaid Services Company Ltd.'' received an EU-wide e-money licence by the [[Financial Services Authority|British Financial Services Authority (FSA)]], later the [[Financial Conduct Authority|Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)]] under the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]],&lt;ref name ="fca"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_FirmDetailsPage?id=001b000000m4IWxAAM |title=Firm Details: Prepaid Services Company Limited |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |publisher=[[Financial Conduct Authority]] |access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/firmBasicDetails.do?sid=194647 |title=Basic details for: 475502 - Prepaid Services Company Limited |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=1 July 2011 |publisher=FSA |access-date=30 January 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.is/lfoM#selection-191.0-195.41 |archive-date=23 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expanding a ''small e-money issuers certificate'' valid for the United Kingdom in 2006.&lt;ref name ="finextra2006" /&gt;
This authorised the company to issue e-money throughout the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=paysafecard erhält EU-Lizenz zur Ausgabe von elektronischem Geld |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |publisher=[[Der Standard]]|url=http://derstandard.at/3361758/paysafecard-erhaelt-EU-Lizenz-zur-Ausgabe-von-elektronischem-Geld |accessdate=22 December 2015 |date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also in 2008, paysafecard Switzerland obtained a license as a financial intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paysafecard expandiert in die Schweiz|publisher=pctipp.ch|url=http://www.pctipp.ch/news/firmen/artikel/paysafecard-expandiert-in-die-schweiz-42406/|accessdate=22 December 2015 |first=Bruno|last=Habegger|date=21 February 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisitions ===
In August 2011, paysafecard absorbed Dutch competitor Wallie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.about-payments.com/newsroom/news/1284/paysafecard-acquires-online-payment-provider-wallie |title=paysafecard acquires online payment provider Wallie |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=7 September 2011 |website=about-payments.com |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, [[Moneybookers|Skrill]], one of the largest payment services providers in Europe completed the acquisition of paysafecard.com Wertkarten AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retail-systems.com/rs/Skrill_paysafecard.php |title=Skrill acquires paysafecard.com |last=Moss |first=Karen |date=11 February 2013 |website=retail-systems.com |access-date=25 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Skrill acquired British paysafecard competitor [[Ukash]] and merged it into paysafecard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techworld.com/news/apps-wearables/skrill-extends-payments-portfolio-with-ukash-acquisition-3589087/ |title=Skrill extends payments portfolio with Ukash acquisition |last=Finnegan |first=Matthew  |date=28 November 2014 |website=techworld.com |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doubleAcquisition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinepaymentsreview.com/news/18-skrill-acquires-ukash-optimal-payments-acquires-skrill |title=Skrill acquires Ukash, Optimal Payments acquires Skrill |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=14 July 2015 |website=onlinepaymentsreview.com |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Skrill group competitor ''Optimal Payments'' group completed the acquisition of Skrill group, including paysafecard, and subsequently rebranded as ''Paysafe Group''.&lt;ref name="doubleAcquisition" /&gt;

==Functionality==
=== Basic function ===
Core of paysafecard is a 16-digit PIN, sold (most usually) on a printout, a pre-printed prepaid card, or as a digital information online. In the respective countries, paysafecard is available in demoninations ranging from 10 to 100 [[euro]]s, [[United States dollar]]s, [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]], and [[Australian dollar]]s, and approximately equivalent sums in other currencies, e. g. 100-1000 [[Norwegian krone]]r.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.casino.org/no/utbetaling/paysafecard/ |title=Casinoer som tilbyr Paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=casino.org |access-date=April 23, 2018 |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Casinos where paysafecard is available}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When paying in an online shop, the user enters the 16 digit PIN, and the amount tendered is deducted from the paysafecard balance. Hence, the same PIN code can be used multiple times. For larger sums it is possible to combine up to ten paysafecard PINs.&lt;ref name="binaryoptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.binaryoptions.net/paysafecard-binary-options-brokers/ |title=Paysafecard Binary Options Brokers |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=binaryoptions.net |access-date=April 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current balance of each paysafecard as well as its transaction history and production date can be viewed at the official site by entering the respective 16 PIN code.

=== Business model and fees ===
The paysafecard company earns varying proportions of merchants' transaction volumes, shared with the distribution partners.&lt;ref name="seekingalpha"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/3983936-paysafe-finally-danger-paypals-rear-view-mirror?page=2 |title=Paysafe: Finally A Danger In PayPal's Rear View Mirror! |last=Rusanov |first=Simeon |date=23 June 2016 |website=seekingalpha.com |publisher=[[Seeking Alpha]] |access-date=21 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not charge any fees to the customer for purchasing and using paysafecard, as well as checking the balance of a PIN or its payment history online. Nonetheless, in the following situations fees are to be paid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://praxistipps.chip.de/was-ist-paysafecard-und-wie-funktioniert-sie_41010 |title=Was ist Paysafecard und wie funktioniert sie? |last=Krug |first=Katharina |date=19 May 2015 |website=chip.de |publisher=[[Chip (magazine)|Chip]] |access-date=2 May 2018 |language=German |trans-title=What is paysafecard and how does it work?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://praxistipps.chip.de/paysafecard-alle-gebuehren-im-ueberblick_41015 |title=Paysafecard: Alle Gebühren im Überblick |last=Krug |first=Katharina |date=19 May 2015 |website=chip.de |publisher=[[Chip (magazine)|Chip]] |access-date=2 May 2018 |language=German |trans-title=Paysafecard: Overview of all fees }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Twelve months after purchasing a paysafecard customers will be charged an administrative fee of €3 (or like sums) on remaining balance per month, which will be automatically deducted from their credit. 
* A reimbursement of credit remaining on a paysafecard PIN requires the customer to provide their personal details, a copy of a valid form of photographic identification, bank account details and the details of the paysafecard PIN in question. Usually a reimbursement fee will be deducted from the remaining paysafecard credit, in Germany amounting to €7.50.
* For payments in a different currency than associated with the PIN obtained, paysafecard will charge a fee of usually 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.worldpay.com/support/kb/gg/alternativepayments/content/paysafecard.htm |title=About paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=worldpay.com |access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issuing ===
In contrast to in-house vouchers and prepaid products, paysafecard is sold and accepted at distinct companies ("Third Party Billing"). For this reason, dealing with them is a banking transaction and requires either a banking partner or a banking licence. In the beginning, paysafecard was issued by the [[BAWAG P.S.K.]] in Austria and the [[Commerzbank]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.at/books?id=XpneBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Challenges of Expanding Internet: E-Commerce, E-Business, and E-Government. 2005, Poznan, Poland, p. 355]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, paysafecard's subsidiary company ''Prepaid Services Company Limited'' holds a licence of the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (resp. its predecessor [[Financial Services Authority]]) "to issue electronic money (e-money) and provide payment services", valid for all countries in the [[European Economic Area]].&lt;ref name ="fca" /&gt; Therefore in those countries, paysafecard is issued by ''Prepaid Services'' without external banking partner. Further, Swiss paysafecard subsidiary ''paysafecard.com Schweiz GmbH'' is a licensed [[financial intermediary]] in Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.finma.ch/de/~/media/finma/dokumente/bewilligungstraeger/pdf/dufi.pdf?la=de |title=Liste der bewilligten Finanzintermediäre nach Art. 2 Abs. 3 GwG (DUFI) |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=finma.de |publisher=[[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] |format=PDF |access-date=16 March 2018 |quote= |language=DE |trans-title=List of licensed financial intermediaries in accord with Article 2 paragraph 3 Money Laundering Act }}&lt;/ref&gt; and issuer of the product also in other countries, e.g. in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://afterpaytouch.com/images/uploads/reports/Paysafe-Card-Terms-and-Conditions.pdf |title=General Terms and Conditions for Use of paysafecards in Australia |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=2013 |website=afterpaytouch.com |publisher=paysafecard |access-date=16 March 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, payment regulations require an external banking partner issuing paysafecard, a role assumed by ''The Bancorp Bank''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/austrian-companys-prepaid-alternative-comes-to-the-us-market |title=Austrian Company's Prepaid Alternative Comes to the U.S. Market |last=Hernandez |first=Will |date=19 October 2010 |website=americanbanker.com |publisher=[[American Banker]] |access-date=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaaonline.com/credit-cards/paysafecard/ |title=PAYSAFECARD |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=cbaaonline.com |access-date=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution ===
In the beginning, paysafecard was sold as pre-printed [[scratchcard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tebiko.de/text.php?tid=171 |title=Verwirrende Vielfalt |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=14 June 2001 |website=tebiko.de |access-date=15 May 2018 |quote=Besitzer der Paysafecard rubbeln auf der Rückseite einen 16-stelligen Zahlencode frei. ("Owners of a Paysafecard reveal the 16-digit number code on the back side by scratching.") |language=German |trans-title=Confusing variety [of online payment methods] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2002, paysafecards are usually sold as printouts called "eVouchers" by the company, uniquely numbered receipts from in-store sales terminals. paysafecard is distributed country-wise by varying external partners, which is why also shop types offering paysafecard vary by country. Typical examples include newsagents, petrol stations,&lt;ref name="seekingalpha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betrugorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.betrug.org/ripple-kaufen-mit-paysafecard/ |title=Ripple kaufen mit Paysafecard 2018: So erwerben Sie XRP |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=betrug.org |access-date=22 May 2018 |quote= |language=German |trans-title=Buy Ripple with Paysafecard in 2018: So you can buy XRP }}&lt;/ref&gt; post offices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.postfinance.ch/de/privat/produkte/digital-banking/digitales-guthaben/paysafecard.html |title=Guthaben für paysafecard: Einfach einkaufen ohne Kreditkarten |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=postfinance.ch |publisher=[[PostFinance]] |access-date=22 May 2018 |language=German |trans-title=Balance for paysafecard: Simple shopping without a credit card}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="betrugorg" /&gt; pharmacies,&lt;ref name="betrugorg" /&gt; supermarkets,&lt;ref name="betrugorg" /&gt; electrical retailers and vending machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbb.ch/de/bahnhof-services/dienstleistungen/weitere-dienstleistungen/paysafecard.html |title=Mit der paysafecard sicher im Internet einkaufen. |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |publisher=[[Swiss Federal Railways]] |access-date=2 June 2018 |quote=An allen SBB Billettautomaten rund um die Uhr [at all ticket vending machines 24/7] |language=German |trans-title=Safe online buying with paysafecard }}&lt;/ref&gt; The world-wide number of points of sales sums up to 600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandlerresearch.org/alternative-payment-solution-paysafecard.html  |title=Alternative Payment Solution: paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=sandlerresearch.org |access-date=22 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other services ===
Aside normal paysafecard, the company offers several other services, most notably in most countries an online account called ''my paysafecard'' to upload PINs and to do repeated payments more comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ewallet-optimizer.com/paysafecard-details-and-information/ |title=Paysafecard Details and FAQ |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=ewallet-optimizer.com |access-date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the payment checkout of a webshop, customers may choose between entering a PIN and signing in to their ''my paysafecard'' account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.securetrading.com//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/STPP-paysafecard.pdf |title=XML Specification Paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=15 January 2018 |website=securetrading.com |access-date=9 May 2018 |format=PDF |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The account also includes a loyalty program called ''my PLUS'' - doing payments will earn you points that can be exchanged for different benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.casinoonline.co.nz/banking-options/paysafecard/ |title=All About Paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date= |website=casinoonline.co.nz |access-date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several countries, paysafecard also issues a prepaid ''paysafecard [[Mastercard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kreditkarten-prepaid.at/paysafe-mastercard-kreditkarte/ |title=PaySafe MasterCard Kreditkarte |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=kreditkarten-prepaid.at |access-date=12 April 2018 |language=German |trans-title=PaySafe MasterCard credit card }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
paysafecard has limitations manifesting especially when used for online [[gambling]]. Payments (thus also deposits in gambling accounts) with paysafecard are inherently limited to the amount of €1000;&lt;ref name="binaryoptions" /&gt; for classic paysafecard (not ''my paysafecard'') this amount has been lowered to €250 in 2016 due to compliance regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.paysafecard.com/en/business/news/detail/new-maximum-payment-amount-per-transaction-250-euros-my-paysafecard-is-not-affected-1/ |title=New maximum payment amount per transaction: 250 euros – my paysafecard is not affected |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=9 May 2016 |website=paysafecard.com |access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other online payment methods allow a multiple of those amounts. Also, in contrast to other payment methods, accountless paysafecard does not enable a customer to withdraw money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.casinobonusesindex.com/banking/paysafecard.html |title=Paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=casinobonusesindex.com |publisher= |access-date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vip-bet.com/events-reviews-betting-preview-odds/payment-options/betsson-payment-methods/ |title=Betsson Payment Methods |last=Seregin |first=Kirill  |date=November 29, 2017 |website=vip-bet.com |access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="casinodubai" /&gt; However, a withdrawal to ''my paysafecard'' is possible and supported by several online casinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.casinotop10.net/paysafecard-online-casinos-review |title=paysafecard online casinos 2018 |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=casinotop10.net |access-date=26 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sirslot.com/withdrawing-casino-paysafecard/ |title=Withdrawing Casino funds to Paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=sirslot.com |access-date=25 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike credit cards, paysafecard does not give the opportunity to overdraw your fundings, which may be appreciated as a means of spending control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rouletteonline.net/deposit-methods/paysafecard/ |title=Deposit Via paysafecard to Play Roulette |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=rouletteonline.net |access-date=21 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.casino.org/payment/paysafecard/ |title=Top 5 Paysafecard Online Casinos of 2018 - Safe &amp; Secure |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=casino.org |access-date=21 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security issues ==
paysafecard is a payment method that enables the customer to stay anonymous not only to the merchants, but also with respect to the payment provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~pras/publications/2005-I3E-2ndgeneration-payments.pdf |title=Second generation micropayment systems: lessons learned |first=Róbert |last=Párhonyi |first2=Lambert J.M. |last2=Nieuwenhuis |first3=Aiko |last3=Pras |date=2005 |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of Twente |access-date=26 May 2018 |format=PDF |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of money exposed to loss by accident or fraud is limited to the denomination of the voucher purchased; no bank account or credit card data are put at risk.&lt;ref name="rechnungswesen"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rechnungswesen-verstehen.de/finanzen/paysafecard.php |title=Wie funktioniert die Paysafecard ?

Advantages, disadvantages, costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, there are varying instances of abuse:
* Like all systems that only require entering data on a website, paysafecard may fall victim to [[phishing]] techniques. By mimicking the official website or a merchant's checkout page, fraudsters may trick users into entering their PINs and use the credit for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pc-magazin.de/news/telekom-phishing-rechnung-paysafecard-giropay-warnung-3195445.html |title=Telekom-Phishing: Sichere Zahlungsmöglichkeiten für angebliche Rückstände |last=Nguyen |first=The-Khoa |date= |website= |publisher=10 December 2015 |access-date=12 May 2018 |language=German |trans-title=[[Deutsche Telekom|Telekom]]-Phishing: Secure payment options for pretended arrears}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special instance are so-called "paysafecard hacks", allegedly doubling the value of your paysafecard.&lt;ref name="botfrei"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.botfrei.de/2012/01/betrugsversuche-mit-der-paysafecard/ |title=Betrugsversuche mit der paysafecard |last= |first= |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date=18 January 2012 |website=botfrei.de |access-date=28 May 2018 |language=german |trans-title=Fraud attempts with paysafecard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In common low-tech versions of this phishing, fraudsters offer goods, services, or cash prizes demanding a commitment fee,&lt;ref name="botfrei" /&gt; and ask for paysafecard PINs by mail or phone (or scans of the card) for payment. No goods or services are ever delivered in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cb-News-Internet-Ebay-Kleinanzeigen-Betrug-Post-17961013.html |title=Ebay-Kleinanzeigen: Das sind die aktuellen Betrugsmaschen |last1=Matthiesen |first1=Nils |last2=Hensen |first2=Christian |date=22 November 2017 |website=computerbild.de |publisher=[[Computer Bild]] |access-date=6 July 2018 |language=German |trans-title=Ebay classified ads: Those are the current fraud scams}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the early 2010s, paysafecard was criticized as being abused by criminals for anonymous payments — by means of uploading prepaid credit cards, including stolen ones.&lt;ref name="Doerner" /&gt; German computer magazine [[Computer Bild]] propagated a quick legal regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bild.de/digital/internet/zahlungsmittel-abzocke-betrug-kriminelle-14100144.bild.html |title=Paysafecard: Kriminelle nutzen Karte für Abzocke und Betrug |author=&lt;!--not stated--&gt; |date=28 September 2010 |website=bild.de |publisher=Computerbild |access-date=20 December 2017 |language=German |trans-title=Paysafecard: Criminals use card for rip-off and fraud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed a new money-laundering law was passed in Germany, effective at the start of 2012. It obliged customers of anonymous prepaid methods (like paysafecard) to undergo an identification procedure when surpassing a monthly spending amount of 100 €.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/Waehrungsrisiken-1723975.html |title=Währungsrisiken |last=Haar |first=Tobias |date=November 2012 |website=heise.de |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |access-date=April 22, 2018 |language=German |trans-title=Currency risks}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mainly from 2012 to 2014 cases were reported of fraudsters calling at gas stations, trying to obtain paysafecard PINs from the salespersons by pretending to be paysafecard personnel. Two cases in [[Vorarlberg]], Austria, summed up to over 6000 €.&lt;ref name ="computerbetrug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AK" /&gt;
* Starting in 2012, paysafecard and other prepaid payment methods (like then-competitor [[Ukash]] and [[Bitcoin]]) have been abused by [[ransomware (malware)|ransomware]], claiming to originate from the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|German Federal Criminal Police Office]]. The ransomware locks customers' computers and may threaten to erase their hard drives, unless a fine is paid. However, computers are not unlocked even when the fine is paid by the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bundes-trojaner.de/ |title=Bundespolizei-, BKA-Trojaner entfernen |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |date= |website=bundes-trojaner.de |publisher= |access-date=April 22, 2018 |language=German |trans-title=How to remove the 'Federal Criminal Police' trojan}}&lt;/ref&gt; paysafecard suggests to remove related viruses and trojans by following instructions provided by Botcrawl.com and other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.paysafecard.com/en-us/security/|title=BKA/GEMA computer virus - demands the payment of a "fine" by paysafecard |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="botfrei" /&gt;
* Some scam websites claim to offer free paysafecard PINs under labels such as "promo PSC", luring internet users into subscription traps and [[click fraud]], and not providing any service in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mimikama.at/allgemein/achtung-vor-dieser-kostenlosen-paysafecard/ |title=Achtung vor dieser kostenlosen Paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated --&gt; |date=6 May 2016 |website= |publisher=mimikama.at |access-date=9 May 2018 |quote= |language=German |trans-title=Beware of this free paysafecard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worse versions of this type of scam offer a free "Paysafe generator" and install a ransomware virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sensorstechforum.com/remove-paysafe-generator-virus-restore-cry_-files/ |title=Remove Paysafe Generator Virus and Restore .cry_ Files |last=Bilbao |first=Berta |date=9 November 2016 |website=sensorstechforum.com |access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
paysafecard sets clear that PINs are only to be entered at authorised online shops, and never to be passed in any other way. The payment method is never used for governmental fines or reminder fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.paysafecard.com/en-gb/security/ |title=How to pay securely online with paysafecard |author=&lt;!-- not stated--&gt; |website=paysafecard.com |access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

'''Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis''' is a technology for restoring sight to patients blinded by [[Degeneration (medical)|degenerative]] [[retina]]l diseases, such as [[retinitis pigmentosa]] and [[Macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD), when patients lose the 'image capturing' photoreceptors, but [[neuron]]s in the 'image-processing' inner retinal layers are relatively well-preserved &lt;ref name="Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis: implant fabrication and performance."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1741-2560/9/4/046014 |title=Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis: Implant fabrication and performance |year=2012 |last1=Wang |first1=Lele |journal=Journal of Neural Engineering |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=046014 |pmc=3419261 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This subretinal [[prosthesis]] is designed to restore a patients' sight by electrically stimulating the surviving inner retinal neurons, primarily the bipolar cells. Photovoltaic retinal implants are completely wireless and powered by near-infrared illumination (880nm) projected from the video goggles. Therefore, they do not require such complex surgical methods as needed for other retinal implants, which are powered via extraocular electronics connected to the retinal array by a trans-scleral cable &lt;ref name="Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis with high pixel density"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nphoton.2012.104 |title=Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis with high pixel density |year=2012 |last1=Mathieson |first1=Keith |journal=Nature Photonics |volume=6 |pages=391–397 |pmc=3462820 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Optical activation of the photovoltaic pixels allows scaling the implants to thousands of electrodes.

A '''portable engine''' is an [[engine]], either a [[steam engine]] or an [[internal combustion engine]],&lt;ref&gt;Examples of oil and gas engines as portable engines are seen, for example, in {{Citation |title='Gasoline Engine Department' column |journal=Threshermen's Review |date=August 1904 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=16–17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0I1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA8-PA16#v=onepage&amp;f=false |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sits in one place while operating (providing power to machinery), but (unlike a [[stationary engine]]) is [[wikt:portable#Adjective|portable]] and thus can be easily moved from one work site to another. Mounted on wheels or skids, it is either towed to the work site or moves there via self-propulsion.

Portable engines were in common use in industrialised countries from the early 19th through early 20th centuries, during an era when [[power transmission#Mechanical power|mechanical power transmission]] was widespread. Before that, most power generation and transmission were by [[working animal|animal]], [[watermill|water]], [[windmill|wind]], or [[manual labour|human]]; after that, a combination of [[electrification]] (including [[rural electrification]]) and modern vehicles and equipment (such as [[tractor]]s, [[truck]]s, [[automobile|cars]], [[engine-generator]]s, and machines with their engines built in) displaced most use of portable engines. In [[developing country|developing countries]] today, portable engines still have some use (typically in the form of modern [[small engine]]s mounted on boards), although the technologies mentioned above increasingly limit their demand there as well. In industrialised countries they are no longer used for commercial purposes, but preserved examples can often be seen at [[live steam#Festivals|steam fairs]] driving appropriate equipment for demonstration purposes.

Portable engines during their [[wikt:heyday#Noun|heyday]] were typically towed to their work sites by [[draft horse]]s or [[ox]]en, or, in the latter part of that era, motive power including self-propulsion or towing by [[traction engine]]s, [[steam tractor]]s, other [[tractor]]s, or trucks. They were used to drive [[agricultural machinery]] (such as [[threshing machine]]s), milling machinery (such as [[gristmill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, and ore mills), pumps and fans (such as in [[mining|mines]] and [[oil well]]s), and factory [[line shaft]]s (for [[machine tool]]s, [[power hammer]]s, [[machine press|presses]], and other machines).

==History==
In common with many other areas of steam technology, the initial design and development of portable engines took place in [[England]], with many other countries initially importing British-built equipment rather than developing their own.

Early [[steam engine]]s were too large and expensive for use on the average farm; however, the first positive evidence of steam power being used to drive a [[threshing machine]] was in 1799 in north [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite book | last =Lane | first =Michael R. | title =Pride of the Road (The Pictorial Story of Traction Engines) | publisher =New English Library | year =1976 | isbn =0-450-03277-9 | page =29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded application was in 1812, when [[Richard Trevithick]] designed the first 'semi-portable' [[stationary steam engine]] for agricultural use, known as a "barn engine".&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt; This was a high-pressure, rotative engine with a [[Fire-tube boiler|Cornish boiler]], for [[Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet|Sir Christopher Hawkins]] of [[Probus, Cornwall]]. It was used to drive a corn threshing machine and was much cheaper to run than the horses it replaced. Indeed, it was so successful that it remained in use for nearly 70 years, and has been preserved by the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name=Hodge&gt;{{cite book | last =Hodge | first =James | title =Richard Trevithick (Lifelines 6) | publisher =Shire Publications | year =1973 | isbn =0-85263-177-4 | page =30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although termed 'semi-portable', as they could be transported and installed without being dismantled, these engines were essentially stationary. They were used to drive such barn machinery as pumps and hammer mills, bone-crushers, chaff and turnip cutters, and fixed and mobile threshing drums.

It was not until about 1839 that the truly portable engine appeared, allowing the application of steam power beyond the confines of the farmyard. [[William Tuxford]] of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]] started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A single cylinder and the crankshaft were mounted on top of the boiler, and the whole assembly was mounted on four wheels: the front pair being steerable and fitted with shafts for horse-haulage between jobs. A large [[flywheel]] was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven.&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt;

[[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes]] built an early portable in 1841 and exhibited it at the Royal Agricultural Society show that year.  The next year Ransomes converted the steam engine to self driving, thus making the first [[traction engine]]
 
Several Tuxford engines were displayed at the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]]'s Show at Bristol in 1842, and other manufacturers soon joined in, using the basic design of the Tuxford engine as a  pattern for the majority of portable engines produced thereafter.

Early manufacturers in the UK included:
* Alexander Dean of [[Birmingham]]
* [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes]] of [[Ipswich]]
* William Tuxford and Sons of Boston, Lincolnshire
* Howden of Boston, Lincolnshire
* [[Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth]] of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]

This last manufacturer is particularly noteworthy here. The first Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth portable was built in 1845, a two-cylinder engine. In 1852, the company won a gold medal for a portable engine at the Royal Agricultural Society's Gloucester show, and thereafter the business expanded rapidly: they established a second works, in [[Vienna]] in 1857, to target the European market, and by 1890 the company had manufactured over 26,000 portable engines, many being exported all over the world.&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt;

In the 1850s, [[John Fowler (agricultural engineer)|John Fowler]] used a Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth portable engine to drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation.

In parallel with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to make them self-propelled &amp;ndash; the fore-runners of the [[traction engine]]. In most cases this was achieved by fitting a sprocket on the end of the crankshaft, and running a chain from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with mixed success.

As noted early on by [[Thomas Aveling (engineer)|Thomas Aveling]] (later of [[Aveling &amp; Porter]] fame), it was absurd to use four horses to pull a steam engine from job-to-job, when the engine possessed ten times the strength of the horses.&lt;ref name=Lane2&gt;{{cite book | last =Lane | first =Michael R. | title =Pride of the Road | page =56}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore inevitable, once self-propelled traction engines had become sufficiently reliable, that they would take over the roles of many portable engines, and this indeed started to happen from the late 1860s.

Other builders manufactured engines around the world.  Small
machine shops could assemble units with a small engine and vertical
boiler and put it on wheels. In North America dozens of builders
entered the market—Case, Sawyer Massey, and Gaar Scott for example.
Native builders erected engines in France, Italy, Sweden and Germany.

However, the portable engine was never completely replaced by the traction engine. Firstly, the portable, having no [[gear]]ing, was markedly cheaper, and secondly, numerous applications benefitted from a simple steam engine that could be moved, but did not require the additional complexity of one that could move itself.

Small numbers of portables continued to be built even after traction engine production ceased.  [[Robey and Company]] of Lincoln were still offering portables for sale into the 1960s. The English builders produced in the order of 100,000 portable steam engines in the hundred year time period both for home use and export abroad.

From about 1900 onward, the requirement for a small cheap source of power on farms was increasingly taken over by internal combustion engines, such as [[hit-and-miss engine]]s and, later, stationary and portable industrial versions of car and truck engines, either for [[belt (mechanical)#Flat belts|belt]] use or built into [[engine-generator]]s.

==Usage==
[[File:Transmissionsriemen.jpg|thumb|right|The drive belt: used to transfer power from the engine's flywheel. Here shown driving a [[threshing machine]].]]
Apart from threshing work, portable engines were used to drive corn-mills, [[centrifugal pump]]s, stone-crushers, [[dynamo]]s, [[chaff]]-cutters, hay-balers and [[saw bench]]es. They were even used to generate electricity for [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlighting]] at [[Association football|football]] matches, the first instance being at [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Simkin | first =John | title =Floodlit Football | work =The Encyclopedia of British Football | publisher =Spartacus Educational | url =http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Ffloodlit.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the portable engine is hauled to the work area, often a farmyard or field, and a long drive belt is fitted between the engine's flywheel and the driving wheel of the equipment to be powered.

In a number of cases, rather than being towed from site-to-site, the portable engine was semi-permanently installed in a building as a [[stationary steam engine]], although the wheels were not necessarily removed.

A more extreme use occurs where the engine is removed from the boiler and is re-used as a stationary engine. Often, the boiler is also re-used (without its wheels) to provide the steam. As of 2007, there are still examples of such dismantled portable engines working commercially in small rice mills in [[Burma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Portable Paradise

  | url =http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/mills/burmamill16.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-01-02 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; (and, no doubt, elsewhere too). Such examples are easy to identify due to the curved saddle, below the cylinder block, that was used to mount the engine to the boiler.
Thousands of 1 horsepower portable engines were built in China, during
the [[Great Leap Forward]] of 1958. Every village and peasant was encouraged to build a small iron smelter and produce [[pig iron]]. To power the blowers to sustain the retort temperatures, small straw burning engines were built. It was all to no effect as the end pig iron was of very poor quality for any use.

==Construction==

===General layout===
[[File:Marshall Portable Engine 87866 (GDSF 2007).JPG|thumb|right|Preserved [[Marshall, Sons &amp; Co.|Marshall]] 6nhp single-cylinder portable engine, no. 87866, built 1936. This design has a 'colonial' boiler and a long firebox for burning logs.]]
[[File:Robey 3nhp Portable Engine (chimney detail)(GDSF 2007).JPG|thumb|right|Preserved Robey 3nhp engine, showing chimney detail. The upper lever controls a damper, while the handle below operates an unusual worm-and-quadrant-gear arrangement for raising and lowering the chimney for transport.]]
The most common arrangement follows the original Tuxford design. Although this closely resembles the common layout of a traction engine, the engine of a portable is usually reversed, with the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] at the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] end and the [[crankshaft]] at the [[smokebox]] end.  This layout was designed to position the [[regulator (steam engine)|regulator]] close to the firebox, making it easier for the engineman to maintain the fire and control the engine speed from the one location. An added bonus is that the [[flywheel]] is clear of the rear road wheels so the latter can be set on a narrower track, making the engine easier to manoeuvre through field gates.

A few makers (e.g. [[John Fowler &amp; Co.|Fowler]]) made their portable engines in the same style as traction engines, with the cylinder at the smokebox end. This was probably to reduce manufacturing costs, as there is no other obvious benefit of doing this. (Thomas Aveling realised that, for a traction engine, it would be better to position the flywheel within reach of the driver in case he carelessly allowed the crank to stop on top dead centre&lt;ref name=Lane3&gt;{{cite book | last =Lane | first =Michael R. | title =Pride of the Road | page =58}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where it could not self-start) and most other traction engine manufacturers followed this same idea.)

===Boiler===
This is usually a [[fire-tube boiler]] with a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]]-type [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]].  However, some designs (e.g. the [[Marshall, Sons &amp; Co.|Marshall]] "Britannia" (pictured)&lt;ref name=Powerhouse&gt;{{cite web | title =Marshall Britannia portable steam engine, 1914 | publisher =Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia | url =
http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/index.php?irn=211873&amp;search=steam+engine&amp;images=&amp;c=&amp;s= | accessdate =2008-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have [[Bagnall boiler|circular, marine-type, fireboxes]]. This latter type were also known by British manufacturers as 'colonial' boilers, as they were mainly intended for export to [[crown colony|'the Colonies']], and had a high ground clearance for travelling along rough tracks.&lt;ref name=Powerhouse/&gt;

Fuel is usually [[coal]] but the engine may be designed to use [[wood fuel]], straw or [[bagasse]] (sugar cane residue) instead.  A longer, circular firebox is particularly suitable for burning logs rather than shorter wood billets.&lt;ref name=Powerhouse/&gt;  Machines designed for wood-burning may be fitted with [[spark arrestor]]s.

===Engine===
Most portable engines are single-cylinder but two-cylinder engines were also built.  The [[D slide valve|slide valve]] is usually driven by a single [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] and no [[Valve gear|reversing gear]] is fitted. There is usually a belt-driven [[Governor (device)|governor]] to keep the engine running at constant speed, even if the load fluctuates.

The engine may have one or two flywheels mounted on the same crankshaft.  Where two are provided, they are mounted either side of the engine and may be of different diameters. A smaller flywheel provides a slower speed for farmyard work (e.g. chopping feedstuffs) than is required for driving a [[threshing machine]] (for example).

===Auxiliaries===
The crankshaft drives a [[boiler feedwater pump]] which draws water from a barrel placed alongside the engine. Many engines have a simple, but effective, [[feedwater heater]] which works by blowing a small portion of the exhaust steam into the water barrel. The barrel also acts as an oil separator. Oil in the exhaust steam rises to the top of the barrel and can be skimmed off.

===Chimney===
A tall chimney is provided to ensure a good draught for the fire. To permit negotiation of overhead obstacles, the chimney is hinged at its base, and is folded down for transport and storage. A suitably shaped bracket is usually provided towards the firebox end to support the chimney when folded.

===Wheels===
Most designs are fitted with four wheels and no suspension of any kind. The first portables had wooden wheels, but as the engines became more powerful (and heavier), fabricated steel wheels were fitted instead.

The 'front' wheels are normally smaller than those at the back. This is because they are mounted on the swivelling ''fore-carriage'', under the smokebox, and large wheels would be liable to hit the boiler when the engine was turned around a corner. An added bonus is that a larger diameter flywheel may be fitted, providing a more steady power output.

==Preservation==
[[File:Rew143-08 Foster Portable.jpg|thumb|A large Foster wood burning portable engine at Summerlee museum in Coatbridge]]

Many portable engines still survive, as they were built in large quantities and were shipped to many remote corners of the Earth. A substantial number of them have been preserved, with many restored to full working order: their relatively small size and simpler construction, compared to a [[traction engine]], makes them a much more viable proposition for restoration by the average enthusiast. (That is, provided the boiler is in reasonable condition: boiler repairs can be very expensive; replacement boilers even more so.)

It is usually possible to see portable engines working at traction engine rallies and steam festivals. At the [[Great Dorset Steam Fair]], for example, portable engines may be found in the relevant demonstration areas driving saw benches, threshing machines, rock crushers and other contemporary equipment.

Numerous agricultural and industrial museums include portable engines within their collections.

What is thought to be the oldest surviving [[Marshall, Sons &amp; Co.|Marshall]] product, works no. 415, a 2.5 [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|nhp]] portable from 1866, may be seen at the [[Turon Technology Museum]] (Museum of Power), in [[New South Wales]]. This engine is also the oldest ''documented'' portable in Australia.&lt;ref name=Turon&gt;{{cite web | title =Gallery 1 &amp;ndash; Steam engines | publisher =Turon Technology Museum (Museum of Power) | url =http://www.hermes.net.au/turon/gallery1.htm  | accessdate =2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Markov Inequality.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|The region of interest for which [[Markov's inequality]] gives a lower bound.]]
A '''region of interest''' (often abbreviated '''ROI'''), are samples within a [[data set]] identified for a particular purpose.&lt;ref name="Brinkmann1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Brinkmann|title=The Art and Science of Digital Compositing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSoUFSW56C4C&amp;pg=PA184|year=1999|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-133960-9|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a ROI is commonly used in many application areas. For example, in [[medical imaging]], the boundaries of a tumor may be defined on an image or in a volume, for the purpose of measuring its size. The endocardial border may be defined on an image, perhaps during different phases of the cardiac cycle, for example, end-systole and end-diastole, for the purpose of assessing cardiac function. In [[geographical information system]]s (GIS), a ROI can be taken literally as a polygonal selection from a 2D map. In [[computer vision]] and [[optical character recognition]], the ROI defines the [[edge detection|borders]] of an object under consideration. In many applications, symbolic (textual) labels are added to a ROI, to describe its content in a compact manner. Within a ROI may lie individual [[point of interest|points of interest]] (POIs). 

==Examples of regions of interest==
* 1D dataset: a time or frequency interval on a waveform
* 2D dataset: the boundaries of an object on an image
* 3D dataset: the contours or surfaces outlining an object (sometimes known as the '''Volume of Interest''' ('''VOI''')) in a volume
* 4D dataset: the outline of an object at or during a particular time interval in a time-volume

A ROI is a form of annotation, often associated with categorical or quantitative information (e.g., measurements like volume or mean intensity), expressed as text or in a structured form.

There are three fundamentally different means of encoding a ROI:
* As an integral part of the sample data set, with a unique or masking value that may or may not be outside the normal range of normally occurring values and which tags individual data cells
* As separate, purely graphic information, such as with vector or bitmap (rasterized) drawing elements, perhaps with some accompanying plain [[unstructured data|(unstructured)]] text in the format of the data itself
* As a separate structured [[semantic]] information (such as coded [[value type]]s) with a set of [[spatial coordinates|spatial]] and/or temporal coordinates

==Medical imaging==
[[File:Mammograms MED-SEG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The left image shows an original mammogram before MED-SEG processing. The image on the right, with region of interest (white) labeled, shows a mammogram after MED-SEG processing.]]
Medical imaging standards such as [[DICOM]] provide general and application-specific mechanisms to support various use-cases.

For DICOM images (two or more dimensions):
* Burned in graphics and text may occur within the normal [[pixel]] value range (e.g., as the maximum white value) (deprecated)
* Bitmap (rasterized) overlay graphics and text may be present in unused high bits of the pixel data or in a separate attribute (deprecated)
* Vector graphics may be encoded in separate image attributes as curves (deprecated)
* Unstructured vector graphics and text as well as bitmap (rasterized) overlay graphics may be encoded in a separate object as a presentation state that references the image object to which it is to be applied
* Structured data may be encoded in a separate object as a structured report in the form of a tree of name-value pairs of coded or text concepts possibly associated with derived quantitative information can reference spatial and/or temporal coordinates that in turn reference the image objects to which they apply
* Reference locations may be encoded as [[fiducial marker|fiducial]]s in the form of spatial coordinates with an associated coded purpose, either as pixel coordinates by reference to specific images or as coordinates in a named patient-relative 3D Cartesian space
* Pixels (possibly non-contiguous) may be classified into [[image segment|segments]] encoded in a segmentation object as either binary or probabilistic values in a raster (which is not required to have the same spatial sampling or extent as the images from which the segmentation was derived); these are usually referenced by other objects containing structured content (structured reports)

For DICOM radiotherapy:
* Contours of objects may be defined as structure sets, either as pixel coordinates by reference to specific images or as coordinates in a named patient-relative 3D Cartesian space (these are also used for non-RT applications)

For DICOM time-based waveforms:
* Burned in values may occur with the waveform (deprecated)
* Annotations may be encoded in a separate attribute can select multiple time points or a range of time points, either by sample number or specified time
* Structured data may be encoded in a separate object as a structured report in the form of a tree of name-value pairs of coded or text concepts possibly associated with derived quantitative information can reference temporal coordinates that in turn reference the waveform objects to which they apply

[[HL7]] [[Clinical Document Architecture]] also has a subset of mechanisms similar to (and intended to be compatible with) DICOM for referencing image-related spatial coordinates as observations; it allows for a circle, ellipse, [[polyline]] or point to be defined as integer pixel-relative coordinates referencing an external multi-media image object, which may be of a consumer rather than medical image format (e.g., a [[GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] or [[JPEG]]).

==Document analysis systems==
In [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) and [[Document Layout Analysis]], regions of interest (ROIs) hierarchically encompass pages, text or graphical blocks, down to individual line-strip images, word and character image boxes. The de facto standard in archives and libraries is the tuplet {image_file,xml_file}, usually in the form of a *.tif file and its accompanying *.xml file.

==Other 2D applications==
As far as non-medical standards are concerned, in addition to the purely graphic markup languages (such as [[PostScript]] or [[PDF]]) and vector graphic (such as [[SVG]]) and 3D (such as [[VRML]]) drawing file formats that are widely available, and which carry no specific ROI semantics, some standards such as [[JPEG 2000]] specifically provide mechanisms to label and/or compress to a different degree of fidelity, what they refer to as regions of interest.

'''Repeater insertion''' is a technique for reducing the time delay associated with long wire lines in integrated circuits. The technique involves cutting the long wire into one or more short wires and inserting a [[repeater]] between each new pair of short wires.

The time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of a wire to the other end is known as ''wire-line delay'' or just ''delay.''  In an integrated circuit, this delay is characterized by [[RC circuit|RC]], the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire (''R'') multiplied by the wire's [[capacitance]] (''C'').  Thus, if the wire's resistance is 100 [[ohm]]s and its capacitance is 0.01 [[Farad|microfarad]] (μF), the wire's delay is one [[microsecond]] (µs).

To first order, the resistance of a wire on an [[integrated circuit]] is [[directly proportional]], or ''linear'', according to the wire's length. If a 1&amp;nbsp;mm length of the wire has 100 ohms resistance, then a 2&amp;nbsp;mm length will have 200 ohms resistance.

For the purposes of our highly simplified discussion, the capacitance of a wire also increases linearly along its length.  If a 1&amp;nbsp;mm length of the wire has 0.01 µF capacitance, a 2&amp;nbsp;mm length of the wire will have 0.02 µF, a 3&amp;nbsp;mm wire will have 0.03 µF, and so on.

Thus, the [[Response time (technology)|time delay]] through a wire increases with the square of the wire's length.  This is true, to first order, for any wire whose cross-section remains constant along the length of the wire.

    '''wire   resistance  capacitance  time delay'''
   '''length       R           C            t'''
    1&amp;nbsp;mm     100 ohm      0.01 µF       1 µs
    2&amp;nbsp;mm     200 ohm      0.02 µF       4 µs
    3&amp;nbsp;mm     300 ohm      0.03 µF       9 µs

The interesting consequence of this behavior is that, while a single 2&amp;nbsp;mm length of wire has a delay of 4 µs, two separate 1&amp;nbsp;mm wires only have a delay of 1 µs each.  The two separate wires cover the same distance in half the time!  By cutting the wire in half, we can double its speed.

To make this magic trick work properly, an [[active component|active]] [[electronic circuit|circuit]] must be placed between the two separate wires so as to move the signal from one to the next.  An active circuit used for such a purpose is known as a ''[[repeater]].''  In a CMOS integrated circuit, the repeater is often a simple inverter.

Reducing the delay of a wire by cutting it in half and inserting a repeater is known as ''repeater insertion''.  The cost of this procedure is the additional new delay through the repeater itself, plus power cost because the repeater is an active circuit that must be powered, whereas the plain unrepeated wire was originally an unpowered [[passive component]].

For more details, see for example Anikreddy and Burleson's paper,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1022">In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''secondary frequency standard''' is a [[frequency standard]] that does not have inherent [[accuracy]], and therefore must be calibrated against a [[primary standard|primary frequency standard]]. 

Secondary standards include [[crystal oscillator]]s and [[rubidium standard]]s. A crystal oscillator depends for its frequency on its physical dimensions, which vary with fabrication and environmental conditions. A [[rubidium standard]] is a secondary standard even though it uses atomic transitions, because it takes the form of a gas cell through which an optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is passed. The gas cell has inherent inaccuracies because of gas pressure variations, including those induced by temperature variations. There are also variations in the concentrations of the required buffer gases, which variations cause frequency deviations.

In 1888 the ''''Smokeless Powder Company'''', owned by [[James Dalziel Dougall]] Junior, the son of the famous glaswegian gunsmith -J D Dougall, took a 99-year lease for 126 arces around 'The Outpost', from the Youngsbury Estate. The site's name was changed from 'The Outpost' to [[Barwick, Hertfordshire|Barwick]] and [[Barwick, Hertfordshire|Barwick]] was formed as a 'factory hamlet'.

The 'factory hamlet' was designed and superintend by the company's engineer [[Ernest Spon A.I.C.E]]. Mr Ernest Spon was well known for his civil engineering books, such as 'Workshop Receipts' and 'The Present Practice of Sinking and Boring Wells...'

The Smokeless Powder Company (S.P.C.) manufactured various high explosive powders for use in torpedoes, artillery shells, small arms ammunition (for the military and sporting) and mine blasting. The 'Smokeless Powder Company' was a world leader in its high explosive powders. S.P.C had over 100 employees at the factory.

On 26 May 1893, there was an explosion &amp; fire in one of the drying houses. As a result, company employees Mr A Aylott &amp; Mr A Ginn both died in this incident[4] The accident was thoroughly investigated by H.M. Chief Inspector of Explosives - Colonel V.D.Majendie C.B; on 20 June 1893.

In 1896 the Smokeless Powder Company, was purchased by the New Schultze Gunpowder Company Limited, located at Eyeworth, Fritham, Hampshire.[5] As a result of this sale, the company was renamed the Smokeless Powder &amp; Ammunition Company Limited in 1896. The company had two of Great Britain's greatest ballistics' experts working for it - Mr F W Jones &amp; Mr R W S Griffith. The Smokeless Powder &amp; Ammunition Company continued to produce high explosive powders until it ceased trading in circa 1910.

'''''The Mindy Project''''' was an American [[romantic comedy]] television series that premiered on [[Fox Television Network|Fox]] on September 25, 2012. It then began airing on [[Hulu]] on September 15, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/06/18/fox-announces-fail-premiere-dates-for-the-2012-2013-season-93501/20120618fox02|title=FOX Announces Fall Premiere Dates for the 2012–2013 Season|date=June 18, 2012|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series, created by and starring [[Mindy Kaling]], was co-produced by [[Universal Television]] and [[3 Arts Entertainment]].

On March 29, 2017, ''The Mindy Project'' was renewed for a sixth and final season, which premiered on September 12, 2017, and concluded on November 14, 2017.&lt;ref name="finalseason"/&gt;

==Plot==
The series follows [[obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician/gynecologist]] Mindy Lahiri ([[Mindy Kaling]]) as she tries to balance her personal and professional life,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2016/11/06/all-hail-the-rise-of-the-reasonably-competent-tv-heroine.html "All hail the rise of the reasonably competent TV heroine"]. ''Toronto Star'', November 5, 2016, Sophie Van Bastelaer.&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by quirky co-workers in a small medical practice in [[New York City]]. The character was inspired by Kaling's own mother, an OB/GYN. Mindy explores life with the help of her co-workers: Danny Castellano, her best friend and love interest, whose religious sensibilities occasionally cause some tension; Jeremy Reed, an [[England|English]] physician who manages the practice; Peter Prentice, another physician who was a [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|fraternity]] jock while attending [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]]; Morgan Tookers, a wacky, yet loveable registered nurse and an [[convict|ex-con]]; Tamra Webb, a blunt  nurse; and Beverley, the libidinous older office receptionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tvguide.com/special/fall-preview/PhotoGallery/Fall-TV-Watch-1050580/1050596|title=The Mindy Project Pictures – Photo Gallery: Fall TV: Must-Watch New Shows|journal=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was initially commissioned by [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]], but the pilot with the working title ''It's Messy'' was released from NBC's projects on January 27, 2012. NBC then sent the script to Fox executives who read it over that following weekend. On January 30, 2012, Fox greenlit the pilot, with [[Mindy Kaling]] attached to star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/will-nbc-be-responsible-for-foxs-next-hit-series-how-hot-comedy-jumped-networks|title=Will ABC Be Responsible For Fox's Next Hit Series?

On October 8, 2012, Fox ordered a full season of ''The Mindy Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|title='Ben and Kate' &amp; 'The Mindy Project' Get Full Season Orders|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/08/ben-kate-the-mindy-project-get-full-season-orders/151994/|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=October 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010234124/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/08/ben-kate-the-mindy-project-get-full-season-orders/151994/|archivedate=October 10, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2013, the series was renewed for a second season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=seat42f.com|title=FOX Renews NEW GIRL, THE MINDY PROJECT And RAISING HOPE|url=http://www.seat42f.com/fox-renews-new-girl-the-mindy-project-and-raising-hope.html|accessdate=March 4, 2013|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began on September 17, 2013.

Casting announcements for the remaining series regular roles began in February 2012, with [[Ed Weeks]] cast in the role of Dr. Jeremy Reed, a sexy, British doctor in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/02/17/development-update-friday-february-17-319110/9636/|title=Development Update: Friday, February 17|work=The Futon Critic|date=February 17, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoe Jarman]] and [[Dana Delorenzo]] then joined in series regular roles. Jarman signed on to play Betsy Putch, an upbeat receptionist at the practice; whilst Delorenzo joined as Shauna Dicanio, a young, party loving receptionist in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/several-more-actors-cast-in-broadcast-pilots/|title=Several More Actors Cast In Broadcast Pilots|work=Deadline.com|date=March 8, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-March, [[Chris Messina]] joined the cast as Dr. Danny Castellano, an arrogant doctor who works at the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/03/12/development-update-monday-march-12-406102/9662/|title=Development Update: Monday, March 12|work=The Futon Critic|date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, [[Anna Camp]] boarded the series as Gwen Grandy, a stay-at-home mom and  Mindy's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/03/14/anna-camp-fox-kaling-benanti-nbc-go-on/|title=Pilot Castings: Anna Camp Joins Mindy Kaling Comedy, Laura Benanti Will Go On and More|work=TV Line|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014|first=Vlada|last=Gelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, [[Amanda Setton]], [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] and [[Ike Barinholtz]] joined the series. Setton replaced Dana DeLorenzo in the role of Shauna; Tobolowsky joined in the series regular role of Dr. Marc Shulman, the senior partner of the practice; and Barinholtz signed onto the recurring role of Morgan Tookers, a quirky rehabilitated ex-con  who joins the practice as a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/tobolowsky-joins-mindy-project-1118056456/|title=Tobolowsky joins ‘Mindy Project’|work=Variety|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014|first=Jon|last=Weisman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cast changes===

The first change occurred when [[Stephen Tobolowsky]]'s role was eliminated after the second episode – following re-shoots that saw his character be re-written into a mere authoritarian figure in the office – when it was decided that "they didn't really want Mindy to have a boss in the office".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/the-mindy-project-says-goodbye-to-stephen-tobolowsky|title=The Mindy Project says goodbye to Stephen Tobolowsky|work=HitFix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobolowsky returned, albeit in a voice-over only role, in the eighth episode to explain that his character had retired. The second change of the season, which was first reported on November 20, 2012, saw Amanda Setton's role also eliminated entirely and Anna Camp downgraded to a recurring cast member. They both departed after the twelfth episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/a-regular-role-cut-another-downgraded-to-recurring-on-foxs-the-mindy-project|title=A Regular Role Cut, Another Downgraded To Recurring On Fox's ‘The Mindy Project’|work=Deadline.com |last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite becoming a recurring cast member, Camp only made a single appearance in the seventeenth episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20130305fox04/|title=Listings – TheFutonCritic.com – The Web's Best Television Resource|work=thefutoncritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Setton or Camp's characters had their absence referenced, nor were they mentioned again.

The first change for the second season, which occurred before production of the season began, saw [[Xosha Roquemore]] upgraded to a series regular role after recurring in the final three episodes of the previous season.&lt;ref name="newregular"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/xosha-roquemore-joins-mindy-project-as-new-regular-kevin-durand-in-the-strain|title=Xosha Roquemore Joins ‘Mindy Project’ As New Regular, Kevin Durand In ‘The Strain’|work=Deadline.com|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second change, which occurred just prior to the production of the season's fifth episode, resulted in [[Adam Pally]] also being upgraded to a series regular role. He had previously signed onto the series in a recurring role but had filmed only two episodes prior to being promoted.&lt;ref name="regularpromotion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2013/09/18/adam-pally-the-mindy-project-season-2-regular|title=The Mindy Project Scoop: Happy Endings' Adam Pally Upped to Series Regular|work=TV Line|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first change of the third season occurred prior to the start of production and saw Zoe Jarman's role eliminated from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Ausiello |url=http://tvline.com/2014/04/30/the-mindy-project-season-3-zoe-jarman-leaving-as-betsy-putch/ |title=‘The Mindy Project’ Season 3: Zoe Jarman Leaving as Betsy Putch |publisher=TVLine |date=April 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Setton and Camp's departures in the first season, the absence of her character was never addressed. The second cast change of the season was announced on November 21, 2014, and saw Adam Pally leave the series after the season's thirteenth episode. His departure after the thirteenth episode of the season was a condition of his upgrade to a series regular that had occurred the previous year. It was reported that Pally is "expected to make occasional guest appearances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/11/21/adam-pally-leaving-the-mindy-project-season-3-peter/|title=Adam Pally Leaving ‘The Mindy Project’ in Season 3 — Peter Prentice – TVLine|author=Michael Ausiello|work=TVLine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pally made multiple guest appearances after his departure, where he was still credited amongst the regular cast in episodes he appeared, making his final appearance as a part of the main cast in the third-season finale.

In December 2015 it was reported that [[Fortune Feimster]] had been upgraded to a series regular role beginning with the fourteenth episode of the fourth season, after appearing in seven of the first thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name="tvline.com"&gt;http://tvline.com/2015/12/18/mindy-project-fortune-feimster-series-regular-season-4/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garret Dillahunt]] joined the show in a major recurring role as Dr. Jody Kimball-Kinney.&lt;ref&gt;http://deadline.com/2015/07/mindy-project-garret-dillahunt-cast-recurring-doctor-hulu-1201486029/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, it was announced that [[Chris Messina]] would not be returning as a series regular for season five, but will instead appear as a guest star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/06/07/the-mindy-project-chris-messina-season-5-danny/|title=Mindy Project: Chris Messina Returning for Season 5 But Not as a Series Regular|author=Michael Ausiello|work=TVLine|date=June 7, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''The Mindy Project'' received positive reviews from critics, with many highlighting Kaling's performance and her unique character, as well as the writing and directing.&lt;ref name="MetaSeason 1"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Mindy Project: Season 1|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-mindy-project|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season has a rating of 81%, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10.

Season 4 of the show holds a rating of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes with the critical consensus reading, "''The Mindy Project'' begins its online migration with some of the show's best-ever episodes, further refining the balance between heart and humor struck during the first three seasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_mindy_project/s04 |title=The Mindy Project: Season 4|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Metacritic the season has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-mindy-project/season-4|title=The Mindy Project Season 4 reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
''The Mindy Project'' has been the object of intense scrutiny not only from traditional media forms but also from feminists and people of color, who often weigh in on the show's decisions in casting and writing. At the end of the first season, [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] posted an article called "Mindy Kaling Only Makes Out with White Guys",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/mindy-kaling-only-makes-out-with-white-guys-on-the-mind-504732390|title=Mindy Kaling Only Makes Out With White Guys on The Mindy Project|author=Dodai Stewart|work=Jezebel}}&lt;/ref&gt; a critique of the casting of romantic leads on the show. The same article contains a response from Nisha Chittal, who has defended Kaling's success in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racialicious.com/2012/09/20/a-reaction-to-the-backlash-against-mindy-kaling/|title=A Reaction To The Backlash Against Mindy Kaling|work=racialicious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who applauded the show for not making Kaling's race central to her character, and for showing that an Indian woman could date non-Indian men.

During the second season, the episode "Mindy Lahiri Is a Racist" provoked discussion as to whether or not Kaling had made "reparations" for showing a predominantly white cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/9309-the-mindy-projects-controversial-episode-on-race-didnt-clear-up-any-concerns%7ctitle=Bustle%7cwork=bustle.com|title=Bustle|work=bustle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the third season began airing, Kaling was criticized for a comment in a ''[[Flare (magazine)|Flare]]'' article entitled "She's the Boss",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flare.com/celebrity/cover-girls/running-the-show-mindy-kaling/|title=FLARE's October Cover Star is... Mindy Kaling!&amp;nbsp;– Flare|author=Flare Staff|work=Flare}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she stated that the show would not address abortion, as "it would be demeaning to the topic to talk about it in a half-hour sitcom." In an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' two weeks later, she clarified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of women look to me and look to the show, and they want me to be a spokesperson for a lot of issues, and I actually think that's a responsibility that's cool, I want to live up to that ... I want to be able to talk plainly on things but I also want to create an entertaining show. We haven't found a hilarious take on abortion that has not been done yet—but we might. I have faith in us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a31135/mindy-kaling-abortion-controversy/|title=Mindy Kaling Addresses the "Mindy Project" Abortion Controversy on Colbert|author=Patti Greco|work=Cosmopolitan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Timed Text Markup Language''' ('''TTML'''), previously referred to as '''Distribution Format Exchange Profile''' ('''DFXP'''), is one of [[W3C]]'s standards regulating [[timed text]] on the [[internet]].

{{Quote|text=“TTML is used in the television industry for the purpose of authoring, transcoding and exchanging timed text information and for delivering captions, subtitles, and other metadata for television material repurposed for the Web or, more generally, the Internet.

There is partial and full support of TTML in components used by several Web browsers plugins, and in a number of caption authoring tools.”|sign=[https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml1/#media-types-registration Timed Text Markup Language 1 (TTML1) (Second Edition)]}}

In 2010, after discussions about its adoption in HTML5, [[WHATWG]] opted for a new but more lightweight standard based on the popular [[SubRip|SRT]] format, now named [[WebVTT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol10/html/Tai01/BalisageVol10-Tai01.html
 |title=WebVTT versus TTML: XML considered harmful for web captions?
 |accessdate=16 February 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in February 2012 the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] declared the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] closed-captioning standard for online video content, a superset of TTML, as a "safe harbor interchange, delivery format".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smpte.org/news-events/news-releases/fcc-declares-smpte-closed-captioning-standard-online-video-content-safe |title=FCC Declares SMPTE Closed-Captioning Standard For Online Video Content As Safe Harbor Interchange, Delivery Format |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether the HTML5 specification will document the usage of any other timed text format with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;track&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. However, as of February 2015, W3C only documents the usage of WebVTT with HTML5 and its specification had 434 entries in its commit history, ranging from March 2013 to January 2015, while the latest TTML specification hadn't been modified since September 2013. Recent versions of [[Internet Explorer]] introduced support for TTML files in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;track&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.microsoft.com/Testdrive/HTML5/Captions/Default.html |title=Simple Delivery Profile for TTML Captions |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other browsers still require [[JavaScript]], such as in the W3C Timed Text Working Group's [http://www.w3.org/2009/02/ThisIsCoffee.html 2009 demo] of TTML features. TTML is still the format of choice for some applications that don't rely on HTML5, such as the popular [[set-top box]] [[Roku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Closed+Caption+Support
 |title=Roku Closed Caption Support
 |accessdate=16 February 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profiles ==
The TTML standard specifies a wide range of features, many of which are not necessary for specific applications. For this reason, the standard developed the concept of profiles, which are subsets of required features from the full specification. This way, a player that only implements a partial set of features, for example, can define its own profile and claim support to it. The specification was thus renamed to TTML, accounting only to the markup language, and defined three standard profiles: DFXP Transformation, DFXP Presentation and DFXP Full. Not satisfied with the list of features defined by TTML, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) created its own profile, which extended the full DFXP profile and defined new features, not included in the TTML specification.

=== DFXP Transformation ===
This profile defines the minimum feature requirements that a transformation processor (e.g. caption converter) needs to support in order to be considered TTML compliant.

=== DFXP Presentation ===
This profile defines the minimum feature requirements that a presentation processor (e.g. video player) needs to support in order to be considered TTML compliant.

=== DFXP Full ===
This profile requires the support of all the feature defined by TTML specification.

=== SMPTE-TT ===
This profile extends the TTML and with three SMPTE-specific elements aimed at legacy formats. Interoperability with pre-existing and regionally-specific formats (such as CEA-708, CEA-608, DVB Subtitles, and
WST (World System Teletext)) is provided by means of [[tunneling protocol|tunneling]] data or bit map images and adding necessary metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.smpte.org/sites/default/files/st2052-1-2010.pdf |title=SMPTE Timed Text Format (SMPTE ST 2052-1:2010) |date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transceiver''' is a device comprising both a [[transmitter]] and a [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] that are combined and share common circuitry or a single housing. When no circuitry is common between transmit and receive functions, the device is a transmitter-receiver. The term originated in the early 1920s. Similar devices include [[transponder]]s, [[transverter]]s, and [[repeater]]s.

==Radio technology==
{{Main article|Two-way radio}}
[[File:Icom.png|thumb|A modern [[High frequency|HF]] transceiver with [[spectrum analyzer]] and [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] capabilities]]

In [[radio]] terminology, a transceiver means a unit which contains both a receiver and a transmitter. From the beginning days
of radio the receiver and transmitter were separate units and remained so until around 1920. [[Amateur radio]] or "ham" radio operators can build their own equipment and it is now easier to design and build a simple unit containing both of the functions: transmitting and receiving. Almost all modern amateur radio equipment is now a transceiver but there is an active market for pure radio receivers, mainly for shortwave listening (SWL) operators. An example of a transceiver would be a [[walkie-talkie]] or a [[CB radio]].

[[File:PXE.jpg|thumb|A decapped integrated circuit of a transceiver used in handheld communication devices and radio equipment as modem extension. 
On die passfilters are visible]]

==Telephony==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Headphones]]. --&gt;
On a wired [[telephone]], the handset contains the transmitter and receiver for the [[Sound reproduction|audio]] and in the 20th century was usually wired to the base unit by [[tinsel wire]].  The whole unit is colloquially referred to as a "receiver".  On a [[mobile telephone]] or other [[radiotelephone]], the entire unit is a transceiver, for both audio and radio.

A [[cordless telephone]] uses an audio and radio transceiver for the handset, and a radio transceiver for the [[base station]]. If a [[speakerphone]] is included in a wired telephone base or in a cordless base station, the base also becomes an audio transceiver in addition to the handset.

A [[modem]] is similar to a transceiver, in that it sends and receives a signal, but a modem uses modulation and demodulation. It modulates a signal being transmitted and demodulates a signal being received.

==Ethernet==

Transceivers are called [[Transmission medium|Medium]] Attachment Units ([[Medium Attachment Unit|MAU]]s) in [[IEEE 802.3]] documents and were widely used in [[10BASE2]] and [[10BASE5]] [[Ethernet]] networks. [[Fiber-optic]] [[gigabit Ethernet|gigabit]], [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]], [[40 Gigabit Ethernet]], and [[100 Gigabit Ethernet]] utilize transceivers known as [[GBIC]], [[SFP transceiver|SFP]], [[SFP+]], [[QSFP]], [[XFP]], [[XAUI]], [[CXP_(connector)|CXP]], and [[C Form-factor Pluggable|CFP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10702">'''TransferJet''' is a close proximity wireless transfer technology initially proposed by [[Sony]] and demonstrated publicly in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/200801/08-002E/index.html|title=Sony develops TransferJet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By touching (or bringing very close together) two electronic devices, TransferJet allows high speed exchange of data. The concept of TransferJet consists of a touch-activated interface which can be applied for applications requiring high-speed data transfer between two devices in a peer-to-peer mode without the need for external physical connectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transferjet.org/tj/transferjet_overview.pdf|title=TransferJet Expanded White Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TransferJet's maximum physical layer transmission rate is 560 Mbit/s. After allowing for error correction and other protocol overhead, the effective maximum throughput is 375 Mbit/s. TransferJet will adjust the data rate downward according to the wireless environment, thereby maintaining a robust link even when the surrounding wireless condition fluctuates.

TransferJet has the capability of identifying the unique [[MAC Address|MAC]] addresses of individual devices, enabling users to choose which devices can establish a connection.  By allowing only devices inside the household, for example, one can prevent data theft from strangers while riding a crowded train.  If, on the other hand, one wishes to connect the device with any other device at a party, this can be done by simply disabling the filtering function.

TransferJet uses the same frequency spectrum as [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but occupies only a section of this band available as a common worldwide channel.  Since the RF power is kept under -70 dBm/MHz, it can operate in the same manner as that of UWB devices equipped with [[Detect and Avoid|DAA]] functionality.  In addition, this low power level also ensures that there will be no interference to other wireless systems, including other TransferJet systems, operating nearby.

By reducing the RF power and spatial reach down to a few centimeters (about an inch or less), a TransferJet connection in its most basic mode does not require any initial setup procedure by the user for either device, and the action of spontaneously touching one device with another will automatically trigger the data transfer.  More complex usage scenarios will require various means to select the specific data to send as well as the location to store (or method to process) the received data.

TransferJet utilizes a newly developed '''TransferJet Coupler''' based on the principle of electric induction field as opposed to radiation field for conventional antennas. The functional elements of a generic TransferJet Coupler consist of a coupling electrode or plate, a resonant stub and ground.  Compared to conventional radiating antennas, the TransferJet Coupler achieves higher transmission gain and more efficient coupling in the near-field while providing sharp attenuation at longer distances.  Because the Coupler generates longitudinal electric fields, there is no polarization and the devices can be aligned at any angle.

Although sometimes confused with [[Near Field Communication]], TransferJet depends on an entirely different technology and is also generally targeted for different usage scenarios focusing on high-speed data transfer.  Thus these two systems will not interfere with each other and can even co-exist in the same location, as already implemented in certain products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644784015|title=Sony VAIO F Series Laptop with TransferJet/FeliCa dual function}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other recent products combine TransferJet with wireless power to allow both data transfer and wireless charging capability simultaneously in the same location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20120201/204246/|title=Sony's New Camera Supports Wireless Power Transmission, TransferJet}}&lt;/ref&gt; TransferJet, NFC and wireless power are the three major near-field (contact-less) technologies that are expected to eliminate the physical connections and cables currently required to interface devices with each other.

The '''TransferJet Consortium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transferjet.org/news/press/200807_001.html|title=TransferJet Consortium established}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in July 2008 to advance and promote the TransferJet Format, by developing the technical specifications and compliance testing procedures as well as creating a market for TransferJet-compliant, interoperable products.  In September 2011, the consortium was registered as an independent non-profit industry association. As of June 2015, the Consortium is led by five Promoter companies, consisting of: [[Japan Radio Company|JRC]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Sony]] (consortium administrator), and [[Toshiba]]. The Consortium currently also has around thirty Adopter companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transferjet.org/about_cons/index.html|title=About TransferJet Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The TransferJet regular typeface and TransferJet logos are trademarks managed and licensed by the TransferJet Consortium.

Commercial products have been introduced since January 2010 and the initial product categories include digital cameras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644770498|title=Digital Still Camera}}&lt;/ref&gt; laptop PCs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644784015|title=Laptop PC}}&lt;/ref&gt; USB cradle accessories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iodata.jp/product/mobile/cable/usb2-tjc/|title=USB Cradle Accessory}}&lt;/ref&gt; USB dongle accessories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.toshiba.co.jp/p-media/transferjet/index_j.htm |title=Dongle Accessories for USB, microUSB and Lightning}}&lt;/ref&gt; and office/business equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/05/12/discussion-table-pioneers-awesome-take-on-microsofts-surface-video//|title=Discussion Table}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance testing equipment is provided by Agilent technologies and certification services are offered by Allion Test Labs.  The first commercially available TransferJet development platform for embedded systems was launched by Icoteq Ltd in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icoteq.com/product/transferjet-i-mx6q-hardware-development-platform/ |title=Hardware Development Platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smartphones with integrated TransferJet functionality were launched in June 2015 from [[Fujitsu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/product/smart_phone/f04g/ |title=Hardware Fujitsu smartphone model: ARROWS NX F-04G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bkav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vneconomictimes.com/article/business/bphone-officially-launched  |title=BKAV smartphone model: BPhone }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other product vendors include [[Melco|Buffalo]] and [[E-Globaledge]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.e-globaledge.com/english/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''TransferJet X'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.transferjet.org/news/press/PR-E-IEEE802153e_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a new second-generation TransferJet specification capable of data transfer speeds of 13.1 Gbit/sec and above, or about 20 times the speed of current TransferJet. This specification uses the 60&amp;nbsp;GHz band and requires only 2&amp;nbsp;msec or less to establish a connection prior to the actual data transfer, thereby enabling the exchange of large content files even in the short amount of time it takes, for example, for a person to walk through a wicket gate. The TransferJet Consortium is currently defining the details of the TransferJet X ecosystem, based on the IEEE 802.15.3e standard&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techstreet.com/ieee/standards/ieee-802-15-3e-2017?product_id=1922221&lt;/ref&gt; completed and published in June 2017. The HRCP Research and Development Partnership&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrcp.jp/en/&lt;/ref&gt;, established in 2016, is developing an [[System on a chip|SoC]] solution for implementing TransferJet X in a variety of products and services to be released starting around 2020.

'''Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing''' ('''TRPS''') is a technique that allows high-throughput single particle measurements as colloids and/or biomolecular analytes driven through a size-tunable [[nanopore]], one at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Dynamically resizable nanometre-scale apertures for molecular sensing"; Stephen J. Sowerby, Murray F. Broom, George B. Petersen; Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical Volume 123, Issue 1 (2007), pages 325-330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel et al. (2011) "Quantitative Sizing of Nano/Microparticles with a Tunable Elastomeric Pore Sensor" Journal of Analytical Chemistry 83 (9), pp 3499–3506&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique adapts the principle of resistive pulse-sensing, which monitors current flow through an aperture, combined with the use of tunable nanopore technology, allowing the passage of ionic current and particles to be regulated by adjusting the pore size.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts et al. (2010) "Tunable Nano/Micropores for Particle Detection and Discrimination: Scanning Ion Occlusion Spectroscopy" Small - Volume 6, Issue 23, pp 2653–2658&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willmott et al. (2010) "Use of tunable nanopore blockade rates to investigate colloidal dispersions" J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 22, 45411&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Scanning Ion Occlusion Sensing.png|thumb|Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing (TRPS). Particles crossing a pore are detected as a transient change in the ionic current flow, which is denoted as a blockade event with its amplitude denoted as the blockade magnitude.]]

== Technique ==
Particles crossing a pore are detected one at a time as a transient change in the ionic current flow, which is denoted as a blockade event with its amplitude denoted as the blockade magnitude. As blockade magnitude is proportional to particle size, accurate particle sizing can be achieved after calibration with a known standard.

Nanopore-based detection allows particle-by-particle assessment of complex mixtures. Optimization of pore size to particle size, by adjusting the stretch of the pore, can improve measurement accuracy.

Through combination with fine-control of pressure TRPS has been used to determine sample concentration &lt;ref&gt;Willmott, G. R., Yu, S.S.C. and Vogel, R., “Pressure Dependence of Particle Transport Through Resizable Nanopores”&amp;nbsp;Proceedings of ICONN, 128-131 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Seth Roberts, Sam Yu, Qinglu Zeng, Leslie C.L. Chan, Will Anderson, Aaron H. Colby, Mark W. Grinstaff, Steven Reid, Robert Vogel. “Tunable Pores for Measuring Concentrations of Synthetic and Biological Nanoparticle Dispersions”&amp;nbsp;Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 31 pp. 17-25, &amp;nbsp;(2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and to accurately derive particle electrophoretic mobility &amp; surface charge&lt;ref&gt;"A variable pressure method for characterising nanoparticle surface charge using pore sensors"&amp;nbsp;Robert Vogel, Will Anderson, James Eldridge, Ben Glossop, and Geoff Willmott.

== Applications ==
TRPS has been applied in product development by nanotechnology instrument manufacturers [[Izon Science|Izon Science Ltd]] in the first commercially available nanopore-based particle characterization systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.prlog.org/10264926-izon-launch-worlds-first-commercial-nanopore-platform.html | work=PRLog | title=IZON launch world's first commercial nanopore platform | date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems have been applied to measure a wide range of biological and synthetic particle types including viruses and nanoparticles. TRPS has been applied in both academic and industrial research fields, including:
*[[Drug delivery]] research
*[[Microvesicles|Microvesicle]] and [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosome]]s
*[[Virology]] and [[vaccine]] production
*[[biosensor|Biomedical diagnostics]]

A '''Vertebrae Bend Restrictor (VBR)''' is used in the [[oil and gas industry]] as part of [[Offshore drilling|offshore deep sea drilling]] operations. It is designed to prevent damage to an [[umbilical cable]] from overbending. It offsets the action of applied loads which could kink or buckle the internal conduits of an umbilical, cable, flexible riser pipe or MUX line.

Most people in the subsea industry have never seen a VBR break during testing or regular use, but manufacturers of VBRs occasionally [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WydiiBqer0Y&amp;feature=youtube_gdata test VBR assemblies] to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUXOvnc46t8 ultimate failure].
