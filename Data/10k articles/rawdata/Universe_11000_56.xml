'''(''E'')-Stilbene''', commonly known as '''''trans''-stilbene''', is an [[organic compound]] represented by the [[condensed structural formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  Classified as a [[diarylethene]], it features a central [[ethylene]] [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] with one [[phenyl]] group [[substituent]]s on each end of the carbon&amp;ndash;carbon [[double bond]].  It has an [[(E)|(''E'')]] stereochemistry, meaning that the phenyl groups are located on opposite sides of the double bond, the opposite of its [[geometric isomer]], [[cis-stilbene|''cis''-stilbene]].  ''Trans''-stilbene occurs as a white crystalline solid at room temperature and is highly soluble in organic solvents.  It can be converted to ''cis''-stilbene [[photochemistry|photochemically]], and further reacted to produce [[phenanthrene]].

Stilbene was discovered in 1843 by the French chemist [[Auguste Laurent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurent|first1=Auguste|title=Mémoire sur la série stilbique|journal=Comptes rendus|date=1843|volume=16|pages=856–860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzEt49manA8C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|trans-title=Memoir on the stilbene series|language=French}}  From p. 857:  ''"En  soumettant ce sulfure à la distillation, il donne plusieurs produits, et entre autres, un composé fort remarquable que je nomme ''stilbène''."''
(On submitting this sulfide [i.e., phenyl thioaldehyde, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CS)H] to [dry] distillation, it gives several products, and among others, a very remarkable compound which I name "stilbene".)&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "stilbene" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''στίλβω'' (''stilbo''), which means "I shine", on account of the lustrous appearance of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=William Allen|title=Elements of Chemistry: Theoretical and Practical|date=1880|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London, England|page=366|volume=vol. 3|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4kMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA366#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isomers==
[[File:Cis-trans-stilbene.svg|center|400px|thumb|The isomerization of stilbene under the influence of radiation.]]
Stilbene exists as two possible [[stereoisomer]]s. One is ''trans''-1,2-diphenylethylene, called (''E'')-stilbene or ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]''-stilbene. The second is ''cis''-1,2-diphenylethylene, called [[(Z)-Stilbene|(''Z'')-stilbene]] or ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]''-stilbene, and is [[sterically hindered]] and less stable because the steric interactions force the aromatic rings out-of-plane and prevent [[Conjugated system|conjugation]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} ''Cis''-stilbene is a liquid at room temperature (melting point: {{convert|5|–|6|C}}), while ''trans''-stilbene is a crystalline solid which does not melt until around {{convert|125|C}}, illustrating the two isomers have significantly different physical properties.&lt;ref name = OrgSynthCis&gt;{{OrgSynth|first1 = Robert E.|last1 = Buckles|first2 = Norris G.|last2 = Wheeler|title = ''cis''-Stilbene|year = 1953|volume = 33|pages = 88|doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.033.0088|prep = CV4P0857|collvol = 4|collvolpages = 857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = OrgSynthTrans /&gt;

==Preparation and reactions==
Many syntheses have been developed.  One popular route entails reduction of [[Benzoin (organic compound)|benzoin]] using zinc amalgam.&lt;ref name = OrgSynthTrans&gt;{{OrgSynth|first1 = R.

Stilbene undergoes reactions typical of alkenes.  ''Trans''-stilbene undergoes epoxidation with [[peroxymonophosphoric acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, producing a 74% yield of ''trans''-stilbene oxide in [[dioxane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Oxidation of ''trans''-stilbene with peroxymonophosphoric acid|first1 = Yoshiro|last1 = Ogata|first2 = Kohtaro|last2 = Tomizawa|first3 = Toshiyuki|last3 = Ikeda|journal = [[J.

For example, using [[tert-butyl hydroperoxide|''tert''-butyl hydroperoxide]], oxidation of ''cis''-stilbene produces 0.8% ''cis''-stilbene oxide, 13.5% ''trans''-stilbene oxide, and 6.1% [[benzaldehyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Olefin Epoxidation by Alkyl Hydroperoxide with a Novel Cross-Bridged Cyclam Manganese Complex:  Demonstration of Oxygenation by Two Distinct Reactive Intermediates|first1 = Guochuan|last1 = Yin|first2 = Andrew M.|last2 = Danby|first3 = David|last3 = Kitko|first4 = John D.|last4 = Carter|first5 = William M.|last5 = Scheper|first6 = Daryle H.|last6 = Busch|authorlink6 = Daryle H.

The '''1995 Daegu gas explosions''' was a gas explosion that occurred at [[Daegu Metro Line 1]], a construction site located in [[Sangin-dong]], [[Daegu]], [[South Korea]], on 28 April 1995. At least 101 people, including 42 Yeoungnam Middle School students were killed with as many as 202 people injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last= |first=|date=29 April 1995|title=어째서 또 이런일이... 大邱 가스폭발 百여명 사망|url=http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?editNo=20&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1995-04-29&amp;officeId=00032&amp;pageNo=1&amp;printNo=15410&amp;publishType=00010&amp;articleId=1995042900329101001|publisher=''[[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]''|access-date=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The event occurred on April 28th, 1995 at 7:52 am in the underground construction site of the 2nd Section of the Sagley Subway Line 2 at [[Yeungnam High School|Nam High School]] in Sangin-dong, Dalseo-gu, Daegu Metropolitan City. Construction work at the Daegu Store (대구점) in Buk-gu, Daegu, of the [[Lotte Department Store]] chain, where 31 holes of 75 millimeter width that were going through a grout curtain were accidentally drilled through a city gas pipeline and resulted in gas leakages into the subway construction site through a nearby sewer lead to the explosion due to an unknown fire at the site. The explosion created a 50-meter pillar of fire. The accident killed 101 people, including 42 students, and injured 202. The 400-meter-long private parking lot on the construction site collapsed, and 60 buildings and 152 cars were damaged and the damage reached 54 billion won.

== Cause ==
* In case of underground excavation at a large construction site, it is necessary to contact the company that buried the gas pipe after inquiring about the position where the gas pipe is buried after obtaining permission from the relevant government office for road excavation. This was the reason for the incident.

* It was not until 30 minutes after the gas pipe was destroyed that it was reported to the city gas department and the damage was further increased.

== Result ==
The damage caused by the accident occurred during the school day.
* 101 deaths (including 42 students at Youngnam middle school, 1 teacher, 2 police officers ), 202 injured
* Damage to 152 vehicles, damage to 60 houses, damage to buildings, 346 cases

== Aftermath ==
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which was set up to deal with the incident, discovered that it was an accident caused by negligence in the development of the Daegu Department Store, which was responsible for the construction of the Daegu Department Store, and arrested nine employees of the company on charges of business misconduct. received. Of course, excavator operation was also included.

This accident led to the necessity of computerized capitals for underground cargoes, the criticism of the authorities on safety management administration, the increase of the voice of the government and the public on the improvement of the emergency rescue system and integrated structure system, A countermeasure mechanism was established centering on the revision of related laws such as city gas business law.
* Cause: Establishment of a special safety inspection team, early construction of a mapping system for underground materials, mandatory pre-consultation with a gas company in road excavation and occupancy, mandatory to carry gas detectors to detect gas leaks,
* Surveillance aspect: Unification of field command, reinforcement of rescue equipments, training of professional manpower, distribution to the city hospital after emergency hospital treatment, establishment of press center and systematic promotion measures, quick and accurate reporting of accident scene Etc

== Controversy ==
One housewife claimed to have reported the smell of gas four hours before the accident, but that night she said "I wanted to be on TV and lied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last= |first=|date=29 April 1995|title=어째서 또 이런일이... 大邱 가스폭발 百여명 사망|url=http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1995050500209130003&amp;editNo=45&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1995-05-05&amp;officeId=00020&amp;pageNo=30&amp;printNo=22845&amp;publishType=00010|publisher=''[[The Dong-A Ilbo]]''|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hashan Park Memorial Tower ==
There is a monument in Wolsung - dong Hashan Park in Dalseo - gu, Daegu Metropolitan City .

On April 28, 2005, the last memorial service was held. The memorial ceremony was the last official memorial ceremony on this day. At the ceremony, about 500 people including family members and citizens attended the ceremony and prayed for the victims' souls.

The '''Alaska Interconnection''' (ASCC) is an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[power transmission]] grid in [[North America]] that serves Central and [[Southeast Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bedes.lbl.gov/bedes-online/egrid-region-code|title=eGRID Region Code - BEDES|website=Bedes.lbl.gov|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Alaska Interconnection is often referred to as one interconnected grid, its two parts are not connected to each other through [[Electric power transmission|interties]], nor are the two grids connected to any other interconnection, making the grids in Alaska isolated circuits. Both grids, though, are managed by the [[Alaska Systems Coordinating Council]] as if they were one entity like the other interconnections in North America. 

== Production ==
The Alaska Interconnection is the smallest individual power transmission grid in North America compared to the three other major interconnections--the [[Western Interconnection]], the [[Eastern Interconnection]], and the [[Texas Interconnection]]--both in physical area and electricity generated. In 2015, the Alaska interconnection generated 2,601 [[gigawatt]] hours of electricity, with natural gas accounting for 1,219 GWh, while the US State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] alone--part of the [[Western Interconnection]]--generated 47,385 GWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/power-plants/|title=Mapping how the United States generates its electricity|website=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both parts of the Alaska Interconnection have no connection to remaining interconnections of North America, all generating units connected to both of its grids generate at a synchronous speed of 60 [[Hz]], the frequency common to North America. Electricity is also delivered to homes and small businesses in the same manner as in [[Canada]] and the contiguous [[United States]] with a [[split-phase]] 240/120 volt service.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/alaska/electricity&lt;/ref&gt;

== Isolation from other power grids ==
In 2014, an intertie to the Western Interconnection of [[British Columbia]] was proposed to the [[Alaska Energy Authority]] in order to bring cleaner cheaper power to Alaska, but as of 2016, no further work on the project had been completed due to economic feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akenergyauthority.org/Content/Policy/RegionalPlanning/Documents/AK-BCTransIntertieReport033114.pdf|format=PDF|title=An Alaska-British Columbia Transmission Intertie Review of Previous Studies and Economic Evaluation in Light of Current Conditions|website=Akenergyauthority.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact to cost ===
Because the transmission networks in Alaska are isolated from other interconnections in North America, average rates for electricity are $0.18 per [[kWh]] - the second highest price in the United States after Hawaii, whose average residential rate is $0.37 per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricitylocal.com/states/alaska/|title=Alaska Electricity Rates|website=Electricity Local|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the average rate for electricity in the 48 contiguous states is $0.10 per kWh.

The '''Alltwalis Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] near [[Brechfa Forest]] located to the north of the town of [[Carmarthen]] in [[Wales]].

The facility is composed of 10&amp;nbsp;wind turbines with a combined installed capacity of 23 [[megawatts]]. The expected annual production of electricity is around 65&amp;nbsp;[[gigawatt]] hours (GWh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alltwaliswindfarm.co.uk/|title=Alltwalis Wind Farm|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was built by [[Statkraft]].  Construction began in November 2008, and was completed in December 2009.

[[File:M5 colour magnitude diagram.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|[[H–R diagram]] for [[globular cluster]] [[Messier 5|M5]], with known AGB stars marked in blue and some of the more luminous [[red giant branch]] stars in red]]
The '''asymptotic giant branch (AGB)''' is a region of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] populated by evolved cool luminous [[star]]s. This is a period of [[stellar evolution]] undertaken by all low- to intermediate-mass stars (0.6–10 solar masses) late in their lives.

Observationally, an asymptotic-giant-branch star will appear as a bright [[red giant]] with a luminosity thousands of times greater than the Sun. Its interior structure is characterized by a central and largely inert core of carbon and oxygen, a shell where helium is undergoing fusion to form carbon (known as [[helium burning]]), another shell where hydrogen is undergoing fusion forming helium (known as [[hydrogen burning]]), and a very large envelope of material of composition similar to main-sequence stars.&lt;ref name=lattanzio&gt;

==Stellar evolution==

[[File:Evolutionary track 5m.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|A {{solar mass|5}} star moves onto the AGB after a blue loop when helium is exhausted in its core]]
When a star exhausts the supply of [[hydrogen]] by [[nuclear fusion]] processes in its core, the core contracts and its temperature increases, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool.  The star becomes a red giant, following a track towards the upper-right hand corner of the HR diagram.&lt;ref name=iben&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, once the [[temperature]] in the core has reached approximately {{val|3|e=8|ul=K}}, [[Helium fusion|helium burning]] (fusion of [[helium]] nuclei) begins. The onset of helium burning in the core halts the star's cooling and increase in luminosity, and the star instead moves down and leftwards in the HR diagram. This is the [[horizontal branch]] (for [[population II stars]]) or [[red clump]] (for [[population I stars]]), or a blue loop for stars more massive than about {{solar mass|2}}.&lt;ref name=vassiliadis/&gt;

After the completion of helium burning in the core, the star again moves to the right and upwards on the diagram, cooling and expanding as its luminosity increases. Its path is almost aligned with its previous red-giant track, hence the name ''[[asymptotic]] giant branch'', although the star will become more luminous on the AGB than it did at the tip of the red giant branch.  Stars at this stage of stellar evolution are known as AGB stars.&lt;ref name=vassiliadis&gt;

===AGB stage===
The AGB phase is divided into two parts, the early AGB (E-AGB) and the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB). During the E-AGB phase, the main source of energy is helium fusion in a shell around a core consisting mostly of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]]. During this phase, the star swells up to giant proportions to become a red giant again. The star's radius may become as large as one [[astronomical unit]] ({{Solar radius|~215}}).&lt;ref name=vassiliadis/&gt;

After the helium shell runs out of fuel, the TP-AGB starts. Now the star derives its energy from fusion of hydrogen in a thin shell, which restricts the inner [[helium]] shell to a very thin layer and prevents it fusing stably.  However, over periods of 10,000 to 100,000 years, helium from the hydrogen shell burning builds up and eventually the helium shell ignites explosively, a process known as a [[Helium flash#Shell helium flash|helium shell flash]].  The luminosity of the shell flash peaks at thousands of times the total luminosity of the star, but decreases exponentially over just a few years.  The shell flash causes the star to expand and cool which shuts off the hydrogen shell burning and causes strong convection in the zone between the two shells.&lt;ref name=vassiliadis/&gt;  When the helium shell burning nears the base of the hydrogen shell, the increased temperature reignites hydrogen fusion and the cycle begins again.  The large but brief increase in luminosity from the helium shell flash produces an increase in the visible brightness of the star of a few tenths of a magnitude for several hundred years, a change unrelated to the brightness variations on periods of tens to hundreds of days that are common in this type of star.&lt;ref name=marigo&gt;

During the thermal pulses, which last only a few hundred years, material from the core region may be mixed into the outer layers, changing the surface composition, a process referred to as ''dredge-up''.  Because of this dredge-up, AGB stars may show [[S-process|S-process elements]] in their spectra and strong dredge-ups can lead to the formation of [[carbon star]]s.  All dredge-ups following thermal pulses are referred to as third dredge-ups, after the first dredge-up, which occurs on the red-giant branch, and the second dredge up, which occurs during the E-AGB.  In some cases there may not be a second dredge-up but dredge-ups following thermal pulses will still be called a third dredge-up.  Thermal pulses increase rapidly in strength after the first few, so third dredge-ups are generally the deepest and most likely to circulate core material to the surface.&lt;ref name=gallino&gt;

AGB stars are typically [[long-period variable]]s, and suffer [[Stellar mass loss|mass loss]] in the form of a [[stellar wind]].  Thermal pulses produce periods of even higher mass loss and may result in detached shells of circumstellar material.  A star may lose 50 to 70% of its mass during the AGB phase.&lt;ref name=wood&gt;

The extensive mass loss of AGB stars means that they are surrounded by an extended [[circumstellar envelope]] (CSE). Given a mean AGB lifetime of one [[Myr]] and an outer velocity of {{val|10|ul=km/s}}, its maximum radius can be estimated to be roughly {{val|3|e=14|ul=km}} (30 [[light years]]). This is a maximum value since the wind material will start to mix with the [[interstellar medium]] at very large radii, and it also assumes that there is no velocity difference between the star and the [[interstellar gas]]. Dynamically, most of the interesting action is quite close to the star, where the wind is launched and the mass loss rate is determined. However, the outer layers of the CSE show chemically interesting processes, and due to size and lower [[optical depth]], are easier to observe.&lt;ref name=habing&gt;

The temperature of the CSE is determined by heating and cooling properties of the gas and dust, but drops with radial distance from the [[photosphere]] of the stars which are {{val|2000|fmt=commas}}–{{val|3000|u=K|fmt=commas}}.

The dichotomy between [[oxygen]]-rich and [[carbon]]-rich stars has an initial role in determining whether the first condensates are oxides or carbides, since the least abundant of these two elements will likely remain in the gas phase as CO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the dust formation zone, [[refractory]] elements and compounds (Fe, Si, MgO, etc.) are removed from the gas phase and end up in [[Circumstellar dust|dust grains]]. The newly formed dust will immediately assist in [[Surface science|surface catalyzed reaction]]s. The stellar winds from AGB stars are sites of [[cosmic dust]] formation, and are believed to be the main production sites of dust in the universe.&lt;ref name=sugarman&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2006Sci...313..196S|title=Massive-Star Supernovae as Major Dust Factories|journal=Science|volume=313|issue=5784|pages=196–200|last1=Sugerman|first1=Ben E.

===Late thermal pulse===
As many as a quarter of all post-AGB stars undergo what is dubbed a "born-again" episode. The carbon–oxygen core is now surrounded by helium with an outer shell of hydrogen. If the helium is re-ignited a thermal pulse occurs and the star quickly returns to the AGB, becoming a helium-burning, hydrogen-deficient stellar object.&lt;ref name=aerts_et_al2009/&gt; If the star still has a hydrogen-burning shell when this thermal pulse occurs, it is termed a "late thermal pulse". Otherwise it is called a "very late thermal pulse".&lt;ref name=sterken_kurtz2002&gt;

The outer atmosphere of the born-again star develops a stellar wind and the star once more follows an [[evolutionary track]] across the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]]. However, this phase is very brief, lasting only about 200 years before the star again heads toward the [[white dwarf]] stage. Observationally, this late thermal pulse phase appears almost identical to a [[Wolf–Rayet star]] in the midst of its own [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref name=aerts_et_al2009&gt;

Stars such as [[Sakurai's Object]] and [[FG Sagittae]] are being observed as they rapidly evolve through this phase.

===Super-AGB stars===
Stars close to the upper mass limit to still qualify as AGB stars show some peculiar properties and have been dubbed super-AGB stars.  They have masses above {{Solar mass|7}} and up to 9 or {{Solar mass|10}} (or more&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). They represent a transition to the more massive supergiant stars that undergo full fusion of elements heavier than helium.  During the [[triple-alpha process]], some elements heavier than carbon are also produced: mostly oxygen, but also some magnesium, neon, and even heavier elements.  Super-AGB stars develop partially degenerate carbon–oxygen cores that are large enough to ignite carbon in a flash analogous to the earlier helium flash. The second dredge-up is very strong in this mass range and that keeps the core size below the level required for burning of neon as occurs in higher-mass supergiants. The size of the thermal pulses and third dredge-ups are reduced compared to lower-mass stars, while the frequency of the thermal pulses increases dramatically. Some super-AGB stars may explode as an electron capture supernova, but most will end as an oxygen–neon white dwarf.&lt;ref name=eldridge&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these stars are much more common than higher-mass supergiants, they could form a high proportion of observed supernovae.  Detecting examples of these supernovae would provide valuable confirmation of models that are highly dependent on assumptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6690">'''Atmospheric-pressure plasma''' (or '''AP plasma''' or '''normal pressure plasma''') is a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in which the pressure approximately matches that of the surrounding [[atmosphere]] – the so-called normal pressure.

== Technical significance  ==
Atmospheric-pressure plasmas have prominent technical significance because in contrast with low-pressure plasma or high-pressure plasma no [[reaction vessel]] is needed to ensure the maintenance of a pressure level differing from atmospheric pressure. Accordingly, depending on the principle of generation, these plasmas can be employed directly in the production line. The need for cost-intensive chambers for producing a partial vacuum as used in low-pressure plasma technology is eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Rory A., Atmospheric Pressure Plasma for Surface Modification, Wiley, 2012

== Plasma generation ==
Various forms of excitation are distinguished:
* AC ([[alternating current]]) excitation
* DC ([[direct current]]) and low-frequency excitation
* Excitation by means of [[radio waves]]
* [[Microwave]] excitation

Atmospheric-pressure plasmas that have attained any noteworthy industrial significance are those generated by DC excitation ([[electric arc]]), AC excitation ([[corona discharge]], [[dielectric barrier discharge]], [[piezoelectric direct discharge plasma | piezoelectric direct discharge]] and plasma jets as well as 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz microwave microplasma).

=== Operating principle of a DC plasma jet ===
By means of a high-voltage discharge (5–15&amp;nbsp;kV, 10–100&amp;nbsp;kHz) a pulsed electric arc is generated. A process gas, usually oil-free compressed air flowing past this discharge section, is excited and converted to the plasma state. This plasma then passes through a jet head to arrive on the surface of the material to be treated. The jet head is at earth potential and in this way largely holds back potential-carrying parts of the plasma stream. In addition, it determines the geometry of the emergent beam.

=== Operating principle of a microwave plasma jet ===
Based on transistor amplifiers up to 200W power RF (radio frequency) and microwave sources are used to generate a microwave plasma. Most of the solutions work at 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz. Meanwhile, is a technology developed which provide the ignition on the one hand and the high efficient operation on the other hand with the same electronic and couple network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Heuermann |first=Holger|title= Various applications and background of 10-200W 2.45GHz microplasmas|conference= 60th International Microwave Symposium|date=June 2012|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2012.6259386|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2012imsd.conf59386H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of atmospheric-pressure plasmas is different. The plasma is only top of the electrode. That is the reason the construction of a cannula jet was possible.

== Applications ==
The plasma jet is used, among other things, in industry for [[Plasma activation | activating]] and [[Plasma cleaning|cleaning]] plastic and metal surfaces prior to adhesive bonding and painting processes. Even sheet materials having treatment widths of several meters can be treated today by aligning a large number of jets in a row. In doing so the modification of the surface achieved by plasma jets is comparable to the effects obtained with low-pressure plasma.&lt;ref&gt;Noeske M., Degenhardt J., Strudhoff S., Lommattzsch U.: Plasma Jet Treatment of five Polymers at Atmospheric Pressure: Surface Modifications and the Relevance for Adhesion; International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives; 24 (2) 2004, pp. 171–177&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the power of the jet, the plasma beam can be up to 40&amp;nbsp;mm long and attain a treatment width of 15&amp;nbsp;mm. Special rotary systems allow a treatment width per jet tool of up to 13&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Buske C., Förnsel P.: Vorrichtung zur Plasmabehandlung von Oberflächen (Device for the plasma treatment of surfaces); EP 0986939&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the required treatment performance, the plasma source is moved at a spacing of 10–40&amp;nbsp;mm and at a speed of 5–400&amp;nbsp;m/min relative to the surface of the material to be treated.

A key advantage of this system lies in its capability of being integrated in-line. This means that it can usually be installed without any difficulty in existing production systems. In addition the activation achievable is distinctly higher than in potential-based pretreatment methods (corona discharge).

It is possible to coat varied surfaces by means of this technique. Thus, anticorrosive layers and [[adhesion]] promoter layers can be applied to many metals without the use of solvents and hence in an environmentally friendly manner.

'''Bimal Mukherjee''' ({{lang-bn|বিমল মুখার্জী}}) (1903–1996) was the first Indian globe trotter who travelled the entire world on a bicycle from the year 1926 to 1937.&lt;ref name="Du Chakai Duniya"&gt;Du Chakai Duniya, by Bimal Mukherjee, Swarnakshar Prakashani Private Limited, June 1987, {{ISBN|81-86891-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the book ''[[Du Chakay Duniya]]'' about his experiences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sansad Bangali Charitavidhan (Bengali)|last=Vol - II|first=Anjali Basu|publisher=Sahitya Sansad|year=2004|isbn=81-86806-99-7|location=Kolkata|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world voyage started on bicycle from Town Hall, [[Calcutta]] on December 12, 1926 and halted at [[Chandannagar]] for the first night.&lt;ref name="Du Chakai Duniya"/&gt;

He and his three friends Ashok Mukherjee, Ananda Mukherjee and Manindra Ghosh had crossed the [[Bohemia|Bohemian Alps]] in bicycles wearing flannel shirts and no woolen clothing in the month of December. They had kept warm by cycling vigorously and alternated keeping one hand in their pockets to prevent frostbite. When asked how they did the amazing feat. He had replied, ''"We are carrying the sun rays from India!"''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Du Chakai Duniya"/&gt;

'''Blyth Harbour Wind Farm''' is a coastal wind farm located along the East Pier of the Port of [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]].
Commissioned in January 1993 it consists of nine 0.3[[Megawatt|MW]] WindMaster [[Wind turbine|turbines]] giving a total capacity of 2.7MW. It was developed by [[AMEC]] Wind and is owned by Hainsford Developments (Blyth Harbour) Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102132011/http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repowering==

In January 2008 consent was granted to replace the existing nine turbines with seven new ones. Six of these would generate 2.5MW each, and a seventh larger one would produce 7.58MW (if it is an [[Enercon E-126]])and be the largest land-based turbine in Europe at {{convert|163|m|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2008/07/17/giant-wind-turbine-is-set-for-go-ahead-61634-21355057/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307113103/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2008/07/17/giant-wind-turbine-is-set-for-go-ahead-61634-21355057/ |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2012, the first new turbine became operational, producing up to 3.4 MW of power (more than the original nine turbines combined).  The turbine is a REpower 3.4M104, with a 76m hub height.

Boron oxyfluoride can be condensed from vapour to a fluorine deficient glass at temperatures below 190° by very rapid cooling. When heated this deposit has a temperature at which it loses more BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form a frothy or porous glass that resembles popcorn.

===Glass===
Boron oxyfluoride glass is transparent and colourless. It is stable in dry air, but it is hygroscopic and in normal air becomes white and opaque. When heated the glass will encounter a glass transition temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) at which it ceases to be a glass, and produces BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gas and a boron oxyfluoride with less fluorine is left behind. This glass transition temperature is determined from where the pressure of BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; produced exceeds the strength of the glass. The hypothetical structure of BOF glass, is of long chains of B-O-B-O with fluorine attached to each boron. These can be considered as BO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F triangles linked in a chain by O atoms. These chains are tangled up like spaghetti in the glass. When the substance becomes fluorine deficient, crosslinks with oxygen form between the chains, and it becomes more two dimensional in structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boussard-Plédel|first1=Catherine|last2=Fonteneau|first2=Gilles|last3=Lucas|first3=Jacques|title=Boron oxyfluoride glasses in the B-O-F system: new polymeric spaghetti-type glasses|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|date=July 1995|volume=188|issue=1-2|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/0022-3093(95)00183-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is produced when the terminals of two linear (BF)O chains join with each other.&lt;ref name=Polishchuk/&gt; These ends contain -O-BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and when two meet, BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be eliminated and the chain extended with oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=Jacques|title=Non-conventional spaghetti-type glasses|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|date=May 1995|volume=184|pages=21–24|doi=10.1016/0022-3093(95)00087-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
BFO is expected to form in supernovae II output in gas between 1,000 and 2,000&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures around 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppe|first1=P.|last2=Lodders|first2=K.|last3=Strebel|first3=R.|last4=Amari|first4=S.|last5=Lewis|first5=R.

==Preparation==
[[Otto Ruff]] noticed that a mixture of BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; passing over molten B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; produced some SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and redistributed B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into cold parts of the reaction tube.  He speculated that there must be some heat stable intermediate that converted back into the original components on cooling.&lt;ref name=pb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruff|first1=Otto|last2=Braida|first2=A.|last3=Bretschneider|first3=O.|last4=Menzel|first4=W.|last5=Plaut|first5=H.|title=Die Darstellung, Dampfdrucke und Dichten des BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; und BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|date=18 May 1932|volume=206|issue=1|pages=59–64|language=de|doi=10.1002/zaac.19322060108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Paul Baumgarten]] and [[Werner Bruns]] made the boron oxyfluoride trimer by passing BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; over solid B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at 450&amp;nbsp;°C.

They announced this find in 1939.&lt;ref name=pb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumgarten|first1=Paul|last2=Bruns|first2=Werner|title=Über die Umsetzung von Borfluorid mit Bortrioxyd, Boraten, Carbonaten und Nitraten und zur Kenntnis eines mutmaßlichen Boroxyfluorides (BOF)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series)|date=6 September 1939|volume=72|issue=9|pages=1753–1762|doi=10.1002/cber.19390720921|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumgarten|first1=Paul|last2=Bruns|first2=Werner|title=Über die Umsetzung von Borfluorid mit Aluminiumoxyd, Siliciumdioxyd, Titandioxyd und Silikaten und die mögliche Verwendung dieser Reaktionen für den Aufschluß aluminiumhaltiger Silikate zwecks Herstellung für die Aluminiumgewinnung verwendbarer Ausgangsmaterialien|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series)|language=de|date=9 July 1941|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1232–1236|doi=10.1002/cber.19410740717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Boron oxyfluoride could be used in [[boriding]] steel. By using a gas, sticking solids onto the steel is avoided. Also this method allows control of the boron concentration, and mostly forms [[Iron boride|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B]] instead of the more brittle FeB.&lt;ref name="Goeuriot"/&gt;
Burning boron releases much energy, so its use in explosives or fuel is being researched.  To maximise energy output, both fluorine and oxygen are used to react, and thus FBO and related molecules are formed and may be in the exhaust.&lt;ref name=smo/&gt;

The '''cashew tree''' (''Anacardium occidentale'') is a tropical evergreen tree that produces the cashew [[seed]] (nut) and the cashew [[Fruit|apple]].&lt;ref name=morton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/index.html|title=Cashew apple, ''Anacardium occidentale'' L.|publisher=Center for New Crops and Plant Products, Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Purdue University, W. Lafayette, IN|work=Fruits of warm climates, Julia F. Morton|isbn=978-0-9610184-1-2|year=1987|author=Morton, Julia F|authorlink=Julia Morton|pages=239–240|access-date=2007-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315023810/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/index.html#|archive-date=2007-03-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can grow as high as {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but the dwarf cashew, growing up to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, has proved more profitable, with earlier maturity and higher yields.

The species is originally native to northeastern Brazil.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; Portuguese colonists in Brazil began exporting cashew nuts as early as the 1550s.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Jostock, "Cashew Industry" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 5. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Major production of cashews occurs in Vietnam, Nigeria, India, and [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=fao2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/rankings/countries_by_commodity/E|title=Major Food And Agricultural Commodities And Producers – Countries By Commodity|publisher=United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Statistics Division|year=2013|accessdate=6 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015234935/http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/rankings/countries_by_commodity/E#|archive-date=2015-10-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cashew nut, often simply called a cashew, is widely consumed. It is eaten on its own, used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or [[cashew butter]]. The shell of the cashew seed yields derivatives that can be used in many applications including lubricants, waterproofing, paints, and arms production, starting in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Jostock, "Cashew Industry", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The cashew apple is a light reddish to yellow fruit, whose pulp can be processed into a sweet, [[astringent]] fruit drink or distilled into liquor.

==Etymology==
Its English name derives from the Portuguese name for the fruit of the cashew tree ''caju'' (Portuguese pronunciation: [kaˈʒu]), which itself is derived from the [[Tupian]] word ''acajú'', literally meaning "nut that produces itself".&lt;ref name=morton /&gt; The generic name "Anacardium" (derived from Greek ἀνά (aná), meaning "outside," and καρδία (kardía), meaning "heart", refers to the unusual location of the seed (the heart) outside of the fruit.

==Habitat and growth==
[[File:Cashew Flower.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Flower of cashew tree]]
[[File:Cajueiro Meconta.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cashew tree]]

The cashew tree is large and [[evergreen]], growing to {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with a short, often irregularly shaped trunk.  The [[leaf|leaves]] are spirally arranged, leathery textured, elliptic to obovate, {{convert|4-22|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2-15|cm|abbr=on}}  broad, with smooth margins. The [[flower]]s are produced in a [[panicle]] or [[corymb]] up to {{convert|26|cm|abbr=on}} long; each flower is small, pale green at first, then turning reddish, with five slender, acute [[petal]]s {{convert|7-15|mm|abbr=on}}  long. [[Cashew of Pirangi|The largest cashew tree in the world]] covers an area around {{convert|7500|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}; it is located in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte]], Brazil.

The fruit of the cashew tree is an [[accessory fruit]] (sometimes called a pseudocarp or false fruit).&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; What appears to be the fruit is an oval or [[pear-shaped]] structure, a [[hypocarpium]], that develops from the [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] and the receptacle of the cashew flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varghese|first1=T.|last2=Pundir|first2=Y.|year=1964|title=Anatomy of the pseudocarp in ''Anacardium occidentale'' L.|journal=Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Section B|volume=59|issue = 5| pages=252–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as ''marañón'', it ripens into a yellow or red structure about {{convert|5–11|cm|abbr=on}} long. It is edible and has a strong "sweet" smell and taste.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney or boxing-glove shaped [[drupe]] that grows at the end of the cashew apple. The drupe develops first on the tree, and then the pedicel expands to become the cashew apple.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; Within the true fruit is a single [[seed]], which is often considered a [[Nut (fruit)|nut]], in the culinary sense. The seed is surrounded by a double shell containing an allergenic [[natural phenol|phenolic]] resin, [[anacardic acid]], a potent skin [[Irritation|irritant]] chemically related to the better-known allergenic oil [[urushiol]] which is also a [[toxin]] found in the related [[poison ivy (plant)|poison ivy]]. Some people are [[allergy|allergic]] to cashews, but cashews are a less frequent [[allergen]] than tree nuts or [[peanut]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=T.|author2=Fordice, D. B.|title=Cashew Nut Dermatitis|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=87|issue=4|pages=543–546|date=April 1994|doi=10.1097/00007611-199404000-00026|pmid=8153790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the cashew plant is native to northeast [[Brazil]], the [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] took it to [[Goa]], India, between 1560 and 1565.  From there, it spread throughout Southeast Asia and eventually Africa.

== Cashew nut and shell==
[[File:Shelling cashews.jpg|thumb|A woman uses a machine to shell cashews in Phuket, Thailand.]]
[[File:CashewSnack.jpg|thumb|Cashews as a snack]]

Culinary uses for cashew seeds in [[snack]]ing and cooking are similar to those for all tree seeds called nuts.

Cashews are commonly used in [[Indian cuisine]] and [[Pakistani cuisine]], whole for garnishing sweets or curries, or ground into a paste that forms a base of sauces for curries (e.g., ''[[korma]]''), or some sweets (e.g., ''[[kaju barfi]]''). It is also used in powdered form in the preparation of several Indian sweets and desserts. In [[Goan cuisine]], both roasted and raw kernels are used whole for making curries and sweets. Cashews are also used in [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[Chinese cuisine]]s, generally in whole form. In the Philippines, cashew is a known product of [[Antipolo]], and is eaten with [[suman (food)|''suman'']]. The province of [[Pampanga]] also has a sweet dessert called [[Turrón#Philippines|''turrones de casuy'']], which is cashew [[marzipan]] wrapped in white wafers. In [[Indonesia]], roasted and salted cashews are called ''kacang mete'' or ''kacang mede'', while the cashew apple is called ''jambu monyet'' (translates in English to monkey rose apple).

In the 21st century, cashew cultivation increased in several African countries to meet the demands for manufacturing [[cashew milk]], a [[plant milk]] alternative to [[dairy milk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumergoods.edgl.com/column/Access-to-Market-Data-and-Supply-Chain-Visibility-offer-Economic-Boost-to-Ghana-Cashew-Farmers101911|title=Access to Market Data and Supply Chain Visibility offer Economic Boost to Ghana Cashew Farmers|author=Osborn M|publisher=Consumer Goods Technology|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604004917/http://consumergoods.edgl.com/column/Access-to-Market-Data-and-Supply-Chain-Visibility-offer-Economic-Boost-to-Ghana-Cashew-Farmers101911#|archive-date=2016-06-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mozambique]], ''bolo polana'' is a cake prepared using powdered cashews and mashed potatoes as the main ingredients. This dessert is popular in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South Africa Eats|author=Phillippa Cheifitz|year=2009|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/south-africa-eats/oclc/519442115|access-date=2012-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211163356/http://www.worldcat.org/title/south-africa-eats/oclc/519442115#|archive-date=2013-12-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], cashew fruit juice and the fruit pulp are used in the production of sweets, juice, alcoholic beverages, such as ''[[cachaça]]'', and as a flour, milk or cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.folhape.com.br/diversao/diversao/sabores/2018/07/28/NWS,76213,71,513,DIVERSAO,2330-E-TEMPO-CAJU-FEIRA-PRATO.aspx|language=Portuguese|title=It's cashew time at the fair and on the plate (translated)|publisher=Folha de Pernambuco|date=2018-07-28|author=Edi Souza|access-date=2018-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821223527/https://www.folhape.com.br/diversao/diversao/sabores/2018/07/28/NWS,76213,71,513,DIVERSAO,2330-E-TEMPO-CAJU-FEIRA-PRATO.aspx#|archive-date=2018-08-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Panama]], the cashew fruit is cooked with water and sugar for a prolonged time to make a sweet, brown, paste-like dessert called ''dulce de marañón'', with ''marañón'' as a Spanish name for cashew.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[nutshell|shell]] of the cashew nut contains oil compounds which may cause [[contact dermatitis]] similar in severity to that of poison ivy, primarily resulting from the [[phenolic lipid]]s, [[anacardic acid]], and [[cardanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=South Med J|year=1994|volume=87|issue=4|pages=543–46|title=Cashew nut dermatitis|author=Rosen T.|author2=Fordice, D.

In 2015, global production of cashew nuts (as the [[Seed|kernel]]) was 738,861 [[tonne]]s, led by [[India]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] each with 23% of the world total (table). [[Vietnam]] and [[Brazil]] also had significant production of cashew kernels.

In 2014, rapid growth of cashew cultivation in [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]] made this country the top African exporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/29/us-ivorycoast-cashews-insight-idUSKBN0II0Y620141029|title=War-scarred Ivory Coast aims to conquer the world of cashews|first=Joe|last=Bavier|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluctuations in world market prices, poor working conditions, and low pay for local harvesting have caused discontent in the cashew nut industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22282599|title=Tanzania riots over cashew nut payments|publisher=BBC|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=14 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521090400/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22282599#|archive-date=2013-05-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/nov/02/cashew-nut-workers-pay-conditions-profits|title=Cashew nut workers suffer 'appalling' conditions as global slump dents profits|author=Lamble L.|work=The Guardian|date=2 November 2013|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Blood cashews': the toxic truth about your favourite nut|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11577928/Blood-cashews-the-toxic-truth-about-your-favourite-nut.html|work=The Telegraph|author=Wilson B.|date=4 May 2015|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cashew tree is cultivated in the tropics between 25°N and 25°S, and is supremely adapted to hot lowland areas with a pronounced dry season, where the mango and tamarind trees also thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/Infopaks/cashew.htm|title=Cultivating Cashew Nuts|publisher=ARC-Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Crops, South Africa|accessdate=February 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221195301/http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/Infopaks/cashew.htm#|archive-date=2015-02-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional cashew tree is tall (up to 14&amp;nbsp;m) and takes three years from planting before it starts production, and eight years before economic harvests can begin. More recent breeds, such as the dwarf cashew trees, are up to 6&amp;nbsp;m tall, and start producing after the first year, with economic yields after three years. The cashew nut yields for the traditional tree are about 0.25 metric tons per hectare, in contrast to over a ton per hectare for the dwarf variety. Grafting and other modern tree management technologies are used to further improve and sustain cashew nut yields in commercial orchards.

==Cashew oil==
Cashew oil is a dark yellow oil for cooking or salad dressing pressed from cashew nuts (typically broken chunks created during processing). This may be produced from a single cold pressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartkitchen.com/resources/cashew-oil|title=Cashew Oil|publisher=Smart Kitchen|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cashew shell oil===
{{See also|Urushiol}}
Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) or cashew shell oil ([[CAS registry number]] 8007-24-7) is a natural [[resin]] with a yellowish sheen found in the [[honeycomb structure]] of the cashew [[nutshell]], and is a byproduct of processing cashew nuts.  It is a raw material of multiple uses in developing drugs, antioxidants, fungicides, and [[biomaterial]]s.&lt;ref name=hamad/&gt; It is used in tropical [[folk medicine]] and for anti[[termite]] treatment of timber.&lt;ref name=clay /&gt;  Its composition varies depending on how it is processed.
* Cold, [[Liquid–liquid extraction|solvent-extracted]] CNSL is mostly composed of [[anacardic acids]] (70%),&lt;ref name=cen/&gt; [[cardol]] (18%) and [[cardanol]] (5%).&lt;ref name=hamad/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/summaries/casntliq/c13793rr3.pdf|title=Exposure and Use Data for Cashew Nut Shell Liquid|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=2012-01-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512194341/http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/summaries/casntliq/c13793rr3.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heating CNSL [[decarboxylation|decarboxylates]] the anacardic acids, producing a technical grade of CNSL that is rich in cardanol. [[Distillation]] of this material gives distilled, technical CNSL containing 78% cardanol and 8% cardol (cardol has one more [[hydroxyl]] group than cardanol).&lt;ref name=epa/&gt; This process also reduces the degree of thermal [[polymerization]] of the unsaturated alkyl-phenols present in CNSL.
* Anacardic acid is also used in the chemical industry for the production of cardanol, which is used for resins, coatings, and frictional materials.&lt;ref name=cen&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cen-v086n033.p026|title=A Nutty Chemical|date=September 8, 2008 |volume=86|issue=36|pages=26–27|author=Alexander H. Tullo|journal=[[Chemical and Engineering News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epa /&gt;

These substances are skin allergens, like the oils of poison ivy, and present danger during manual cashew processing.&lt;ref name=clay&gt;"World Agriculture and the Environment", by Jason W. Clay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_RU8D9kB714C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;vq=nutshell+liquid&amp;dq=nutshell+nut+protect&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_search_s p. 268]&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural oil phenol has been found to have interesting chemical structural features which enable a range of chemical modifications to create a wide spectrum of biobased [[monomer]]s capitalizing on the chemically versatile construct, containing three different [[functional group]]s: the [[aromatic ring]], the [[hydroxyl group]], and the [[double bond]]s in the flanking [[alkyl]] chain. These can be split into key groups, used as [[polyols]], which have recently seen a dramatic increase in demand for their biobased origin and key chemical attributes such as high reactivity, range of functionalities, reduction in blowing agents, and naturally occurring fire retardant properties in the field of ridged polyurethanes aided by their inherent phenolic structure and larger number of reactive units per unit mass.&lt;ref name=hamad/&gt;

CNSL may be used as a resin for [[carbon composite]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferri|first=Enrico|title=Bioresins Derived from Cashew Nutshell Oil|url=http://www.materialstoday.com/composite-processing/features/bio-resins-derived-from-cashew-nutshell-oil/|publisher=MaterialsToday|accessdate=7 September 2011|date=22 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910171651/http://www.materialstoday.com/composite-processing/features/bio-resins-derived-from-cashew-nutshell-oil/#|archive-date=2015-09-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CNSL-based [[Novolac]] is another versatile industrial monomer deriving from cardanol typically used as a [[cross-link|reticulating]] agent for [[epoxy]] matrices in [[Composite material|composite]] applications providing good thermal and mechanical properties to the final composite material.

==Cashew apple==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
The cashew apple, also called cashew fruit, is the fleshy part of the cashew fruit attached to the cashew nut.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The top end of the cashew apple is attached to the stem that comes off the tree. The bottom end of the cashew apple attaches to the cashew nut, which is encased in a shell. In botanical terms, the cashew apple is an [[accessory fruit]] that grows on the cashew seed (which is the nut).

The cashew apple can be eaten fresh, cooked in curries, or fermented into vinegar, as well as an alcoholic drink. It is also used to make preserves, chutneys, and jams in some countries such as India and Brazil. In many countries, particularly in South America, the cashew apple is used to flavor drinks, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;

Cashew nuts are more widely traded than cashew apples, because the apple, unlike the nut, is easily bruised and has very limited shelf life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cashew Juice, the Apple of Pepsi's Eye|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/business/international/cashew-juice-the-apple-of-pepsis-eye.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2014-08-08|accessdate=2015-11-24|issn=0362-4331|first=Stephanie|last=Strom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashew apple juice, however, may be used for manufacturing blended juices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
In cultures that consume cashew apples its astringency is sometimes removed by steaming the fruit for five minutes before washing it in cold water; alternatively, boiling the fruit in salt water for five minutes or soaking it in gelatin solution also reduces the astringency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Small-scale cashew nut processing|author=Azam-Ali and Judge|publisher=FAO, United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-ac306e.pdf|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215021318/http://www.fao.org/3/a-ac306e.pdf#|archive-date=2017-02-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
In [[Goa]], the cashew apple is mashed and the juice extracted and kept for fermentation for a few days. Fermented juice then undergoes a double distillation process. The resulting beverage is called [[Feni (liquor)|''feni'' or fenny]]. ''Feni'' is about 40–42% alcohol. The single-distilled version is called ''urrac'', which is about 15% alcohol.

In the southern region of [[Mtwara]], [[Tanzania]], the cashew apple (''bibo'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is dried and saved. Later, it is reconstituted with water and fermented, then distilled to make a strong liquor often referred to by the generic name, ''gongo''.

In Mozambique, cashew farmers commonly make a strong liquor from the cashew apple. It is known under various names in the local languages of Mozambique (muchekele in Emakua spoken in the North, xicadju in Changana spoken in the South). In contrast to the above-mentioned Feni of Goa, the cashew liquor made in Mozambique does not involve the extraction of the juice from the cashew apples. Following harvest and the removal of the nuts, the apples are spread on the ground under trees and courtyards and allowed to lose water and ferment. The shrivelled fruits are then used for distillation.

According to one source,&lt;ref name="Ref to Alcohol in Literature on Ceylon"&gt;{{cite book|url=//archive.org/details/anaccountisland01percgoog|title=An Account of the Island of Ceylon: Its History, Geography, Natural History, with the Manners and Customs of its various Inhabitants|first=Robert|last=Percival|publisher=C. &amp; R. Baldwin |location=London|year=1803}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alcohol had been distilled in the early 20th century from the juice of the fruit, and was manufactured in the [[West Indies]].

==Animal feed==
Discarded cashew nuts unfit for human consumption, alongside the residues of oil extraction from cashew kernels, can be used to feed livestock. Animals can also eat the leaves of cashew trees.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2017. Cashew (Anacardium occidentale) nuts and by-products.

== History ==
[[File:Channapatna-toys.jpg|thumb|right|Channapatna toys]]
The origin of these toys can be traced to the reign of [[Tipu Sultan]] who invited [[artisan]]s from [[Persia]] to train the local artisans in the making of wooden toys. [[Bavas Miyan]] is the father of Channapatna Toy.  He is the one to sacrifice his life for channapatna toys. He adopted Japanese technology for toys making and help the local artisans improve their art.&lt;ref name="tt" /&gt; For nearly two centuries, ivory-wood was the main wood used in the making of these toys, though [[rosewood]] and [[sandalwood]] were also occasionally used.

The craft has diversified over time; in addition to the traditional ivory-wood, other woods—including [[para rubber tree|rubber]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedar wood|cedar]], [[pine]] and [[teak]]—are now used as well.&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;A detailed summary of Channapatna toys is provided by {{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar292005/spt1.asp |author=Azmathulla Shariff |title=Toy town changes with new trends |work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2005-03-29 |publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. |accessdate=2007-04-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420034609/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar292005/spt1.asp |archivedate=2007-04-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manufacturing]] stages include procuring the wood, seasoning the wood, cutting the wood into the desired shapes, pruning and carving the toys, applying the [[colour]]s and finally polishing the finished product. [[Vegetable]] [[dye]]s are used in the colouring process to ensure that the toys and dolls are safe for use by children.&lt;ref name="tt" /&gt; As of Oct 2006, more than 6,000 people in Channapatna, working in 254 home manufacturing units and 50 small factories, were engaged in the making of these toys. The Karnataka Handicrafts Development Corporation (KHDC) provides assistance with marketing efforts. Most oldest and popular manufacturing unit Bharath Art and crafts help develop innovative products.&lt;ref name="tt" /&gt;

== Growth ==
With no proper backing or marketing, the Channapatna toy industry faced a financial crunch for more than a decade and was almost on the verge of dying out.&lt;ref name="dh" /&gt; However, with the help of KHDC, the craft has been revived and the artisans involved are being trained on changing trends in the industry, to help them keep abreast of the current scenario. Prototypes designed by master craftsmen are introduced to the local artisans, who use them to create well-designed toys and dolls. The Government of Karnataka has also provided help by constructing a Lacquerware Craft Complex, which has a manufacturing centre with 32 turning lathe machines, at Channapatna.&lt;ref name="dh" /&gt; Financial assistance to the artisans, with help from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Government and the Karnataka Government's ''Vishwa'' scheme has also been provided.

Over the last 4 years, many new companies and social enterprises have been reviving the Channapatna craft to suit modern tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Bharath art and crafts a leading and oldest manufacturing unit of toys based from Channapatna, in its Fourth generations to innovate the tradition of toys and handicrafts into modernization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pavitrajayaraman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/zYEgmRno5tPeWYhSok8nJN/Channapatna-Karnataka--Back-in-the-game.html|title=Channapatna, Karnataka – Back in the game|author=Pavitra Jayaraman|work=livemint.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Right now they are working and supporting artisans of Channapatna, but soon they would spread across the country and bring in more varieties under the crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/toy-destination/article6209551.ece|title=Toy destination|author=S.

The '''chloride [[ion]]''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔər|aɪ|d}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|page=143|isbn=9781405881180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[anion]] (negatively charged ion) '''Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;'''. It is formed when the [[chemical element|element]] [[chlorine]] (a [[halogen]]) gains an [[electron]] or when a [[chemical compound|compound]] such as [[hydrogen chloride]] is dissolved in water or other polar solvents. Chloride salts such as [[sodium chloride]] are often very soluble in water.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Green, John, and Sadru Damji. "Chapter 3." ''Chemistry''. Camberwell, Vic.: IBID, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an essential [[electrolyte]] located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting [[nerve impulses]] and regulating fluid in and out of cells. Less frequently, the word ''chloride'' may also form part of the "common" name of [[chemical compound]]s in which one or more chlorine [[atom]]s are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]].  For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name [[chloromethane]] (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent C−Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.

==Electronic properties==
A chloride ion is much larger than a chlorine atom, 167 and 99 pm, respectively.  The ion is colorless and diamagnetic.  In aqueous solution, it is highly soluble in most cases; however, some chloride salts, such as silver chloride, lead(II) chloride, and mercury(I) chloride are slightly soluble in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zumdahl|first1=Steven|title=Chemical Principles|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-13370-6|pages=109|edition=7th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In aqueous solution, chloride is bound by the protic end of the water molecules.

==Occurrence in nature==
Sea water contains 1.94% chloride.  Some chloride-containing minerals include the chlorides of sodium ([[halite]] or NaCl), potassium ([[sylvite]] or KCl), and magnesium ([[bischofite]]), hydrated MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The concentration of chloride in the blood is called [[serum chloride]], and this concentration is regulated by the [[kidneys]]. A chloride ion is a structural component of some proteins, e.g., it is present in the [[amylase]] enzyme.

==Role in commerce==
The [[chlor-alkali]] industry is a major consumer of the world's energy budget.  This process converts sodium chloride into chlorine and sodium hydroxide, which are used to make many other materials and chemicals.  The process involves two parallel reactions:
:2&amp;nbsp;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →   {{chem|Cl|2}}  +  2&amp;nbsp;[[electron|e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]
:2&amp;nbsp;{{chem|H|2|O}}  +  2&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2&amp;nbsp;OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
[[Image:Chloralkali membrane.svg|thumb|center|600px|Basic membrane cell used in the [[electrolysis]] of brine. At the anode ('''A'''), chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is oxidized to chlorine. The ion-selective membrane ('''B''') allows the counterion Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to freely flow across, but prevents anions such as hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and chloride from diffusing across. At the cathode ('''C'''), water is reduced to hydroxide and hydrogen gas.]]

===Water quality and processing===
Another major application involving chloride is [[desalination]], which involves the energy intensive removal of chloride salts to give [[drinking water|potable water]].  In the [[petroleum industry]], the chlorides are a closely monitored constituent of the [[drilling fluid|mud system]]. An increase of the chlorides in the mud system may be an indication of drilling into a high-pressure saltwater formation. Its increase can also indicate the poor quality of a target sand.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Chloride is also a useful and reliable chemical indicator of river / groundwater fecal contamination, as chloride is a non-reactive solute and ubiquitous to sewage &amp; potable water. Many water regulating companies around the world utilize chloride to check the contamination levels of the rivers and potable water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopetsamerica.com/substance/chlorides.aspx|title=Chlorides|author=|date=|website=www.gopetsamerica.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic uses===
Chloride salts such as [[sodium chloride]] are used to preserve food.

===Corrosion===
The presence of chlorides, e.g. in [[seawater]], significantly aggravates the conditions for [[pitting corrosion]] of most metals (including stainless steels, aluminum, aluminum alloys, and high-alloyed materials) by enhancing the formation and growth of the pits through an autocatalytic process.

==Role in biology==
{{Expand section|date=March 2016}}
Chloride is an essential [[Electrolyte#Physiological_importance|electrolyte]], trafficking in and out of cells through [[chloride channel]]s and playing a key role in maintaining cell [[Homeostasis#Biological|homeostasis]] and transmitting [[action potentials]] in neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular Structure and Physiological Function of Chloride Channels |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/content/82/2/503 |journal=Physiological Reviews |date=2002-04-01 |issn=0031-9333 |pmid=11917096 |pages=503–568 |volume=82 |issue=2 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00029.2001 |first=Thomas J. |last=Jentsch |first2=Valentin |last2=Stein |first3=Frank |last3=Weinreich |first4=Anselm A. |last4=Zdebik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristic concentrations of chloride in model organisms are: in both ''E. coli'' and budding yeast are 10-200[[molar concentration|mM]] (media dependent), in mammalian cell 5-100mM and in blood plasma 100mM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-concentrations-of-different-ions-in-cells/|title =Cell Biology by the Numbers: What are the concentrations of different ions in cells? |website =book.bionumbers.org|first1= Ron|last1= Milo|first2= Rob |last2=Philips|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions of chloride==
Chloride can be oxidized but not reduced.  The first oxidation, as employed in the chlor-alkali process, is conversion to chlorine gas.  Chlorine can be further oxidized to other oxides and oxyanions including [[hypochlorite]] (ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, the active ingredient in chlorine [[bleach]]), [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|3|−}}), and [[perchlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|4|−}}).

In terms of its acid–base properties, chloride is a [[very weak base]] as indicated by the negative value of the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of hydrochloric acid.  Chloride can be protonated by [[strong acid]]s, such as sulfuric acid:
:NaCl  +   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl

Ionic chloride salts reaction with other salts to exchange anions. The presence of chloride is often detected by its formation of an insoluble [[silver chloride]] upon treatment with silver ion:
: Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;   →   AgCl

The concentration of chloride in an assay can be determined using a [[chloridometer]], which detects silver ions once all chloride in the assay has precipitated via this reaction.

[[Silver chloride electrode|Chlorided silver electrodes]] are commonly used in {{Lang|la|ex vivo}} [[electrophysiology]]. &lt;ref&gt;Molleman, Areles (2003). "Patch Clamping: An Introductory Guide to Patch Clamp Electrophysiology". Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-471-48685-5}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example is table salt, which is [[sodium chloride]] with the [[chemical formula]] NaCl. In [[water (molecule)|water]], it dissociates into Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ions.  Salts such as [[calcium chloride]], [[magnesium chloride]], [[potassium chloride]] have varied uses ranging from medical treatments to cement formation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Calcium chloride (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a salt that is marketed in [[Granular material|pellet]] form for removing dampness from rooms. Calcium chloride is also used for maintaining unpaved roads and for fortifying roadbases for new construction. In addition, calcium chloride is widely used as a [[de-icer]], since it is effective in lowering the [[melting point]] when applied to ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Chemical/saltcom.html|title=Common Salts|last=|first=|date=|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|publisher=Georgia State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of covalently bonded chlorides are [[phosphorus trichloride]], [[phosphorus pentachloride]], and [[thionyl chloride]], all three of which are reactive chlorinating [[reagent]]s that have been used in a [[laboratory]].

==Other oxyanions==
Chlorine can assume [[oxidation state]]s of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. Several neutral [[chlorine oxide]]s are also known.

In [[turbomachinery]], '''Degree of reaction''' or '''reaction ratio (R)''' is defined as the ratio of the static [[pressure]] drop in the [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] to the static pressure drop in the stage or as the ratio of static [[enthalpy]] drop in the rotor to the static enthalpy drop in the stage.

Degree of reaction ('''R''') is an important factor in designing the blades of a [[turbine]], [[compressors]], [[pumps]] and other [[turbo-machinery]]. It also tells about the efficiency of machine and is used for proper selection of a machine for a required purpose.

Various definitions exist in terms of enthalpies, pressures or [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] [[geometry]] of the device.   
In case of [[turbines]], both impulse and reaction machines, Degree of reaction (R) is defined as the ratio of energy transfer by the change in static head to the total energy transfer in the [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac {\text{Isentropic enthalpy change in rotor}}{\text{Isentropic enthalpy change in stage}} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, William W., Fundamentals of turbomachinery, John Wiley, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
For a [[gas turbine]] or [[Gas compressor|compressor]] it is defined as the ratio of [[isentropic]] heat drop in the moving blades (i.e. the rotor) to the sum of the isentropic heat drops in the fixed blades (i.e. the stator) and the moving blades i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac {\text{Isentropic heat drop in rotor}}{\text{Isentropic heat drop in stage}} &lt;/math&gt;.
In pumps, degree of reaction deals in static and dynamic head. Degree of reaction is defined as the fraction of energy transfer by change in static head to the total energy transfer in the rotor i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; R = \frac {\text{Static pressure rise in rotor}}{\text{Total pressure rise in stage}} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Relation==
Most turbo machines are efficient to a certain degree and can be approximated to undergo isentropic process in the stage.
Hence from &lt;math&gt;Tds = dh - \frac{dp}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, 
[[File:Enthalpy vs. Entropy diagram for stage flow in turbine..jpg|border|400px|alt=enthalpy diagram|thumb|Figure 1. Enthalpy vs. Entropy diagram for stage flow in turbine]]
it is easy to see that for isentropic process ∆H ≃ ∆P. Hence it can be implied
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\Delta H\text{ (Rotor)}}{\Delta H\text{ (Stage)}}&lt;/math&gt;
The same can be expressed mathematically as:&lt;ref name=yahya&gt;S.M,Yahya, Turbines, Compressors and Fans, 4th ed. McGraw,2011&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ R = \frac{\int_{3ss}^{2s} \textrm{dh}}{\int_{3ss}^1\textrm{dh}} \,\  \textrm{Or} \,\ \frac{\int_{3ss}^{2s} \textrm{dp } }{\int_{3ss}^1\textrm{dp}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where 1 to 3ss in Figure 1 represents the isentropic process beginning from stator inlet at 1 to rotor outlet at 3. And 2 to 3ss is the isentropic process from rotor inlet at 2 to rotor outlet at 3. The [[velocity triangle]]&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt; (Figure 2.) for the flow process within the stage represents the change in fluid velocity as it flows first in the stator or the fixed blades and then through the rotor or the moving blades. Due to the change in velocities there is a corresponding pressure change.
[[File:Velocity Triangle.jpg|border|400px|alt=velocity triangle relates the inlet and outlet velocities within the stator and rotor during flow in a stage|thumb|Figure 2. Velocity Triangle for fluid flow in turbine]]

Another useful definition used commonly uses stage velocities as:&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, h_2 - h_3 = {1 \over {2}}( V_{r3}^2 -  V_{r2}^2) + {1\over {2}}( U_2^2 - U_3^2)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[enthalpy]] drop in the rotor and&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, h_{01} -h_{03} = h_{02} - h_{03} = ( U_2\,V_{w2}- U_1\,V_{w1})&lt;/math&gt;
is the total [[enthalpy]] drop. The degree of reaction is then expressed as&lt;ref name=dixon&gt;Dixon, S. L., Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Turbo-machinery, 5th ed. Elsevier,2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R =\frac{[{1 \over {2}}( V_{r3}^2 -  V_{r2}^2) + {1\over {2}}( U_2^2 - U_3^2)]}{( U_2\,V_{w2}- U_1\,V_{w1})}&lt;/math&gt;

For [[Axial flow pump|axial machines]] &lt;math&gt; U2 =U1= U&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;ref name=dixon /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R=\frac{( V_{r3}^2 -  V_{r2}^2)}{2U(V_{w3} +V_{w2})}&lt;/math&gt;
The degree of reaction can also be written in terms of the geometry of the turbomachine as obtained by&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R=  (\frac{V_f}{2U})(\tan {\beta_3} - \tan{\beta_2}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\beta_3&lt;/math&gt; is the vane angle of rotor outlet and &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; is the vane angle of stator outlet. In practice &lt;math&gt;(\frac{V_f}{2U})&lt;/math&gt;  is substituted as ϕ and &lt;math&gt; (\tan {\beta_3} - \tan{\beta_2})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=yahya /&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\tan{\beta_m}&lt;/math&gt; giving&lt;math&gt;  R= \phi \tan{\beta_m}.&lt;/math&gt; The degree of reaction now depends only on ϕ and &lt;math&gt;\tan{\beta_m}&lt;/math&gt; which again depend on geometrical parameters β3 and β2 i.e. the vane angles of stator outlet and rotor outlet. Using the velocity triangles degree of reaction can be derived as:&lt;ref name=dixon /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{V_f}{2U}(\tan{\beta_3} - \tan{\alpha_2}) &lt;/math&gt;
This relation is again very useful when the rotor blade angle and rotor vane angle are defined for the given geometry.

==Choice of reaction (R) and effect on efficiency==

[[File:Influence of reaction on total to static efficiency..jpg|border|380px|right|thumb|Figure 3. Influence of reaction on total-to-static efficiency with fixed value of stage loading factor]]

The Figure 3&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A. H., Soderberg, C. R., Stenning, A. H., Taylor, E. S. and Horlock, J. H. (1957). Notes on Turbomachinery. Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; alongside shows the variation of  total-to-static efficiency at different blade loading coefficient with the degree of reaction.
The governing equation is written as 
:&lt;math&gt; R= 1 + \frac{\Delta W}{2 U^2} - \frac{C_{y2}}{U}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta W}{2 U^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is the stage loading factor.  The diagram shows the optimization of total - to - static efficiency at a given stage loading factor, by a suitable choice of reaction. It is evident from the diagram that for a fixed stage loading factor that there is a relatively small change in total-to-static efficiency for a wide range of designs.

===50% reaction===

The degree of reaction contributes to the stage efficiency and thus used as a design parameter. Stages having 50% degree of reaction are used where the pressure drop is equally shared by the stator and the [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] for a [[turbine]]. 
[[File:Velocity triangle for Degree of Reaction = 1⁄2 in a turbine.jpg|border|380px|thumb|Figure 4. Velocity triangle for Degree of Reaction = 1/2 in a turbine]]

This reduces the tendency of [[boundary layer]] separation from the blade surface avoiding large [[stagnation pressure]] losses.

If R= {{frac|1|2|}}  then from the relation of degree of reaction,|{{EquationRef|C}}| α2 = β3 and the [[velocity triangle]] (Figure 4.) is symmetric. The stage [[enthalpy]] gets equally distributed in the stage (Figure 5.) . In addition the [[wikt:whirl|whirl]] components are also the same at the inlet of [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] and [[Turbine|diffuser]].

===Reaction less than 50%===

Stage having reaction less than half suggest that pressure drop or enthalpy drop in the 
rotor is less than the pressure drop in the stator for the turbine. The same follows for a pump or [[Gas compressor|compressor]] as shown in Figure 6. Therefore the stator has a larger contribution to the total work extracted or work done. From the relation for degree of reaction, 
|{{EquationRef|C}}| α2 &gt; β3.

=== Reaction more than 50% ===

Stage having reaction more than half suggest that pressure drop or enthalpy drop in the rotor is more than the pressure drop in the stator for the turbine. The same follows for a pump or compressor. Thus in this case the rotor has a larger contribution to the total work extracted or work done. From the relation for degree of reaction,|{{EquationRef|C}}| α2 &lt; β3 which is also shown in corresponding Figure 7.

=== Reaction = zero ===

This is special case used for impulse turbine which suggest that entire pressure drop in the turbine is obtained in the stator. 
The stator performs a nozzle action converting pressure head to velocity head and extracting work. It is difficult to achieve adiabatic expansion in the impulse stage, i.e. expansion only in the nozzle, due to irreversibility involved, in actual practice. Figure 8 shows the corresponding enthalpy drop for the reaction = 0 case.

At this boundary two layers of ions with opposing polarity form if a voltage is applied, one at the surface of the electrode, and one in the electrolyte. The two layers of ions are separated by a single layer of solvent molecules that [[Adhesion|adheres]] to the surface of the electrode and acts like a [[dielectric]] in a conventional [[capacitor]].

The amount of [[electric charge]] stored in double-layer capacitance is linearly proportional to the applied [[voltage]] and depends primarily on the electrode surface. The unit of capacitance is the [[farad]].

{{See also|Supercapacitor}}[[File:EDLC-simplified-principle.png|thumb|right|250px| Simplified view of a double-layer of negative ions in the electrode and solvated positive ions in the liquid electrolyte, separated by a layer of polarized solvent molecules.]]

[[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] laid the theoretical foundations for understanding the double layer phenomenon. The formation of double layers is exploited in every [[Supercapacitor|electrochemical capacitor]] to store electrical energy.

Every capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically separated by a separator. These are electrically connected via the electrolyte, a mixture of positive and negative ions dissolved in a [[solvent]] such as water. Where the liquid electrolyte contacts the electrode's conductive metallic surface, an interface is formed which represents a common boundary between the two phases of matter. It is at this interface that the double layer effect occurs.&lt;ref name=Stojek /&gt;&lt;ref name="EDL" /&gt;

When a voltage is applied to the capacitor, two layers of polarized ions are generated at the electrode interfaces. One layer is within the solid electrode (at the surfaces of crystal grains from which it is made that are in contact with the electrolyte). The other layer, with opposite polarity, forms from [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissolved]] and [[Solvation|solvated]] ions distributed in the electrolyte that have moved towards the polarized electrode. These two layers of polarized ions are separated by a monolayer of solvent [[molecules]]. The molecular monolayer forms the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). It adheres by physical [[adsorption]] on the electrode surface and separates the oppositely polarized ions from each other, forming a molecular [[dielectric]].

The amount of charge in the electrode is matched by the magnitude of counter-charges in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). This is the area close to the IHP, in which the polarized electrolyte ions are collected. This separation of two layers of polarized ions through the double-layer stores electrical charges in the same way as in a conventional capacitor. The double-layer charge forms a [[Static electricity|static electric]] [[Electric field|field]] in the molecular IHP layer of the solvent molecules that corresponds to the strength of the applied voltage.

The "thickness" of a charged layer in the metallic electrode, i.e., the average extension perpendicular to the surface, is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm, and mainly depends on the electron density because the atoms in solid electrodes are stationary. In the electrolyte, the thickness depends on the size of the solvent molecules and of the movement and concentration of ions in the solvent. It ranges from 0.1 to 10&amp;nbsp;nm as described by the [[Debye length]]. The sum of the thicknesses is the total thickness of a double layer.

The IHP's small thickness creates a strong electric field E over the separating solvent molecules. At a potential difference of, for example, U = 2&amp;nbsp;V and a molecular thickness of d = 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm, the electric field strength is

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{U}{d} = \frac{2\ \text{V}}{0{,}4\ \text{nm}} = 5000\ \text{kV/mm}&lt;/math&gt;

To compare this figure with values from other capacitor types requires an estimation for [[electrolytic capacitors]], the capacitors with the thinnest dielectric among conventional capacitors. The voltage proof of [[aluminum oxide]], the dielectric layer of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, is approximately 1.4&amp;nbsp;nm/V. For a 6.3&amp;nbsp;V capacitor therefore the layer is 8.8&amp;nbsp;nm. The electric field is 6.3&amp;nbsp;V/8.8&amp;nbsp;nm = 716&amp;nbsp;kV/mm, around 7 times lower than in the double-layer. The [[field strength]] of some 5000&amp;nbsp;kV/mm is unrealizable in conventional capacitors. No conventional dielectric material could prevent charge carrier breakthrough. In a double-layer capacitor the chemical stability of the solvent's molecular bonds prevents breakthrough.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Gräser, Christoph Schmid: ''Supercap, Grundlagen - Eigenschaften – Anwendungen.'' Berner Fachhochschule, Semesterarbeit in Technologie und Deutsch ([http://home.datacomm.ch/graeser/Dateien/supercap.pdf PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The forces that cause the adhesion of solvent molecules in the IHP are physical forces rather than chemical bonds. Chemical bonds exist within the adsorbed molecules, but they are polarized.

The magnitude of the electric charge that can accumulate in the layers corresponds to the concentration of the adsorbed ions and the electrodes surface. Up to the electrolyte's [[Electrical breakdown|decomposition voltage]], this arrangement behaves like a capacitor in which the stored electrical charge is linearly dependent on the [[voltage]].
 
[[File:EDLC-Charge-Distribution.png|thumb|right|300px|Structure and function of an ideal double-layer capacitor.  Applying a voltage to the capacitor at both electrodes a Helmholtz double-layer will be formed separating the adhered ions in the electrolyte in a mirror charge distribution of opposite polarity]]

The double-layer is like the dielectric layer in a conventional capacitor, but with the thickness of a single molecule. Using the early Helmholtz model to calculate the capacitance the model predicts a constant [[differential capacitance]] C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; independent from the charge density, even depending on the dielectric constant ε and the charge layer separation δ.

:&lt;math&gt;\ C_d = \frac{\epsilon}{4 \pi \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

If the electrolyte solvent is water then the influence of the high field strength creates a [[permittivity]] ε of 6 (instead of 80 without an applied electric field) and the layer separation δ ca. 0.3&amp;nbsp;nm, the Helmholtz model predicts a differential capacitance value of about 18&amp;nbsp;µF/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name= "Srinivasan"&gt;S.

This capacitance can be calculated with:

:&lt;math&gt;C= \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;.

The capacitance C is greatest in components made from materials with a high permittivity ε, large electrode plate surface areas A and a small distance d between plates. Because activated carbon electrodes have a very high surface area and an extremely thin double-layer distance which is on the order of a few [[ångström]]s (0.3-0.8&amp;nbsp;nm), it is understandable why supercapacitors have the highest capacitance values among the capacitors (in the range of 10 to 40&amp;nbsp;µF/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Halper"&gt;{{cite techreport|author= Marin S. Halper, James C. Ellenbogen |title= Supercapacitors: A Brief Overview |publisher=MITRE Nanosystems Group|date= March 2006|url= http://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/06_0667.pdf ||accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite techreport|author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A SURVEY OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SUPERCAPACITOR TECHNOLOGY |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In real produced supercapacitors with a high amount of double-layer capacitance the capacitance value depends first on electrode surface and DL distance. Parameters such as electrode material and structure, electrolyte mixture, and amount of [[pseudocapacitance]] also contribute to capacitance value.&lt;ref name=Stojek /&gt;

Because an electrochemical capacitor is composed out of two electrodes, electric charge in the Helmholtz layer at one electrode is mirrored (with opposite polarity) in the second Helmholtz layer at the second electrode. Therefore, the total capacitance value of a double-layer capacitor is the result of two capacitors connected in series. If both electrodes have approximately the same capacitance value, as in symmetrical supercapacitors, the total value is roughly half that of one electrode.

'''Evopod''' is a unique [[tidal energy]] device being developed by a [[UK]]-based company Oceanflow Energy Ltd for generating electricity from tidal streams and [[ocean currents]]. It can operate in exposed deep water sites where severe wind and waves also make up the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbon-innovation.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=517&amp;sid=c42fa5148565f6575c1d0242767a3660 A recent article about Oceanflow Energy Ltd from www.carbon-innovation.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floating tethered turbines==

=== Advantages ===
[[Image:Evopod Installed.JPG|thumb|400px|Evopod - Installed in Strangford Lough 2009]]
*The [[flow speed]] in tidal streams and ocean currents tends to be fastest near the surface and falls off in speed as one descend in the [[water column]]. As the power that can be extracted from the free flowing water is proportional to the velocity cubed, then a 10% increase in flow speed equates to a 33% increase in power per unit swept area of the turbine.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Black and Veatch (17-7-2005) [http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/NR/rdonlyres/19E09EBC-5A44-4032-80BB-C6AFDAD4DC73/0/TidalStreamResourceandTechnologySummaryReport.pdf "TIDAL STREAM ENERGY - RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY SUMMARY REPORT"] (PDF) Retrieved on 11-06-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The flow is generally more consistent in the top 1/3 of the water column as it is well away from disturbances created by the seabed [[topography]].
*The drag force on turbines of the same power output is proportionally less for a turbine in faster flow (positioned in the upper part of the water column) than a turbine in slower flow (positioned in the lower part of the water column).
*A floating device does not require a flat seabed as the pile anchors require relatively little space and there is no structure on the seabed.
*Turbines supported by floating platforms are more readily accessible for maintenance than those on the seabed.
*Maintaining watertight seals is less problematic for devices positioned higher in the water column as they are not subject to such extreme static pressures.
*Floating devices that are fitted with navigation lights and markings are more readily identifiable under international navigation regulations than unmarked submerged turbines.

=== Disadvantages ===
*Floating devices are subject to [[ocean wave]] action which can induce motions that will impact on the performance of the turbines they support; semi-submerged devices such as Evopod are designed to be a stable platform in waves so that they can operate for longer and extract more energy from the wave particle velocity.  Waves large enough to have an adverse effect on Evopod would affect turbines in all parts of the water column.
*[[Wind wave|Ocean waves]] create an orbital movement of the water particles which will add or subtract from the steady ocean current or tidal stream velocity as the wave passes the turbine. Without proper blade pitch or power take-off control systems this could lead to the blade stalling and loss of power output. With proper control systems it is possible to extract this kinetic energy from the waves, much as a wind turbine does in response to wind gusts. The wave [[particle velocity]] for short wave reduces with water depth and is therefore less of an issue for deeply submerged turbines.  As the wavelength gets longer than it becomes a shallow water wave where there is little change in velocity in the water column.
*The vertical component of the mooring load induced by the drag of the turbine can pull a floating platform under the water unless it is adequately compensated for by change in buoyancy forces, e.g. the submergence of the struts on Evopod, or hydrodynamic lift forces (lifting foils).  Tests have shown residual buoyancy in Evopods is sufficient to withstand these forces with the extra bonus of improve system stability.  
*Floating devices have to be robust enough to withstand impact from flotsam and in Northern latitudes may need to be designed to cope with ice floes.  This is however true for all turbines as flotsam may be fully submerged and therefore impact any seabed turbine.

== Design features ==

===Hull design and rotating midwater buoy===

[[Image:Evopod lighter.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A 3d rendering of Evopod.]]
The device differentiates itself from other tidal turbines in that the turbine is mounted on a floating, semi-submerged body that is tethered to the seabed. The power generation equipment is similar to that of a wind turbine and is housed in the cylindrical shaped watertight lower hull, which is deeply submerged below the water line and supported by small waterplane area surface piercing struts.

One variant of this patented hull concept has three vertical struts that pierce the water surface, much like a multi-hull [[SWATH]] design. The two transversely separated aft struts provide the stability that is needed to resist the torque reacted by the single turbine/generator unit. The configuration of the struts also ensure that the device weathervanes about its midwater mooring buoy such that it always points into the direction of the current.

The device is moored by a mid-water buoy, which is fixed to the seabed by four spread mooring lines which are anchored to the sea-bed by pile or gravity anchors. The buoy design is also unique in that it encompasses a geo-fixed part that is anchored to the seabed and a rotating part that is linked to Evopod by a rigid yoke. The turbine drag forces are therefore transmitted through a bearing system linking the fixed and rotating parts of the buoy. A slip ring power export swivel is located in the buoy so that twist is not imparted into the umbilical cable that takes the power from the midwater buoy to the seabed. A subsea power export cable links the umbilical’s seabed connection point to the shore.

With the weather-vaning hull design and rotational midwater buoy, Evopod generates electricity with both the ebb and flood tides by always pointing into the tide’s direction of flow. This gives it a generating time of roughly 20 hours per/lunar day (approx 24hrs 50 minutes).

In comparison to other marine bodies that float on the surface of the ocean, Evopod’s semi-submerged hull form is hardly affected by the passing waves. It is also designed to be readily detachable from the mid-water buoy for recovery operations. Developing safe installation, maintenance and recovery operations in the hazardous environment of fast flowing currents is one of the biggest challenges facing tidal energy device developers.

The device is designed for deep water sites, such as the [[Pentland Firth]] (Up to 60meters water depth, flow speed 6&amp;nbsp;m/s). Deep water sites in UK waters have the fastest flow speeds and have the greatest potential for electricity generation.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

== Testing and collaboration==
[[Image:Evopod Pre-Launch, Portaferry Northern Ireland.jpg|thumb|300px]]

===Evopod 1/40th scale tank testing, Newcastle University, England===

A 1/40th scale model of Evopod was initially tested in the test tank of [[Newcastle University]] during a proof of concept phase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/marine/about/facilities/towingtank.html Towing Tank - Marine Science and Technology - Newcastle University]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1kW Evopod tidal test facility demonstration, Tees Barrage, England===

The 1/10 scale device was initially used to demonstrate the tidal test facilities at the [[Tees Barrage]] in Thornaby-on-Tees near Middlesbrough, UK by [[NaREC|Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsletters.narec.co.uk/newsletters/view.aspx?nl=2&amp;it=3 NaREC Launches Tidal Testing Facility]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1kW Evopod sea testing, Portaferry, Northern Ireland===

In 2008 a 1/10 scale Evopod device was installed and tested in the tidal flow through [[Strangford Narrows]] near [[Portaferry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Over a period of two years the device collected data but was not connected to the grid under the Supergen Marine Energy Research Programme&lt;ref name = Supergen&gt;Supergen Marine Energy Annual Assembly - Prof Trevor Whittaker, Dr Graeme Savage, Dr Matt Folley, Mr Cuan Boake (1-10-2008) [http://www.supergen-marine.org.uk/drupal/files/events/assembly_2008_presentations/Progress_towards_sea_TW.pdf "Progress Towards the Sea"] (PDF) Retrieved on 21-8-2012&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with [[Queen's University Belfast]], amongst others. In 2011 the device was upgraded to include a power export solution which feeds Evopod's generated power onshore to the Queen's University Marine Laboratory. The power is currently fed into the mains circuit of the Marine Laboratory, with plans to be fully grid connected in the near future.

===35kW Evopod sea testing, Sanda Sound, Scotland===

In 2010 Oceanflow Energy were awarded a Scottish WATERS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/your-sector/energy/energy-funding/wave-and-tidal-energy-fund.aspx Scottish Executive WATERS grant funding press release&lt;/ref&gt; grant to "Build and deploy the ‘Evopod’, a 35 kilowatt floating grid connected tidal energy turbine at Sanda Sound in South Kintyre".

== Awards ==

Oceanflow Energy and Evopod have won several awards, the most recent being the Shell Springboard Regional award in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shellspringboard.org/winning-ideas/winning-ideas-2009/29 Shell Springboard Winning Ideas 2009 - Oceanflow Energy]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also won awards for “innovation of the year” and “green business of the year” in the North East of England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">An '''explosive-driven ferroelectric generator''' ('''EDFEG''', '''explosively pumped ferroelectric generator''', '''EPFEG''', or '''FEG''') is a compact [[pulsed power]] generator, a device used for generation of short high-[[voltage]] high-[[electric current|current]] pulse. The energies available are fairly low, in the range of single joules, the voltages range in tens of kilovolts to over 100 kV, and the powers range in hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts.&lt;ref name=eppbook&gt;{{cite book |author1=Larry L. Altgilbers |author2=Jason Baird |author3=Bruce L. Freeman |author4=Christopher S. Lynch |author5=Sergey I.

ECFEGs operate by releasing the electrical charge stored in the [[poling (piezoelectricity)|poled]] crystal structure of a suitable [[ferroelectric material]], e.g. [[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]], by an intense mechanical shock.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F4520397%2F4530649%2F04530693.pdf%3Farnumber%3D4530693&amp;authDecision=-203] They are a kind of [[phase transition]] generators.

The structure of an EDFEG is generally a block of a suitable [[high explosive]], accelerating a metal plate into a target made of ferroelectric material.[http://www.lokiconsult.com/products.html]

FEGs find multiple uses due to their compact character; charging banks of capacitors, initiation of [[slapper detonator]] arrays in [[nuclear weapon]]s and other devices, driving [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, powering pulsed [[neutron generator]]s, seed power sources for stronger pulse generators (e.g. [[EPFCG]]s), [[electromagnetic pulse]] generators, [[Directed-energy weapon|electromagnetic weapon]]s, [[vector inversion generator]]s, etc.

A 2.4 megawatt [[HERF]] generator (an EDFEG with a [[pulse forming network]] directly driving a [[dipole antenna]]) with peak output frequency at 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz was demonstrated.[http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/115/a115z630.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5621">[[File:Log splitter 86.JPG|thumb|A firewood processor in Russia]]
A '''firewood processor''' is a machine designed to cut and split [[firewood]] with minimal manual handling of the logs. There are typically four main parts of the machine, each dedicated to a separate function. Processing begins with a log pile – a pile of logs that have been de-limbed and cut to an appropriate length, generally {{Convert|10|-|12|ft|m}}. Popular brands include Hakki Pilke, Wood Beaver, DYNA, Multitek and Blockbuster. Many individuals use processors commercially and also privately as a hobby. Others choose to rent them as an alternative to purchasing.

==Log deck==
Logs are stacked onto the log deck using a machine such as a [[Skid-steer loader|skid steer]] or small [[excavator]] with a grapple. Each log is pulled mechanically into a trough that feeds it into position to be sawn into firewood-length pieces (often called “rounds”).

==Saw station==
The log is sawn by either a hydraulically operated [[chainsaw]] harvester bar, or on larger machines, a very large [[circular saw]] blade (slasher saw), or a guillotine powered either directly from a pto (tractor or engine powered) or by hydraulics. When the cut is completed, the "round" drops into position to be split in the next process.  In some guillotine splitters the wood is split as the wood is cut.

==Splitting chamber==
Here, the log is simply forced into a wedge that splits the round into anywhere between two and ten pieces, depending on the size of the logs and the intended market.

==Outfeed==
Typically a conveyor that pulls the split firewood away from the processor and into a waiting delivery truck’s box or a woodpile for later handling. Some setups will use multiple conveyors and introduce a tumbling system to clean the firewood.

The output capacity of a firewood processor varies with the size and cost of the machine, from one cord per hour on a $10,000 entry-level machine, up to five or six cords per hour on a $100,000 industrial machine. (''2012 prices''). ''See notes on output capacity ratings below.''

The choice of machine depends on a large number of variables other than straight production output. Different markets require different processing. For example, people who heat with large outside wood boilers prefer large, slow-burning pieces of hardwood, while a good campfire is made of small pieces of fast-burning softwood. Restaurants with wood-fired ovens prefer small pieces as well, but of hardwood or specialty species.

==Misconceptions and areas of confusion==
The physics of the process demand that it requires a larger machine to make smaller pieces of firewood, and the species of logs being processed may also dictate machine size and power requirements.

==Output ratings==
Every manufacturer lists an output rating of cords per hour. Even the lightest-duty machines will split two cords of green, frozen {{Convert|8|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} Aspen into halves {{Convert|16|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} long quickly. Changing any one of these optimal variables (condition, temperature, size, species, number of splits, or length of round) will reduce the rate of output, making meaningful comparison between manufacturers' claims difficult. The most effective way to determine how fast a machine really is would be either in person or by watching detailed videos of it processing wood.

==Cycle time==
This term is frequently misunderstood. While the definition is understood to be the time it takes the splitter ram to fully extend and retract, there is no consideration of force in this equation. In proper terms, cycle time is simply a mathematical calculation of the size of a cylinder’s bore, stroke and rod diameter, and the ability of that combination to act at a given flow of hydraulic oil in GPM. A properly designed advanced hydraulic systems can use Regenerative systems to both accelerate cycle times and maintain full pressure.

A properly designed advanced hydraulic systems can use Regenerative systems to both accelerate cycle times and maintain full pressure.&lt;ref&gt;http://hydraulicspneumatics.com/other-technologies/book-2-chapter-17-regeneration-circuits?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintenanceresources.com/referencelibrary/ezine/hydraulic.htm Bud Trinkel, Certified Fluid Power Engineer, "10 Ways to Increase Hydraulic Circuit Cycle Speed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saw type==
While most processors use a hydraulic chainsaw bar to cut the logs to length, some use a very large circular saw blade called a slasher blade. They are fast and efficient, requiring little maintenance once set up properly. While the safety of slasher blades has been proven over decades, there are a number of people who will not walk within {{convert|50|ft|m}} of one. The more traditional chainsaw bar setup requires constant oiling and frequent maintenance, but it is simple and familiar work.

==Safety==
The reduction in manual labor is obvious, but few immediately recognize the improvement in safety conditions. Everything related to logging is dangerous, but eliminating a great deal of the need for workers to use chainsaws or wrestle heavy rounds onto a splitter measurably reduces the incidence of injury on these job sites. The fact that it takes fewer workers to produce the same amount of firewood further reduces these risks.

}}
A '''gravity gun''' is a type of device in [[video game]]s, particularly [[first-person shooter]]s using an advanced [[physics engine]], whereby players can directly manipulate objects in the world, often allowing them to be used as projectiles against hostile characters. The concept was first featured in the third-person shooter ''[[Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy]]'' which, while not featuring a dedicated 'gravity gun', allows the player to use telekinesis to manipulate both objects and enemies by moving them or forcefully throwing them around.

The concept was popularized by the gravity gun found in [[Valve Corporation|Valve's]] ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', as well as the Temporal Uplink found in [[Free Radical Design]]'s ''[[TimeSplitters: Future Perfect]]''; although a similar concept was used by [[id Software]] during the production of the earlier game ''[[Doom 3]]'', eventually leading to the introduction of a physics-based weapon in the expansion pack ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil|Resurrection of Evil]]''. Later games, such as ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[Crysis]]'', and ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', have been influenced by the success of these physics-based weapons, adopting their own styles of comparable abilities or weapons.

== Appearances ==
=== ''Half-Life 2'' ===
[[File:HL2 gravitygun.jpg|thumb|''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s gravity gun is capable of turning innocuous objects into weapons, as well as assisting in physics-based puzzles.|alt=In the foreground, a woman from ''Half-Life 2: Deathmatch'' holds a weapon which is glowing orange. A damaged toilet is being held in mid-air by the gun, pointed at gun-wielding enemies in the background.]]
{{See also|Half-Life 2}}
Valve Software's ''Half-Life 2'' made significant use of physics in the game, powered by the [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]]. The physics engine within Source is derived from Havok, which opens up a wealth of possibilities for object interaction – particularly when later in the game, Freeman receives an energy-beam weapon that lets him move huge objects. Although the player can pick up and throw objects early in the game, this ability is somewhat limited in scope. Around a quarter of the way through the game, the player acquires the gravity gun, properly named as the "[[Zero-point energy|Zero-point Energy]] Field Manipulator". [[Alyx Vance]] explains that the gravity gun is designed for handling hazardous materials, but is mostly used for heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation]]|year=2004|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|level=Black Mesa East| quote='''Alyx Vance''': Its designed for handling hazardous materials, but we mainly use it for heavy lifting. [...] I've found it handy for clearing minefields.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explains to Gordon that she once found it useful "for clearing [[land mine|minefields]]". The gravity gun significantly increases the player's ability to manipulate objects in the game. Like most other weapons in the game, the gravity gun has two trigger functions. The primary trigger causes the gun to emit a small discharge which emits energy to the targeted object. The distance which the object is forced is dependent on its weight and distance from the gun. The secondary trigger attracts the targeted object to the gun and holds it in midair a few inches away, negating its weight and allowing the player to carry it with them. Using the secondary trigger again will drop the item, while the primary trigger will launch it with considerable force.

By combining these functions, players can use the gravity gun to scale barriers and obstacles, create cover against enemy characters, or launch the objects at enemy characters, causing them considerable damage. Certain types of objects, such as saw blades, fuel barrels and hydrogen tanks are intentionally designed by Valve to be used as "gravity gun ammunition". The gravity gun, however, cannot manipulate heavier objects and enemy characters until the late stages of the game, when the device becomes temporarily infused with [[dark energy]] meant to destroy it.

The gravity gun was very well received by critics, who considered it one of the defining features of ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s entertainment value.&lt;ref name="edge143"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2004|title=''Half-Life 2'' review|journal=Edge|issue=143|quote=Tearing a radiator from a wall and using it to swat a parasitic headcrab, while all the furniture in a room goes tumbling around you, is truly a gaming epiphany.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planet Half-Life called the gravity gun "the next level in interactive gaming."&lt;ref name="PHL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Editorials.Detail&amp;id=18 |title=The Gravity Gun: The Next Level in Interactive Gaming |publisher=[[Planet Half-Life]] |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227141357/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Editorials.Detail&amp;id=18 |archivedate=December 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' described ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s gravity gun as the "thinking man's death tool," which lets players "toy with gravity to kill foes with everyday objects." [[Call of Duty|''Call of Duty'' series]] military adviser [[Hank Keirsey]] stated that "the weapon is not very practical".  He did, however, discuss its historical precedents, further stating that "The ancients learned very early how to use gravity to their advantage — but this usually involved rolling rocks down hills or pouring boiling oil down the castle walls. Those that failed to respect gravity suffered."&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' features seven notable video game weapons and for each of them divides the profiles into sections headed as "The Gun," "Keirsey says...Practicality," "Historical precedents," and "Lethality level."  See Evan Shamoon, "Gun Show: A real military expert takes aim at videogame weaponry to reveal the good, the bad, and the just plain silly," ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 230 (July 2008): 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on later games ==
=== ''TimeSplitters: Future Perfect'' Temporal Uplink ===

It was not until the third installment of the TimeSplitters franchise, ''[[TimeSplitters: Future Perfect]]'', that the Temporal Uplink was given the ability to manipulate the physics in the game. In ''Future Perfect'', the Temporal Uplink played a much larger role than that of its previous, map and mini-game oriented functionality, which the device was originally used for in ''[[TimeSplitters 2]]''. Worn on the wrist of the main player character Sergeant Cortez, the uplink provides a map and the ability to pick up and throw objects, as well as the capability to activate switches remotely. Its grabbing abilities range from picking up weapons and ammo for use by the player in addition to launching objects from a distance at foes. This makes it an especially useful weapon for dispatching larger groups of enemies in the event that the player comes across one of the many explosive barrels placed throughout maps in the campaign mode of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/timesplitters-3/531095p1.html|title=''TimeSplitters: Future Perfect'' Preview|last=Lopez|first=Miguel|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=July 16, 2004|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Doom 3'' grabber ===
{{See also|Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil}}
[[File:Ionized plasma levitator.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Doom 3'' grabber enables the player to return enemy projectiles to their origin.|alt=A nondescript figure stands in the foreground, holding a gun which is emitting a rope-esque beam of light which appears to be manipulating the matter around it.]]
Although ''Half-Life 2'' and ''TimeSplitters: Future Perfect'' were the first games released to feature a gravity gun (the former released on November 16, 2004 and the latter released on March 21, 2005), [[id Software]] had previously conceived a similar idea during the development of the earlier title ''[[Doom 3]]''. id Software designer Matt Hooper noted that "we actually used it as a tool throughout development where we'd grab physics objects and place them around the world".&lt;ref name="GSpy RoE preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/doom-3-resurrection-of-evil/577592p1.html|title=''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil'' Preview|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|last=Accardo|first=Sal|date=January 5, 2005|accessdate=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool was used to create "damaged" rooms in ''Doom 3''; instead of constructing a ruined room, the designers would code a pristine room and use the device to "damage" it realistically. Although used to assist the development of ''Doom 3'', the gravity gun was not implemented in the final game. Hooper explained that "we talked about that quite a few times, but we had such a big arsenal of weapons, and so many other cool things going on, that it was just one of those things that never made it in".&lt;ref name="GSpy RoE preview" /&gt; However, [[Nerve Software]] revived the code for the weapon five months after the release of ''Half-Life 2'' in ''Doom 3''{{'}}s [[expansion pack]], ''Resurrection of Evil''.

The device is noted in the ''Doom 3'' storyline as an "ionized plasma levitator", created by the Union Aerospace Corporation for moving hazardous materials and a forerunner to [[tractor beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]|developer=[[Nerve Software]]|date=2005|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|level=Black Mesa East|quote='''UAC narrator:''' The prototype ionized plasma levitator was designed to transport hazardous materials without physical contact... With further research and development, uses for this technology would include heavy lifting and the ability to create tractor beams, thereby making low gravity docking procedures much safer for pilots.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually referred to as the "grabber", the player obtains the device early on in the course of ''Resurrection of Evil''. The grabber operates differently from ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s gravity gun, using only a single trigger function. Once the grabber is aimed at an appropriate object, it locks on, allowing the player to lift the object with the trigger.&lt;ref name="grabber" /&gt; When the player releases the trigger, the object will be propelled forward with force, turning it into an impromptu weapon. One key ability of the grabber is its capacity to lock on to the fireball projectiles cast by some hostile non-player characters, allowing players to turn the attack against their foe. However, unlike the gravity gun in ''Half-Life 2'', the grabber cannot hold objects for as long as the player wishes; if they wait too long to launch the object, the grabber will start to overload and disengage, dropping the object gently on the ground.&lt;ref name=grabber&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetdoom.gamespy.com/static.php?page=ROE%20Weapons&amp;game=4 |title=''ROE'' Weapons |work=Planet Doom |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |archivedate=September 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911153627/http://planetdoom.gamespy.com/static.php?page=ROE+Weapons&amp;game=4 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics often compared the grabber directly with ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s gravity gun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/doom-3-resurrection-of-evil/601519p1.html|title=''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil'' Review|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|last=Accardo|first=Sal|date=March 4, 2005|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; some noting that the device was far more combat-focused in operation than the gravity gun; in particular, the ability to turn projectiles cast by enemies against them was praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/doom3resurrectionofevil/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review |title=''Doom 3'': Resurrection of Evil for PC Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |last=Shoemaker |first=Brad |date=March 5, 2005 |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912035058/http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/doom3resurrectionofevil/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Bread-review |archivedate=September 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the grabber was considered somewhat "awkward" to use, requiring a "finesse" that "is rarely something the player has time for in a close-quarters situation".&lt;ref name="IGN D3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/601/601442p1.html|title=''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil'' Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Tom|last=McNamara|date=March 4, 2005|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Various other video games have included gameplay features that allow players to use the game's physics to their advantage in combat. In some cases, these are manifested as weapons or devices. For instance, ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (also created by Valve Software) features the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device which displays a limited capacity to move objects around the game world, while [[Crytek]]'s ''[[Crysis]]'' allows the player to throw objects and enemy characters considerable distances through the use of an experimental [[Powered exoskeleton|nanosuit]].

In other games, however, it can be represented in a different manner:
*In [[Arkane Studios]]' ''[[Dark Messiah of Might and Magic]]'' a [[psychokinesis]] spell allows for similar functions as ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s gravity gun.
*''[[Destroy All Humans!]]'' portrayed a similar gravity usage, known as PK.
*[[2K Games]]'s ''[[BioShock]]'' displays the concept as a telekinesis [[BioShock#Gameplay|plasmid]].
*In EA's third-person horror shooter ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', the player character acquires a 'Kinesis' module, which allows the player to grab and throw objects.{{or|date=February 2014}}
*in the ''[[Open Arena]]'' mod Powerball, there is a weapon called gravity mine launcher, a modified version of the [[grenade launcher]] that release gravity mines, that attract to them any too close player.
*In ''[[Garry's Mod]]'', one of the items is a gravity gun directly imported from ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. It also includes a Physics Gun, a modified gravity gun which can position items and limbs as well as freeze them.

== Reception ==
On their list of top 100 weapons which originated in video games, [[IGN]] ranked the gravity gun #5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/video-game-weapons/5|title=Gravity Gun - #5 Top Video Game Weapons|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[GamesRadar]]'s list of top 100 weapons in video games, the gravity gun was ranked #2 just behind the [[Cerebral Bore]] from ''[[Turok 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/100-best-weapons-video-games/|title=The 100 Best Weapons in Video Games|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hammeren Hydroelectric Power Station''' ({{lang-no|Hammeren kraftstasjon}}) is a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[power station]] located in [[Oslo]], Norway. It is the only power station in Oslo, and among the oldest power stations still running in Norway. It has a total installed capacity of 5&amp;nbsp;MW, and an annual production of 16&amp;nbsp;GWh. The power station utilises the waterfalls from [[Skjærsjøen]] to [[Maridalsvannet]], with a total height of 105&amp;nbsp;m. It was established in 1900 by the company Christiania Elektricitetsværk, originally with 4 generator units, and increased to six units in 1901. In 1927 the six generators were replaced by a single 5.6&amp;nbsp;MW unit.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hammeren kraftstasjon |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Hammeren_kraftstasjon |language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jahnsen&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Kraftverket ved Hammeren|first=Jahn Børe |last=Jahnsen|title=Maridalen|pages=78–80|isbn=82-504-1724-0|publisher=Grøndahl|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hard Water Calcification.jpg|thumb|A [[bathtub]] [[faucet]] with built-up calcification from hard water.]]
'''Hard water''' is [[water]] that has high [[mineral]] content (in contrast with "[[soft water]]"). Hard water is formed when water [[percolation|percolates]] through deposits of [[limestone]] and [[chalk]] which are largely made up of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] carbonates.

Hard [[drinking water]] may have moderate health benefits, but can pose critical problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in [[boiler]]s, [[cooling tower]]s, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of [[foam]] formation when [[soap]] is agitated in water, and by the formation of [[limescale]] in kettles and water heaters.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf Hardness in Drinking-Water], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever water hardness is a concern, [[water softening]] is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects.

==Sources of hardness==
Water's hardness is determined by the [[concentration]] of [[multivalent]] [[cations]] in the water. Multivalent cations are positively charged [[metal complex]]es with a charge greater than 1+. Usually, the cations have the charge of 2+. Common cations found in hard water include Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. These ions enter a water supply by leaching from minerals within an [[aquifer]]. Common [[calcium]]-containing minerals are [[calcite]] and [[gypsum]]. A common [[magnesium]] mineral is [[dolomite]] (which also contains calcium). [[Rainwater]] and [[distillation|distilled]] water are [[soft water|soft]], because they contain few [[ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;[[Hermann Weingärtner]], "Water" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]], 2006[December], Wiley–VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[equilibrium reaction]] describes the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolving]] and formation of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium bicarbonate]] (on the right):
:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) ⇋ Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

The reaction can go in either direction. Rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it. The calcium carbonate may be re-deposited as calcite as the carbon dioxide is lost to atmosphere, sometimes forming [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s.

Calcium and magnesium ions can sometimes be removed by water softeners.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Nitsch, Hans-Joachim Heitland, Horst Marsen, Hans-Joachim Schlüussler, "Cleansing Agents" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] 2005, Wiley–VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a07_137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary hardness===
{{see also|Carbonate hardness}}
Temporary hardness is a type of water hardness caused by the presence of [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] [[bicarbonate]] [[mineral]]s ([[calcium bicarbonate]] and [[magnesium bicarbonate]]). When dissolved, these minerals yield calcium and magnesium [[cations]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] [[anion]]s (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the [[#Permanent hardness|permanent hardness]] caused by [[sulphate]] and [[chloride]] [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s, this "temporary" hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water, or by the addition of [[lime (mineral)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) through the process of [[lime softening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lime Softening| url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/softeninglime.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.

===Permanent hardness===
Permanent hardness is hardness (mineral content) that cannot be removed by [[boiling]]. When this is the case, it is usually caused by the presence of [[calcium sulphate]]/[[calcium chloride]] and/or [[magnesium sulphate]]/[[magnesium chloride]] in the water, which do not precipitate out as the [[temperature]] increases. Ions causing permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener, or [[ion exchange|ion exchange column]].

Total Permanent Hardness = Permanent Calcium Hardness + Permanent Magnesium Hardness

==Effects==
With hard water, soap solutions form a white precipitate ([[soap scum]]) instead of producing [[Foam|lather]], because the 2+ ions destroy the [[surfactant]] properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate (the soap scum). A major component of such scum is [[calcium stearate]], which arises from [[sodium stearate]], the main component of [[soap]]:
:2 C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) → (C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca (s)
Hardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample, or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap. Synthetic [[detergent]]s do not form such scums.
[[File:Eifelwasserleitung05.jpg|right|thumb|210px|A portion of the ancient Roman [[Eifel aqueduct]] in Germany. After being in service for about 180 years, the aqueduct had mineral deposits of up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm thick along the walls.]]

Hard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing. These deposits, called "[[Fouling|scale]]", are composed mainly of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and [[heat exchanger]]s. This precipitation (formation of an insoluble solid) is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.wi.gov/regulations/labcert/documents/training/basics-genchem.pdf Wisconisin DNR - Carbonate chemistry]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat. In a pressurized system, this overheating can lead to failure of the boiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/hardwater.html |title=Hard water and water softening |accessdate=2007-10-08 |author=Stephen Lower |date=July 2007 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies on the crystalline form, for example, [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |title=Scale reduction and scale modification effects induced by Zn |accessdate=2010-03-29 |author=PP Coetzee|month= | year=1998 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]], in this case, hard water, can also lead to [[galvanic corrosion]], in which one metal will preferentially [[corrode]] when in contact with another type of metal, when both are in contact with an electrolyte. The softening of hard water by ion exchange does not increase its [[corrosivity]] ''per se''. Similarly, where lead plumbing is in use, softened water does not substantially increase [[Lead (element)|plumbo]]-solvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

In swimming pools, hard water is manifested by a [[Turbidity|turbid]], or cloudy (milky), appearance to the water. Calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water. The solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong ([[Periodic table#Groups|group 2 of the periodic table]]) increases moving down the column. Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming the insoluble carbonates, giving rise to the turbidity.  This often results from the pH being excessively high (pH &gt; 7.6). Hence, a common solution to the problem is, while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level, to lower the pH by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the optimum value being in the range of 7.2 to 7.6.

===Softening===
{{Main|Water softening}}
It is often desirable to soften hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practised, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening involves the use of [[ion exchange resin]]s, which replace ions like Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by twice the number of monocations such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] ions.

Washing soda ([[sodium carbonate]] - Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.

===Health considerations===
The [[World Health Organization]] says that "there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans".&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; In fact, the [[United States National Research Council]] has found that hard water actually serves as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-research.net/hardness.htm |title=Drinking Water Hardwater Hardness Calcium Magnesium Scale Stained Laundry |publisher=Water-research.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have shown a weak [[inverse relationship]] between water hardness and [[cardiovascular disease]] in men, up to a level of 170&amp;nbsp;mg calcium carbonate per litre of water. The World Health Organization has reviewed the evidence and concluded the data was inadequate to allow for a recommendation for a level of hardness.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

Recommendations have been made for the maximum and minimum levels of calcium (40–80 [[parts per million|ppm]]) and magnesium (20–30 ppm) in drinking water, and a total hardness expressed as the sum of the calcium and magnesium concentrations of 2–4&amp;nbsp;mmol/L.&lt;ref name="Koz"&gt;František Kožíšek [http://www.aquasafecanada.com/mirror/hardness/hardness.pdf Health significance of drinking water calcium and magnesium], February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have shown weak correlations between cardiovascular health and water hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=[[Stuart Pocock|Pocock SJ]], Shaper AG, Packham RF |title=Studies of water quality and cardiovascular disease in the United Kingdom |journal=Sci.

== Measurement ==
&lt;!--DH links to this section--&gt;
Hardness can be quantified by [[instrumental chemistry|instrumental analysis]]. The total water hardness is the sum of the [[molar concentration]]s of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, in mol/L or mmol/L units. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent [[divalent]] metal ions), [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[manganese]] can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish ([[rust]]-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds).

Water hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration, but rather in various units, such as degrees of general hardness ([[dGH]]), German degrees (°dH), parts per million (ppm, mg/L, or American degrees), grains per gallon (gpg), English degrees (°e, e, or [[Thomas Clark (chemist)|°Clark]]), or French degrees (°fH, °F or °HF; lowercase ''f'' is used to prevent confusion with degrees [[Fahrenheit]]). The table below shows conversion factors between the various units.

The various alternative units represent an equivalent mass of calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that, when dissolved in a unit volume of pure water, would result in the same total molar concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The different conversion factors arise from the fact that equivalent masses of calcium oxide and calcium carbonates differ, and that different mass and volume units are used. The units are as follows:
* ''Parts per million (ppm)'' is usually defined as 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (the definition used below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/CO2/hardness-larryfrank.html|title=Water Hardness|work=thekrib.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equivalent to '''mg/L''' without chemical compound specified, and to '''American degree'''.
* ''[[Grains per Gallon]] (gpg)'' is defined as 1 [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&amp;nbsp;mg) of calcium carbonate per [[U.S. gallon]] (3.79 litres), or 17.118 ppm.
* a ''mmol/L'' is equivalent to 100.09&amp;nbsp;mg/L CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or 40.08&amp;nbsp;mg/L Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.
* A ''degree of General Hardness ([[dGH]]'' or 'German degree (°dH, ''deutsche Härte''))' is defined as 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L CaO or 17.848 ppm.
* A ''Clark degree (°Clark)'' or ''English degrees (°e or e)'' is defined as one [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&amp;nbsp;mg) of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; per [[Imperial gallon]] (4.55 litres) of water, equivalent to 14.254 ppm.
* A ''French degree (°fH or °f)'' is defined as 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, equivalent to 10 ppm.

===Hard/soft classification===
Because it is the precise mixture of minerals dissolved in the water, together with the water's [[pH]] and temperature, that determine the behavior of the hardness, a single-number scale does not adequately describe hardness. However, the [[United States Geological Survey]] uses the following classification into hard and soft water,&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/owq/hardness-alkalinity.html|title=USGS Water-Quality Information: Water Hardness and Alkalinity|author=USGS - U.S. Geological Survey Office of Water Quality|work=usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seawater is considered to be very hard due to various dissolved salts. Typically seawater's hardness is in the range of 6630 ppm. In contrast, freshwater has hardness in the range of 15 - 375 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvdsb.ca/uploads/ScienceProbeware/totalwaterhardness.pdf Total water hardness]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indices===
Several indices are used to describe the behaviour of calcium carbonate in water, oil, or gas mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://64.224.111.143/technicallibrary/corrdoctors/Modules/NaturalWaters/Frames.htm Corrosion by water&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020200711/http://64.224.111.143/technicallibrary/corrdoctors/Modules/NaturalWaters/Frames.htm |date=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Langelier saturation index (LSI)====
The Langelier saturation index&lt;ref name="McTigueSymons2011"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Nancy E. |editor1-last=McTigue |editor2-first=James M.|editor2-last= Symons|title=The Water Dictionary: A Comprehensive Reference of Water Terminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zZuvPDvUAwC&amp;pg=PA333|year=2011|publisher=American Water Works Association|isbn=978-1-61300-101-1|pages=333–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes Langelier stability index) is a calculated number used to predict the calcium carbonate stability of water.&lt;ref name="Reid2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert N. |title=Water Quality Systems: Guide For Facility Managers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dR9iNIqcaa4C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-4010-8|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It indicates whether the water will precipitate, dissolve, or be in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. In 1936, Wilfred Langelier developed a method for predicting the pH at which water is saturated in calcium carbonate (called pHs).&lt;ref name="Langelier1936"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Analytical Control of Anti-Corrosion Water Treatment | last = Langelier | first = W. F. | journal = Journal of the American Water Works Association | date = October 1936|volume=28|issue=10|pp=1500-1521 | jstor=41226418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSI is expressed as the difference between the actual system pH and the saturation pH:&lt;ref name="Aquaprox2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Aquaprox|title=Treatment of cooling water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSH71rjpub8C&amp;pg=PA104|year=2009|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-01985-2|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:LSI = pH (measured) − pHs
* For LSI &gt; 0, water is super saturated and tends to precipitate a scale layer of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
* For LSI = 0, water is saturated (in equilibrium) with CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A scale layer of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is neither precipitated nor dissolved.
* For LSI &lt; 0, water is under saturated and tends to dissolve solid CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

If the actual pH of the water is below the calculated saturation pH, the LSI is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential. If the actual pH exceeds pHs, the LSI is positive, and being supersaturated with CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the water has a tendency to form scale. At increasing positive index values, the scaling potential increases.

In practice, water with an LSI between -0.5 and +0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale forming properties. Water with an LSI below -0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an LSI above +0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale forming properties.

The LSI is temperature sensitive. The LSI becomes more positive as the water temperature increases. This has particular implications in situations where well water is used. The temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the LSI measurement is made. This increase in temperature can cause scaling, especially in cases such as hot water heaters. Conversely, systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling.

====Ryznar Stability Index (RSI)====
The Ryznar stability index (RSI)&lt;ref name="McTigueSymons2011" /&gt;{{rp|525}} uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry.&lt;ref name="Reid2003" /&gt;{{rp|72}}&lt;ref name="Emerson2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=A.

Ryznar saturation index (RSI) was developed from empirical observations of corrosion rates and film formation in steel mains. It is defined as:&lt;ref name="RyznarLangelier1944"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = A New Index for Determining Amount of Calcium Carbonate Scale Formed by a Water

:RSI = 2 pHs – pH (measured)
* For 6,5 &lt; RSI &lt; 7 water is considered to be approximately at saturation equilibrium with calcium carbonate
* For RSI &gt; 8 water is under saturated and, therefore, would tend to dissolve any existing solid CaCO3
* For RSI &lt; 6,5 water tends to be scale forming

== Regional information ==
The hardness of local water supplies depends on the source of water. Water in streams flowing over volcanic (igneous) rocks will be soft, while water from boreholes drilled into porous rock is normally very hard.

=== In Australia ===
Analysis of water hardness in major Australian cities by the Australian Water Association shows a range from very soft (Melbourne) to hard (Adelaide).

[[Prairie]] provinces (mainly [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]) contain high quantities of calcium and magnesium, often as [[dolomite]], which are readily soluble in the groundwater that contains high concentrations of trapped [[carbon dioxide]] from the last [[glaciation]]. In these parts of Canada, the total hardness in ppm of calcium carbonate equivalent frequently exceed 200 ppm, if groundwater is the only source of potable water. The west coast, by contrast, has unusually soft water, derived mainly from mountain lakes fed by glaciers and snowmelt.

Information from the British Drinking Water Inspectorate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwi.gov.uk/ dwi.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; shows that drinking water in [[England]] is generally considered to be 'very hard', with most areas of England, particularly east of a line between the Severn and Tees estuaries, exhibiting above 200 ppm for the calcium carbonate equivalent. Water in London, for example, is mostly obtained from the [[River Thames]] and [[River Lea]] both of which derive significant proportion of their dry weather flow from springs in limestone and chalk aquifers. [[Wales]], [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]] and parts of [[North West England|North-West England]] are softer water areas, and range from 0 to 200 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/_assets/media/Hard_Water_Bro_16-3-09_12PP.pdf anglianwater.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[brewing]] industry in England and Wales, water is often deliberately hardened with [[gypsum]] in the process of [[Burtonisation]].

Generally water is mostly hard in urban areas of England where soft water sources are unavailable. A number of cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the [[industrial revolution]] and urban population burgeoned. [[Manchester]] was a notable such city in North West England and its wealthy corporation built a number of reservoirs at [[Thirlmere]] and [[Haweswater]] in the [[Lake District]] to the north. There is no exposure to [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] in their [[headwaters]] and consequently the water in Manchester is rated as 'very soft'.&lt;ref name="manchester"/&gt; Similarly, tap water in [[Birmingham]] is also soft as it is sourced from the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs]] in Wales.

=== In Ireland ===
The EPA has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in Ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given.&lt;ref&gt;Section 36 "Hardness" https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/quality/Water_Quality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In this section, reference to original EU documentation is given, which sets out no limit for hardness.
In turn, the handbook also gives no "Recommended or Mandatory Limit Values" for Hardness.
The handbooks does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as "Moderately Hard", effects are seen increasingly: "The chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap.... and, more important, that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation. These effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mg/l CaCO3."

=== In the United States ===
A collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120&amp;nbsp;mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories "hard" or "very hard".&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard. More than 85% of American homes have hard water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Amber |last2=Parrott |first2=Kathleen |last3=Ross |first3=Blake |title=Household Water Quality – Water Hardness |url=http://www.aquasafecanada.com/mirror/household-water-quality-water-hardness.htm |date=June 1999 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The softest waters occur in parts of the [[New England]], South Atlantic-Gulf, [[Pacific Northwest]], and [[Hawaii]] regions. Moderately hard waters are common in many of the rivers of the [[Tennessee]], [[Great Lakes]], and Alaska regions. Hard and very hard waters are found in some of the streams in most of the regions throughout the country. The hardest waters (greater than 1,000 ppm) are in streams in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Arizona, Utah, parts of Colorado, southern Nevada, and southern California.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, J.C., and Ficke, J.F.; ''Quality of Rivers of the United States, 1975 Water Year -- Based on the National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN)'': U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 78-200, 436 p.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">'''High lead logging''' is a method of [[cable logging]] using a [[spar (tree)|spar]], [[yarder]] and loader. It was developed by [[Oscar Wirkkala]].  It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two [[winch]]es (or cable drums).  The mainline or yarding line extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the other winch to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line.   Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers.  The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.

The "high lead" feature is added by elevating both lines near the winch or 'head' end.  This is accomplished by running the lines through a block ([[pulley]]) called the "head block" because it is on the head end of the project.  Early on, it was customary to trim and top a tree making it into a 'spar pole' or 'spar tree' for the purpose of supporting the head blocks but gradually the use of wooden spars gave way over the 20th century to the use of steel spars stood up for the purpose. In any event the spars are supported by a number of [[guy wires]].

The reason for elevating the lines (cables) at the head end is to assist in pulling the logs free of obstructions on the ground.  Also if the trees are being partially lifted as they are transported it is less disruptive to the ground which can be an environmental issue.

High lead is a popular method of logging on the West Coast of America.

First used in 1904, with [[Lidgerwood]] winches, and a spar tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">An '''insulation monitoring device''' monitors the [[Earthing system#IT network|ungrounded system]] between an [[active phase conductor]] and [[Ground (electricity)|earth]]. It is intended to give an alert (light and sound) or disconnect the power supply when the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] between the two conductors drops below a set value, usually 50 k[[Ohm|Ω]] (sample of IEC standard for medical applications). The main advantage is that the ungrounded or floating system allows a continuous operation of important consumers such as medical, chemical, military, etc. 

Some manufacturers of monitors for these systems are capable of handling VFDs (Variable Frequency (Speed) Drives). Most, however are not due to issues with the DC-portions of the VFDs.

Most monitors work by injecting low level dc on the line and detecting. Some manufacturers use a patented AMP-monitoring principle (Adapted Measuring Pulse){{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The '''International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC)''' is published by the [[International Code Council]] through the [[governmental consensus]] process and is updated on a three year cycle to include the latest advances in [[technology]] and safest mechanical practices. The current version of this code is the 2018 edition. The IFGC is published in partnership with the [[American Gas Association]] (AGA). The IFGC protects public health and safety for all building systems that use [[fuel gas]] for the design, installation and inspection of such systems by providing minimum safeguards for people at homes, schools and workplace. [[Fuel burning appliance]]s, [[furnace]]s, [[chimney]]s, vents, [[gas pipe]] sizing and many other such issues are addressed in the IFGC.

The IFGC is the most widely used Fuel Gas code in the [[United States]].

The '''José Cabrera Nuclear Power Station''' (also known as '''Zorita'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foronuclear.org/en/2004_a_year_of_nuclear_energy.jsp ::FORO Nuclear::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[nuclear power station]] in [[Almonacid de Zorita]], {{convert|70|km}} east of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

The power plant consisted of a single [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]] of 160&amp;nbsp;MWe, built by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]]. It was operated by [[Unión Fenosa]].&lt;ref name=wnn120210&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR_Jose_Cabrera_moves_into_decommissioning_1202101.html | publisher=World Nuclear News | date=2010-02-11 | title= José Cabrera moves into decommissioning | accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction of the power station started in 1964. It was commissioned in 1968, and it operated from 1968 until 2006. In 2006, it was closed by ministerial order.&lt;ref name=wnn120210/&gt;

On 11 February 2010, Unión Fenosa transferred the site's ownership to Enresa, a Spanish company responsible for decommissioning the power station. Enresa planned to clear the site by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name=wnn120210/&gt;

==2003 incident==

The [[Spanish Nuclear Safety Council]] has investigated the plant's deficient [[Nuclear safety|safety system]] and a missing screw that prevented the reactor from resuming operations after a month-long refueling operation in December 2003.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Decommissioning==
Westinghouse Electric Company has secured a contract for dismantling and segmentation of the Jose Cabrera nuclear power station.

'''Kosovo B Power Station''' is the largest power station in [[Obilić]], [[Kosovo]].{{efn|name=status}} It is a lignite-fired consisting of 2 units with 340 MW generation capacity, which share a {{convert|183|m}} tall chimney with 6.8 metres diameter at the top.

==History==
Kosovo B Power Station was opened in 1983. It was operated by [[EPS Surface Mining Kosovo]] and [[EPS TPP Kosovo]] until the end of [[Kosovo War]]. After [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] administration was established in Kosovo on 1 July 1999, [[Elektroprivreda Srbije]] (EPS) lost its access to the local coal mines and power plants, including [[Kosovo A Power Station|Kosovo A]] and Kosovo B power plants.&lt;ref name="eps - au"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.eps.rs/Eng/Article.aspx?lista=Sitemap&amp;id=9|website=eps.rs|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, it is operated by Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës (KEK).

In this model, the vortex loses strength along the whole wingspan because it is shed as a vortex-sheet from the trailing edge, rather than just at the wing-tips.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ira H. Abbott|Abbott, Ira H.]], and Von Doenhoff, Albert E., ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Section 1.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 8.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Lift distribution over a three-dimensional wing (1).svg|thumb|An unrealistic lift distribution that neglects three-dimensional effects]]
[[File:Lift distribution over a three-dimensional wing (2).svg|thumb|A lift distribution as observed over a (finite) trapezoidal wing]]
On a three-dimensional, finite wing, lift over each wing segment (local lift per unit span, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\tilde L&lt;/math&gt;) does not correspond simply to what two-dimensional analysis predicts. Instead, this local amount of lift is strongly affected by the lift generated at neighboring wing sections.

It is difficult to predict analytically the overall amount of lift that a wing of given geometry will generate. The lifting-line theory yields the lift distribution along the span-wise direction, &lt;math&gt;\tilde L_{(y)}&lt;/math&gt; based only on the wing geometry (span-wise distribution of chord, airfoil, and twist) and flow conditions (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\infty&lt;/math&gt;).

==Principle==
The lifting-line theory applies the concept of [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] and the [[Kutta–Joukowski theorem]],

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde L_{(y)} = \rho V \Gamma_{(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

so that instead of the ''lift'' distribution function, the unknown effectively becomes the distribution of circulation over the span, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{(y)}&lt;/math&gt;.

|File:Lifting line theory illustration (2).svg|[[Horseshoe vortex|A vortex is shed downstream]] for every span-wise change in lift
}}

Modeling the (unknown and sought-after) local lift with the (also unknown) local circulation allows us to account for the influence of one section over its neighbors. In this view, any span-wise change in lift is equivalent to a span-wise change of circulation. According to [[Helmholtz's theorems]], a vortex filament cannot begin or terminate in the air. Any span-wise ''change in lift'' can be modeled as [[Horseshoe vortex|the shedding of a vortex filament down the flow]], behind the wing.

This shed vortex, whose strength is the derivative of the (unknown) local wing circulation distribution, &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}\Gamma\over\operatorname{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;, influences the flow left and right of the wing section.

}}

This sideways influence (upwash on the outboard, downwash on the inboard) is the key to the lifting-line theory. Now, if the ''change'' in lift distribution is known at given lift section, it is possible to predict how that section influences the lift over its neighbors: the vertical induced velocity (upwash or downwash, &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;) can be quantified using the velocity distribution within a [[vortex]], and related to a change in effective angle of attack over neighboring sections.

In mathematical terms, the local induced change of angle of attack &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; on a given section can be quantified with the integral sum of the downwash induced by every other wing section. In turn, the integral sum of the lift on each downwashed wing section is equal to the (known) total desired amount of lift.

This leads to an [[integro-differential equation]] in the form of &lt;math&gt;L_{total} = \rho V_\infty \int_{tip}^{tip} \Gamma_{(y)} \operatorname{d}y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{(y)}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed solely in terms of the wing geometry and its own span-wise variation, &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}\Gamma_{(y)}\over\operatorname{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;. The solution to this equation is a function, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{(y)}&lt;/math&gt;, that accurately describes the circulation (and therefore lift) distribution over a finite wing of known geometry.

==Derivation==
(Based on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/aero/liftline/liftline.pdf Sydney University's Aerodynamics for Students (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nomenclature:
*&lt;math&gt; \ \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] over the entire wing (m²/s)
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_L &lt;/math&gt; is the 3D [[lift coefficient]] (for the entire wing)
*&lt;math&gt; \ AR &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]]
*&lt;math&gt; \ \alpha_\infty &lt;/math&gt; is the freestream [[angle of attack]] (rad)
*&lt;math&gt; \ V_\infty &lt;/math&gt; is the freestream velocity (m/s)
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_{D_i} &lt;/math&gt; is the drag coefficient for [[Lift-induced drag|induced drag]]
*&lt;math&gt; \ e &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Oswald efficiency number|planform efficiency factor]]

The following are all functions of the wings span-wise station &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. they can all vary along the wing)
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_l &lt;/math&gt; is the 2D [[lift coefficient]] (units/m)
*&lt;math&gt; \ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the 2D circulation at a section (m/s)
*&lt;math&gt; \ c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord length]] of the local section
*&lt;math&gt; \ \alpha_{geo} &lt;/math&gt; is the local change in angle of attack due to geometric twist of the wing
*&lt;math&gt; \ \alpha_0 &lt;/math&gt; is zero-lift angle of attack of that section (depends on the airfoil geometry)
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_{l_\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; is the 2D lift coefficient slope (units/m⋅rad, and depends on airfoil geometry, see [[Thin airfoil theory]])
*&lt;math&gt; \ \alpha_i &lt;/math&gt; is change in angle of attack due to [[downwash]]
*&lt;math&gt; \ w_i &lt;/math&gt; is the local downwash velocity

To derive the model we start with the assumption that the circulation of the wing varies as a function of the spanwise locations. The function assumed is a Fourier function. Firstly, the coordinate for the spanwise location &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is transformed by &lt;math&gt; y = scos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, where y is spanwise location, and s is the semi-span of the wing.

[[File:Prandtl-lifting-line-coordinate-change.PNG]]

and so the circulation is assumed to be:

&lt;math&gt; \Gamma(y) = \Gamma(\theta) = \gamma = 4sV_\infty \sum_n{A_n \sin(n\theta})  \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the circulation of a section is related the &lt;math&gt; C_l &lt;/math&gt; by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;C_l= \frac{2 \gamma}{V_\infty c}  \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

but since the coefficient of lift is a function of angle of attack:

&lt;math&gt;C_l = C_{l_\alpha}(\alpha_\infty + \alpha_{geo} - \alpha_0 - \alpha_i)  \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;
 
hence the vortex strength at any particular spanwise station can be given by the equations:

&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{2} V_\infty c C_{l_\alpha}(\alpha_\infty + \alpha_{geo} - \alpha_0 - \alpha_i)  \qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

This one equation has two unknowns: the value for &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; and the value for &lt;math&gt; \alpha_i &lt;/math&gt;. However, the downwash is purely a function of the circulation only. So we can determine the value &lt;math&gt; \alpha_i &lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(y) &lt;/math&gt;, bring this term across to the left hand side of the equation and solve. The downwash at any given station is a function of the entire shed vortex system. This is determined by integrating the influence of each differential shed vortex over the span of the wing.

Differential element of circulation:

&lt;math&gt; d\Gamma = 4 s V_\infty \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n A_n \cos(n\theta)  \qquad (5)&lt;/math&gt;

Differential downwash due to the differential element of circulation (acts like half an infinite vortex line):

&lt;math&gt; dw_i = \frac{d\Gamma}{4\pi r}  \qquad (6)&lt;/math&gt;

The integral equation over the span of the wing to determine the downwash at a particular location is:

&lt;math&gt; w_i = \int_{-s}^s \frac{1}{y-y_0} d\Gamma  \qquad (7)&lt;/math&gt;

After appropriate substitutions and integrations we get:

&lt;math&gt; w_i = V_\infty \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n A_n \sin(n \theta)}{\sin(\theta)}  \qquad (8)&lt;/math&gt;

And so the change in angle attack is determined by ([[Small-angle approximation|assuming small angles]]):

&lt;math&gt; \alpha_i = \frac{w_i} {V_\infty}  \qquad (9) &lt;/math&gt;

By substituting equations 8 and 9 into RHS of equation 4 and equation 1 into the LHS of equation 4, we then get:

&lt;math&gt; 4 s V_\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n \sin(n \theta) = \frac{1}{2} V_\infty c C_{l_\alpha}\left[\alpha_\infty + \alpha_{geo} - \alpha_0 - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n A_n \sin(n \theta)}{\sin(\theta)} \right] \qquad (10) &lt;/math&gt;

After rearranging, we get the series of simultaneous equations:

&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n \sin(n \theta) \bigg(  \sin(\theta) + \frac{n C_{l \alpha} c}{8 s} \bigg) = \frac{C_{l \alpha} c}{8 s} \sin(\theta) (\alpha_\infty + \alpha_{geo} - \alpha_0) \qquad (11) &lt;/math&gt;

By taking a finite number of terms, equation 11 can be expressed in matrix form and solved for coefficients A. Note the left-hand side of the equation represents each element in the matrix, and the terms on the RHS of equation 11 represent the RHS of the matrix form. Each row in the matrix form represents a different span-wise station, and each column represents a different value for n.

Appropriate choices for &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; are as a linear variation between &lt;math&gt; (0 , \pi ) &lt;/math&gt;. Note that this range does not include the values for 0 and &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;, as this leads to a singular matrix, which can't be solved.

==Lift and drag from coefficients==
The lift can be determined by integrating the circulation terms:

&lt;math&gt; \text{Lift} = \rho V_\infty \int_{-s}^s \Gamma (y) \cos{(\alpha_i(y))} dy \approx \rho V_\infty \int_{-s}^s \Gamma (y) dy &lt;/math&gt;

which can be reduced to:

&lt;math&gt; C_L = \pi A\!R A_1 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; A_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the first term of the solution of the simultaneous equations shown above.

The induced drag can be determined from

&lt;math&gt;\text{Drag}_\text{induced} = \rho V_\infty \int_{-s}^s \Gamma (y) \sin{(\alpha_i(y))} dy \approx \rho V_\infty \int_{-s}^s \Gamma (y) \alpha_i(y) dy&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be reduced to:

&lt;math&gt; C_{D_{\text{induced}}} = \pi A\!R \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n A_n^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; A_n &lt;/math&gt; are all the terms of the solution of the simultaneous equations shown above.

Moreover, this expression may be arranged as a function of &lt;math&gt; C_L &lt;/math&gt; in the following way :

&lt;math&gt; C_{D_{\text{induced}}} = \pi A\!R A_1^2 + \pi A\!R \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n A_n^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C_{D_{\text{induced}}} = \pi A\!R A_1^2 * \frac{\pi A\!R}{\pi A\!R} + \pi A\!R \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n A_n^2 * \frac{\pi A\!R A_1^2}{\pi A\!R A_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C_{D_{\text{induced}}} = \frac{\pi^2 A\!R^2 A_1^2}{\pi A\!R} + \frac{\pi^2 A\!R^2 A_1^2}{\pi A\!R}* \frac{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n A_n^2}{A_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt; C_{D_{\text{induced}}} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A\!R}(1+\frac{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n A_n^2}{A_1^2})  = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A\!R e}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; \delta = \frac{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n A_n^2}{A_1^2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; e = \frac{1}{1+\delta} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Oswald efficiency number#Comparison with span efficiency factor|span efficiency factor]]

==Symmetric wing==
For a symmetric wing, the even terms of the series coefficients are identically equal to 0, and so can be dropped.

==Rolling wings==
When the aircraft is rolling, an additional term can be added that adds the wing station distance multiplied by the rate of roll to give additional angle of attack change. Equation 3 then becomes:

&lt;math&gt;C_l = C_{l_{\alpha}}\left(\alpha_{\infty} + \alpha_{geo} - \alpha_0 - \alpha_i + \frac{p y}{s}\right)  \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt; \ p &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of roll in rad/sec,

Note that y can be negative, which introduces non-zero even coefficients in the equation that must be accounted for.

==Control deflection==
The effect of ailerons can be accounted by simply changing &lt;math&gt; \alpha_0 &lt;/math&gt; term in Equation 3. For non-symmetric controls such as ailerons the &lt;math&gt; \alpha_0 &lt;/math&gt; term changes on each side of the wing.

==Elliptical wings==
For an elliptical wing with no twist, with:

&lt;math&gt; y(\theta) = s \cos(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

The chord length is given as a function of span location as:

&lt;math&gt; c(\theta) = c_{root} \sin(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

Also,

&lt;math&gt; e = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

This yields the famous equation for the elliptic induced drag coefficient:

&lt;math&gt; C_{D_{induced}} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A\!R} &lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is the value of the wing span,
*&lt;math&gt; y(\theta) &lt;/math&gt; is the position on the wing span, and
*&lt;math&gt; c(\theta) &lt;/math&gt; is the chord.

==Useful approximations==
A useful approximation is that
:&lt;math&gt; \ C_{L} = C_{l_\alpha} \left( \frac{\text{AR}}{\text{AR}+2} \right) \alpha &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref?&lt;/ref&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_{\text{L}} &lt;/math&gt; is the 3D [[lift coefficient]] for elliptical circulation distribution,
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_{l_\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; is the 2D lift coefficient slope (see [[Thin Airfoil Theory]]),
*&lt;math&gt; \ \text{AR} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], and
*&lt;math&gt; \ \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angle of attack]] in radians.

The theoretical value for &lt;math&gt; \ C_{l_\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; is 2&lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;. Note that this equation becomes the [[Thin Airfoil Theory|thin airfoil]] equation if ''AR'' goes to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/aerodynamics/q0136.shtml Aerospace Web's explanation of lift coefficient]&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen above, the lifting-line theory also states an equation for [[induced drag]]:.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E., ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Section 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Equation 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \ C_{D_i} = \frac{{C_L}^2}{\pi \text{AR} e} &lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_{D_i} &lt;/math&gt; is the drag coefficient for induced drag,
*&lt;math&gt; \ C_L &lt;/math&gt; is the 3D [[lift coefficient]], and
*&lt;math&gt; \ \text{AR} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]].
*&lt;math&gt; \ e &lt;/math&gt; is the planform efficiency factor (equals 1 for elliptical circulation distribution, and usually tabulated for other distributions).

==Limitations of the theory==
The lifting line theory does not take into account the following:
* [[Compressible flow]]
* [[Viscous flow]]
* [[Swept wing]]s
* [[Low aspect ratio]] wings
* [[Unsteady flow]]s

'''''Making Peace With the Planet''''' is a 1990 book by [[Barry Commoner]].  Commoner argues that, despite billions of dollars spent to save the environment, [[America]] is still in a deep [[environmental crisis]]. The book argues that environmental [[pollution]] can be prevented only through fundamental redesign of the way we produce goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n2_v43/ai_10913677  Making Peace With the Planet. - book reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA1E3FF937A25757C0A966958260 Books of The Times; Mankind as Aggressor In the War on the Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">A '''miscibility gap''' is a region in a [[phase diagram]] for a mixture of components where the mixture exists as two or more [[Phase (matter)|phases]] - any region of composition of mixtures where the constituents are not completely miscible.

The [[IUPAC_book#Gold_Book | IUPAC Gold Book]] defines ''miscibility gap'' as ''"Area within the coexistence curve of an isobaric phase diagram (temperature vs composition) or an isothermal phase diagram (pressure vs composition)."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/MT07270.html| title = miscibility gap| work = IUPAC Gold Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A miscibility gap between isostructural phases may be described as the [[solvus]], a term also used to describe the boundary on a phase diagram between a miscibility gap and other phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Petrogenesis of Metamorphic Rocks| first = Kurt |last = Bucher| first2 =  Rodney |last2= Grapes| publisher = Springer| year = 2011|chapter = 4.7.4 Miscibility Gaps and Solvus Thermometry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamically, miscibility gaps indicate a maxima (''e.g.'' of [[Gibbs energy]]) in the composition range.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://resource.npl.co.uk/mtdata/winmt_miscibility_gaps.html| title = Miscibility Gaps| work = MTDATA – Phase Diagram Software from the National Physical Laboratory| date = 7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.its.caltech.edu/~me260/class%20notes/Phase_diagrams.pdf| title = Phase diagrams|page = 1| work = www.its.caltech.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Named miscibility gaps==
A number of miscibility gaps in phase systems are named, including:
* The ''Huttenlocher'' (found in [[bytownite]], Anorthite composition An55-95.), ''Boggild'' (in [[labradorite]], An39-48 and An53-63.) and Peristerite (in [[oligoclase]], ~An5-15.) miscibility gaps in the [[plagioclase]] feldspars.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Feldspars and their Reactions: [proceedinsg of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Feldspars and Their Reactions, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, June 29-July 10, 1993]| editor-first = Ian |editor-last = Parsons| publisher = Springer| year =  1994|at = Subsolidus Phase Relations of the Plagioclase Feldspar Solid Solution, pp.221-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin| first = Hans-Rudolf| last = Wenk| first2= Andrei| last2= Bulakh| year = 2004| publisher = Cambridge University Press|page = 326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Manual of Forensic Taphonomy| first = James|last =  Pokines| first2 = Steven A.|last2= Symes| publisher = CRC Press| year = 2013|page = 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Miscibility gaps in liquid states can cause [[spinodal decomposition]], commonly referred to as '''''oiling out''''', and commonly occurs in oil/water mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Crystallization: Basic Concepts and Industrial Applications | first = Wolfgang|last =  Beckmann|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| year =  2013| chapter = 3.3.6 Oiling-out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness''' ('''NSTAR''') is a type of spacecraft [[ion thruster]] called [[electrostatic ion thruster]].&lt;ref name="GRC 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ion/past/90s/nstar.htm |title=NASA Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) |work=NASA's Glenn Research Center |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=2015-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sovey, J. S., Rawlin, V. K., and Patterson, M. J.: "Ion Propulsion Development Projects in U. S.: Space Electric Rocket Test 1 to Deep Space 1." Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 17, No. 3, May–June 2001, pp. 517-526.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a highly efficient low-thrust [[spacecraft propulsion]] running on electrical power generated by [[solar arrays]]. It uses  high-voltage [[electrode]]s to accelerate [[ion]]s with [[electrostatic]] forces.

==Development and performance==
[[Image:Electrostatic ion thruster-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of an [[electrostatic ion thruster]] ]]
The purpose of NSTAR program was to develop a [[xenon]]-fueled ion propulsion system for deep space missions.&lt;ref name="NSTAR program"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html |title=Innovative Engines - The NSTAR Program |work=NASA Glenn Research Center |accessdate=2015-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NSTAR [[electrostatic ion thruster]] was developed at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] and manufactured by Hughes, and [[General Dynamics|Spectrum Astro, Inc.]] in the early 1990s. The feed system development was a collaborative effort between [[JPL]] and [[Moog Inc]].&lt;ref name="GRC 2009"/&gt;

The ions are accelerated through two fine grids with roughly a 1300 V difference between them for 2.3&amp;nbsp;kW operation,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Astronautica"/&gt;&lt;ref name='NSTAR performance'&gt;{{cite conference |title=In-flight performance of the NSTAR ion propulsion system on the Deep Space One mission |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3868954_In-flight_performance_of_the_NSTAR_ion_propulsion_system_on_theDeep_Space_One_mission |conference=Aerospace Conference Proceedings |publisher=IEEExplore |year=2000 |doi=10.1109/AERO.2000.878373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a thrust of 20-92&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|mN]], a specific impulse of 1950-31000 N·s/kg and a total impulse capability of 2.65 x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Ns.&lt;ref name='NSTAR performance'/&gt; In 1996, the prototype engine endured 8000 hours of continuous operation in a vacuum chamber that simulates conditions of [[outer space]]. The results of the prototyping were used to define the design of flight hardware that was built for Deep Space 1 probe. One of the challenges was developing a compact and light weight power processing unit that converts power from the [[solar array]]s into the voltages needed by the engine.&lt;ref name="NSTAR program"/&gt;

The engine achieves a [[specific impulse]] of one to three thousand seconds. This is an order of magnitude higher than traditional space propulsion methods, resulting in a mass savings of approximately half. This leads to much lighter and less expensive launch vehicles. Although the engine produces just 92 [[newton (unit)|millinewtons]] (0.331 [[pound-force|ounce-force]]) thrust at maximum power (2,100W on [[Deep Space 1|DS1]] mission), the craft achieved high speed because ion engines thrust continuously for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;{{cite journal

==Applications==
The NSTAR ion thruster was first used on the [[Deep Space 1]] (DS1) spacecraft, launched on 24 October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/ds1.html NASA Glenn Contributions to Deep Space 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The Deep Space mission carried out a flyby of asteroid [[9969 Braille]] and  [[19P/Borrelly|Comet Borrelly]].

The typical use is to send information and signals to cause electrical power-using devices to be turned off during periods of high demand.

In its early phases, the OpenADR research was initiated by Demand Response Research Center (DRRC) which is managed by [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=David|last2=Piette|first2=Mary Ann|title=Machine To Machine (M2M) Technology In Demand Responsive Commercial Buildings|url=http://drrc.lbl.gov/publications/machine-machine-m2m-technology-demand|website=Demand Response Research Center|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piette|first1=Mary Ann|last2=Watson|first2=David|title=Automated Critical Peak Pricing Field Tests: 2006 Pilot Program Description And Results|url=http://drrc.lbl.gov/publications/automated-critical-peak-pricing-field|website=Demand Response Research Center|publisher=Lawrench Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=17 August 2015|ref=LBNL-62218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification was released in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2009/04&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the related [[OpenHAN]] standard for [[home area network]]s was promoted by utilities themselves and is an attempt to reconcile various [[home control]] technologies including [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]], [[Insteon]], [[P1901]] and [[HomePlug]].

An Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) outreach collaborative was eventually formed in October 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openadrcollaborative.org Welcome to the Open ADR Collaborative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a related '''OpenADR Alliance''' [http://www.openadr.org/] "to accelerate the development, adoption and compliance of OpenADR standards throughout the energy industry"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openadr.org OpenADR Alliance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and "provide common language"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartmeters.com/the-news/1005-openadr-provides-common-language.html OpenADR Provides Common Language | Latest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for [[smart meter]]s.

== Overview&lt;ref&gt;https://openadr.memberclicks.net/overview&lt;/ref&gt; ==

Demand Response (DR) is a set of actions taken to reduce load when electric grid contingencies threaten supply-demand balance or market conditions occur that raise electricity costs. Automated demand response consists of fully automated signaling from a utility, ISO/RTO or other appropriate entity to provide automated connectivity to customer end-use control systems and strategies. OpenADR provides a foundation for interoperable information exchange to facilitate automated demand response.

The OpenADR Alliance is composed of industry stakeholders that are interested in fostering and accelerating the development and adoption of OpenADR standards and compliance with those standards. This extends to de facto standards based on specifications published by LBNL in April 2009, as well as Smart Grid-related standards emerging from OASIS, UCA, NAESB (North American Energy Standards Board), and ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air‐Conditioning Engineers).

== A Brief History of OpenADR ==

The California energy crisis of 2002 served as the impetus for the effort that ultimately led to the creation of version 1.0 of the OpenADR standard. The Demand Response Research Center [http://drrc.lbl.gov], which is operated by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), created the standard with funding from the California Energy Commission’s (www.energy.ca.gov) Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) program. Shortly after 2002, the DRRC worked with the California IOUs (SCE, SDG&amp;E and PG&amp;E) to jointly develop this technology through pilots and actual program implementations. In 2009, OpenADR was included in the Smart Grid Interoperability Standards Framework, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) identified OpenADR as a key standard for Demand Response. Additional standards work was performed by the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP), which is being tasked by the U.S. [[Nist|National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) to oversee standardization of the Smart Grid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nist.gov/smartgrid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki‐sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/OpenADR/&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Energy Standards Board&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naesb.org&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the effort by developing a set of requirements. In that same year, the OpenADR specification was released as an official [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC) document, and the DRRC donated version 1.0 of the OpenADR standard to the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasis‐open.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the Utilities Communication Architecture (UCA) International Users Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucaiug.org&lt;/ref&gt; The work to create version 2.0 of the OpenADR standard is being performed by OASIS through its Energy Interoperation (EI) Technical Committee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasis‐open.org/committees/energyinterop/&lt;/ref&gt; with assistance from the UCAIug OpenADR Taskforce. Once work is completed on OpenADR version 2.0, with its expanded and complete set of DR and DER signals, the standard will be submitted to the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in Geneva, Switzerland for adoption worldwide. IEC is the world’s leading organization for international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies.

== How OpenADR Works ==
In the Open Automated Demand Response Communications Specification (Version 1.0), LBNL describes OpenADR as:

{{quotation | “a communications data model designed to facilitate sending and receiving DR signals from a utility or independent system operator to electric customers. The intention of the data model is to interact with building and industrial control systems that are pre‐programmed to take action based on a DR signal, enabling a demand response event to be fully automated, with no manual intervention. The OpenADR specification is a highly flexible infrastructure design to facilitate common information exchange between a utility or Independent System Operator (ISO) and their end‐use participants. The concept of an open specification is intended to allow anyone to implement the signaling systems, providing the automation server or the automation clients.”}}

The specification also describes the scope of the OpenADR standard:

{{quotation | “The Open Automated Demand Response Communications Specification defines the interface to the functions and features of a Demand Response Automation Server (DRAS) that is used to facilitate the automation of customer response to various Demand Response programs and dynamic pricing through a communicating client. This specification, referred to as OpenADR, also addresses how third parties such as utilities, ISOs, energy and facility managers, aggregators, and hardware and software manufacturers will interface to and utilize the functions of the DRAS in order to automate various aspects of demand response (DR) programs and dynamic pricing.”}}

During a Demand Response event, the utility or ISO/RTO provides information to the DRAS about what has changed and on what schedule, such as start and stop times. A typical change would specify one or more of the following: 
*PRICE_ABSOLUTE – The price per kilowatt‐hour 
*
*PRICE_RELATIVE – A change in the price per kilowatt‐hour 
*
*PRICE_MULTIPLE – A multiple of a basic rate per kilowatt‐hour 
*
*LOAD_AMOUNT – A fixed amount of load to shed or shift 
*
*LOAD_PERCENTAGE – The percentage of load to shed or shift 
*
Note that in the first three cases, it would be up to the customer to determine how best to participate in the OpenADR event. For example, commercial customers might be notified of a change in Time‐of‐Use pricing during a peak period, and the [[Energy management system|Energy Management System]] (EMS) might be programmed to temporarily offset building temperatures by several degrees and dim or turn‐off non‐essential lights. The last two cases normally shed load automatically based on an existing arrangement. If prices continue to climb higher the EMS may escalate the DR program by reducing or turning off rooftop air handlers during the same peak period. The standard also specifies considerable additional information that can be exchanged related to DR and DER events, including event name and identification, event status, operating mode, various enumerations (a fixed set of values characterizing the event), reliability and emergency signals, renewable generation status, market participation data (such as bids), test signals, and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openadr.org/assets/docs/openadr_primer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Other Standards ==
In development of OpenADR, the OASIS Energy Interoperation Technical Committee is working with both the OASIS Energy Market Information Exchange (EMIX) and the OASIS Web Services Calendar (WS‐Calendar) Technical Committees to coordinate development of the full set of standards needed to exchange pricing information using a common schedule across energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasis‐open.org/committees/emix and www.oasis‐open.org/committees/ws‐calendar OASIS EMIX and WS-Calendar&lt;/ref&gt; EMIX defines a standard way to exchange pricing and other information among ISOs and utilities. Because the price of electricity varies with the time of delivery, EMIX conveys the necessary time and interval data using WS‐Calendar as a common clock. Both EMIX (Common Price Communication Model) and WS‐ Calendar (Common Scheduling Mechanism) take advantage of the SGIP Priority Action Plan (PAP) assessment and recognition process.

OpenADR also interacts, although less directly, with the NAESB Energy Usage Information Model and the [[Ashrae|ASHRAE]] Facility Smart Grid Information Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/standards/ashrae-201-2016?product_id=1915946|title=ASHRAE 201-2016 {{!}} ASHRAE Store|website=www.techstreet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Usage Information Model supports load curtailment, load shaping and energy market operations, all of which pertain to Demand Response. The Facility Smart Grid Information Model will create a standardized data exchange that enables control systems in the customer premises to manage electrical loads and generation sources in response to communications from utilities, and other electrical service providers or market operators. OpenADR will also need to interoperate directly or interwork indirectly with other popular protocols now used for energy management, including [[BACnet]], LonMark&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonmark.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the Smart Energy Profile [[Zigbee|ZigBee]]. Depending on the protocol, this is expected to be accomplished either with enhancements to these standards, or with separate software or systems, such as a gateway function capable of translating between protocols.

== Why The OpenADR Alliance Was Formed ==

The OpenADR Alliance was formed to build on the foundation of technical activities to support the development, testing, and deployment of commercial OpenADR and facilitates its acceleration and widespread adoption. This approach needs to engage service providers (such as electric utilities and systems operators) within the domain of the Smart Grid that publish OpenADR signals, as well as the facilities or third-party entities that consume them to manage electric loads. The OpenADR Alliance will enable all stakeholders to participate in automated DR, dynamic pricing, and electricity grid reliability.

The OpenADR Alliance activities will include, but not be limited to, the following:&lt;ref&gt;https://openadr.memberclicks.net/overview&lt;/ref&gt;

* Develop a conformance, certification, and testing process/program for OpenADR, coordinated with entities such as standard development organizations (SDOs), user groups, and Smart Grid activities.
* 
* Collaborate with SDOs and user groups for the continued enhancements of the OpenADR standard.
* 
* Collaborate with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and other government agencies to expand the adoption of OpenADR.
* 
* Collaborate with other alliances and organizations on global partnership opportunities.
* 
* Develop an OpenADR marketing portal targeted to customers that may be interested in participating in an automated DR program. Members can use this portal to promote their offerings and direct interested parties to their own web sites for information.
* 
* Conduct and provide education and training sessions for system integrators, control vendors, and others to enable them to install "OpenADR-ready" equipment within facilities to receive OpenADR signals; and customers to help them develop load management strategies.
* 
* Establish centralized development and documentation related to OpenADR deployments, including lessons learned from previous deployments and the development of best practices.
* 
* Develop programs to allow vendors to develop, test, and demonstrate their ability to integrate with OpenADR signals.
*

== The Role of the OpenADR Alliance ==
The mission of the OpenADR Alliance is to foster the development, adoption and compliance of the OpenADR standards through collaboration, education, training, testing and certification. The Alliance will also promote the worldwide market acceptance of the OpenADR standard. Work being performed by industry coalitions like the OpenADR Alliance is critical to the success of new Smart Grid standards. No new standard is ever 100% complete, and different interpretations can cause interoperability problems in early implementations. For this reason, the Alliance is supported by a broad cross section of utilities, independent system operators, regional transmission operators, regulators and vendors who share a common interest in the success and widespread adoption of the OpenADR standard. In performing its work, the Alliance will adhere to industry best practices as detailed in the Interoperability Process Reference Manual (IPRM) created by the SGIP Testing and Certification Committee (www.sgip.org). The IPRM outlines the conformance, interoperability and cyber‐security testing and certification requirements for Smart Grid standards recommended by the SGIP.

In addition, the national government offers through the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment]] a {{euro|3,000}} subsidy on the purchase of all-electric taxis or delivery vans. This subsidy increases to {{euro|5,000}} per vehicle in [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Utrecht]], and [[Stadsregio Arnhem Nijmegen|Arnhem-Nijmegen metropolitan area]]. An additional subsidy is offered by several local government for the purchase of full electric taxis and vans, {{euro|5,000}} in Amsterdam and {{euro|3,000}} in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[Tilburg]].&lt;ref name=HighlightsNED2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2014/04/Electromobility%20in%20the%20Netherlands%20Highlights%202013.pdf|title=Electromobility in the Netherlands - Highlights 2013|author=Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO)|publisher=RVO (Dutch National Enterprise Agency)|date=March 2014|accessdate=2014-09-25}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''See Financial stimulation, pp. 8.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rotterdam/&gt;

The subsidy is only available to the first 5,000 applicants that buy an eligible vehicle before the end of December 2013.&lt;ref name=Rotterdam/&gt;

Other factors contributing to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the relative small size of the country, which reduces [[range anxiety]] (the Netherlands stretches about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} east to west); a long tradition of environmental activism; high gasoline prices ({{USD|8.50}} per gallon as of January 2013), which make the cost of running a car on electricity five times cheaper; and also some EV leasing programs provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles for those who want to take a vacation driving long distances. With all of these incentives and tax breaks, plug-in electric cars have similar driving costs than conventional cars.&lt;ref name=NYT02913/&gt;

'''Polyethylene glycol''' ('''PEG''') is a [[polyether]] compound with many applications, from industrial manufacturing to [[medicine]]. PEG is also known as '''polyethylene oxide''' ('''PEO''') or '''polyoxyethylene''' ('''POE'''), depending on its [[molecular weight]]. The structure of PEG is commonly expressed as H−(O−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;−OH.

==Available forms and nomenclature==
''PEG'', ''PEO'', and ''POE'' refer to an [[oligomer]] or polymer of [[ethylene oxide]]. The three names are chemically synonymous, but historically ''PEG'' is preferred in the biomedical field, whereas ''PEO'' is more prevalent in the field of polymer chemistry. Because different applications require different polymer chain lengths, ''PEG'' has tended to refer to oligomers and polymers with a molecular mass below 20,000{{nbsp}}g/mol, ''PEO'' to polymers with a molecular mass above 20,000{{nbsp}}g/mol, and ''POE'' to a polymer of any molecular mass.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [http://www.scientificpolymer.com/utils/search.asp online catalog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229131736/http://www.scientificpolymer.com/utils/search.asp |date=29 December 2006 }} of Scientific Polymer Products, Inc., poly(ethylene glycol) molecular weights run up to about 20,000, while those of poly(ethylene oxide) have six or seven digits.&lt;/ref&gt; PEGs are prepared by polymerization of [[ethylene oxide]] and are commercially available over a wide range of molecular weights from 300{{nbsp}}g/mol to 10,000,000{{nbsp}}g/mol.&lt;ref name=french2009angewandte/&gt;

PEG and PEO are liquids or low-melting solids, depending on their [[molecular weight]]s. While PEG and PEO with different molecular weights find use in different applications, and have different physical properties (e.g. [[viscosity]]) due to chain length effects, their chemical properties are nearly identical. Different forms of PEG are also available, depending on the [[Radical initiator|initiator]] used for the polymerization process – the most common initiator is a monofunctional methyl ether PEG, or methoxypoly(ethylene glycol), abbreviated mPEG. Lower-molecular-weight PEGs are also available as purer oligomers, referred to as monodisperse, uniform, or discrete. Very high purity PEG has recently been shown to be crystalline, allowing determination of a crystal structure by x-ray diffraction.&lt;ref name=french2009angewandte&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=19142918 | title=High Purity Discrete PEG Oligomer Crystals Allow Structural Insight | journal=[[Angewandte Chemie|Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] |year=2009 | url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~dplb0149/publication/pub108.pdf|doi=10.1002/anie.200804623 | last1=French |first1=Alister C. | last2=Thompson |first2=Amber L.
 | last3=Davis |first3=Benjamin G. | volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=1248–1252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since purification and separation of pure oligomers is difficult, the price for this type of quality is often 10–1000 fold that of polydisperse PEG.

PEGs are also available with different geometries.
* ''Branched'' PEGs have three to ten PEG chains emanating from a central core group.
* ''Star'' PEGs have 10 to 100 PEG chains emanating from a central core group.
* ''Comb'' PEGs have multiple PEG chains normally grafted onto a polymer backbone.

The numbers that are often included in the names of PEGs indicate their average molecular weights (e.g. a PEG with {{nowrap|n {{=}} 9}} would have an average molecular weight of approximately 400 [[Atomic mass unit|daltons]], and would be labeled [[PEG 400]].) Most PEGs include molecules with a distribution of molecular weights (i.e. they are polydisperse). The size distribution can be characterized statistically by its [[weight average molecular weight]] (Mw) and its [[number average molecular weight]] (Mn), the ratio of which is called the [[polydispersity index]] (Mw/Mn). Mw and Mn can be measured by [[mass spectrometry]].

[[PEGylation]] is the act of covalently coupling a PEG structure to another larger [[molecule]], for example, a [[therapeutic protein]], which is then referred to as a ''PEGylated'' protein. [[PEGylated interferon alfa-2a]] or [[PEGylated interferon alfa-2b|−2b]] are commonly used injectable treatments for [[hepatitis C]] infection.

PEG is soluble in [[water]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[acetonitrile]], [[benzene]], and [[dichloromethane]], and is insoluble in [[diethyl ether]] and [[hexane]]. It is coupled to hydrophobic molecules to produce non-ionic [[surfactant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Force-field dependence of the conformational properties of α,ω-dimethoxypolyethylene glycol|journal=Molecular Physics|volume=107|issue=13|pages=1313|doi=10.1080/00268970902794826|year=2009|last1=Winger|first1=Moritz|last2=De Vries|first2=Alex H.|last3=Van Gunsteren|first3=Wilfred F.|bibcode=2009MolPh.107.1313W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEGs potentially contain toxic impurities, such as ethylene oxide and [[1,4-dioxane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/potentialcontaminants/ucm101566.htm|title=Potential Contaminants - 1,4-Dioxane A Manufacturing Byproduct|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethylene Glycol and its ethers are [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] if applied to damaged skin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Special Report: Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity of Ethylene Glycol and Its Ethers| journal = International Journal of Toxicology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 53–67| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1177/109158189901800208 | last1 = Andersen | first1 = F. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and related polymers (PEG phospholipid constructs) are often [[sonication|sonicated]] when used in biomedical applications. However, as reported by Murali et al., PEG is very sensitive to sonolytic degradation and PEG degradation products can be toxic to mammalian cells. It is, thus, imperative to assess potential PEG degradation to ensure that the final material does not contain undocumented contaminants that can introduce artifacts into experimental results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Rapid detection of polyethylene glycol sonolysis upon functionalization of carbon nanomaterials |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |volume=240 |issue=9 |pages=1147–1151 |doi=10.1177/1535370214567615|pmid=25662826 |year=2015 |last1=Murali |first1=V.

PEGs and [[methoxypolyethylene glycol]]s are manufactured by [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] under the tradename ''Carbowax'' for industrial use, and ''Carbowax Sentry'' for food and pharmaceutical use. They vary in consistency from liquid to solid, depending on the molecular weight, as indicated by a number following the name. They are used commercially in numerous applications, including as [[surfactant]]s, in foods, in [[cosmetics]], in pharmaceutics, in [[biomedicine]], as dispersing agents, as solvents, in [[ointment]]s, in [[suppository]] bases, as tablet [[excipient]]s, and as [[laxative]]s. Some specific groups are [[lauromacrogol]]s, [[nonoxynol]]s, [[octoxynol]]s, and [[poloxamer]]s.

[[Macrogol]], used as a laxative, is a form of polyethylene glycol. The name may be followed by a number which represents the average molecular weight (e.g. macrogol 3350, macrogol 4000 or macrogol 6000).

==Production==
[[File:Polyethylene glycol 400.jpg|thumb|Polyethylene glycol 400, pharmaceutical quality]]
[[File:Polyethylene glycol 4000.jpg|thumb|Polyethylene glycol 4000, pharmaceutical quality]]

The production of polyethylene glycol was first reported in 1859. Both [[A. V. Laurence]] and [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz]] independently isolated products that were polyethylene glycols.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey, Jr.|first1=Frederick E.|last2=Koleske|first2=Joseph V.|title=Alkylene oxides and their polymers|date=1990|publisher=Dekker|location=New York|isbn=9780824783846|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfmJuNNl5bwC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyethylene glycol is produced by the interaction of [[ethylene oxide]] with water, [[ethylene glycol]], or ethylene glycol oligomers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemindustry.ru/Polyethylene_Glycol.php Polyethylene glycol], Chemindustry.ru&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction is catalyzed by acidic or basic catalysts. Ethylene glycol and its oligomers are preferable as a starting material instead of water, because they allow the creation of polymers with a low [[polydispersity]] (narrow molecular weight distribution). Polymer chain length depends on the ratio of reactants.

:HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + n(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) → HO(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;H

Depending on the catalyst type, the mechanism of [[polymerization]] can be cationic or anionic. The anionic mechanism is preferable because it allows one to obtain PEG with a low [[polydispersity]]. [[Polymerization]] of ethylene oxide is an exothermic process. Overheating or contaminating ethylene oxide with catalysts such as alkalis or metal oxides can lead to runaway polymerization, which can end in an explosion after a few hours.

Polyethylene oxide, or high-molecular weight polyethylene glycol, is synthesized by [[suspension polymerization]]. It is necessary to hold the growing polymer chain in [[polymer solution|solution]] in the course of the [[polycondensation]] process. The reaction is catalyzed by magnesium-, aluminium-, or calcium-organoelement compounds. To prevent [[coagulation]] of polymer chains from solution, chelating additives such as [[dimethylglyoxime]] are used.

Alkaline catalysts such as [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH), [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH), or [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are used to prepare low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol.

* Since PEG is a flexible, water-soluble polymer, it can be used to create very high [[osmotic pressure]]s (on the order of tens of atmospheres). It also is unlikely to have specific interactions with biological chemicals. These properties make PEG one of the most useful molecules for applying osmotic pressure in [[biochemistry]] and [[biomembrane]]s experiments, in particular when using the [[osmotic stress technique]].
* Polyethylene glycol is also commonly used as a polar stationary phase for [[gas chromatography]], as well as a [[Coolant|heat transfer fluid]] in electronic testers.
* PEG has also been used to preserve objects that have been salvaged from underwater, as was the case with the warship ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' in Stockholm,&lt;ref&gt;Lars-Åke Kvarning, Bengt Ohrelius (1998), ''The Vasa – The Royal Ship'', {{ISBN|91-7486-581-1}}, pp. 133–141&lt;/ref&gt; and similar cases.

When PEG is chemically attached to therapeutic molecules (such as protein drugs or nanoparticles), it can sometimes be antigenic, stimulating an anti-PEG antibody response in some patients. This effect has only been shown for a few of the many available PEGylated therapeutics, but it has significant effects on clinical outcomes of affected patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McSweeney|first1=MD. et al.|title=Physician Awareness of Immune Responses to Polyethylene Glycol‐Drug Conjugates|pmc=5866984|journal=Clinical and Translational Science|volume=11|issue=2|pages=162–165|doi=10.1111/cts.12537|pmid=29383836|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than these few instances where patients have anti-PEG immune responses, it is generally considered to be a safe component of drug formulations.

'''Rhenium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Re''' and [[atomic number]] 75. It is a silvery-gray, heavy, third-row [[transition metal]] in [[group 7 element|group 7]] of the [[periodic table]]. With an estimated average concentration of 1 [[parts-per notation|part per billion]] (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the [[Earth's crust]]. Rhenium has the [[list of elements by melting point|third-highest]] [[melting point]] and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903&amp;nbsp;K. Rhenium resembles [[manganese]] and [[technetium]] chemically and is mainly obtained as a [[by-product]] of the extraction and refinement of [[molybdenum]] and [[copper]] ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of [[oxidation state]]s ranging from −1 to +7.

Discovered in 1908, rhenium was the second-last [[stable element]] to be discovered. It was named after the river [[Rhine]] in Europe.

[[Nickel]]-based [[superalloys]] of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of [[jet engine]]s. These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element. The second-most important use is as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]]: rhenium is an excellent catalyst for [[hydrogenation]] and isomerization, and is used for example in [[catalytic reforming]] of naphtha for use in gasoline (Rheniforming process). Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is expensive, with price reaching an all-time high in 2008/2009 US$10,600 per [[kilogram]] (US$4,800 per pound). Due to increases in rhenium recycling and a drop in demand for Rhenium in catalysts, the price of rhenium has dropped to US$2,844 per [[kilogram]] (US$1,290 per pound) as of July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://apps.catalysts.basf.com/apps/eibprices/mp/YearlyCharts.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhenium is generally considered to have been discovered by [[Walter Noddack]], [[Ida Tacke|Ida Noddack]], and [[Otto Berg (scientist)|Otto Berg]] in [[Germany]].

==Characteristics==
Rhenium is a silvery-white metal with one of the highest [[melting point]]s of all elements, exceeded by only [[tungsten]] and [[carbon]]. It also has one of the highest [[boiling points]] of all elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by [[platinum]], [[iridium]] and [[osmium]]. Rhenium has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;276.1&amp;nbsp;pm and ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;445.6&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of pressure and temperature on lattice parameters of rhenium|first1=L.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of rhenium}}
Rhenium has one [[Stable nuclide|stable]] isotope, rhenium-185, which nevertheless occurs in minority abundance, a situation found only in two other elements ([[indium]] and [[tellurium]]). Naturally occurring rhenium is only 37.4% &lt;sup&gt;185&lt;/sup&gt;Re, and 62.6% &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re, which is [[Radionuclide|unstable]] but has a very long [[half-life]] (≈10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years). This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of rhenium atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=math.ucr.edu|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html|title=How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates|date=1993|first=Bill|last=Johnson|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosch1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosch|first1=F.|last2=Faestermann|first2=T.|last3=Friese|first3=J.|last4=Heine|first4=F.|last5=Kienle|first5=P.|last6=Wefers|first6=E.|last7=Zeitelhack|first7=K.|last8=Beckert|first8=K.|last9=Franzke|first9=B.|last10=Klepper|first10=O.|last11=Kozhuharov|first11=C.|last12=Menzel|first12=G.|last13=Moshammer|first13=R.|last14=Nolden|first14=F.|last15=Reich|first15=H.|last16=Schlitt|first16=B.|last17=Steck|first17=M.|last18=Stöhlker|first18=T.|last19=Winkler|first19=T.|last20=Takahashi|first20=K.|displayauthors=3|title=Observation of bound-state ''β''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay of fully ionized &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re: &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re-&lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os Cosmochronometry|date=1996|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=77|issue=26|pages=5190–5193|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5190|bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5190B|pmid=10062738}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[beta decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re is used for [[rhenium-osmium dating]] of ores.

===Compounds===
{{Category see also|Rhenium compounds}}

Rhenium compounds are known for all the [[oxidation states]] between −3 and +7 except −2. The oxidation states +7, +6, +4, and +2 are the most common.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1118–1123|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|author2 = Wiberg, Egon|author3 = Wiberg, Nils|chapter = Rhenium| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rhenium is most available commercially as salts of [[perrhenate]], including [[sodium perrhenate|sodium]] and [[ammonium perrhenate]]s.  These are white, water-soluble compounds.&lt;ref name=Brauer&gt;Glemser, O. (1963) "Ammonium Perrhenate" in ''Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry'', 2nd ed., G. Brauer (ed.), Academic Press, NY., Vol. 1, pp. 1476–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halides and oxyhalides====
The most common rhenium chlorides are ReCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Rhenium pentachloride|ReCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], ReCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Rhenium trichloride|ReCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=G&amp;W&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structures of these compounds often feature extensive Re-Re bonding, which is characteristic of this metal in oxidation states lower than VII.  Salts of [Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; feature a [[quadruple bond|quadruple]] metal-metal bond.  Although the highest rhenium chloride features Re(VI), fluorine gives the d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; Re(VII) derivative [[rhenium heptafluoride]].  Bromides and iodides of rhenium are also well known.

Like tungsten and molybdenum, with which it shares chemical similarities, rhenium forms a variety of [[Oxohalide|oxyhalides]].  The oxychlorides are most common, and include ReOCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ReOCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Oxides and sulfides====
[[File:Perrhenic-acid-3D-balls.png|left|thumb|upright=0.5|Perrhenic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) adopts an unconventional structure.]]

The most common oxide is the volatile colourless [[Rhenium(VII) oxide|Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[ReO3|Rhenium trioxide]] ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adopts a [[perovskite]]-like structure.  Other oxides include Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Rhenium(IV) oxide|ReO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=G&amp;W/&gt; The [[sulfide]]s are [[rhenium disulfide|ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[dirhenium heptasulfide|Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Perrhenate salts can be converted to [[tetrathioperrhenate]] by the action of [[ammonium hydrosulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Goodman|first=J. T.|author2=Rauchfuss, T.

====Other compounds====
[[Rhenium diboride]] (ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a hard compound having the hardness similar to that of [[tungsten carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium diboride]] or [[zirconium diboride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jiaqian|last=Qin|author2=He, Duanwei |author3=Wang, Jianghua |author4=Fang, Leiming |author5=Lei, Li |author6=Li, Yongjun |author7=Hu, Juan |author8=Kou, Zili |author9= Bi, Yan  |title=Is Rhenium Diboride a Superhard Material?| journal= Advanced Materials |volume=20|date =2008| pages=4780–4783| doi=10.1002/adma.200801471| issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organorhenium compounds====
{{main|Organorhenium chemistry}}
[[Dirhenium decacarbonyl]] is the most common entry to organorhenium chemistry.

[[Methylrhenium trioxide]] ("MTO"), CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a volatile, colourless solid has been used as a [[catalyst]] in some laboratory experiments. It can be prepared by many routes, a typical method is the reaction of Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and [[tetramethyltin]]:
:Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;  +  (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn  →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SnOReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
Analogous alkyl and aryl derivatives are known.  MTO catalyses for the oxidations with [[hydrogen peroxide]].  Terminal [[alkyne]]s yield the corresponding acid or ester, internal alkynes yield diketones, and [[alkene]]s give epoxides. MTO also catalyses the conversion of [[aldehyde]]s and [[diazoalkane]]s into an alkene.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, A. (2002) “Methyltrioxorhenium” in ''Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis''.

A distinctive derivative of rhenium is [[Potassium nonahydridorhenate|nonahydridorhenate]], originally thought to be the ''rhenide'' anion, Re&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, but actually containing the {{chem|ReH|9|2-}} anion in which the oxidation state of rhenium is +7.

For 2006, the consumption is given as 28% for [[General Electric]], 28% [[Rolls-Royce plc]] and 12% [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]], all for superalloys, whereas the use for catalysts only accounts for 14% and the remaining applications use 18%.&lt;ref name="Naumov"/&gt; In 2006, 77% of the rhenium consumption in the United States was in alloys.&lt;ref name="USGS_2009_yearbook"/&gt; The rising demand for military jet engines and the constant supply made it necessary to develop superalloys with a lower rhenium content. For example, the newer [[CFM International CFM56]]  high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades will use Rene N515 with a rhenium content of 1.5% instead of Rene N5 with 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = Paul J. | last2 = Miller | first2 = Joshua L. | last3 = Konitzer | first3 = Douglas G. | title = Rhenium reduction—alloy design using an economically strategic element | journal = JOM | volume = 62 | page = 55 | date = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s11837-010-0012-z|bibcode = 2010JOM....62a..55F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first =Douglas G. | last =Konitzer | url = http://memagazine.asme.org/Articles/2010/September/Design_Era_Constrained.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725021809/http://memagazine.asme.org/Articles/2010/September/Design_Era_Constrained.cfm | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | title = Design in an Era of Constrained Resources | accessdate = 2010-10-12| date = September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhenium improves the properties of [[tungsten]]. Tungsten-rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature, allowing them to be more easily machined.  The high-temperature stability is also improved. The effect increases with the rhenium concentration, and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to 27% of Re, which is the solubility limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tungsten: properties, chemistry, technology of the element, alloys, and chemical compounds|first=Erik|last=Lassner|author2=Schubert, Wolf-Dieter | publisher=Springer|date=1999|isbn=978-0-306-45053-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foLRISkt9gcC&amp;pg=PA256|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten-rhenium wire was originally created in efforts to develop a wire that was more ductile after recrystallization. This allows the wire to meet specific performance objectives, including superior vibration resistance, improved ductility, and higher resistivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ucfilament.com/materials/tungsten-rhenium/|title=Tungsten-Rhenium - Union City Filament|work=Union City Filament|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One application for the tungsten-rhenium alloys is [[X-ray]] sources. The high melting point of both elements, together with their high atomic mass, makes them stable against the prolonged electron impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Practical radiotherapy physics and equipment|first=Pam|last=Cherry|author2=Duxbury, Angela |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1998|isbn=978-1-900151-06-1|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=5WIBbmmDm-gC&amp;pg=PA55|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as [[thermocouple]]s to measure temperatures up to 2200 °[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tungsten-Rhenium Thermocouples for Use at High Temperatures|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=39|page=1233|date=1968|doi=10.1063/1.1683642|first= R.|last=Asamoto|author2=Novak, P. E. |issue=8|bibcode = 1968RScI...39.1233A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high temperature stability, low vapor pressure, good [[Wear|wear resistance]] and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning [[Switch#Contacts|electrical contacts]]. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; has poor stability (sublimes at ~360&amp;nbsp;°C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.&lt;ref name="Naumov"/&gt;

Rhenium has a high melting point and a low vapor pressure similar to [[tantalum]] and tungsten. Therefore, rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j100873a513|date=1966|last=Blackburn|first=Paul E.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=70|pages=311–312|title=The Vapor Pressure of Rhenium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those filaments are widely used in [[mass spectrometer]]s, in [[ion gauge]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tungsten-Rhenium Filament Lifetime Variability in Low Pressure Oxygen Environments|last= Earle|first=G.

===Catalysts===
Rhenium in the form of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as catalyst for [[catalytic reforming]], which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery [[Petroleum naphtha|naphthas]] with low [[octane rating]]s into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhenium-containing catalysts in reactions of organic compounds|date=1998|journal=Russian Chemical Reviews|volume=67|pages=157–177|doi=10.1070/RC1998v067n02ABEH000390|first=Margarita A.|last= Ryashentseva|issue=2|bibcode = 1998RuCRv..67..157R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[olefin metathesis]] is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; on [[alumina]] is used for this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Catalysis Today |volume=51| issue=2|date=1999|pages=289–299|title=Olefin metathesis over supported rhenium oxide catalysts|first=Johannes C.|last=Mol|doi=10.1016/S0920-5861(99)00051-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to [[catalyst poisoning|chemical poisoning]] from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ind.

===Other uses===
The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Re and &lt;sup&gt;186&lt;/sup&gt;Re are radioactive and are used for treatment of [[liver cancer]]. They both have similar penetration depth in tissue (5&amp;nbsp;mm for &lt;sup&gt;186&lt;/sup&gt;Re and 11&amp;nbsp;mm for &lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Re), but &lt;sup&gt;186&lt;/sup&gt;Re has advantage of longer lifetime (90 hours vs. 17 hours).&lt;ref name="Dilw"&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jonathan R.|last=Dilworth|author2=Parrott, Suzanne J. |title=The biomedical chemistry of technetium and rhenium| journal=Chemical Society Reviews|date= 1998|volume=27|pages=43–55|doi=10.1039/a827043z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]|title=The Tungsten-188 and Rhenium-188 Generator Information|date=2005|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nuclear_science_technology/nu_med/188info.htm|accessdate=2008-02-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109170105/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nuclear_science_technology/nu_med/188info.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Re is also being used experimentally in a novel treatment of pancreatic cancer where it is delivered by means of the bacterium ''Listeria monocytogenes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Monya|title=Radioactive bacteria attack cancer|url=http://www.nature.com/news/radioactive-bacteria-attack-cancer-1.12841|work=Nature|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related by [[periodic trends]], rhenium has a similar chemistry to that of [[technetium]]; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where it is difficult to work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.&lt;ref name="Dilw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/QR9621600299|title=An outline of technetium chemistry|date=1962|author=Colton, R.|author2=Peacock R. D. |journal=Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society|volume=16|pages=299–315|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Very little is known about the toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself.&lt;ref name="Emsley"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last=Emsley|first=J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|location=Oxford, England, UK|isbn=0-19-850340-7|chapter=Rhenium| pages=358–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an [[Median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] value of 2800&amp;nbsp;mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 280&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pharmacology and toxicology of potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride|pages=321–323|first =Thomas J.|last=Haley|author2=Cartwright, Frank D. |doi=10.1002/jps.2600570218|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=57|issue=2|date=1968|pmid=5641681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">A '''security assurance''', in the context of [[nuclear warfare]], is an expression of a political position by a [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear-armed nation]] intended to placate other non-nuclear-armed nations. There are two types of security assurance: positive and negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Negative Security Assurances (NSAs) and Positive Security Assurances (PSAs) |url=http://www.nti.org/db/china/npsaorg.htm |work=Nuclear Threat Initiative |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030902134638/http://www.nti.org/db/china/npsaorg.htm |archivedate=2003-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A positive assurance states that the nation giving it will aid any, or a particular, non-nuclear-armed nation in retaliation, should it be a victim of nuclear attack. A negative assurance is not the opposite of this, but instead means that a nuclear-armed nation has promised not to use nuclear weapons, except in retaliation for a nuclear attack against themselves. See also [[No first use]].

Security assurances are a key part of [[nuclear diplomacy]], and since they are statements of intent - not guarantees - they are based entirely on trust and the threat of retaliation should they be broken. Thus, Security Assurances have been issued and changed over time, and are vital tools in the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT). U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] modified the specific conditions of the US Negative Security Assurance on 6 April 2010 citing "the importance of nations meeting their NPT and nuclear non-proliferation obligations.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. "Negative Security Assurances" At a Glance|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/negsec|work=Arms Control Association|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[People's Republic of China|China]] is so far the only nation to issue a positive security assurance in April 1995, at the same time it issued a negative security assurance. China stated that despite its willingness to use nuclear weapons, it "[should] not in any way be construed as endorsing the use of nuclear weapons."&lt;ref name="S/1995/265"&gt;{{cite document |url=http://www.undemocracy.com/S-1995-265.pdf |title=Statement on security assurances issued on 5 April 1995 by the People’s Republic of China |publisher=United Nations |date=6 April 1995 |id=S/1995/265 |accessdate=20 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dichotomy]] of such a position has led for calls to make more use of [[protocol (treaty)|protocol]]s attached to [[NWFZ]] ([[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]) treaties, instead of generalized security assurances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spector and Ohlde|first=Leonard S. and Aubrie|title=Negative Security Assurances: Revisiting the Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Option|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2005_04/Spector_Ohlde|work=Arms Control Today|publisher=Arms Control Association|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheet moulding compound''' ('''SMC''') or '''sheet moulding composite''' is a ready to mould [[Fiberglass|glass-fibre reinforced polyester]] material primarily used in [[compression moulding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelan |first=A. |year=2012 |title=Polymer Technology Dictionary |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=391 |isbn=9789401112925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheet is provided in rolls weighing up to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg. Alternatively the resin and related materials may be mixed on site when a producer wants greater control over the chemistry and filler.

SMC is both a process and reinforced composite material.  This is manufactured by dispersing long strands (usually &gt;1”) of chopped fiber (commonly [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s on a bath of [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] resin (commonly [[polyester resin]], [[vinyl ester resin]] or [[epoxy resin]])). The longer fibers in SMC result in better strength properties than standard [[bulk moulding compound]] (BMC) products. Typical applications include demanding electrical applications, corrosion resistant needs, structural components at low cost, automotive, and transit. 

==Process==
Paste reservoir dispenses a measured amount of specified resin paste onto a plastic carrier film.  This carrier film passes underneath a chopper which cuts the fibers onto the surface. Once these have drifted through the depth of resin paste, another sheet is added on top which sandwiches the glass.  The sheets are compacted and then enter onto a take-up roll, which is used to store the product whilst it matures.  The carrier film is then later removed and the material is cut into charges.  Depending on what shape is required determines the shape of the charge and steel die which it is then added to.  Heat and pressure act on the charge and once fully cured, this is then removed from the mould as the finished product. Fillers both reduce weight and change the physical properties, typically adding strength. Production challenges include wetting the filler, which could consist of glass microspheres or aligned fibers rather than random chopped fibers; adjusting die temperature and pressure to provide the proper geometry; and adjusting chemistry to end use.

==Advantages==
Compared to similar methods, SMC benefits from a very high volume production ability, excellent part reproducibility, it is cost effective as low labor requirements per production level is very good and industry scrap is reduced substantially.  Weight reduction, due to lower dimensional requirements and because of the ability to consolidate many parts into one, is also advantageous.  The level of flexibility also exceeds many counterpart processes.

==Physical properties==
Properties vary depending upon fiber and resin types.

The '''sulfate''' or '''sulphate''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) ion is a [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic]] [[anion]] with the [[empirical formula]] {{chem|SO|4|2-}}. Sulfate is the spelling recommended by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], but sulphate is used in [[British English]]. Salts, acid derivatives, and peroxides of sulfate are widely used in industry. Sulfates occur widely in everyday life. Sulfates are [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[sulfuric acid]] and many are prepared from that acid.

==Structure==
The sulfate anion consists of a central [[sulfur]] [[atom]] surrounded by four equivalent [[oxygen]] atoms in a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] arrangement. The symmetry is the same as that of methane. The sulfur atom is in the +6 [[oxidation state]] while the four oxygen atoms are each in the −2 state. The sulfate ion carries an overall [[charge (physics)|charge]] of −2 and it is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of the '''bisulfate''' (or hydrogen sulfate) ion, {{chem|HSO|4|-}}, which is in turn the conjugate base of {{chem|H|2|SO|4}}, [[sulfuric acid]]. Organic [[sulfate ester]]s, such as [[dimethyl sulfate]], are covalent compounds and [[ester]]s of sulfuric acid. The [[tetrahedral molecular geometry]] of the sulfate ion is as predicted by [[VSEPR theory]].

==Bonding==

The first description of the bonding in modern terms was by [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Gilbert Lewis]] in his groundbreaking paper of 1916 where he described the bonding in terms of electron octets around each atom, that is no double bonds and a [[formal charge]] of +2 on the sulfur atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Atom and the Molecule|first=Gilbert N.|last=Lewis|authorlink=Gilbert N. Lewis|journal=[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]|volume=38|date=1916|pages=762–785|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr216.3-lewispub-19160400-18-large.html|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002}} (See page 778.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Lewis assigned to sulfur a negative charge of two, starting from six own valence electrons and ending up with eight electrons shared with the oxygen atoms. In fact, sulfur donates two electrons to the oxygen atoms.}}

Later, [[Linus Pauling]] used [[valence bond theory]] to propose that the most significant [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance canonicals]] had two [[pi bond]]s involving d orbitals. His reasoning was that the charge on sulfur was thus reduced, in accordance with his [[Pauling's principle of electroneutrality|principle of electroneutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The modern theory of valency|first=Linus|last=Pauling|authorlink=Linus Pauling|journal=[[J. Chem. Soc.]]|date=1948|page=1461–1467|doi=10.1039/JR9480001461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The S−O bond length of 149&amp;nbsp;pm is shorter than the bond lengths in [[sulfuric acid]] of 157&amp;nbsp;pm for S−OH. The double bonding was taken by Pauling to account for the shortness of the S−O bond. Pauling's use of d orbitals provoked a debate on the relative importance of π bonding and bond polarity (electrostatic attraction) in causing the shortening of the S−O bond. The outcome was a broad consensus that d orbitals play a role, but are not as significant as Pauling had believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=C.&amp;nbsp;A.|last=Coulson|title=d Electrons and Molecular Bonding|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=221|page=1106|date=1969|doi=10.1038/2211106a0|bibcode=1969Natur.221.1106C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=K.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;R.|last=Mitchell|title=Use of outer d orbitals in bonding|journal=[[Chem. Rev.]]|volume=69|page=157|date=1969|doi=10.1021/cr60258a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted description involving pπ&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;dπ bonding was initially proposed by D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;J. Cruickshank. In this model, fully occupied p orbitals on oxygen overlap with empty sulfur d orbitals (principally the d&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="cotton" /&gt; However, in this description, despite there being some π character to the S−O bonds, the bond has significant ionic character. For sulfuric acid, computational analysis (with [[natural bond orbital]]s) confirms a clear positive charge on sulfur (theoretically +2.45) and a low 3d occupancy. Therefore, the representation with four single bonds is the optimal Lewis structure rather than the one with two double bonds (thus the Lewis model, not the Pauling model).&lt;ref name=Stefan&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Thorsten|last1=Stefan|first2=Rudolf|last2=Janoschek|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/d21kpda6jgjd7vlr/|title=How relevant are S=O and P=O Double Bonds for the Description of the Acid Molecules H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively?|journal=J. Mol. Modeling|volume=6|issue=2|date=Feb 2000|page=282–288|DOI=10.1007/PL00010730}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the structure obeys the [[octet rule]] and the charge distribution is in agreement with the [[electronegativity]] of the atoms. The discrepancy between the S−O bond length in the sulfate ion and the S−OH bond length in sulfuric acid is explained by donation of p-orbital electrons from the terminal S=O bonds in sulfuric acid into the antibonding S−OH orbitals, weakening them resulting in the longer bond length of the latter.

However, the bonding representation of Pauling for sulfate and other main group compounds with oxygen is still a common way of representing the bonding in many textbooks.&lt;ref name=cotton&gt;{{cite book|author1-link=F. Albert Cotton|last=Cotton|first=F.

On the other hand, in the structure with an [[dipolar bond]], the charge is localized as a [[lone pair]] on the oxygen.&lt;ref name=Stefan/&gt;

==Preparation==
Methods of preparing metal sulfates include:&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*treating metal, metal hydroxide or metal oxide with [[sulfuric acid]]
: Zn + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: CdCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CdSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*oxidation of metal [[sulfide]]s or [[sulfite]]s

==Properties==
Many examples of ionic sulfates are known, and many of these are highly [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water]]. Exceptions include [[calcium sulfate]], [[strontium sulfate]], [[lead(II) sulfate]], and [[barium sulfate]], which are poorly soluble. [[Radium sulfate]] is the most insoluble sulfate known. The barium derivative is useful in the [[gravimetric analysis]] of sulfate: if one adds a solution of, perhaps, [[barium chloride]] to a solution containing sulfate ions, the appearance of a white precipitate, which is barium sulfate, indicates that sulfate anions are present.

The sulfate ion can act as a ligand attaching either by one oxygen (monodentate) or by two oxygens as either a [[chelate]] or a bridge.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; An example is the complex &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Cobalt|Co]]([[Ethylenediamine|en]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; or the neutral metal complex [[Platinum|Pt]]SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;([[Triphenylphosphine|P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the sulfate ion is acting as a [[denticity|bidentate]] ligand. The metal–oxygen bonds in sulfate complexes can have significant covalent character.

==Uses and occurrence==

===Commercial applications===
[[File:Objectes de la Sala Horta i Marjal (27190138015).jpg|thumb|Knapsack sprayer used to apply sulfate to vegetables. [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]].]]
Sulfates are widely used industrially. Major compounds include:

* [[Gypsum]], the natural mineral form of hydrated [[calcium sulfate]], is used to produce [[plaster]]. About 100 million tonnes per year are used by the construction industry.
* [[Copper sulfate]], a common [[algaecide]], the more stable form ([[Copper(II) sulfate|CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is used for galvanic cells as electrolyte
* [[Iron(II) sulfate]], a common form of iron in mineral supplements for humans, animals, and soil for plants
* [[Magnesium sulfate]] (commonly known as [[Epsom salts]]), used in therapeutic baths
* [[Lead(II) sulfate]], produced on both plates during the discharge of a [[lead–acid battery]]
*[[Sodium laureth sulfate|Sodium Laureth Sulfate]], or SLES, a common [[detergent]] in shampoo formulations 

===Occurrence in nature===
[[Sulfate-reducing bacteria]], some anaerobic microorganisms, such as those living in sediment or near deep sea thermal vents, use the reduction of sulfates coupled with the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen as an energy source for chemosynthesis.

==History==
Some sulfates were known to alchemists. The vitriol salts, from the Latin ''vitreolum'', glassy, were so-called because they were some of the first transparent crystals known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry|first=F. Sherwood|last=Taylor|edition=6th|date=1942|publisher=William Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green vitriol]] is [[iron]](II) sulfate heptahydrate, FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; [[blue vitriol]] is [[copper]](II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[white vitriol]] is zinc sulfate heptahydrate, ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. [[Alum]], a double sulfate of [[potassium]] and [[aluminium]] with the formula K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·24H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, figured in the development of the chemical industry.

==Environmental effects==
Sulfates occur as microscopic particles ([[Particulate|aerosols]]) resulting from [[fossil fuel]] and [[biomass]] combustion. They increase the acidity of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and form [[acid rain]]. &lt;!-- do sulfate aerosols per se comprise "acid rain" vs. aerobic oxidation of SO2 and SO3 to give H2SO4--&gt; The [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] ''[[Desulfovibrio]] desulfuricans'' and ''[[Desulfovibrio vulgaris|D. vulgaris]]'' can remove the black [[sulfate crust]] that often tarnishes buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date= Nov 2006| pages=1075–1079| title=Saving a fragile legacy.

===Main effects on climate===
[[Image:Gocart sulfate optical thickness.png|thumb|alt=An oval map of earth which uses colors to indicate different quantities|Sulfate aerosol [[optical thickness]] 2005 to 2007 average]]
The main direct effect of sulfates on the climate involves the scattering of light, effectively increasing the Earth's [[albedo]]. This effect is moderately well understood and leads to a cooling from the negative [[radiative forcing]] of about 0.4&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; relative to pre-industrial values,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html|title=Chapter 2: Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and Radiative Forcing|date=2007|work=Working Group I: The Scientific Basis}}&lt;/ref&gt; partially offsetting the larger (about 2.4&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) warming effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es. The effect is strongly spatially non-uniform, being largest downstream of large industrial areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map

The first indirect effect is also known as the [[Twomey effect]]. Sulfate aerosols can act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and this leads to greater numbers of smaller droplets of water. Lots of smaller droplets can diffuse light more efficiently than just a few larger droplets.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SulfateMap2017.png|thumb|Sulfate aerosol [[optical thickness]] 2017]] --&gt;
The second indirect effect is the further knock-on effects of having more cloud condensation nuclei. It is proposed that these include the suppression of drizzle, increased cloud height,&lt;ref&gt;Pincus &amp; Baker 1994&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} to facilitate [[cloud]] formation at low [[humidity|humidities]] and longer cloud lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} Sulfate may also result in changes in the particle size distribution, which can affect the clouds radiative properties in ways that are not fully understood. Chemical effects such as the dissolution of soluble gases and slightly soluble substances, surface tension depression by organic substances and accommodation coefficient changes are also included in the second indirect effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/Preprints/Sensitivity_JASPP.pdf|title=Chemical Amplification (or dampening) of the Twomey Effect: Conditions derived from droplet activation theory|first1=T. A.|last1=Rissman|first2=A.|last2=Nenes|first3=J.&amp;nbsp;H.|last3=Seinfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indirect effects probably have a cooling effect, perhaps up to 2&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the uncertainty is very large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Archer|title=Understanding the Forecast|page=77}} Figure 10.2&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} Sulfates are therefore implicated in [[global dimming]]. Sulfate is also the major contributor to stratospheric aerosol formed by oxidation of sulfur dioxide injected into the stratosphere by impulsive volcanoes such as the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]]. This aerosol exerts a cooling effect on climate during its 1-2 year lifetime in the stratosphere.

Biomaterials are materials that are used in contact with biological systems. Biocompatibility and applicability of surface modification with current uses of metallic, polymeric and ceramic biomaterials allow alteration of properties to enhance performance in a biological environment while retaining bulk properties of the desired device.

Surface modification involves the fundamentals of physicochemical interactions between the biomaterial and the physiological environment at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels (reduce bacterial adhesion, promote cell adhesion). Currently, there are various methods of characterization and surface modification of biomaterials and useful applications of fundamental concepts in a several biomedical solutions.

==Function==

The function of surface modification is to change the physical and chemical properties of surfaces to improve the functionality of the original material. Protein surface modification of various types [[biomaterial]]s (ceramics, polymers, metals, composites) is performed to ultimately increase biocompatibility of the material and interact as a [[Biological activity|bioactive]] material for specific applications. In various biomedical applications of developing implantable medical devices (such as [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[stent]]s), surface properties/interactions of proteins with a specific material must be evaluated with regards to biocompatibility as it plays a major role in determining a biological response. For instance, surface hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a material can be altered. Engineering biocompatibility between the physiological environment and the surface material allows new medical products, materials and surgical procedures with additional biofunctionality.

Surface modification can be done through various methods, which can be classified through three main groups: physical (physical adsorption, [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir blodgett film]]), chemical (oxidation by strong acids, ozone treatment, [[chemisorption]], and [[flame treatment]]) and radiation ([[Electric glow discharge|glow discharge]], [[corona discharge]], photo activation (UV), laser, ion beam, [[Ion implantation|plasma immersion ion implantation]], [[electron beam lithography]], and [[Gamma ray|γ-irradiation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Q. F. Wei |author2=W. D. Gao |author3=D. Y. Hou |author4=X. Q. Wang |title=Surface modification of polymer nanofibers by plasma treatment|journal= Appl. Surf. Sci.|volume=245 |issue=1–4 |year=2005|pages=16–20|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2004.10.013|bibcode = 2005ApSS..245...16W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biocompatibility===

In a biomedical perspective, biocompatibility is the ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application. It is described to be non-toxic, no induced adverse reactions such as chronic inflammatory response with unusual tissue formation, and designed to function properly for a reasonable lifetime.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. K. Chu, J. Y. Chen, L. P. Wang and N. Huang|title= Plasma-surface modification of biomaterials|journal= Materials Science and Engineering R |volume=36 |year=2002|pages=143–206|doi=10.1016/S0927-796X(02)00004-9|issue=5–6|citeseerx= 10.1.1.452.780}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a requirement of biomaterials in which the surface modified material will cause no harm to the host, and the material itself will not harmed by the host. Although most synthetic biomaterials have the physical properties that meet or even exceed those of natural tissue, they often result in an unfavorable physiological reaction such as [[Thrombosis|thrombosis formation]], inflammation and infection.

Biointegration is the ultimate goal in for example orthopedic implants that bones establish a mechanically solid interface with complete fusion between the artificial implanted material and bone tissues under good biocompatibility conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Hao  |author2=J. Lawrence |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Laser Surface Treatment of Bio-implant Materials|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modifying the surface of a material can improve its biocompatibility, and can be done without changing its bulk properties. The properties of the uppermost molecular layers are critical in biomaterials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Hao  |author2=J. Lawrence |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Laser Surface Treatment of Bio-implant Materials|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the surface layers are in physicochemical contact with the biological environment.

Furthermore, although some of the biomaterials have good biocompatibility, it may possess poor mechanical or physical properties such as wear resistance, anti-corrosion, or wettability or lubricity. In these cases, surface modification is utilized to deposit a layer of coating or mixing with substrate to form a composite layer.

===Cell adhesion===

As proteins are made up of different sequences of amino acids, proteins can have various functions as its structural shape driven by a number of molecular bonds can change. Amino acids exhibit different characteristics such as being polar, non-polar, positively or negatively charged which is determined by having different side chains. Thus, attachment of molecules with different protein for example, those containing Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) sequences are expected to modify the surface of tissue scaffolds and result in improvement of cell adhesion when placed into its physiological environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Y.

Some of the surface modification techniques listed above are particularly used for certain functions or kinds of materials. One of the advantages of plasma immersion ion implantation is its ability to treat most materials. Ion implantation is an effective surface treatment technique that be used to enhance the surface properties of biomaterials.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.

Overall, it is an effective method to modify medical implants with complex shape. By altering the surface functionalities using plasma modification, the optimal surface, chemical and physical properties can be obtained.

Plasma immersion implantation is a technique suitable for low melting point materials such as polymers, and widely accepted to improve adhesion between pinhole free layers and substrates. The ultimate goal is to enhance the properties of biomaterials such as biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and functionality with the fabrication of different types of biomedical [[thin film]]s with various biologically important elements such as nitrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=I.

In order to evaluate the biocompatibility of the fabricated thin films, various in vitro biological environment need to be conducted.

==Biological response==

The immune system will react differently if an implant is coated in extra-cellular matrix proteins. The proteins surrounding the implant serve to "hide" the implant from the innate immune system. However, if the implant is coated in allergenic proteins, the patient's [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]] may be initiated. To prevent such a negative immune reaction, [[immunosuppressive drug]]s may be prescribed, or [[autotransplantation|autologous]] tissue may produce the protein coating.

===Acute response===
Immediately following insertion, an implant (and the tissue damage from surgery) will result in acute [[inflammation]]. The classic signs of acute inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function. Hemorrhaging from tissue damage results in clotting which stimulates latent [[mast cells]]. The mast cells release chemokines which activate blood vessel endothelium. The blood vessels dilate and become leaky, producing the redness and swelling associated with acute inflammation. The activated endothelium allows extravasation of blood plasma and white blood cells including macrophages which transmigrate to the implant and recognize it as non-biologic. Macrophages release [[oxidizing agent|oxidants]] to combat the foreign body. If antioxidants fail to destroy the foreign body, chronic inflammation begins.

===Chronic response===
Implantation of non-degradable materials will eventually result in chronic inflammation and fibrous capsule formation. Macrophages that fail to destroy pathogens will merge to form a [[foreign-body giant cell]] which quarantines the implant. High levels of oxidants cause fibroblasts to secrete collagen, forming a layer of fibrous tissue around the implant.

By coating an implant with extracellular matrix proteins, macrophages will be unable to recognize the implant as non-biologic. The implant is then capable of continued interaction with the host, influencing the surrounding tissue toward various outcomes. For instance, the implant may improve healing by secreting angiogenic drugs.

==Fabrication techniques==

===Physical modification===
Physical immobilization is simply coating a material with a [[biomimetic]] material without changing the structure of either. Various biomimetic materials with cell adhesive proteins (such as collagen or laminin) have been used in vitro to direct new tissue formation and cell growth. Cell adhesion and proliferation occurs much better on protein-coated surfaces. However, since the proteins are generally isolated, it is more likely to elicit an immune response. Generally, chemistry qualities should be taken into consideration.

===Chemical modification===
[[File:Covalent binding for Wiki project.jpg|thumb|Covalent binding of protein with polymer graft]]

Alkali hydrolysis, covalent immobilization, and the wet chemical method are only three of the many ways to chemically modify a surface. The surface is prepped with surface activation, where several functionalities are placed on the polymer to react better with the proteins. In alkali hydrolysis, small protons diffuse between polymer chains and cause surface hydrolysis which cleaves ester bonds. This results in the formation of carboxyl and hydroxyl functionalities which can attach to proteins. In covalent immobilization, small fragments of proteins or short peptides are bonded to the surface. The peptides are highly stable and studies have shown that this method improves biocompatibility. The wet chemical method is one of the preferred methods of protein immobilization. Chemical species are dissolved in an organic solution where reactions take place to reduce the hydrophobic nature of the polymer. Surface stability is higher in chemical modification than in physical adsorption. It also offers higher biocompatibility towards cell growth and bodily fluid flow.

===Photochemical modification===

[[File:Improved Cell adhesion.png|thumb|Cell adhesion for various functional groups. OH and CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; improve surface wetting compared with COOH]]

Successful attempts at grafting biomolecules onto polymers have been made using photochemical modification of biomaterials. These techniques employ high energy photons (typically UV) to break chemical bonds and release free radicals. Protein adhesion can be encouraged by favorably altering the surface charge of a biomaterial. Improved protein adhesion leads to better integration between the host and the implant. Ma et al. compared cell adhesion for various surface groups and found that OH and CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; improved PLLA [[wetting|wettability]] more than COOH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Ma |author2=C. Gao |author3=Y. Gong |author4=J. Shen |title=Chondrocyte behaviors on poly(lactic acid)(PLLA) membranes containing hydroxyl, amide or carboxyl groups|pmid=12818544|url=http://144.206.159.178/FT/114/92496/1608293.pdf|journal=Biomaterials|year=2003|volume=24|issue=21|pages=3725–30|doi=10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00247-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying a mask to the surface of the biomaterial allows selective surface modification. Areas that UV light penetrate will be modified such that cells will adhere to the region more favorably.

The minimum feature size attainable is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = k_1 \cdot\frac{\lambda}{NA}&lt;/math&gt;
where

&lt;math&gt;\,CD&lt;/math&gt; is the '''minimum feature size'''

&lt;math&gt;\,k_1&lt;/math&gt; (commonly called ''k1 factor'') is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors, and typically equals 0.4 for production.

&lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of light used

&lt;math&gt;\,NA&lt;/math&gt; is the [[numerical aperture]] of the lens as seen from the wafer

According to this equation, greater resolution can be obtained by decreasing the wavelength, and increasing the numerical aperture.

===Composites and graft formation===
Graft formation improves the overall hydrophilicity of the material through a ratio of how much glycolic acid and lactic acid is added. Block polymer, or PLGA, decreases hydrophobicity of the surface by controlling the amount of glycolic acid. However, this doesn't increase the hydrophilic tendency of the material.In brush grafting, hydrophilic polymers containing alcohol or hydroxyl groups are placed onto surfaces through photopolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasita|first=Rajesh|title=Improved biomaterials for tissue engineering applications: surface modification of polymers|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=341–353|doi=10.2174/156802608783790893|pmid=18393896|last2=Shanmugam i|first2=K|last3=Katt|first3=DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plasma treatment===
Plasma techniques are especially useful because they can deposit ultra thin (a few nm), adherent, conformal coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morra|first=M.|author2=Cassinelli, C. |title=Biomaterials surface characterization and modification|journal=The International Journal of Artificial Organs|year=2006|volume=29|issue=9|pages=824–833|pmid=17033989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glow discharge plasma is created by filling a vacuum with a low-pressure gas (ex. argon, ammonia, or oxygen). The gas is then excited using microwaves or current which ionizes it. The ionized gas is then thrown onto a surface at a high velocity where the energy produced physically and chemically changes the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.E. Baier|chapter=Surface properties influencing biological adhesion|title= Adhesion in Biological Systems|publisher= Academic Press|place= New York|pages=15–48|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the changes occur, the ionized plasma gas is able to react with the surface to make it ready for protein adhesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=H. Kawahara|title=Cellular responses to implant materials: biological, physical and chemical factors|journal=Int. Dent. J.|volume=33|pages= 350–375 |year=1983|pmid=6581129|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the surfaces may lose mechanical strength or other inherent properties because of the high amounts of energy.

Several plasma-based technologies have been developed to contently immobilize proteins depending on the final application of the resulting biomaterial.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cifuentes and S. Borros (2013). "Comparison of Two Different Plasma Surface-Modification Techniques for the Covalent Immobilization of Protein Monolayers". ''Langmuir'' '''29''' (22), 6645–6651 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la400597e&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is a relatively fast approach to produce smart bioactive surfaces.

==Applications==

===Bone tissue===
Extra-cellular matrix (ECM) proteins greatly dictate the process of bone formation—the attachment and proliferation of osteogenitor cells, differentiation to osteoblasts, matrix formation, and mineralization. It is beneficial to design biomaterials for bone-contacting devices with bone matrix proteins to promote bone growth.It is also possible to covalently and directionally immobilize osteoinductive peptides in the surface of the ceramic materials such as hydroxyapatite/β-tricalcium phosphate to stimulate osteoblast differentiation and better bone regeneration &lt;ref name=r17&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acharya |first1=B |last2=Chun |first2=SY |last3=Kim |first3=SY |last4=Moon |first4=C |last5=Shin |first5=HI |last6=Park |first6=EK  |date= 2012 |title=Surface immobilization of MEPE peptide onto HA/β-TCP ceramic particles enhances bone regeneration and remodeling |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research. Part B, Applied Biomaterials |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=841–9 |doi=10.1002/jbm.b.32648 |pmid=22278974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
RGD peptides have been shown to increase the attachment and migration of osteoblasts on titanium implants, polymeric materials, and glass. Other adhesive peptides that can be recognized by molecules in the cell membrane can also affect binding of bone-derived cells. Particularly, the heparin binding domain in fibronectin is actively involved in specific interaction with osteogenic cells. Modification with heparin binding domains have the potential to enhance the binding of osteoblasts without affecting the attachment of endothelial cells and fibroblasts.Additionally, growth factors such as those in the bone morphogenic protein family are important polypeptides to induce bone formation. These growth factors can be covalently bound to materials to enhance the osteointegration of implants.

===Neural tissue===
Peripheral nervous system damage is typically treated by an autograft of nerve tissue to bridge a severed gap. This treatment requires successful regeneration of neural tissue; axons must grow from the proximal stump without interference in order to make a connection with the distal stump. Neural guidance channels (NGC), have been designed as a conduit for growth of new axons and the differentiation and morphogenesis of these tissues is affect by interaction between neural cells and the surrounding ECM. Studies of laminin have shown the protein to be an important ECM protein in the attachment of neural cells. The penta-peptide YIGSR and IKVAV, which are important sequences in laminin, have been shown to increase attachment of neural cells with the ability to control the spatial organization of the cells.

===Cardiovascular tissue===
It is important that cardiovascular devices such as stents or artificial vascular grafts be designed to mimic properties of the specific tissue region the device is serving to replace. In order to reduce thrombogenicity, surfaces can be coated with fibronectin and RGD containing peptides, which encourages attachment of endothelial cells. The peptides YIGSR and REDV have also been shown to enhance attachment and spreading of endothelial cells and ultimately reduce the thrombogenicity of the implant.&lt;ref name="Shin2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H.

The '''Titiokura/Te Waka Wind Farm''' was a [[wind farm]] project abandoned by [[Unison Networks]] and Roaring 40s.

Early stages of the consent process were administered by the [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] District Council and the [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] Regional Council.  Both stages of the wind farm are opposed by local [[iwi]], Ngati Hineuru and Maungaharuru-Tangitu Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4787696a6045.html?source=RSShawkesbay/headlines_20081210 |title=Iwi felt harassed on wind farm plan|publisher=Dominion Post|date=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page documents the '''[[tornado]]es and [[tornado outbreak]]s of 1968''', primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. 2 F5 tornadoes struck Iowa in the Charles City and Maynard areas, combined they claimed 18 lives and this was one of very few cases in history where two F5s or EF5 tornadoes hit the same state, on the same day.

[[File:Musée de la viscose (Échirolles) abc29.JPG|thumb|Cellulose xanthate (orange).]]
'''Xanthate''' usually refers to a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] with the formula {{chem|ROCS|2|−|M|+}} (R = [[alkyl]]; M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC]] does not recommend the use of the term xanthate, although it is in current use in the scientific literature: {{GoldBookRef|file=X06696 |title=Xanthate}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus O-esters of [[dithiocarbonate]].  The name ''xanthates'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ξανθός}} ''xanthos'', meaning “yellowish, golden”, and indeed most xanthate salts are yellow. They were discovered and named in 1823 by Danish chemist [[William Christopher Zeise]]. These [[organosulfur compound]]s are important in two areas: the production of [[cellophane]] and related polymers from [[cellulose]] and (in mining) for extraction of certain ores.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|first=Kathrin-Maria|last=Roy|title=Xanthates|doi=10.1002/14356007.a28_423}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also versatile intermediates in [[organic synthesis]]. Xanthates also refer to [[ester]]s of xanthic acid.  These esters have the structure ROC(=S)SR′.

==Formation and structure==
Xanthate salts are produced by the reaction of an [[alkoxide]] salt with [[carbon disulfide]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This report gives a detailed procedure for the [[potassium ethyl xanthate]]: {{OrgSynth|first1=Charles C.|last1=Price|first2=Gardner W.|last2=Stacy|year=1948|title=''p''-Nitrophenyl sulfide|volume=28|pages=82|collvol=3|collvolpages=667|prep=CV3P0667}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The reaction involves the attack of the alkoxide nucleophile on the electrophile CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Often the alkoxide is generated in situ by treating the alcohol with sodium or [[potassium hydroxide]]:
:ROH + CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + KOH → ROCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
For example, [[sodium ethoxide]] gives [[sodium ethyl xanthate]].  Many alcohols can be used in this reaction. Technical grade xanthate salts are usually of 90–95% purity.  Impurities include alkali-metal sulfides, sulfates, trithiocarbonates, [[thiosulfate]]s, sulfites, or carbonates as well as residual raw material such as alcohol and [[alkali hydroxide]]. These salts are available commercially as powder, granules, flakes, sticks, and solutions are available. 

Some commercially important xanthate salts include:
* [[sodium ethyl xanthate]]  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na
* [[potassium ethyl xanthate]], CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K
* sodium isopropyl xanthate, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHOCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na
* sodium isobutyl xanthate, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na
* [[potassium amyl xanthate]], CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K

The OCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core of xanthate salts, like that of the all-oxygen [[carbonate]]s and other simple [[ester]]s is characteristically planar.  The central carbon is sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized.

==Reactions==
[[File:Xanthate-ester-2D-general.png|thumb|160px|Structure of a xanthate ester]]
Xanthate salts characteristically decompose in acid:
:ROCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K + HCl → ROH  +  CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  KCl
This reaction is the reverse of the method for the preparation of the xanthate salts.  The intermediate in the decomposition is the xanthic acid, ROC(S)SH, which can be isolated in certain cases.

Xanthate anions also undergo [[alkylation]] to give xanthate esters, which are generally stable:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|first1=Fabien|last1=Gagosz|first2=Samir Z.|last2=Zard|year=1948|title=A Xanthate-Transfer Approach to α-Trifluoromethylamines |volume=84|pages=32|collvol=11|collvolpages=212|prep=V84P0032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:ROCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K  +  R′X   →   ROC(S)SR′  +  KX
The C-O bond in these compounds are susceptible to cleavage by the [[Barton–McCombie deoxygenation]], which provides a means for deoxygenation of alcohols.

They can be oxidized to the so-called dixanthogens:
:2 ROCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  ROC(S)S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(S)OR  +  2 NaCl

Xanthates bind to transition metal cations as bidentate [[ligand]]s.  The charge-neutral complexes are soluble in organic solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Haiduc|first=I. |title=1,1-Dithiolato ligands |encyclopedia=Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II |editor1-last=McClevert|editor1-first=J. A.|editor2-last= Meyer|editor2-first= T. J.|date= 2004 |volume=1 |page=349–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M(S2COEt)3.png|thumb|Structure of typical metal tris(ethylxanthate) complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/9780470132418.ch6| title = Tris (O-Ethyl Dithiocarbonato) Complexes of Tripositive Chromium, Indium, and Cobalt| volume = 10| pages = 42| journal = [[Inorganic Syntheses|Inorg.

==Industrial applications==
[[File:Xanthogenate_Cellulose_Structural_Formula_V1.svg|300px|thumb|Formation of sodium cellulose xanthate starting from cellulose (top)]]
Cellulose reacts with [[carbon disulfide]] (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in presence of [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) to produces sodium cellulose xanthate, which upon neutralization with sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gives [[viscose]] rayon or [[cellophane]] paper ([[Sellotape]] or [[Scotch Tape]]).

Certain xanthate salts and bisxanthates (e.g. [[Dixanthogen]]) are used as [[flotation process|flotation]] agents in mineral processing. They are intermediates in the [[Chugaev elimination]] process and are used to control [[Living polymerization|radical polymerisation]] under the [[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]] process, also termed MADIX (macromolecular design via interchange of xanthates).

==Related compounds==
Rarely encountered, [[thioxanthate]]s arise by the reaction of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with thiolate salts.  For example, sodium ethylthioxanthate has the formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;SCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na.  [[Dithiocarbamate]]s are also related compounds. They arise from the reaction of a secondary amine with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, [[sodium diethyldithiocarbamate]] has the formula (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na.

==Environmental impacts==
Xanthates may be toxic to aquatic life at concentrations of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.05.013| pmid = 18603298| year = 2009| last1 = Besser | first1 = J.| last2 = Brumbaugh | first2 = W.| last3 = Allert | first3 = A.| last4 = Poulton | first4 = B.| last5 = Schmitt | first5 = C.| last6 = Ingersoll | first6 = C.| title = Ecological impacts of lead mining on Ozark streams: toxicity of sediment and pore water| volume = 72| issue = 2| pages = 516–526| journal = Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water downstream of mining operations is often contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF02021019| title = Fate and effects of xanthates in laboratory freshwater systems| year = 1988| last1 = Xu | first1 = Y.| last2 = Lay | first2 = J.

Xylomannan is also found in the [[red alga|red seaweed]] ''[[Nothogenia fastigiata]]''.
